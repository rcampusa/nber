        "Our death data comes from Johns Hopkins University CSSE (2020). We must remember, nevertheless, that data about deaths are subject to undercount and interpretation.",
        "Conversely, low deaths in previous years (such as mild flu season in 2019) might have implied a high mortality in 2020 even in the absence of the epidemic. Second, the lockdowns also affected other death causes, both lowering them (fewer traffic and work accidents) and increasing them (fewer medical procedures undertaken, worsening physical and mental health triggered by the lockdowns and the economic crisis). While we do not believe that Figure 5 would dramatically change once researchers have more accurate counts of COVID-19 deaths, this is an additional aspect where caution is necessary."
