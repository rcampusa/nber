        "A Appendix: Data procedures As noted in Subsection 2.1, this paper uses data from the Social Security Administration \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s Master Earnings File. We begin with an extract from this file that includes one observation for each year, for each individual, for each firm that this individual worked for. (For self-employed individuals, the data set also contains these earnings from the IRS as reported in Schedule-SE tax form by the individuals. Because our focus is on firms with employees, we exclude these earnings from our analysis.) For example, if Alice worked at Alpha, Inc. in 2001, 2002, and 2003, and Beta, Inc. in 2002, our file would include four observations with her information\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dthree based on her job at Alpha, and one based on her job at Beta. For each observation, this file includes the year; a transformation of that individual\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s Social Security Number, along with the associated sex and date of birth; and the EIN, along with the associated 4-digit SIC code and state.",
        "The first step we take with this data is to exclude individuals who did not have a reasonably strong labor market attachment in a given year from the analysis for that year. More concretely, we consider an individual to be \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093employed\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d in a given year and include in the analysis if, summing across all jobs, he/she earns at least the equivalent of 40 hours per week for 13 weeks at that year\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s minimum wage; in 2012, that wage would have amounted to $3,770. (We also conducted robustness checks with other threshold levels, which show similar results.) This condition ensures that we are focusing on data about individuals with a reasonably strong labor market attachment, and that our results are comparable to other results in the wage inequality literature, such as Juhn et al. (1993b) and Autor et al. (2008). The data from any individual earning below this threshold in a given year is excluded from all results for both firms and individuals in that year.",
        "We then calculate statistics for each firm. To do this, we calculate the fraction of each individual\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s earnings that come from each employer in a given year; this fraction at a given firm represents the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees that work at that firm. For example, suppose that, in 2002, Alice earned $15,000 at Alpha and $5,000 in Beta. She would then count as 0.75 of an FTE in Alpha and 0.25 of an FTE in Beta. Using this, we calculate the total wage and total employment at each firm. Suppose that, in 2002, Bob earned $20,000 from Alpha (and no money from any other firm), Carol earned $100 from Alpha (and no money from any other firm), and no one other than Alice, Bob, or Carol earned income from Alpha. We would exclude Carol\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s earnings because she did not have a strong labor market attachment.",
        "The total wage bill at Alpha would be $35,000 ($15,000 from Alice and $20,000 from Bob), while total employment at Alpha would be 1.75 FTE (0.75 FTE from Alice and 1.0 FTE from Bob). Average wage at Alpha would then be calculated as $20,000 ( = $35,000/1.75 ). Next, we assign firm statistics to individuals based on the firm at which that individual had the largest earnings. In our running example, Alice would be assigned firm-wide statistics based on Alpha rather than Beta in 2002, because she had more earnings at Alpha than at any other firm. Thus she would be noted as being in a firm with total wage bill $35,000, employment of 1.75 FTE, average wage of $20,000, and the location and industry of Alpha.",
        "Finally, we adjust all dollar values in the data set to be equivalent to 2012 dollars with the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) price index12 . http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/PCEPI/downloaddata?cid=21"
