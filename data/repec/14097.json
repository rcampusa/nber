        "Number of signals J is calibrated to get the aggregate labor force participation to rise from 6% in 1940 to 10% in 1950.",
        "Endowment distribution Data come from the census. We use husbands wages in 1940 (first available year). From this, we construct two pools of matched data: One is only married women; the other is their husbands. The log endowment is normal. For these two sets of wage data, we take the log of wages over previous year. For husbands, mean(logincwagejrnsb ) = 7.04 and std(logincwagejrnsb) = 0.73. Therefore, we set a~ = 0.73. We choose the mean log endowment Itw = -(a~)/2 such that mean endowment is normalized to 1.",
        "August 1936 The Gallup Poll asked: Should a married woman earn money if she has a husband capable of supporting her? 18% said yes, 82% no. No uncertain or no response entries were allowed.",
        "October 1938 The Gallup Poll asked: Do you approve of a married woman earning money in business or industry if she has a husband capable of supporting her? 22% approve, 78% disapprove.",
        "November 1945 The Gallup Poll (AIPO) asked: Do you approve or disapprove of a married woman holding a job in business and industry if her husband is able to support her? 62% disapprove, 18% approve. The rest of the replies are miscellaneous open answers (e.g., if she has a good job, if she has no children, etc.).",
        "June 1970 The Gallup Poll asked: Do you approve of a married woman earning money in business or industry if she has a husband capable of supporting her? 60% approve, 36% disapprove, 4% do not know.",
        "From 1977 on, data come from http://webapp.icpsr.umich.edu/GSS/. The question is: Do you agree with the following statement: A preschool child is likely to suffer if his or her mother works. (Strongly agree=1, agree=2, diagree=3, strongly disagree=4, dont know=8, no answer=9, na=0). The only modification we make is to treat dont know and na replies as missing observations. There are 14 observations, one in 1977, and then at least every two years from 1995-2004. There are between 890 and 2,344 responses per year, totalling 19,005 observations. The average reply ranges from 2.2 in 1977 to 2.6 in 2004.",
        "B.2 Survey data The survey data from GSS begin only in 1972. However, the increasing speed of female entry in the labor force (start of the 5) precedes that date. To establish the contemporaneous S-shaped evolution of beliefs, it is vital to have more historical data. We have one measure of beliefs that is collected infrequently, since the 1930s. This data are from IPOLL databank, maintained by the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research. Unfortunately, the phrasing of the questions differs slightly over time. We describe below the questions and the replies.",
