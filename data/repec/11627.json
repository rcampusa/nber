        "30 Acemoglu (1999) offers an alternative theory ofjob polarization based on endogenous changes in production techniques as a response to a rise in the availability of skilled labor.",
        "28 See Levy and Murnane (2004) for numerous paradigmatic examples. The fact that computerization causes manual tasks to grow as a share of labor input may be understood as a form of Baumols disease.",
        "24 In Autor, Katz and Kearney (2005), we provide a more complete reanalysis of the Lemieux (2006b) using a quantile decomposition approach proposed by Machado and Mata (2005) and comparing the findings for the CPS March and May/ORG samples. Here we adopt the kernel reweighting approach of Lemieux to facilitate a direct comparison.",
        "22 Lee (1999) also noted a puzzling relationship between the `effective state minimum wage (the log difference between the state median and the state minimum) and upper-tail inequality. Opposite to the simple time-series regressions above, Lee finds in a cross-state analysis that increases in the effective state minimum wage appear to reduce upper-tail inequality, both for males and for the pooled-gender distribution, leading him to advise caution in causally attributing trends in male and pooled-gender earnings inequality to the minimum wage.",
        "21 Lemieux (2006b) focuses on the tight fit between the real minimum wage and residual wage variance for men and women from 1973 to 2003. We find greater time series explanatory power of the real minimum wage for residual wage inequality measures than for actual wage inequality measures. This is puzzling for minimum wage hypothesis since the minimum wage should bite more for actual low wage workers than for residual low wage workers.",
        "20 Foreign outsourcing of less-skilled jobs is another possible explanation for this pattern (Feenstra and Hanson 1999). But large within-industry shifts towards more skilled workers are pervasive even in sectors with little or no observed foreign outsourcing activity. Foreign outsourcing appears likely to become increasingly important, however.",
        "17 For females, earnings growth between 1988 and 2005 among post-college educated workers was substantially greater than for college-only workers but the pattern was reversed for 1979 to 1988. 18 However, the divergence of post-college and college-only wages is inconsistent with this simple two skill group CES framework and demands its own explanation, to which we return below. 19 Skill-biased technological change refers to any introduction of a new technology, change in production methods, or change in the organization of work that increases the demand for more-skilled labor relative to less-skilled labor at fixed relative wages.",
        "16 Similar conclusions of a significant slowdown in trend relative demand growth for college workers arise in models allowing trends breaks in any year from 1989 to 1994.",
        "~ In fact, Goldin and Katz (2007) find that rather steady relative demand growth for college workers combined with relative supply growth fluctuations does a nice job of explaining the longer-run evolution of the U.S. college wage premium from 1915 to 2005. Their analysis implies a modest acceleration in demand growth after 1950 as well as a slowdown in the trend demand after 1990. The slowing of relative demand growth for college workers after 1990 also has been noted by Autor, Katz and Krueger (1998), Katz and Autor (1999) and Card and DiNardo (2002).",
        "13 The present analysis of the college wage premium extends earlier work in Katz and Murphy (1992) and Katz and Autor (1999), drawing on additional years of data. 14 We use a standard measure of college/non-college relative supply calculated in efficiency units to adjust for changes in labor force composition by gender and experience groups. Full details are provided in the Data Appendix.",
        "12 The March and May/ORG samples appear equally valid for measuring between-group wage trends and show almost identical patterns in between-group wage differentials since 1973. The March data cover an additional decade.",
        "Using decennial Census earnings data, Angrist, Chernozhukov and Fernandez-Val (2006) document a sharp rise in residual inequality from 1980 to 1990, with a continuing increase from 1990 to 2000 concentrated in the upper half of the wage distribution.",
        "~ The divergent growth of the 90-50 and 50-10 wage differentials previously has been emphasized by Murphy and Welch (2001) and Mishel, Bernstein and Boushey (2002) and is noted by Lemieux (2006b).",
        "10 The robustness of conclusions concerning the timing of changes in overall and residual wage inequality changes to the choice of wage concept and sample are illustrated in an online reference Tables la and lb, which presents changes over consistent sub-periods from 1975-2005 of different measures of inequality for males, females, and both combined using weekly earnings for full-time workers and hourly wages for all workers for the March CPS and May/ORG CPS.",
        "~ We also drop from the sample (full-time) workers with weekly earnings below V2 the value of the real minimum wage in 1982 ($67 a week in 1982 dollars or $112 a week in 2000 dollars). Starting in 1976 (earnings year 1975), the March survey began collecting information on hours worked in the prior year, and this allows us to create a second March sample of hourly wage data for all wage and salary workers for earnings years 1975 to 2005. Supplemental tables using the hourly wage sample for the March CPS are available in an online appendix (see online reference Tables la, lb and 2).",
        "~ Approximately eighty percent of the rise in 90-10 earnings inequality from 1980 to 2005 is accounted for by the rise in the 90-50 wage gap using hourly wages for all male wage and salary workers in both the CPS ORG and March data.",
        "~ These explanations are not intrinsically at odds, and numerous studies focused on the experience of the 1 980s support the view that institutions and market forces both contributed to rising inequality (Katz and Autor 1999).",
        "~ DiNardo, Fortin and Lemieux (1996) also conclude that labor market institutions are the most important factor explaining rising wage inequality in the 1 980s, but they do not attribute the majority of the increase to this factor.",
