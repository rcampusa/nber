        "Government Employment 1889-1929 data are from Kendrick Productivity Trends in the United States, 1961, Table A-VI. Data from 1929-2002 were from BEA NIPA Tables 6.8A-D. The data were spliced using overlap data at 1929. Employment is full-time workers.",
        "School Enrollment: The school enrollment numbers were obtained by combining information from the Digest of Education Statistics, 2002, Historical Statistics Table H442, and Claudia Goldin A Brief History of Education in the U.S. August 1999, NBER working paper H0119. The Digest of Education Statistics contained total enrollment figures annually from 1964 2002, and every 10 years before that. We used Goldins and the Historical Statistics enrollment numbers for K-12 to interpolate the total enrollment numbers.",
