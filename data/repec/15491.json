        "~ The estimates based on David Mitch's data fall within the range of possible private and social rates of return he staked out (Mitch 1982, 1984, 1992). Professor Mitch suggests that my estimate based on Jason Long's work may have been too pessimistic in assuming that it would take six years of primary school to achieve the kind of wage gains estimated by Long. I am grateful to him for his advice on these estimates.",

        "A key clue to the validity of the infant-industry or Gerschenkronian argument would be whether or not countries that caught up in the past and became educational leaders did it by tipping government subsidies away from primary education and toward higher education, like some of today's developing countries covered in Table 4. A good case study would be North America and Australasia, which had to catch up with Britain, France, and Germany in the nineteenth century. While I am still gathering data on American university finance between the Civil War and World War II, it seems that the Northeastern states achieved their global prominence in higher education with primary/tertiary ratios above the text 50% threshold, to judge from the data for 1850 and from 1950 on. The Southern and Western states usually had lower primary/tertiary ratios, but also failed to catch up to the Northeast.",

The present author's transatlantic empirics are also comparative and reach conclusions like those of the Engerman-MariscalSokoloff team, but tend to rely more on panel-data econometrics, with the usual caveats about exogeneity and instrument power (Lindert 2004, Chs. S and 15). 8 If there are exceptions in which society over-invested public funds in primary education rather than higher education, they would probably be highly egalitarian communist regimes, such as Cuba under Castro. Yet I am not aware of any study that has quantified such overinvestment in basic education.",
        "The natural-experiment study by Acemoglu and Angrist (2000) emphasized the low statistical significance of externalities from the extra schooling triggered by compulsory schooling laws. Yet they authors acknowledge that their point estimates still include enough externalities to justify noticeable subsidies, and that their experiment was limited to externalities from secondary education alone.",
        "~ On the civic participation effects of schooling, see Dee (2004) and Milligan, Moretti, and Oreopoulos 2004. On its crime prevention effect, see Lochner and Moretti (2004). Currie and Moretti (2003) and other studies find positive effects of schooling on health. Other studies use production-function econometrics to capture the productivity effects of spillovers that leave no specific imprint (Moretti 2004a, 2004b, and a survey in 2006). See also the surveys by Krueger and Lindahl (2001) and McMahon (2004).",
