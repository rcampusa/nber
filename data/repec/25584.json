Summary Statistics This table summarizes descriptive statistics for the main variables. The sample period ranges from 1992 to 2005, in line with the data availability for our key mental health variables. Each respondent is surveyed three times over the depression symptoms, the first in 1992, the second in 1994 and the final when (s)he turns age 40 (over 1998-2005).

        "NLSY79 37 County-Level Partitioning Variables External Finance Dependence Following the literature (Rajan and Zingales, 1998; Duchin, Ozbas and Sensoy, 2010), we define EFD as the ratio of capital expenditures minus net cash flows from operating activities over the capital expenditures. We first aggregate firm-level values to the 3-digit SIC industry-level and calculate annual EFD for each industry. We next take the median of industry-year EFD over the long window (1980-2000) as the measurement of industry-level EFD. To arrive at the county-level EFD, we compute the employmentweighted EFD across all 3-digit SIC industries for each county-year. Then we average the county-year EFD over the pre-shock period 1989-1991 to gauge a persistent measurement of county-level EFD. We split the low-income group sample into low county EFD and high county EFD based on the county EFD median.",

We then scale this raw density by county total population. We split the low-income group sample into high county branch density and low county branch density based on the county density median."
