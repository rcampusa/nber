        "We identify Chinese last-named authors using a list of common Chinese last names from the Chinese Ministry of Public Security household registrations: http://www.mps.gov.cn/, accessed June 26, 2017. This list has last names for 84.8% of the population, leaving out uncommon last names, including some non-Han minority names. We distinguish Mainland Chinese names from other Chinese language speaking areas, by analyzing differences in the Chinese Pinyin spelling (Pinyin is the official romanization system for Standard Chinese in mainland China). We check authors' first names by hand. 5 This method limits mislabeling country of birth to immigrants who changed their first name to fit the country to which they moved and to native born persons whose parents gave them a mainland first name. 6 The sum of China Only (CO) addressed articles and fractional counts of articles with both Chinese and nonChina addresses proportionate to China's share of the article's addresses. 7",

        "The 2000 paper maximum sample that Scopus allowed for an inquiry gives us an adequate number of observations for generalizing to the larger population of all papers. As most of our statistics are counts that we use to compute proportions of papers in different groups, we calculate the sampling error for estimating a proportion in a random sample of 2,000. It is quite small, with a maximum value on the order of 0.006 for a true proportion of 0.50. This allows us to distinguish modest differences in shares of the magnitudes we observe with a high level of significance. As noted in the text, in the case where we had a substantially smaller sample with just 324 persons with Chinese last names in the 2018 NC sample from which to calculate the proportion with Chinese first names, we drew a much larger sample of 2,000 NC papers with at least one Chinese last-named author and obtained virtually identical estimates of the proportion with Chinese first names as in the smaller sample.",
        "Table A-1 lists the data samples that we created. Our focus on diaspora authors meant that we sampled papers with diaspora authors more intensely than papers with all China addresses. The number of 2,000 samples for CJ papers is particularly large because we wanted to track the change over time carefully for a related project.
