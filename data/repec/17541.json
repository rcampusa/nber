GED), Attend College indicates that the highest grade attended includes 1 or more years of college. College Graduate is a dummy variable that indicates that the student received a Bachelor's degree. The sample sizes are not identical in each of the columns due to non-response on the question required to infer their education status. Coefficients are similar if we restrict the sample to individuals who responded to all three questions. Additional covariates include a female dummy, race dummies and dummies for year of birth.
