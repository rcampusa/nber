        "Whether one or the other side proclaims the truth is largely an empirical matter. A fundamental study of this problem has been done by Cagan in 1965 who, relying on disaggregated U.S. data from 1875\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d1960 and nonpara\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d metric methods, argues convincingly that the long\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009drun relation between money supply and the price level is largely unidirectional. His analysis of the cyclical relations between money and income fails to yield a firm conclusion, however.",
        "Recently Granger (1969) gave an explicit and testable definition of causality and feedback. Sims (1972) used a Hilbert space argument to show that Granger&apos;s definition was equivalent to the existence of a particular representation of the driven process with respect to the driving process and proposed a univariate regression method to test for the direction of causality. Since then, a significant amount of interest in the theory and technique of causality detection has been developed in the economic literature. However, the particular aspect of inference advocated by each individual author fails to yield a consensus on the particular problem being investigated. Take the case of money and income causality. Sims (1972) contended that there existed a unidirectional 2 causality from money to GNP in the U.S. On the other hand, DyReys, Starleaf and Wang (1976)1, Feige and Pearce (1974), etc., based on different methods, contended that money and income were, at most, weakly related.",
        "Neither is the pattern uniform f or inter\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dcountry comparison. For instance, Wall (1974) found that money was the driving force for income in the U.K., while Williams, Goodhart and Gowland (1976) found the reverse causality to be the case.",
        "Section II presents the basic theorem characterizing the causality events and suggests two feedback detection methods which, like the one suggested by Pierce and Haugh (1977), are based on correlation analysis.",
        "c&apos;(O)] cA(k) and c.(O), c.(O) and C-(k) are the sample variances and cross\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dcovariances of u, v. The test statistic calculated would be (7) = (T_p)?(k) In a large sample this statistic is approximately chi\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dsquare distributed with M degrees of freedom under the null hypothesis, because the asymptotic distribution of a finite set of lagged cross\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dcorrelations between two independent linear processes is normal (Hannan [1971, p. 230]).",
        "The proof of (k) having the same asymptotic distribution follows straightforwardly from that of Haugh (1976) except for the minor complication here that although v is a white noise process, u is not. However, the independence of u and v implies that c(k) is still of O(T); thus, there is no change in the basic argument. Neither is there a reduction in the degrees of freedom for this test because the constraints placed on the residuals by the fitting process did not play a crucial role as that in the case of Box and Pierce (1970) or Chitturi (1974).",
        "If the spectra are sufficiently smooth, they can be divided into M bands between (O,ir ) such that for each band each spectral matrix is constant (see Wahba [1968] for a precise condition). We can then obtain an estimate of (w) by first transforming and &apos; into Vu(Wd) and where w(wd) = (211)2 exp(itwd) w() = (2irn) exp(itwd) d = 1, . . . [n/2] , with n = (T\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d2p) and (] the largest integer not greater than the indicated number. Let m satisfy mM = As T- , we can group the Wd into i sets (excluding = 0), the Lth which we call S, containing m adjacent d nearest to . We put W(Wd) w (Wd) W dC S - 1 r = ; 1. w(w) w WdS f (w) uv i in u d v d WdCS where the super asterisk indicates transposition combined with conjugation.",
        "Under appropriate conditions, such an estimate is consistent (see Anderson [1971, Ch. 10], Brillinger [1975, Ch. 7]).",
        "Test 3 (Sims test): From theorem 1(u), Sims(1972) suggested an F test for causal detection. That is, first regress Y on past and future values of X, taking account by generalized least squares or prefiltering of the serial correlation in the residuals. If there is no feedback from Y to X, future values of X in the regression should have coefficients insignificantly different from zero, as a group. 12 Test 4 (Pierce and Haugh (1976), Wall(1974)): First use separate filters on X and Y to ensure that each is very nearly pre\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dwhitened.",
        "Then use cross\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dcorrelation analysis to determine whether the residuals of the two prewhitened series are cross\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dcorrelated. If causality runs from X to Y only, all the cross\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dcorrelations between the residuals of X and lagged residuals of Y should be insignificantly different from zero. Haugh (1976) showed that .mder the null hypothesis these estimated residual cross correlations are asymptotically normally distributed with mean zero and variance 1/n. Thus M (15) f=fl rk k=1 is chi\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dsquare distributed with M degrees of freedom.",
        "Test 5: From theorem 1(iii), it is clear that one way to test feedback free is to test the independence between the stochastic regressors x and the disturbances v. Various testing methods have been suggested by Wu (1973). However, the power of these tests depend crucially upon the available instrumental variables. Therefore, except mentioning it as a possible candidate, we shall not elaborate on it here.",
        "The probability theory under the null hypothesis is the same whether one uses the correlation analysis or the regression analysis. The distribution of the test criterion when the null hypothesis is not true differs in the two cases (see Anderson (1958)). Thus the power function will be different even though the same test is valid in each case. Whether one prefers the former approach to the latter wiil be largely a matter of judicious choice and individual preference. However, when T-.c , the results are identical in both situations. (Kendall and Stuart (1965, ch. 26)). Test 4 in this case uses the statistic (22) X;AY..1(Y_jYt_1)Y;_1AX = \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2(T\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d3) 4",
        "(Friedman and Schwarz [963, Friedman [1970], Brunner and Meltzer [1964], etc.) Standing on the other side are the new viewers who provide explicit examples of the possibilities for non\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dcorrespondence between causal ordering and temporal ordering of turning points (Brainard and Tobin [1968], Tobin [1970], etc.) 20 T) The extreme critics even maintain that the money supply has no relevant place in the determination of money income. They attribute the association between money supply and income to the demand for money which contains income as an important argument. The money stock is somehow called forth to meet the demand. For instance, Davis (1968), Gramley and Chase (1965), Kazken (1967), etc., contend that cyclical fluctuations of monetary growth cannot be attri\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d buted to the behavior of the Federal Reserve authorities. These fluctuations are claimed to result primarily from the behavior of commercial banks and the public.",
        "The monetarists, on the other hand, although agreeing with the general relevance of money and income, are far from reaching a consensus with regard to the impact of economic activity on money supply. The strong view (e.g., L. Anderson [1968])contends that the behavior of the monetary authorities dominates movements in money income. The weak view (e.g., Cagan [1965], Friedman and Schwartz [1963])does not exclude feedback from income to the money supply, except that the monetary impulses are considered the major factor accounting for variations in money income. Such controversies can only be resolved by empirical studies. In this section we use the concepts of feedback and causality as they apply to stochastic processes to derive a time series interpretation of the direction of cause and effect. Hopefully it will shed some light on this empirically difficult problem.",
        "We use seasonally adjusted U.S. quarterly money stock and current dollar measures of GNP from 1947 I to 1976 II, for our analysis. Both N]. and N2 were used as alternative measures of money stock variables.",
        "All variables were measured as natural logs. Following Sims (1972), we prefiltered each logged variable using the filter 1 \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d 1.5L + .5626L2.",

        "Based on the experience of analyzing money and income relationship and the theoretical discussions in section 2 and 3, we feel that if the sample size is small, and the residuals were serially uncorrelated, Sims test is a powerful one to use and is easy to implement. If the sample size 37 is large, then causal spectral analysis would be a powerful exploratory tool. Of course, parametric estimation should be regarded as the ultimate goal in this kind of work. However, the empirical identification of multivariate autoregressive\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dmoving average processes may not be feasible in many occasions. (See Akaike (1974) for some theoretical discussions and Caines and Chan (1975), Wa].1 (1974) for some actual fitting). The main value of causal spectral analysis is in its flexLbility in examining the sources of variations in the data. It can be used to suggest possible models. 38 FOOTNOTES 1.
