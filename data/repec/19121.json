Throughout the Appendix, we will mention whenever our methods deviate from AL. Below we first introduce the control totals for population and income, then provide description of the taxation tables and related issues. We then describe how we exclude dividend imputation credits and capital gains from the top income share series. Finally, we provide a description of the mean-split histogram method.",
        "Control total for population. We choose as the control population every person aged 15 years and over. We use the most recent population estimates from Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) published data in Australian Demographic Statistics, Sep 2012: Table 59. Estimated Resident Population By Single Year Of Age, Australia (Catalogue No. 3101.0) (ABS 2013a). This table contains 58 population estimates for Australia by tax year (financial year), gender and age. The control total for the population is simply the total number of persons aged 15 and over in each year.",
        "The population totals we use are slightly different from those used by AL, who use different releases of the population estimates, whereas we only use the most recent release, which contains population estimates for all years back to 1970. In principle, using different versions may affect the consistency of the top income shares over time. Our analysis shows, however, that this does not in practice significantly affect population totals.",
        "We employ the most recent release of the National Accounts data available (as at the time of writing), which was published in November 2012. This release provides the best and most consistently measured income data currently available for all years that we examine. That is, the most recent release incorporates, for all years under study, all revisions to estimates made subsequent to first release and, insofar as possible, applies consistent definitions and approaches to measurement across all years. AL, on the other hand, use various different releases after 2003, so that estimates do not take into account 59 changes to definitions and measurement or revisions to estimates made subsequent to 2003 for pre2003 estimates, or changes and revisions subsequent to first release for post-2003 estimates.",
        "Taxation Statistics We rely on published taxation statistics. For the period from 1970 to 1994, tables published by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) are available only in printed form. For the period from 1994 to 1999, the tax tables we use come from CD-ROMs that accompanied the printed publications, while for the period from 1999 to 2010 we download all tables from the ATO website.",
        "The income measure is \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093net income\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d from 1970 to 1991, \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093total income\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d from 1992 to 1999, and \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093total income or loss\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d from 2000 to 2010.

The income measure is thus consistently defined from 1992 onwards. However, there is a significant inconsistency between the pre-1992 income measure and the income measure available from 1992. Like AL, we do not address this inconsistency. Since total income is larger than net income (and the control total for income is unaffected), this will cause a spurious increase in measured top income shares post-1991 compared with the earlier period. Our analysis to this point is very similar to AL. However, we are interested in creating a series that excludes dividend imputation credits and capital gains.",
        "We can identify imputation credits in the more detailed Australian tax tables we use. These tables contain the total value of imputation credits by taxable income ranges in all years in which the imputation system is in operation\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dfrom 1987 onward. Because we base our top income series on these more detailed tax tables we are able to subtract these credits from taxable income. From 1988, \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093primary\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d imputation credits can be distinguished from \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093subsidiary\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d imputation credits. Primary imputation credits derive from dividends on shares directly owned by the tax filer, while subsidiary imputation credits are those received indirectly as part of a distribution from a trust or partnership that owns shares attracting imputation credits. For 1987, to disaggregate total imputation credits into its primary and subsidiary components, we assume the 1988 ratio of primary to subsidiary credits applies.",
        "Until 1999, only real capital gains were taxed (indexation method). Net capital gains were calculated as total capital gains less capital losses (total capital losses of the current year and net capital losses from previous years). A change in tax law in 1999 meant that capital gains of assets acquired after 20 September 1999 were taxed in nominal rather than real terms, but with a discount of 50 per cent applied to assets held more than 12 months (discount method). For assets acquired before 20 September 1999, taxpayers could (and can still) choose to use either the indexation or the discount method. If the discount method is applied, net capital gains are calculated as total (nominal) capital gains less capital losses (total capital losses of the current year and net capital losses from previous years) with a 50 per cent discount for assets held more than 12 months.",
        "As an example, suppose we want to calculate the income share held by the top 1 per cent for the tax year 2009. We are therefore using information from the 2009 Taxation Statistics (see Table A11). For this exercise, the income measure we are interested in is \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093Total income minus imputation credits and capital gains.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d The results of steps 1 and 2 are listed in the right section of Table A11.",
        "Thus, the accrued capital gain on a non-home asset in 2006-07 is based on the (initial) reported value of the asset in 2006 and the change in the relevant price index between 1 July 2006 and 30 June 2007. By contrast, the accrued capital gain in 2009-10 is based on the (final) reported value of the asset in 2010 and the change in the relevant price index between 1 July 2009 and 30 June 2010.",
