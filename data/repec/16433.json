        "For instance, over four years, 2,364 participants in the landmark American Dream Demonstration (ADD) IDA program accumulated $1.25MM in savings (Schreiner, Clancy and Sherraden 2002). Andrea Ryan contributed to this section of this chapter. It draws upon work done by Angela Seensun Kang , Anooshree C. Sinha and Howell Jackson of Harvard Law School, from the insights of Jackson and Tufano's students in their JD-MBA course on consumer finance, especially Daniel Preysman, and from work done by D2D Fund and its legal advisors. Readers should not rely on this document for legal advice, as the law in this area is quite complex.",
        "Both Tufano (2008) and Lobe and Holzl (2007) demonstrate that large prizes are strongly related to sales of premium bonds. This is a feature that we have proposed testing in random design field experiments. As mentioned above, we have yet to successful implement such an experimental design in the field. Guryan and Kearney are currently developing a laboratory experiment to be conducted at the Experimental Laboratory in the Department of Economics at the University of Maryland that would test this concept.",
        "Data on the program come from a public presentation by a senior FNB executive to the Prize Linked Subcommittee of the FDIC Advisory Committee on Economic Inclusion (ComE-In), Washington DC, July 30, 2009. (http://www.vodium.com/MediapodLibrary/index.asp?library=pn100472_fdic_advisorycommittee&Sessi onArgs=0A1U0100000100000101) Coauthor of this chapter Peter Tufano is Chairman and Co-founder of the D2D fund. The mission of D2D is to expand access to financial services, especially asset building opportunities, for low-income families by creating, testing and deploying innovative financial products and services.",

        "By way of comparison, Kearney's (2005) analysis of demand for U.S. state lottery products, estimated at the level of game and week, similarly finds that lottery sales are positively driven by expected return suggesting an investment motive and evaluation  as well as non-pecuniary characteristics, including the nominal top prize, numbers of digits chosen, and age of the game.",

        "O' Donaghue, Goulding, and Allen (2004) report a consistent inflation series from 1750 through 2003. Using this period (and assuming no inflation prior to 1750), the ticket would have cost over 1400 in 2003 pounds.",
        "Among those in the lowest income third of the NORC data  defined by having household income of less than $30,400 in 2005 dollars  reported annual lottery expenditures averaged $164. We can make an imperfect comparison of lottery gambling and savings by low-income individuals by comparing these numbers to the 1992, 1995, 1998, and 2001 waves of the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF). Among individuals in the SCF with less than a high school degree, median assets in savings and checking accounts total $200 (in year 2005 dollars); likewise for median liquid assets. The SCF data suggest that this amount is comparable to median liquid assets and median savings and checking assets, both amounting to $200 for this income group.",

        "See Tufano and Schneider (2008) for an overview of existing policies aimed at promoting savings among low and moderate savers in the United States. This team of authors has attempted multiple projects designed to investigate whether prize-linked savings products generate new and increased levels of saving, as opposed to shifting assets from other vehicles. We have yet to implement a randomized design experiment, but we continue to seek research opportunities.",
