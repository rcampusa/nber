        "In this regard, it is worth mentioning that existing empirical tests of propositions suggested by the Lucas (1972) model \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d for example, the \"policy ineffectiveness\" hypothesis\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dhave typically been conducted using specifications taken from these other papers. Leading examples are provided by Boschen and Grossman (1982), Gordon (1982), and Mishkin (1982).",
        "Lucas (1981, pp. 12, 14-15) has suggested that a linearized version of the ENM model is provided by Lucas (1973). But the relative price variables in these papers are different \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dsee fn. 7 below\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dand markets clear locally in the ENM model but not in Lucas (1973). Our linearization procedure is related to one employed by Lucas (1975) but relies more heavily on properties of the nonlinear model. Kydland and Prescott (1982) recently used a rather similar procedure in the context of a numerical analysis. These linearizations lose, of course, the effects of time-varying conditional variances and higher moments. Our notation is related to Lucas's but is not identical."
