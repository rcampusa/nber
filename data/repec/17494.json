        "There have been documented cases of cheating in California (May, 1999), Massachusetts (Marcus, 2000), New York (Loughran and Comiskey, 1999), Texas (Kolker, 1999), Great Britain (Hofkins, 1995; Tysome, 1994) and Chicago (Jacob and Levitt, 2003). While these studies generally rely on examination of erasure patterns and the controlled retesting of students, Jacob and Levitt (2003) develop a method for statistically detecting cheating. Their approach is guided by the intuition that teacher cheating, especially if done in an unsophisticated manner, is likely to leave blocks of identical answers, unusual patterns of correlations across student answers within the classroom, or unusual response patterns within a student\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2s exam.",
        "Following Jacob and Levitt\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2s (2003) algorithm, we use four strategies to investigate the possibility of cheating at treatment schools. First, we search for unusual blocks of consecutive identical answers given by multiple test-takers. Second, we look for unlikely correlation in answer responses within specific within classrooms. Third, we examine whether these correlations exhibit an unusually high variance in certain schools and grades. Finally, we measure whether students achieve a given aggregate score through an unlikely combination of correct answers.36 We should note that there are more subtle ways teachers can cheat, such as by providing subtle feedback during the test or changing answers in a random way, that our algorithm is unlikely to detect. Even when cheating is done naively our approach is not likely to detect every instance of cheating (see Jacob and Levitt (2003) for details and calibration exercises). Our results should be interpreted with these caveats in mind.",
        "Jacob and Levitt (2003) used Chicago Public Schools administrative data to determine the actual room students tested in, and they were able to to construct class-sized groups within which to analyze correlations using this information. Unfortunately, HISD testing procedures do not assign students to specific rooms or record how tests are administered logistically."
