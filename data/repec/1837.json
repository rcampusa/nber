        "Table 12 provides estimates of the contribution of the labor force shifts shown in Table 9 to the growth of GOP per worker from 1960 to 1980. It uses aflr% (ID lflOfl C1D .LUV iQl lv i.LJr Jl l\\I Qilu iJiJ I lai. lV IJIJF JI VJl rI G ,Ji lvi weights to evaluate the shift. The results show that in the developing countries (with the exception of India), changes in the sectoral distribution of the labor force have contributed significantly to the growth of overall labor productivity: a 21-25 percent increase in middle\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dincome developing countries and a 14-15 percent increase in low-income countries exclusive of China and India. With productivity growth over the period of nearly 150 percent in middle-income developing countries and about 100 percent in low-income countries, the observed ability of the labor markets to shift labor to the relatively more productive sectors despite rapid population growth contributed from one\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dtenth to one-fifth of observed overall productivity growth.",
        "It is interesting to note, however, that an important exception to the pattern of services comprising a larger share of the labor force than industry is China (in 1980), in which this pattern is reversed, and substantially so. With regard to country\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dspecific differences, the statistics for India are also interesting insofar as they show a relatively small decline between 1960 and 1980 in the proportion of the labor force in agriculture.",
        "However, with the exception of the upper middle-income developing economies, agriculture has been and remains the largest utilizer of labor in the developing economies. Even in the upper middle-income countries, the proportion of the labor force in agricuture was five times that in the industrial market economies in 1980. [25] Second, Table 9 reveals that the relative decline of agriculture coincided mainly with growth in the share of the labor force in the service sector, which tended to be larger in size than the industrial sector in both 1960 and 1980.",

        "-42To begin with, consider the projected population and labor force growth rates in Table 14. The figures here show two advantages compared to the 1960-80 period examined in Table 1. First, rates of population growth will be smaller than in the earlier periods: for all low-income developing countries the rates of growth fall from 2\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d3 percent (1960-70) and 1.9 percent (1970-82) to a projected 1.7 percent. The rate of population increase also falls for lowerand upper middle-income developing countries. Second, in sharp contrast to the earlier period, the labor force will increase more rapidly than population in all types of economies. For the first time in recent years, dependency rates will be getting lower. Hence, smaller increases in income per worker will be needed to produce any given increase in income per capita.",
        "What about the future? Simply because the developing economies managed to raise productivity and shift employment into the service and manufacturing sectors in the 1960-80 period does not necessarily mean that they will be able to do so in the next two decades. We consider next the factors likely to make absorption of the increased population easier and those likely to make it more difficult in the 1980-2000 period.",
        "Overall, the experiences of the 1960-1980 period tend to be more supportive of an optimistic view of the ability of developing economies to adjust to population 9rowth, than of a pessimistic view.",
        "Although we focus our attention mainly on the expansion of the industrial and service sectors, we do not mean to suggest that agricultural development is of little consequence. Indeed, increases in productivity in the agricultural sector, which we will also discuss, usually precede and are the primary cause of sectoral shifts in employment. [24] The key result of our analysis is that, in the 1960-80 period, despite the unprecedented magnitude of population growth and the existence of imperfections in labor markets, developing countries tended to shift from low-productivity agriculture to the higher-productivity service sector and to a slightly lesser extent to the high\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dproductivity industrial sector, and to raise income per head, although with some exceptions (e.g., some African countries). We do not address the question of whether these changes could have been more extensive in some counterfactual world with slower growth of population and labor force.",
        "Population and Employment, 1960-1980 As the preceding section makes clear, a central indicator of the pace at which a developing economy is absorbing labor is the rate at which the sectoral balance of the economy is shifted from agricultural to nonagricultural employment. In this section, we present and discuss a series of statistics on these shifts. We will use World Bank data to examine differentials across both income groups and geographic regions. The three sectors on which we will focus our attention are the agricultural, industrial, and service sectors. The agricultural sector encompasses forestry, hunting, and fishing, in addition to agriculture. [23] The industrial sector is comprised of manufacturing, mining,construction, and utilities. Services are defined as a residual category of economic activity (i.e., not agriculture or industry, as defined above).",
        "Until the 1980&apos;s, the overpaid civil servant was often cited as a problem in \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d24\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d African countries. While one might expect the effectiveness of policies in altering modern sector wages relative to those elsewhere to be extensively studied, with firm research conclusions, in fact there are only scattered studies for developing countries, and no clear consensus of either the direction or effectiveness of the policies. According to one leading scholar, the experiences of the various countries has called attention to the importance of the role of government in &apos; riri T. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d. 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2iI.",
        "Turning now to the labor force participation rates for females, we observe a slight decline from 1960 to 1980 for the low-income developing countries, most likely due to the effect of population growth on the age distribution. On the other hand, we observe a stable pattern in the middle-income developing countries, although the participation rates are substantially below those of the low-income developing countries. Whether this difference is a consequence of the notoriously poor data on female labor force participation in developing countries and problems of definition in countries with large agricultural sectors, or whether it is indicative of a tendency for women to withdraw from the labor force as development proceeds, is unclear. It is also unclear whether this pattern is due to some omitted factors that affect the labor force participation of women and that are correlated with income group.",
        "A second apparent regularity in Table 2 is that the labor force participation rates for males in the middle-income developing countries are lower than in the low-income countries. In addition, participation rates in both groups of countries have declined over time. These findings seem to reflect the facts that (1) population growth was substantial in both groups of developing economies in the 1950&apos;s and 1960&apos;s (as they began their demographic transitions), thereby tending to raise the youth share of their populations, and \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d13\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d (2) population growth was relatively greater in the middle-income countries than in the low-income countries in the 1950&apos;s and 1960&apos;s, resulting in a greater increase in the youth proportions of their populations (and consequently a greater decline in their male labor force participation rates).",
        "In Table 2 we present male and female labor force participation rates for a somewhat abridged income grouping of economies. One striking feature of these statistics is that the labor force participation rates of men in industrial market economies exceeded the rates for men in the two groups of developing economies in both 1960 and 1980. This differential results from the relatively older age distributions of the industrial market economies, a consequence of their lower rates of population growth. This pattern is especially interesting given that labor force participation rates for men tend to fall at the young and old ages as development proceeds (see Durand, 1975). In this case the demography of the age structure dominates the behavioral factors in determining aggregate labor force participation.",
        "Fourth, one pattern not revealed in Table 1 but worthy of note relates to \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d12\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d the considerable variability of population and labor force growth rates between countries within the same income group. For example, among the low-income economies, Kenya and Mozambique had population growth rates of 4.0 and 4.3 percent between 1970 and 1982 while Sri Lanka and Haiti had growth rates of 1.7 percent. As another example, among the upper middle-income economies, Syria, Venezuela, and Iraq had population growth rates of about 3.6 percent from 1970 to 1982, roughly nine times the rate of 0.4 percent in Uruguay and more than twice the rates in Argentina, Chile, and North Korea.",
        "If there had been either no technological progress in this period or no increases-in capital per worker, these economies&apos; productive capacities per capita would have declined between 1960 and 1982. Nonetheless, the difference between population and labor force growth rates decreased for the developing economies between the 1960&apos;s and the 1970&apos;s. This decrease reflects the age distribution effects of population growth prior to 1960 and suggests that the secular deterioration of developing economies&apos; ratios of labor force to total population is slowing. In China, this decline was actually reversed as labor force growth exceeded population growth during the 1970&apos;s.",
        "The third noteworthy pattern in Table 1 is that during the 1960-82 period, none of the groups of developing countries (with the single exception of China in the 1970&apos;s) experienced labor force growth in excess of population growth.",
        "Second, declining population growth rates in the 1970&apos;s have not yet shown up in the form of declining labor force growth rates for either China, the upper middle\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dincome developing economies, or the industrial market economies. This pattern illustrates the point made in the preceding subsection about the existence of a time lag between population growth and labor force growth.",
        "The geographic grouping of developing economies also follows the standard World Bank classification. Thus, countries are grouped into the following regions: (1) Sub-Sahara Africa, 34 countries; (2) Middle East and North Africa, 11 countries; (3) East Asia and Pacific, 14 countries; (4) South Asia, 8 countries; (5) Latin America and Caribbean, 22 countries; and (6) South Europe, 5 countries. All of the countries represented in our tables are listed individually by income group and geographic region in Tables A.1 and A.2 of the Appendix. All of the population, labor force, and output statistics reported represent weighted averages of the individual country statistics, with 1960, 1970, or 1980 population sizes used to construct the weights. For the low-income developing countries, statistics are reported both separately and together for China, India, and other low-income countries.",
        "The figures for lower middle-income economies are based on data for 38 countries whose 1982 per capita GNP exceeded 410 U.S. dollars but was less than 1650 U.S. dollars (average per capita income for these countries is 840 dollars). The figures for the upper middle-income developing economies are based on data for 22 developing economies with GNP per capita in excess of 1650 U.S. dollars (average equals 2490 dollars). Finally, the figures for the industrial market economies are based on data for 19 countries that had an average GNP per capita of 11070 dollars.",
        "B. Empirical Patterns In this section we present and discuss evidence on the linkages between population growth and the size and the structure of the labor force in developing countries. Most of the statistics we analyze are drawn from various publications of the World Bank, although some of those statistics were originally produced by the UN or the ILO. Countries will be grouped in two conventional ways for purposes of our analysis: by income group and geographic location. The income classification is based on levels of GNP per capita for most countries, with other characteristics thought to be correlated with income group used to classify countries for which per capita GNP data are either unreliable or unavailable. The figures for low-income developing economies are -10based on data for 34 countries whose 1982 per capita GNP was less than 410 U.S. dollars (average income per capita for these countries is 250 U.S. dollars).",
