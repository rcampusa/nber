Wages are weighted by CPS sample weights. Hourly wages are equal to the logarithm of reported hourly earnings for those paid by the hour and the logarithm of usual weekly earnings divided by hours worked last week for non-hourly workers. Top-coded earnings observations are multiplied by 1.5. Hourly earners of below $1.675/hour in 1982 dollars ($3.41/hour in 2008 dollars) are dropped, as are hourly wages exceeding 1/35th the top-coded value of weekly earnings. All earnings are deflated by the chain-weighted (implicit) price deflator for personal consumption expenditures (PCE). Allocated earnings observations are excluded in all years, except where allocation flags are unavailable (January 1994 to August 1995).",

Full-time, full-year workers are those who usually worked 35 or more hours per week and worked forty or more weeks in the previous year. Weekly earnings are calculated as the logarithm of annual earnings divided by weeks worked. Calculations are weighted by CPS sampling weights and are deflated using the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) deflator. Earnings of below $67/week in 1982 dollars ($136/week in 2008 dollars) are dropped. Allocated earnings observations are excluded in earnings years 1967 forward using either family earnings allocation flags (1967\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d1974) or individual earnings allocation flags (1975 earnings year forward).",
