        "A Legislator Voting Behavior Figure A.1 displays the McCrary (2008) test of whether there is a discontinuity in the density of Democrats&apos; winning margin over Republicans. The estimate of the discontinuity is 0.003 with a standard error of 0.125, indicating that there is not a statistically signicant discontinuity. Figures A.2 to A.10 examine the distributions of each of the district-level attributes included in the legislative voting regressions in Section 5, plotted against the Democrat margin of victory. As discussed there, none of these distributions exhibit discontinuities at the cuto point at which the Democrat margin of victory is 0.",
        "B Approaches for Estimating Regression Discontinuity Coecient The nonparametric approach is a local linear estimation that uses observations within a window of width w on both sides of the cuto point and assumes that g(.) and f(.) are linear, with potentially dierent slopes on the two sides of the cuto point. We implement this approach using the procedure developed by Imbens and Kalyanaraman (2014) to calculate the optimal bandwidth w\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00cb\u0086\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0094 , and estimate analytical standard errors using the procedure developed in Porter (2003). In robustness checks, we examine whether our estimates are sensitive to dierent bandwidths, e.g., halving and doubling w\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00cb\u0086\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0094 , as in Lee and Lemieux (2010). As indicated in Table A.1, we obtain similar results in both cases for both sets of bills.",
        "Parametric estimation, by contrast, uses all of the observations over the domain of the assignment variable and assumes high-order polynomial functions of g(.) and f(.). In the main text, we implement this approach using third-order polynomial functions with potentially dierent coecients on the two sides of the cuto point. Following Lee and Card (2008), we calculate standard errors clustered at the assignment variable level. Here, we report results using second- and fourth-order polynomials to examine the sensitivity of our estimates to using third order polynomials. As indicated in Table A.2, we obtain similar results in both cases."
