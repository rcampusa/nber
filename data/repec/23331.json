        "Appendix A: A Model of Risk Management Alternatives We use a simple liquidity management model along the lines of Holmstr\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00b6m and Tirole (1998). Start with an initial (date-0) investment = I, which is fixed. The firm also starts with net worth A > 0. The investment produces a payoff R at the final date (date 2). At date-1, the firm has to make an additional (random) investment to continue the project. If this investment is not made, the project is liquidated and produces zero. With probability \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00bb, the required investment is \u00c3\u008f\u00c2\u0081, and it is zero in the other state. We assume that \u00c3\u008f\u00c2\u0081 < R (so that continuation is efficient in state \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00bb), and that R > I + \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00bb \u00c3\u008f\u00c2\u0081 (so the project is positive NPV). Everyone is risk-neutral, and the discount rate is 1 for simplicity.",
        "Settlement Risk: To construct the first proxy, Supplier Z-Score, we first calculate the Z-score (Altman, 1968) for all firms in Compustat and then aggregate firm-year Z-scores by two-digit NAICS code to construct industry characteristics, and define Industry Z-Score as the median industry Z-score. The weighting procedure for all supplier-industry variables is identical as for Supplier Industry HHI. Supplier settlement risk is high if the Supplier Z-Score is below the sample mean and low if above that threshold.13 Alternative Settlement Risk: Supplier Tangibility is based on the same process as Supplier ZScore.",
        "Tangibility is computed following Almeida and Campello (2007), and it is sales-weighted by supplier industry for each downstream customer industry.",
        "Alternative Hold-up: Supplier Differentiated Goods is based on Giannetti, Burkart, and Ellingsen (2011) and Rauch (1999), which classifies products as standardized or differentiated. Standardized goods have mostly homogenous prices while differentiated goods have heterogeneous pricing. We construct this variable similar to Supplier R&D above. Specifically, we use the above definitions to define industries that produce differentiated good at the 2-digit level and then constructed a sales-weighted average across all supplier industries to estimate the percentage of a firm\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s upstream industries that produce differentiated products. We estimate the following formula, where Diff Goods takes a value of one for each differentiated goods industry: \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u0086\u00e2\u0080\u0098",
        "Vertical Integration: Finally, we identify vertically integrated firms based on the methodology of Acemoglu, Johnson, and Mitton (2009). We identify all of a firm\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s 6-digit NAICS operating segments using the Compustat Segment tapes and then map the NAICS codes to the BEA\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s 6 digit IO codes. Using the industry input-output flows in the BEA IO tables, we estimate the sales weighted percentage of a firm\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s inputs that it could hypothetically purchase from itself. We define Vertical Relatedness as a continuous measure between 0 and 1 that captures this value.",
