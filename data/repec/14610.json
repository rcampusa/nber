        "From this source, we gather balance sheet information (total sales, total labor costs, total wage-bill, sales, value-added, total employment). Matching the Customs database and the BAL-SUSE database leaves us 229,900 firms in manufacturing (excluding construction, mining and oil industries) in 1986 with valid information on sales and exports. All values are translated into U.S. dollars at the 1986 exchange rate.",
        "We match this file with the Base dAnalyse Longitudinale, Syst\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a8me Unifl\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a9 de Statistiques dEntreprises (BAL-SUSE) database, which provides firm-level information. The BAL-SUSE database is constructed from the mandatory reports of French firms to the fiscal administration. These reports are then transmitted to INSEE where the data are validated. It includes all firms subject to the ~B\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a9n\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a9fices Industriels et Commerciaux regime, a fiscal regime mandatory for all manufacturing firms with a turnover above 3,000,000FF in 1990 (1,000,000FF in the service sector). In 1990, these firms comprised more than 60% of the total number of firms in France while their turnover comprised more than 94% of total turnover of firms in France. Hence, the BAL-SUSE is representative of French enterprises in all sectors except the public sector.",
