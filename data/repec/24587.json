We plot in this graph the coefficients on College Grad from each of these estimations. We control for survey-date and state fixed effects, age and its square, and gender.

To summarize how the actual (unweighted) Gallup observations compare to the full U.S. adult population, we compare unweighted Gallup data to Census IPUMS tabulations. Given Gallup\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s well-documented under-sampling of the South, we show results separately for Southern and non-Southern states.",
        "Gallup respondents outside the South are more educated than their Census counterparts, with the largest gap being a high school completion difference of ten percentage points in 1950. In the South, except for 1950, Gallup and IPUMS show similar levels of education.",
        "Gallup Southern respondents have higher high school completion rates than those in the Census in 1950, not surprising as it was still under-sampling Southern blacks in that year. Later in the paper we will show results with the Gallup data both unweighted and weighted to match Census characteristics, but Table A.1 gives some sense of how much \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00c5\u0093work\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u009d the weights must do.",
        "Also, outside the South, Gallup appears to accurately sample the remaining six regions of the US.47 In general, we show results with Gallup data using weights to match (interpolated) Census IPUMS summary statistics, even though the need for weights is not obvious after 1950 or 1960. From 1937 until 1941, we weight so that Gallup matched the IPUMS in terms of White \u00c3\u0083\u00c6\u0092\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0094 South cells, given that the summary statistics show that Gallup sampling along these dimensions appears suspect in the early years. Beginning in 1942 (the first year in which Gallup surveys ask the union and education questions in the same survey) we weight by White \u00c3\u0083\u00c6\u0092\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Education \u00c3\u0083\u00c6\u0092\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0094 South, where Education \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00cb\u0086\u00c3\u0082\u00cb\u0086 {No high school degree, HS degree, Some college, College graduate}, thus giving us 2 \u00c3\u0083\u00c6\u0092\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0094 4 \u00c3\u0083\u00c6\u0092\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0094 2 = 16 cells on which to match. In practice, however, our results are very similar with and without weights. 47We use Gallup-defined geographic regions in this table.",
        "Appendix D. Existing Measures of Union Density Pre-Dating the Current Population Survey The CPS first asks respondents their union status in 1973, and then only in selected months until 1983 from which time information on union status was collected each month in the CPS as part of the outgoing rotation group supplement. Before this survey, the primary sources for union density are the BLS and Troy/NBER historical time series mentioned in the introduction. The data underlying these calculations are union reports of membership and dues revenue when available, and a variety of other sources when not available. Neither of these data sources ever used representative samples of individual workers to calculate union density.",
        "In general, the data derived from union reports likely become more accurate by the 1960s.",
        "Post-1959 the BLS collected mandatory financial reports from unions as a condition of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure (Landrum-Griffin) Act, and Troy and Sheflin (1985) incorporate these data into their estimates of union density. Beginning in 1964, the BLS disaggregates union membership counts by state, and Hirsch et al. (2001) splice these reports together with the CPS to form state-year union density panel beginning in 1964 and continuing through today.48 Before the 1960s, however, union data were far less standardized. In the remainder of this section, we detail the methodology of the two most widely used data sources on aggregate union density: the BLS and Troy series.",
        "For example, the 1945 Monthly Labor Report notes as its sources: \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00c5\u0093This study is based on an analysis of approximately 15,000 employer-union agreements as well as employment, union membership, and other data available to the Bureau of Labor Statistics [emphasis ours]\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u009d (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1945)49 It is obviously hard to verify information from unspecified \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00c5\u0093sources available to the BLS\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u009d but even in instances where the BLS can rely on union membership reports, concerns arise.",
        "A key issue is that unions had important incentives to over-state their membership and until the late 1950s faced no penalty for doing so. In the early and mid-1930s, the main umbrella organization for local unions was the American Federation of Labor (AFL). They were often charged with over-stating their membership, presumably to inflate their political influence.",
        "For example, a 1934 New York Times story casts doubt on the AFL\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s claim to represent over six million workers, noting that \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00c5\u0093complete and authoritative data are lacking\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u009d and that the figures provided by the AFL \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00c5\u0093are not regarded as accurate.\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u009d50 Individual unions also had an incentive to inflate the numbers they reported to the AFL. For example, the number of seats each union would receive at the annual convention was based on a formula to which membership was the main input.",
        "If anything, these incentives to over-report likely grew after 1937, when the Committee on Industrial Organization broke away from the AFL to form a rival umbrella organization, the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). Both federations of labor, the AFL and CIO, now competed for local unions to join their umbrella organizations, as well as for sympathies of government officials, tasks that were aided by a public perception that the federation was large and growing. Based on our read of New York Times articles on unions in the late 1930s and early 1940s, one of the most common if not the most common topic is the conflict between the two federations.51 Individual unions still had incentives to compete for influence within their given federation, and thus inflate membership.",
        "But union financial reports, like membership reports, are also not verified until the late 1950s. Nor is it obvious that union revenue data are not similarly inflated (in fact, the AFL accused the CIO of lying about their income data, as we mention in footnote 51).",
        "Moreover, revenue data are largely incomplete for the 1930s and 1940s.

The [AFL] reported an average membership of 2,609,011 for the year ended Aug.",
        "The historical Troy measures for 1939 and 1956 are constructed from even more fragmentary records than the annual series we discuss above (as many union reports did not disaggregate either revenue or membership by state), we are also correlated with these data in both cross-sections and changes (1939 correlation = 0.78, 1953 correlation = 0.75, correlation in changes =0.5).",

        "53Troy (1965) also only presents validation exercises for his post-1950 data, comparing reported measurement with that inferred from dues receipts for the Chemical and Rubber Workers in 1953, leaving it open whether the BLS or Troy (or neither) is correct for the pre-1950 series.",
