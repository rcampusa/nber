The categories are cardiac, cancer, labor, digestive diseases, and neurological diseases.

These variables summarize the services offered by each hospital; they cover cardiac, imaging, cancer, and birth services. Each hospital is rated on a scale from 0 to 1, where 1 implies that the hospital offers the least common of a list of relevant services and 0 implies that it offers none of the services. Details are given in Table 9.",
        "There is no outside option, since our data includes only patients who are sick enough to go to hospital for a particular diagnosis. We estimate the model using standard maximum likelihood techniques and our micro (encounter-level) data. We observe the network of each insurer and, therefore, can accurately specify the choice set of each patient. We assume that the enrollee can choose any hospital in his HSA that is included in his insurer\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s network provided that hospital is located no more than 100 miles from the patient\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s home zip code. As in Ho (2006), we implicitly assume there is no selection across our two insurance plans on unobservable consumer preferences for hospitals."
