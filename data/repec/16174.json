        "8 Data Appendix A. Trade flows US trade flows: From the US Census Bureau Foreign Trade Statistics, which reports monthly US trade flows at the 3-digit or 6-digit NAICS level. For US imports, we use the imports series rather than the Cimports series. The two series differ in their treatment of imports destined for US foreign trade zones (FTZs) or bonded warehouses. The Cimports series records the value of these goods as they are imported from or withdrawn from the FTZs or bonded warehouses, whereas the imports series record this value at their time of arrival in the FTZs or bonded warehouses (see Feenstra et al. 2002). The correlation between the two import concepts is in any case very high: 0.9917.",
        "Asset tangibility (): Constructed following Braun (2003), using the same Compustat data as for . For each firm, asset tangibility is computed as the total value of a firm's net plant, property and equipment divided by the total value of its assets for the period 1996-2005. The median value across firms in each NAICS 3-digit category is used as the industry measure of .",
        "Trade credit (): Constructed following Fisman and Love (2003), using the same Compustat data as for . For each firm, access to trade credit in a given year is computed as the change in accounts payable divided by the change in the firm's total assets. This flow measure of access to trade credit is summed over the period 1996-2005 to get a firm measure for this decade. The median value across firms in each NAICS 3-digit category is used as the industry measure of . Factor intensities (log() log()): From the NBER-CES database. These are constructed first for SIC 4-digit industries: (i) Physical capital intensity as the log of the ratio of real capital stock to total employment; and (ii) Skill intensity as the log of the ratio of non-production workers to total employment.",
        "These are calculated using 1996 data, the most recent year available in the dataset. We map SIC 4-digit to NAICS 3-digit industries using the Feenstra et al. (2002) US import database (1989-2006). In that database, import flows at a detailed HS-10 digit level are reported, with accompanying SIC and NAICS industry codes, from which concordance weights were constructed. The factor intensity of each NAICS 3digit industry is calculated as the concordance-weighted average of the factor intensities of its constituent SIC 4-digit industries. C. Country variables Interbank rates (): See Section 3 of the paper.",
