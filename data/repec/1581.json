        "2. Eichenbaura's (1982) model does not fit precisely into this framework, even in its simplified version (1982, pp 24-25). He includes the term a.w Q.in the cost function, where w ^. is the wage and a. another t+j t+j t+j *\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00bb positive parameter. As will become apparent, the inequality to be derived here is approximately correct if a^(cov(w,Q)-cov(w,3)) is small compared to the other terms in the inequality.",
        "3. That is, inventories serve two functions apart from any they may serve on the revenue side. In the general formulation of the model used here, inventories may also\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00abserve to, say, allow the price speculation by producers that is emphasized in Eichenbaum (1982). The comment in this footnote also applies the model without a target level. 4. I thank both R. Shiller and L. Summers for (independently) suggesting to me the basic argument of this section. 5. Except if the firm has some market power and demand depends on actual or expected production or inventories. As far as I know, this assumption has never been made in this class of models.",
        "7. An alternative method for calculating unadjusted constant dollar inventories would be to deflate book value inventories by the appropriate wholesale price index- Given the massive switch from FIFO to LIFO accounting in the 1970's and cyclical differences in output price versus input cost (see Foss, et al. (n.d.)), this is likely to lead to estimates substantially inferior than those derived as described in the text.",
        "F2-8. It should be noted that in Reagan and Sheehan (1982) time series study of precisely the unadjusted aggregate data used here, it was found that seasonal dummies alone successfully accounted for the seasonal variation in inventories. There appeared to be no need to allow for indeterministic seasonal components.",
        "9- This assumes dp .S ,/dH =0. This is consistent with any linear ^t+j t+j t quadratic inventory model that I am aware of, including not only those in which sales are exogenous (e.g. Belsley (1969)) but also those in which they are jointly endogenous with inventories (Eichenbaum (1982), Blinder (1982)). 10. u is MA(1) if production and sales decisions are made simultaneously.",
        "But if production is decided before sales are known, as in Blinder (1982), u is MA(2). It seemed desirable to adopt a procedure that was consistent It under those circumstances, so the estimation procedure allowed for a MA(2) disturbance."
