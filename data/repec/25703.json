        "These data includes quantities, indices, and pre-calculated growth rate of output, capital, labor, and productivity, among other variables. With the exception of value added and a handful of indices (usually labor and capital services), labor productivity and growth rate data generally start post-1995 in the 2017 release. However, these data were also available in the 2012 releases, which estimated values back until 1970. To gain a full picture of the data for each country and industry back us far as possible, it was necessary to link the older release of the KLEMS from 2012 with the 2017 dataset.",
        "Towards the end of July, EUKLEMS revised the 2017 release, in the process eliminating many pre-1995 datapoints. Since we downloaded the data prior to this revision, we have retained many of the now-missing pre-1995 values from the 2017 release, though these are likely available to some extent in the 2012 releases.",
        "Merging the KLEMS Data Old to New The primary method of merging was ratio linking, which was used for merging indices and quantities. For each variable in a given industry and country, we took the earliest value available in the 2017 data and identified the observation in the older dataset corresponding to the same variable. We then computed the ratio of the 2017 datapoint to the 2012 datapoint for that year and multiplied all prior observations by this ratio. The main consequence of using this procedure was that growth rates were preserved across the old and new data without any jumps or discontinuities at the point of merging.",
        "Calculating Earlier LP1_Q Values There are two labor productivity variables of interest available in the KLEMS data: \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093LP1_Q\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d and \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093LP_I\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d while the former is a growth rate calculated bottom-up as a sum of contributions, the latter is an index that directly divides value added by the hours index. The former is available only in the 2017 release, while the latter is available in both the 2012 and 2017 datasets. Since this project is concerned with breaking down labor productivity growth into its components, we use LP1_Q in preference to LP_I.",
        "However, since LP1_Q is unavailable in the 2012 data, we use the growth of the LP_I index to proxy for any earlier years where LP1_Q is unavailable \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d we append the growth rate of LP_I to any data points prior to the earliest year where LP1_Q is available.",
        "The final variable is based on Table A1 from Fernald (2014). Our own Table A1 shows the KLEMS industries in the left column, and then the line numbers of Fernald\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s table on the right to display which the industries on the left were matched and subsequently marked as IT-intensive."
