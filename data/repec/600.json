        "Grossman (1973) uses data on spending patterns of employed and unemployed individuals to infer that the unemployed substitute time for goods in producing commodities. His results can also be used outside Becker&apos;s framework to infer that the unemployed consume disproportionate amounts of commodities that are relatively time intensive.",
        "The exact problem is encountered by Nicholson (1977) and Houthakker and Taylor (1970).",
        "In Hamermesh (1980, Chapter 3) we do examine this model using a data set for which a permanent income measure can be constructed. The results are very similar to those presented here, though they are less robust because of the paucity of observations for which U&gt;0. Indeed, the CES is the only data set that contains large numbers of UI recipient households, separate data on income by source, and complete, detailed information on spending by commodity.",
        "Taylor (1971), the only available study to consider the effects of different income sources on aggregate savings or consumption, finds that transfer income is saved more than earned income, exactly opposite our findings on UI benefits. Taylor has no ready explanation for what he views as an anomaly, and, in any event, UI benefits are a relatively small part of the transfer income included in his study.",
        "The Box-Jenkins estimation was performed using the program written by David Pack at the University of Wisconsin and Ohio State University and distributed by the Ohio State University. The filter for UI is: log u = 1.5592 log U , - .5592 log U ; X2(19) = 11.60, (.0856) t_/ and that for Y is: log Y = .008096 + 1.11836 log Y - .11836 log Y \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u00be ; x^18) = 14.58. (.00137) t_i (.10125) (Standard errors are listed in parentheses.) -32-",
        "Baily (1977) justifies UI benefits in the context of optimal resource allocation by considering the program as an insurance mechanism that pools the risks of unemployment with its concomitant reduction in income. Flemming (1978) does consider how UI overcomes liquidity constraints, but only in the context of deriving an optimal replacement rate for the typical individual. Since UI benefits are not taxed, subtracting them from disposable personal income does not induce errors in the data.",
        "Becker (1961) analyzed the behavior of households surveyed by the Department of Labor in the studies of the 1950s. Recently, Burgess and Kingston (1978) have conducted a major benefit adequacy study using econometric techniques.",
        "A dozen studies completed through 1976 are summarized in Hamermesh (1977, Chapter 3), and at least a half dozen more have been completed since then. Only Brechling (1978), Feldstein (1978) and Halpin (1979) have examined how UI changes employment at the micro level, but a number of studies have considered its effects on macroeconomic stabilization (see Hamermesh, 1977, Chapter 4).",
        "Roosevelt&apos;s message was sent June 8, 1934. The original bill, 74th Congress, 1st Session, H.R. 4142, was submitted by Representative Lewis on January 17, 1935.",
        "The NAM&apos;s statement is Unemployment Compensation in a Free Economy, New York, National Association of Manufacturers, July 1952; that of the AFL is from Social Security Bulletins, No. 4, Washington, AFL, 1943."
