        "The PVS follows the typical steps in record linkage: preprocessing, sorting into blocks, identifying potential matches, and resolving multiple matches. Person records are preprocessed to standardize the blocking and matching fields to ensure comparability across the census file and the reference file. Next, because the reference file is large, PVS sorts the input and reference files into blocks to create reasonably sized search spaces (Michelson and Knoblock, 2006). The PVS creates the Cartesian product of the census and reference records falling within the same block, comparing every census record to every reference record falling within the same block.",
        "The PVS then scores the similarity between the census and reference records in this comparison space. 20 The average number of transactions per SSN is 2.1 (Harris, 2014).",
        "The Census Applications Branch (CAB) within CARRA processed the 2000 Census and the 2001-2013 American Community Surveys (ACS) through the PVS. CAB assigned PIKs to these files using full name (first, last, and middle), full date of birth (month, day, and year), and street address. To assign PIKs to the 1940 Census and the 1973-1990 Current Population Surveys (CPS) Annual Social and Economic Supplements (ASEC), we modified the PVS to assign PIKs tailored to the information available on each file.",
        "The 1940 Census contains PII that is not traditionally used to assign PIKs. We adapted the Census Bureau\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s matching software to use state or country of birth, location in 1940 and 1935, and parents\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 names in addition to more traditional PII such as first name, middle initial, last name, and age. To incorporate place of birth, we coded birthplace in the Numident to match the five-digit IPUMS birthplace (BPL) codes in the 1940 Census, accounting for both territories and changes in country names over time. To match on age, we calculated age on April 1, 1940 using full date of birth in the reference file and compared this to reported age in the 1940 Census.",
        "We used six customized modules to PIK the 1940 Census. The first module blocked on the first three digits of the IPUMS BPL code. The second module blocked on age on April 1, 1940.",
        "The third module blocked on the first letter of first and last name. The fourth and fifth modules compared location in 1940 and 1935 observed from the 1940 Census to states where records received their SSN in the reference file. For these modules, we used the first three digits of the SSN (called the area number) to determine location of SSN issue in the reference file and allowed no more than 2 years difference between age in 1940 or 1935 and the age a person acquired their SSN. The final module blocks on county observed in 1940 and 1935 to state and county of birth observed in the reference file. We only processed person-records less than 2 years old in 1940 or 1935 through this module to ensure we did not introduce significant bias from migration. Within each module, potential matches were scored based on the similarity of first name, middle initial, last name, age, five-digit state or country of birth BPL code, and parents\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 first name.",
        "We used probabilistic matching techniques to link the 1940 Census back to the 1910 and 1920 censuses to obtain education for the Great-Grandparent generation. We used the 1920 Census in addition to the 1910 Census to reduce bias introduced by requiring survival of the GreatGrandparent generation to 1940. To link 1910 and 1920 to 1940, we used first name, middle initial (if available), last name, age, sex, and state or country of birth. We employed two blocking strategies, first blocking on place of birth then blocking on the first letter of the first and last name. We allowed a tolerance of three years in age between a 1910 or 1920 observation and a potential match in the 1940 Census. Once the probabilistic matching algorithm identified and scored all potential matches, we used only the highest-scoring, unique match.",
        "When the initial match between 1910/1920 and 1940 was complete, we appended education data from the 1940 census to adults in the 1910 and 1920 censuses. We then used the relationship-to-household-head variable to construct family units and identify children. These children were linked forward to the 1940 Census. To account for name-changes of women, we appended mother\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s maiden names from the Numident to children in the 1940 Census using the PIKs discussed previously. Once we knew a child\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s mother\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s maiden name, we appended the maiden names to mothers observed in 1940 to link backwards to 1910 and 1920.",
        "To fill in the gap between 1940 and 2000, we produced PIKed versions of the 1973, 1979, and the 1981-1990 CPS. We employed multiple techniques to PIK this data. For 1973, 1979, and 1981-1985 data, we used probabilistic matching techniques to assign PIKs using SSN, first name, middle initial, last name, age (or full date of birth if available), and sex. We observed SSN for a large number of observations over the age of 15. For children, we also used parents\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 first names in the PIKing algorithm. We used two blocking procedures: one blocking on age and one blocking on first and last name initials.",
        "The 1986-1990 CPS did not contain first or last name. To PIK this data, we merged the CPS to the Numident using SSN. If sex and age agreed, we assigned the PIK associated with that SSN. We were able to PIK 99.5 percent of the 248,670 respondents who provided a SSN (out of 386,630 total respondents). Because we do not observe SSN for children under the age of 15, we took additional steps to increase the number of parent-child associations possible from the CPS.",
        "After PIKing adults who provided an SSN, we used the PIKs to append first and last name from the Numident to the 1986-1990 CPS. We then took these appended these names to observations of their children, allowing us to PIK children using age, sex, and parents\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 first and last names.",
