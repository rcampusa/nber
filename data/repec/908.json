Who Does R&D and Who Patents? FOOTNOTES +",
        "This is a revision of an earlier draft of this paper which was presented at the NEER Conference on R&D, Patents, and Productivity in Lenox, Massachusetts, October 1981. That version contained preliminary results on patenting in the Drug and Computer industries which have been replaced in this revision by a section on patenting in all manufacturing industries. * This work has been supported by the NBER Productivity and Technical Change Studies Program and NSF grants PR79\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d13740 and SOC 79\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d04279. We are indebted to Sumanth Addanki and Elizabeth Stromberg for research assistance. The research reported here is part of the NBER's research program in Productivity. Any opinions expressed are those of the authors and not those of the National Bureau of Economic Research.",
        "1. This limitation is primarily for convenience; about 97% of company\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d sponsored R&D was performed in the manufacturing sector in 1976 (NSF, 1978). It does, however, exclude a few large performers of R&D in the communications and computer service industries. 2. The vast majority of patents are owned by principal companies. In our earlier sample about ten percent of total patents were accounted for by patents of subsidiaries.",
        "3. The not significant code is a 1977 Compustat innovation which appears in 1976 data only for the Full Coverage tape companies. 4. Or, more recently not significant. See previous note. 5. Also included in missing, are companies that reported R&D but Compustat concluded that their definition of R&D did not conform.",
        "6. This comparison of the definitions in the two surveys is drawn from a letter detailing the differences from Milton Eisen, Chief, Industry Division, Bureau of the Census, to Hr. William L. Stewart, R&D Economic Studies Section, Division of Science Resources Studies, National Science Foundation, in April 1978.",
        "7. Leamer (1978) suggests using critical values for this F\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dtest based on Bayesian analysis with a diffuse prior as a solution to the old problem of almost certain rejection of the null hypothesis with a sufficiently large sample. Using his formula (page 114), the 5% level for this F\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dtest is 7.8, implying that we would accept the hypothesis of equal slopes in this data. 8. Average sales for reporting firms is $620 million, for non\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dreporting firms, $240 million.",
        "9. Scherer (1981), using data on 443 large industrial corporations comprising 59 percent of corporate patenting activity in the U.S., found an R&D cost per patent of $588,000 for the period June 1976 through March 1977 (adjusted to (annual basis). 10. We also looked at this question for two different size classes of firms: above and below 100 million dollars in gross plant. We found that the smaller firms had a lower R&D coefficient (.26 in contrast to .36) and slightly less curvature. For these firms, the industry dummies were completely insignificant, whereas they remained at about the same level for the large firms."
