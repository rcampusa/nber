        "The PISA Index of Economic, Social, and Cultural Status (ESCS) Across the different PISA waves, the OECD provides a measure of socio-economic status called the PISA Index of Economic, Social, and Cultural Status (ESCS). The ESCS, according to the PISA 2015 Technical Report, is \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093a composite score built by the indicators parental education (pared), prestige of the occupation of the parent with the highest occupational ranking (hisei), and home possessions (homepos) including books in the home via principal component analysis (PCA)\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6. The rationale for using these three components was that socio-economic status has usually been seen as based on education, occupational status and income. As no direct income measure has been available from the PISA data, the existence of household items has been used as a proxy for family wealth\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d (OECD (2017b)).",
        "Home possessions. To create ESCS, the OECD uses an index of home possessions (homepos) which is \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093a summary index of all household and possessions items\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d (OECD (2017b)).",
        "In TIMSS, it is twenty in the two waves of the 1990s and between eleven and thirteen in the subsequent four waves. In PISA, it is 38 in 2000, 28 in 2003, and between 44 and 46 in the 35 Because some home possessions variables are missing for some students, we also considered computing homepos as a ratio of owned items to known items. In this case, homepos would be the sum of items possessed divided by the number of non-missing items. We did not make this adjustment, as it had a slightly lower correlation with the ESCS index. A4 subsequent four waves (all reported numbers refer to the sum of possible item counts across the dichotomous and categorical questions; see Appendix Table A4 for examples).36 Construction of the index. Using homepos and hisced, we simply follow the ESCS construction process of performing PCA and assigning each student the first principal component as a composite score.",
        "The correlation between the SES index and reported family income is displayed in Appendix Table A6. The two variables are strongly but not perfectly correlated. Interestingly enough, at 0.66 the SES index is more highly correlated with the average of the annual earnings estimates obtained in 1987 and 1991 than with either of the annual estimates, suggesting that the average is a better measure of permanent income, a concept similar to socio-economic status.37 37 Using 2002 ELS data, where family income is available only on the base year survey (2001 income), the correlation between the SES index and reported income is 0.503.",
        "A6 Appendix B: Comparison with Reardon (2011b) Our results differ from those reported by Reardon (2011b), who finds rapidly growing SES gaps when SES is measured with parental income indicators. In this Appendix, we reconcile our findings with his by showing that the difference in results is due to systematic measurement errors in his analysis. When a trend line is estimated from the studies in his analysis less prone to measurement error, no upward trend in the SES-achievement gap is detected.",
        "He uses a quadratic equation to estimate the trend for these SES-achievement gaps by subject over the entire time period and a linear equation to estimate the trend between 1974 and 2001. He finds that the \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093achievement gaps [between those at the 90th and the 10th percentiles of the income distribution] among children born in 2001 are roughly 75 percent larger than the estimated gaps among children born in the early 1940s\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d (p. 95).",
        "Reardon (2011b) himself expresses concern \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093that the trend in the estimated gaps for the earliest cohorts, those born before 1970, is not as accurately estimated as the later trend. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6 Family income was reported by students rather than by a parent \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6 [and they] are school-based samples of students in high school [that] exclude dropouts, who are disproportionately lowincome and low-achieving\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d (pp. 95-96). He is more confident that the trend has shifted upward for cohorts born between 1970 and 2001. Between 1974 and 2001, \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093the income achievement 38 Issues related to extrapolating the observed SES percentiles are discussed in Appendix C and present an additional component of measurement error.",
        "A7 gap has grown by roughly 40 to 50 percent \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6, a very sizeable increase\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d (p. 97). Elsewhere, he describes this increase as \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093roughly 30 to 40 percent\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d (p. 93). Unfortunately, his analysis does not reflect the overall impact of the data problems, many of which he himself identifies in an appendix (Reardon (2011a)). There are two strands of evidence indicating that the perceived trends are not real but instead are a function of measurement error. First, in a significant portion of constructed gaps household income is very poorly measured; in another portion the test instruments themselves are quite suspect; and in a final set survey sampling and missing data become serious issues. When surveys at high risk of serious measurement error are excluded, no upward trend in the incomeachievement gap is observed. Second, comparisons of gap differences among psychometrically matched observations that cover the relevant period of supposed steep gap increases reveal no upward trend.",
        "Six of his twelve surveys are plagued with serious problems and clearly do not meet current scientific quality standards. Importantly, these surveys introduce systematic measurement error into the subsequent trend estimation based upon them. From the information provided in A8 Reardon (2011a, 2011b) and the online descriptions, these surveys do not provide reliable data points but nonetheless have a decided influence on the shape of the estimated trend line.",
        "Project Talent Talent, the earliest survey, provides estimated gaps for four cohorts born in 1942-1945. It uses student-provided estimates of family income, employing five income categories.39 While there are questions about the sampling in the Talent survey, the largest concerns relate to nonresponse rates to the question concerning family income. No less than 54 percent of the freshmen, 50 percent of the sophomores, 45 percent of the juniors, and 39 percent of the seniors chose not to \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093guess\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dthe word used in the survey\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dthe answer to the family income question. For the early Talent cohorts born in the early forties, Reardon reports income-achievement gaps in reading and math of approximately 0.75 s.d. Only Prospect, which has its own measurement problem (see below), reports gaps of a similarly low magnitude.",
        "National Longitudinal Study of 1972 (NLS) The National Longitudinal Study of 1972 was an early survey conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics. It was designed to follow a sample of high-school seniors of the Class of 1972 into the labor market and college. Like Talent, its parental-income measure came from sampling the students, who place estimated income into one of ten categories.40 Twentyone percent of the respondents chose not to respond to this question.",
        "A10 Prospects estimates are much lower than the 1.3 s.d. gap obtained from NLSY97 administered at about the same time. In other words, estimates for the income-achievement gap for cohorts born within a couple of years of 1980 vary by no less than 0.6 s.d. Measurement error is the most likely explanation for this spread in estimates made at close to the same time.",
        "National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) Add Health contains no math achievement data, but the study contributes over a third of the post-1970 data points used by Reardon to estimate the trend in the reading gap. The observations cover students at the ages of 13 through 18 born between 1978 and 1983. The survey has been used for a wide variety of studies, but grades and GPA are the primary school outcome measures. As Rees and Sabia (2010) note, \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093the Adolescent Health study did not administer formal achievement tests such as are available in the National Education Longitudinal Survey of 1988.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d Instead, it contains the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT), a commonly used test of receptive vocabulary. It is described on the NLSY79 website (which used this test along with reading and math achievement assessments) as follows: \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093The PPVT-R [an updated version of the original] consists of 175 stimulus words and 175 corresponding image plates.",
        "Each image plate contains 4 black-and-white drawings, one of which best represents the meaning of the corresponding stimulus word. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6 Starting in 1998, the administration of the PPVT-R was largely limited to 4- and 5-year-old children\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d.44 Reardon makes use of the results of Add Health\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s PPVT scores for six of the 17 observations used to estimate the growth in the reading gap for cohorts born between 1974 and 2001. But PPVT asks respondents to point at a picture when told a word. No reading is involved.",
        "Add Health provides low estimates of the income-achievement gap in reading for students born between 1978 and 1983 when that gap is alleged to be much lower than in later years.",
        "Those lower estimations could easily be due to serious measurement error driven by a test of reading skills that does not require the student to read. 44 https://www.nlsinfo.org/content/cohorts/nlsy79-children/topical-guide/assessments/peabody-picturevocabulary -test-revised [accessed January 15, 2020]. A11 Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD) Although Reardon says his surveys are nationally representative, SECCYD is not.",
        "According to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (2018), the study recruited ten hospitals willing to participate as recruiting grounds for mothers willing and available to participate in a multi-year study. The sample description explicitly says its \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093data are not representative in the statistical sense, and therefore inference to the nation as a whole is not possible. Comparisons to other databases, national or otherwise, should be made with extreme caution.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d45 The website for SECCYD identifies use of the Woodcock-Johnson Tests, which are designed to be IQ tests. It is not clear how these might translate into the reading or math achievement tests found in the other surveys. In any event, the survey does not meet the criterion of being nationally representative.",
        "Trends in the SES-Achievement Gap from High-quality Surveys in Reardon (2011b) With reliance on SES-achievement gap data constructed from different birth cohorts found in large-scale surveys, it is natural to want to include as many different survey data sets as possible. As delineated above, however, six of Reardon\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s choices do not meet current scientific quality standards. The three early surveys rely upon student reports of household income (Talent, NLS, and HS&B); three later surveys lack reliable test information and/or pertain to non-representative samples (Prospects, Add Health, and SECCYD). These error-prone data points yield gap estimates that are biased downward. Since they tend to relate to early birth cohorts, they distort the trends that are estimated when combined with higher-quality data available later.",
        "We estimate a revised trend line using Reardon\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s data that restricts observations of gaps to the high-quality surveys in Reardon (2011b). These cover the birth cohorts 1961-2001 (NLSY79 [two cohorts], NELS, NLSY97 [three cohorts], ELS, ECLS-K, and ECLS-B). We supplement these limited observations with an additional observation added from Reardon and Portilla (2016) who update the SES-achievement gap analysis to include the ECLS-K2010.46 (The 45 https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/DSDR/studies/21940/versions/V6/summary [accessed 2/1/2020]. 46 While the three ECLS data sets are included among the high-quality surveys, their outcome data are tests of kindergarten readiness in math and reading. Reardon and Portilla (2016), who specifically analyze trends in these A12 ECLS-K2010 observation became available subsequent to the publication of Reardon (2011b) and extends the birth cohorts available to 2005).",
        "Appendix Figure A1 replicates the Reardon analysis of estimated 90-10 incomeachievement gaps in math and reading for the birth cohorts 1961-2005 using only the highquality surveys.47 All of these data come from well-regarded, nationally representative surveys that obtained income information from parents rather than students. One striking fact emerges from this figure: Simple linear regressions that estimate trends in math and reading from the ten observations taken from these surveys show perfectly flat trends with no significant change in the income-achievement gap over this time period.",
        "Trends from Two Sets of Psychometrically Linked Surveys One concern with the overall approach in Reardon (2011b) is that it compares test score gaps (measured in standard deviations) across a large number of structurally different tests. This kind of comparisons of trends across tests can give incorrect inferences even about the direction of change (Ho (2009); Holland (2002)). The problems of such comparisons are particularly severe when the tests have different designs and scales.",
        "It is possible to use two subsets of Reardon\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s data to investigate the potential impact of testing artifacts on the trend results. The first set of surveys relying on the same testing, NLSY79 and NLSY97, was administered to cohorts born as early as 1961 and as recently as 1981, a twenty-year interval.48 The second set, ECLS-K, ECLS-B, and ECLS-K2010, provides information on income and achievement for cohorts born as early as 1993 and as late as 2005, a twelve-year interval. Together, these two sets of studies overlap nearly half (28 of 59 years) of the entire time span covered by Reardon (2011b) and over half (15 of 26 years) of the period between 1974 and 2001 when Reardon is more confident of the accuracy of estimated gap growth, identified as at least \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u009330 to 40 percent\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d.",
        "If the income gap had truly increased, it should be evident in these two intertemporally linked surveys. But, at roughly 1.3 s.d., the average income-achievement gap in math and data, argue that these SES-achievement gaps are comparable to those for later ages in the other surveys because gaps do not change much over the school years. 47 The point estimates are estimated from observation of the points displayed in Reardon (2011b), Figures 5.1 and 5.2. Reardon and Portilla (2016) provide estimated gaps from the three ECLS surveys. 48 Household income is measured in the same way in the two surveys, and the non-response rate for NLSY97 is 3 percent, about the same as the 2 percent for NLSY79.",
        "A13 reading estimated by NLSY97 is no different from the one observed twenty years earlier. Over the twelve years between the administration of ECLS-K and ECLS-K2010, the 90-10 math achievement gap, as reported by Reardon and Portilla (2016), declines by 0.13 s.d. and the gap for reading drops by 0.21 s.d.49 Neither set of observations reveals any increase in the income-achievement gap. Reardon (2011b) concedes that \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093the income achievement gap as measured in the NLSY97 cohort is virtually identical to the gap in the NLSY79 cohort, born twenty years earlier\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d (p. 96). But, he says, \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093the NLSY cohort was born in the early 1980s, just as the trend\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d upward is about \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093to begin\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d once more. This survey was administered too soon to discern \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093a rising gap among the 1980s and 1990s cohorts.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d The ECLS data, analyzed in Reardon and Portilla (2016), removes uncertainty about whether or not the NLSY comparison was simply due to observations outside the relevant range.",
        "An alternative approach, applied by Reardon (2011b), Chmielewski and Reardon (2016), and Chmielewski (2019) (see section 2.2), is to extrapolate achievement from the observed range to points farther in the tail of the distribution. It is just the shape of the SES-achievement relationship in the tails of the SES distribution that is the object of the overall analysis. We do not use this extrapolation approach because it necessarily involves making strong assumptions about the shape of the SES-achievement distribution that cannot be verified by the data.",
        "The inherent difficulties with this extrapolation can be illustrated with our SES-achievement data. Figure 8 in the text shows the SES histogram for Main-NAEP in 1990, incorporating student data on parental education and home-possession items. The top panel of Appendix Figure A10 presents this SES distribution in terms of the achievement distribution corresponding to the SES percentiles that are observed. The bars in the figure indicate the percentile ranges of the SES distribution covered by the categorical elements of the SES distribution along with the average achievement in the category. For example, the highest SES category identified in the data covers the top 26.5 percent of the distribution and has an average achievement of 278 scale points.",
