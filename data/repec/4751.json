        "A Presidential veto might have been avoided by attaching an amendment providingprotection for the textile industry to a bill the President would not want to lose. But the industrywas not able to achieve this, e.g., in 1955 losing by two votes in an attempt to add to the foreign aid bill an amendment that would have imposed quotas on textile imports.",
        "The two-price cotton problem was not resolved until April 1964 when President Lyndon B. Johnson signed a bill that established a payment-in-kind program that made cotton available to manufacturers inside the United States at the world price.",
        "In addition, the VER is consistent with the \"property rights\" implicit in the GAiT. The basic element in the GAiTis an exchange of concessions, anexchange between countries of the right to access to each other&apos;s market. If a country wants to take back some of the access it has thus \"sold,\" -- impose a new import restriction \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d it owes compensation to the trading parties that \"own\" that concession. Ifcompensationis not made, trading parties have the right to retaliate, i.e., take back an equal amount of the market access that they had \"paid\" to the offending country. GAIT provides separate processes to decide offense, compensation and retaliation. A VER considers all of the rights in one negotiation and thus provides for efficient trade-offs. This view is elaborated in Finger, 1984.",

        "No restriction was the Administration&apos;s preferred outcome, negotiated restrictions its failback position. The following statement by Secretary of State John Foster Duties is characteristic of the liberal, foreign policyview of trade policy that dominated Administration thinking: \"The United States does not have a single mport quota on manufactured products, and to restrict trade at a time when the free world must depend on the expansion of trade for so much of its strength would severely weaken the United States and the free world.\" (Quoted by Bauge, (p. 128) from U.S. Department of State, Department of State Bulletin, vol. 31, no. 861, December 26. 1955, p. 105.] Dulles added that he would prefer to see domestic industry protected by voluntary action of the exporting nations."
