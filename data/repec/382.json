        "Separate studies by the authors of this paper (Bruno, 1979, and Sachs, 1978) have dealt with aspects of these relationships in other OECD countries. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2 For example, the United States may be characterized by nominal wage rigidity and may therefore be more output\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dresponsive to monetary policy.",
        "During the 1974-75 recession there was clearly a combination of a supply shock with a concomitant demand contraction coining from the cumulative income reduction in all OECD countries. This was compounded by a fall in investment and in some countries (notably the United States) + -13- + by domestic fiscal and monetary restraint as well. For this reason it is easy to fall into the trap of attributing all of the unemployment to a wore conventional demand contraction combined with downward price rigidity. As pointed out by Malinvaud (1977), until recently the experience of the industrial countries has been confined to alternations between situations of Keynesian unemployment or inflation. The developments of 1973-75 mark a departure from this pattern.",
        "The three kinds of shift discussed here (import price shock, exchange rate adjustments and demand contraction) go quite a long way in explaining both the deep recession of 1974-75 and the intercountry differences in rates of inflation. But before turning back to these let us consider the + -15- + implications for the labour market, which in many ways mirrors the effects already considered in the commodity market.",
        "Figure 4 traces the main average developments for six major OECD countries, excluding the United States2&apos; (Canada, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom). As is well known, the poj.nts followed what looked like a reasonably well-behaved Phillips curve in the 1960s; the plot starts curving back in 1969, with a fairly flat upward drift in both inflation and output deviation. From 1972-73 on one obtains the perverse bell-shaped curve, which is familiar from the experience of so many countries.22 21 The U.S. data, taken by themselves, also.show a very similar general -",

Capacity estimates are based on Artus (1977). 22 A diagram of exactly this kind,averaging the figures of seven major cOuntries, as well as individual country pictures appeared in the McCracken Report (OECD, 1977). It is worth noting that the Report had the figure drawn only up to 1976, with an arrow (and a question mark) pointing in a clear southwest direction signifying the hoped-for move towards price stability and full employment. Subsequent developments in 1977 and 1978 have not exactly fulfilled that promise. 2 0 I.--J z 0 w I I I Figure 4.

        "In this part of the paper we discuss the empirical relevance of the same model. First, the model&apos;s parameter values are selected to describe a &apos;representative&apos; OECD economy. The response of this economy to a doubling of oil prices is studied under a variety of assumptions about labour market dynamics. A second economy is then added and we illustrate how multi-country interactions affect our numerical estimates. Throughout this section, we also appeal to the country data to support the general structure of the simulation model (for further empirical results, see Saclis, 1979).",
        "The simulations convey a clear message: fuel inputs are sufficiently important in production, and the 1973 oil pricE rise was of such magnitude that a large part of the 1974-75 recession is directly attributable to the change in the relative of oil. While monetary policy was contractionary in most countries in 1974, the simulations suggest that even with accommodative policy the 1974-75 recession would have been severe, with significant classical unemployment.",
        "To the extent that wages are indexed, so that real wages adjust slowly while nominal wages are flexible, monetary adjustments lead only to compensating price movements, without affecting real output. Indeed, if real rather than nominal wages are rigid, a sustained period of unemployment might be necessary to restore equilibrium wage levels after a. supply disturbance (see also Bruno, 1978).",
        "Many writers have speculated as to whethr actual wage processes are more accurately described by wages following past wages (wage-wage process) or current price expectations (wage-price process). The wage-wage process corresponds to nornina7 rigidity in that the real wage can be affected by anticipated monetary policy. We speculate that the wage-wage process results in large part frbm the existence of overlapping long-term contracts in the labour market.43 Until the mid-1970s, aggregate real wage growth was so constant that the two hypotheses could not be econometrically distinguished.",
        "The increased variability in real wages since 1973 allows a partial answer tO the question. Indeed, the evidence suggests that different, countries have significantly different degrees of nominal rigidity.",

However, the estimated coefficients of (p - p) are throughout implausibly high compare them with the 0.08 coefficient in (9)]. Capital-energy complementarity could in part account for the large coefficient. We suspect also that p - p is, to sonic extent, proxying for an aggregate demand variable that might appear in an investment equation in addition to the profit variable. That is, the coefficient of p - p also reflects the effect on I of the 1974-75 world recession. Finally, n - p might proxy for long-run expectations of profitability, affecting I through stock-market prices.",

        "As a final long-run issue with short-term nolicy implications one should mention a development which has become important in the 1970s. We have in mind the internal structural implications for. the highly industrialized economies of the rapid growth of manufacturing exports by semi-industrialized LDCs. These have been completely ignored in the present paper although for. some OECD countries, this is gradually becoming a major issue. In at least one respect, however, the analysis of this quesion would fall quite naturally into the general approach that we would like to advocate.
