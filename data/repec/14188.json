        "Weeks Worked in a Year: For the censuses 1960 and 1970 the variable used to define weeks worked in the last year is WKSWORK2, which defines weeks worked in intervals. We choose the median value for each interval so that we impute to individuals weeks worked in the previous year according to the following criteria: 6.5 weeks if wkswonk2=1; 20 weeks if wkswonk2=2; 33 weeks if wkswonk2=3; 43.5 weeks if wkswonk2=4; 48.5 weeks if wkswonk2=S; 51 weeks if wkswonk2==6. For the censuses 1980, 1990, 2000 and ACS we use the variable wkswonkl which records the exact number of weeks worked last year.",
        "Immigration Status: In each year, only people who are not citizens on who were naturalized citizens are counted as immigrants. This is done using the variable CITIZEN and by attributing the status of foreign-bonn to people when the variable is equal to 2 on 3. In 1960, the variable is not available and the selection is done using the variable BPLD (birthplace, detailed) and attributing the status of foreign-bonn to all of those for which BPLD>1S000, except for the codes 90011 and 90021 which indicate U.S. citizens born abroad.",
