The data comes from the baseline survey. This regression is then used to predict values for the missing values.",
        "Remittances to target household is the total amount sent by the migrant to the target household since January 1, 2012. This equals the number of regular remittances sent since January 1, 2012 multiplied by the average amount of each remittance, plus the total amounts reported to have been sent for special occasions in various categories since January 1, 2012. This figure does not include any funds that may have been sent as an EduRemesa.",
        "Online Appendix Table 14 reports the effect of the EduRemesa treatments on annualized target student education expenditure for 2013. Although the coefficients are imprecise, the pattern and magnitude of the results are similar to the results in Table 5 for expenditures in 2012, suggesting that the EduRemesa may have led families to maintain this higher level of expenditures even after the transfer ended. However, only two coefficients are statistically significantly different from zero at the 10% level (food expenditures for the 3:1 match and tuition expenditures for the 1:1 match) so very little should be interpreted from these results. It should also be noted that while the impact of the 3:1 match treatment on total target student expenditures is larger in magnitude for females than for males, this difference is much more subtle than in the results in Table 5, and again, neither coefficient is statistically significant.",
        "The impacts of the EduRemesa treatments on household education expenditures in 2013 are presented in Online Appendix Table 15. Again, the same very rough pattern of results from Table 6 is present, but the standard errors are even larger here than in the estimates presented in Online Appendix Table 14, and the coefficients are not stable across treatments and subsamples. Overall, the results on educational expenditures, both at the target student and household level, are somewhat suggestive of continued impacts, but due to lack of power no definitive conclusions can or should be drawn from the results. Given the lack of a first stage in these analyses, we do not repeat the instrumental variables regressions from Table 7 with the data from the second followup.",
