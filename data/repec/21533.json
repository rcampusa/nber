APPENDIX A A1. The 11 Anomalies Used to Construct the Mispricing Factors Below we detail the construction of the anomaly measures used to construct mispricing scores and form anomaly portfolios and mispricing factors. The anomaly measures are computed at the end of each month. We exclude stocks with share prices less than $5, primarily to avoid micro-structure effects, and we use ordinary common shares (CRSP codes 10 and 11). The anomaly portfolios are constructed using NYSE deciles as breakpoints.",
        "Following Fama and French(2008), we measure net issuance as the annual log change in split-adjusted shares outstanding. Split-adjusted share equal shares outstanding (Compustat annual item CSHO) times the adjustment factor(Compustat annual item ADJEX C). The most recent reporting year used is the one that ends (according to item DATADATE) at least four months before the end of month t \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u0086\u00e2\u0080\u0099 1. Stocks with negative net issues are assigned to decile 1 and those with zero net issues are assigned to decile 2. The remaining stocks are assigned to the remaining eight deciles using NYSE breakpoints.",
        "2. Composite Equity Issues: Daniel and Titman (2006) find that issuers underperform nonissuers using a measure they denote as composite equity issuance, defined as the growth in the firm\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s total market value of equity minus (i.e., not attributable to) the stock\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s rate of return. We compute this measure by subtracting the 12-month cumulative stock return from the 12-month growth in equity market capitalization. We lag the quantity four months, to make its timing more coincident with the above measure of net stock issues.",
        "3. Accruals: Sloan (1996) shows that firms with high accruals earn abnormally lower average returns than firms with low accruals, and he suggests that investors overestimate the persistence of the accrual component of earnings when forming earnings expectations. Following Sloan (1996), we measure total accruals as the annual change in noncash working capital minus depreciation and amortization expense (Compustat annual item DP), divided by average total assets (item AT) for the previous two fiscal years. Noncash working capital is computed as the change in current asset (item ACT) minus the change in cash and short-term investment (item CHE), minus the change in current liabilities (item DLC), plus the change in debt included in current liabilities (item LCT), plus the change in income taxes payable (item TXP). The most recent reporting year used is the one that ends (according to item DATADATE) at least four months before the end of month t \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u0086\u00e2\u0080\u0099 1.",
        "5. Asset Growth: Cooper, Gulen, and Schill (2008) find that companies that grow their total assets more earn lower subsequent returns. They suggest that this phenomenon is due to investors\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 initial overreaction to changes in future business prospects implied by asset expansions. Asset growth is measured as the growth rate of total assets in the previous fiscal year. Following that study, we measure asset growth as the most recent year-over-growth rate annual growth rate of total assets (Compustat annual item AT). The most recent reporting year used is the one that ends (according to item DATADATE) at least four months before the end of month t \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u0086\u00e2\u0080\u0099 1.",
        "Following Campbell, Hilscher, and Szilagyi (2008), we increase book equity by 10% of the difference between market equity and book equity. If the resulting value of book equity is negative, then book equity is set to $1. PRICE is the log of the share price, truncated above at $15. All explanatory variables except PRICE are winsorized above and below at the 5% level in the cross section. CRSP based variables, EXRETAVG, SIGMA, RSIZE and PRICE are for month t \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u0086\u00e2\u0080\u0099 1. NIQ is for the most recent quarter for which the reporting date provided by Compustat (item RDQ) precedes the end of month t \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u0086\u00e2\u0080\u0099 1, whereas the items requiring information from the balance sheet (LTQ, CHEQ and MB) are for the prior quarter.",
        "9. Momentum: The momentum effect, discovered by Jegadeesh and Titman (1993), is one of the most robust anomalies in asset pricing. It refers to the phenomenon whereby high (low) past recent recent returns forecast high (low) future returns. The momentum ranking at the end of month t-1 uses the cumulative returns from month t-12 to month t-2. This is the choice of ranking variable used by Carhart (1997) to construct the widely used momentum factor.",

In Panel A, two versions of the GRS test are reported. Data for the distress anomaly begin in October 1974, and data for the return-on-assets anomaly begin in November 1971. The other ten anomalies begin at the start of the sample period, which is from January 1967 through December 2013 (564 months). GRS10 tests whether the ten alphas for the full-sample anomalies equal zero, while GRS12 uses all 12 anomalies and begins the sample in October 1974. Panels B and C also report two versions of the GRS test: GRS51 uses 51 anomalies whose data are available by January 1967, while GRS72 use those anomalies plus 21 others whose data are available by February 1986.",
