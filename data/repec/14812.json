Staiger (2002), The Economics of the World Trading System, Cambridge, MA.: The MIT Press. 31We can show, for example, that the critical discount factor for the repeated game with transitory shocks is unaltered when the model is replicated to allow for K identical import goods and K identical export goods, where K = 1. A government is most tempted to cheat when it has the high type on all K goods at once. In any period, a government expects that its trading partner will have the high (low) type on nHK (nLK) goods. It is now easy to see that K cancels from the relevant off-schedule constraint.",
