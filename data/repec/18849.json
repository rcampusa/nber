        "C Steps to Clean Smog Check Data C.1 Smog Check Data California implemented its first inspection and maintenance program (the Smog Check Program) in 1984 in response to the 1977 Clean Air Act Amendments. The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments required states to implement an enhanced inspection and maintenance program in areas with serious to extreme non-attainment of ozone limits. Several of California \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s urban areas fell into this category, and in 1994, California\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s legislature passed a redesigned inspection program was passed by California\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s legislature after reaching a compromise with the EPA. The program was updated in 1997 to address consumer complaints, and fully implemented by 1998. Among other improvements, California\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s new program introduced a system of centralized \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093Test-Only\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d stations and an electronic transmission system for inspection reports.26 Today, more than a million smog checks take place each month.",
        "We construct these weights using the vehicle population estimates contained in CARB\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s EMFAC07 software, which are given by year, vehicle age, and truck status. Our population weight is the number of vehicles of a given age and truck status in a each year given by EMFAC07, divided by the number of such vehicle appearing in our sample. For instance, if EMFAC07 gave the number of 10-year-old trucks in 2005 as 500, while our data contained 50, each 10-year-old truck in our data would have a population weight of 10. Denote the population weight by Ptac, where t is year, a is age, and c is truck status.",
        "There is an additional extensive margin that we have not estimated in this paper: new car purchases. To ensure that the total vehicle population is accurate, we apply an ad hoc correction based on Busse et al. (forthcoming), who find that a $1 increase in gasoline prices would decrease new car sales by 650,000 per year. Because California\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s vehicle fleet makes up about 13 percent of the national total, we decrease the population of model years 1998 and later by 84,500 when constructing the population weight for the counterfactual.
