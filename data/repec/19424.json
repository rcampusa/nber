        "Online Appendix B: 1098-T Data and College Quality Index Quality of 1098-T Data. We evaluate whether the 1098-T data capture college enrollment accurately in three ways.48 First, we find that the correlation between enrollment counts for students age 18-21 based on 1098-T\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s and enrollment counts for colleges listed in the IPEDS dataset from the Department of Education exceeds 0.95. Second, the aggregate counts of students enrolled in college are aligned with estimates based on the CPS. In 2009, 27.4 million 1098-T forms were issued (Internal Revenue Service, 2010). According to the Current Population Survey (US Census Bureau, 2010, Tables V and VI), in October 2008, there were 22.6 million students in the U.S. (13.2 million full time, 5.4 million part-time, and 4 million vocational).",
        "We first evaluate the stability of rankings of college quality with respect to the age at which we measure earnings. Appendix Figure 1a plots the percentile ranking of colleges based on earnings measured at age 48Legally, colleges are not required to file 1098-T forms for students whose qualified tuition and related expenses are waived or paid entirely with scholarships or grants. However, the forms appear to be available even for such cases, perhaps because of automated reporting to the IRS by universities. 49Only current citizenship status is recorded in the database. As a result, the date at which we determine citizenship is simply the date we accessed the data.",
        "In Appendix Figure 1b, we extend this analysis to cover all ages from 23-32. This figure plots the rank correlation between college quality measured at age 32 with college quality measured using earnings at earlier ages. Each point shows the correlation of an earnings-based percentile ranking at a given age with the ranking based on earnings at age 32. The correlation is very low at age 23 and rises steeply at first before asymptoting to 1. At age 28 and after, the correlations are all above 0.95, implying that we obtain similar rankings irrespective of what age one uses to measure earnings of college graduates beyond this point. The stability of the index starting in the late 20\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s is consistent with evidence from other studies that annual earnings starting in the late 20\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s are quite highly correlated with lifetime earnings (Haider and Solon 2006).",
        "Panel C of Appendix Table 2 varies the cohort of students included in the measure, including students born between 1979 and 1981. We hold fixed the ages of college attendance and earnings measurement at 20 and 30, respectively. The measures are very highly correlated across cohorts, showing that the reliability of our index of college quality is quite high.",
        "In each case we hold fixed age in college at 20, age of earnings measurement at 30, and focus on the 1979 cohort. The correlation between these measures exceeds 0.94, showing that the rankings are not sensitive to the concept of income used to measure earnings. We view W-2 earnings as the preferred measure because it is unaffected by marriage and the endogeneity of filing.",
        "Based on these results, we construct our preferred measure of college quality measuring college attendance at age 20 and mean W-2 earnings at age 31. These choices allow us to combine data from two cohorts \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u009d students born in 1979 and 1980 \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u009d for whom we measure earnings in 2010 and 2011, respectively."
