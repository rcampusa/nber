        "The dependent variable is the net change in employment in the non-tradable sector (NAICS2= 44, 45 and 72) over the previous two years created in firms of each age category, and this variable is scaled by the total non-tradable employment in the CZ as of 2000. Income growth is the 2-year growth of total wages and salaries in the CZ. We instrument for this variable using the Bartik manufacturing shock, which interacts changes in nationwide employment in the manufacturing sector with the preexisting manufacturing composition in a CZ.",
        "This variable is scaled by the total non-tradable employment in the region (CZ in Panel A, MSA in Panels B and C) as of 2000. Income growth is the 2-year growth of total wages and salaries in the region (CZ in Panel A, MSA in Panels B and C). We instrument for this variable using the Bartik manufacturing shock, which interacts changes in nationwide employment in the manufacturing sector with the preexisting manufacturing composition in an area.",

Column (1) reports the first stage regression of income growth on the manufacturing employment instrument. Column (2) is the OLS regression of net employment change on local income growth, and column (3) is the 2SLS regression with instrumented income growth. Columns (4) to (11) perform similar regressions as columns (2) and (3) for firms of different ages.",
