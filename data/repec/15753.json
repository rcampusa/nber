A Appendix: expenditure weights Composition of the consumption baskets di\u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00ac\u00e2\u0082\u00acers across goods, countries, and time. At the same time, components of in\u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009aation are known to co-move strongly with aggregate in\u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009aation, suggesting that non-equal weighting should not a\u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00ac\u00e2\u0082\u00acect the behaviour of the RER. To explore the degree to which this may in\u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009auence our results we construct expenditure weights for each good, country, and year, using the local currency expenditures data provided by Eurostat. Speci\u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00ac\u00c2\u0081cally, for good i, country j and year t, we construct a weight \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b3i,j,t = expi,j,t \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u0086\u00e2\u0080\u0098M i expi,j,t where exp is the local currency expenditure. We then construct an expenditure-weighted PLI\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s for all countries using \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b3i,j,t, and plot them against the un-weighted PLI\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s in the \u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00ac\u00c2\u0081gures below.",

While there are di\u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00ac\u00e2\u0082\u00acerences between the two, these are small for most countries.
