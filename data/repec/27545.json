        "C.i Online Appendix C: Classification of Tracts as Enterprise Zones or Controls in the 2000s In this appendix, we detail our work to map enterprise zones to tracts from 2000 to 2010. We study state-level enterprise zones, for which rules and how areas are designated vary by state. As a consequence, different approaches were needed for different states. In some cases, it was possible to retrieve information of changes in the evolution zones boundaries over the entire period. In other states, the information available was available only for is only for one or two years. The states include in the original Ham et al. (2011) study were California, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, Virginia, and Wisconsin. We construct a database that includes all these states, except for Massachusetts and Wisconsin, for which we could not obtain any information on enterprise zone boundaries for this decade.",
        "The program expired in 2014. The information on the website does not allow the user to download data. Hence, we communicated with the Employment Development Department of California, and they give us access to the files used in the website. The files obtained were layers, not shapefiles. This means that the data did not contain geolocation codes or any other data; they were only pictures projected on a map. Hence, we had to redraw all the enterprise zones using these layers as a guide. The redrawing was useful because we created shapefiles that capture changes in boundaries over time. We used old maps from the enterprise zone program from the website: http://www.hcd.ca.gov/grants-funding/archive/enterprise-zone.shtml. With these maps, we were able to build a map database of California that includes changes of the enterprise zone boundaries on time.",
        "C.iii (a) Layer File (b) Shape File To illustrate an example, in the figure above we use the Los Angeles area as an example. The layer file is shown in panel (a), and in panel (b) we show the shapefile that we drew (green shadow). We use the layer as a guide to generate the shapefile, but we exclude all the areas that were designated after 2010. Panel (b) excludes part of the blue layers because these areas were designated after 2010. Once we redrew all the enterprise zones, we merged the information with Census tracts in California, and calculated what percentage of each tract overlaps with the enterprise zone each year (as explained in the previous section). In the case of California, we usually have two points in time, because the enterprise zone boundaries only change twice since the beginning of the program.",
        "Colorado This state only had shapefiles and maps from 2016. However, we communicated with Sonya Guram, director of the state enterprise zone program, and she told us that there were only two main changes in enterprise zone boundaries. One change occurred in 2000 and the other in 2016.",
        "Ms. Guram and her team provided us with the shapefiles updated in 2016 that reflected the new changes that year, and the shapefiles for just the \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093new areas\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d added in 2016. We identified the tracts that were active between 2000-2015 by subtracting the \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093new areas\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d added in 2016 to get the 2000-2015 maps from the updated 2016 areas.",
        "Florida Florida only had data starting from 2015. There are no old maps or any references on old enterprise zone boundaries or changes available. The state reports data in \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093FGDL\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d instead of standard shapefiles. (The FGDL is a type of file that the state of Florida uses to geolocate information in maps. It is very similar to a shapefile; this type of file will not open on ArcGIS.) However, we managed to find shapefiles online: http://mail.geoplan.ufl.edu/pipermail/fgdl-l/2015-September/000094.html.",
        "Most of the Florida enterprise zones were updated in 2010, but we do not know if the update included boundary changes or not. We calculate the area covered by the enterprise zone as discussed at the beginning of this document, but because we do not observe boundary changes over time, we cannot be certain the areas were constant between 2000-2010. Nonetheless, these are the best data available, and we have to assume no changes in this period.",
        "C.iv Hawaii In Hawaii, most of the enterprise zone boundaries were defined in 2000. We obtained a shapefile from 2015; we were not able to get other shapefiles to calculate changes in the boundaries. The significant enterprise zone area changes occurred in 2001. These changes were: Koolauloam became an enterprise zone, new zones were added to the urban Honolulu enterprise zone, and five of the six island zones being expanded. Other changes occurred in 2004, 2006, 2007 and 2008 and were relatively minor. This information is all provided at: http://files.hawaii.gov/dbedt/annuals/2015/2015-bdsd-ez.pdf.",
        "Nebraska Nebraska has data available from 1992 and 2015. We found data from 1992 online, and we got the 2015 enterprise zone data from Jacob Knutson, who is in charge of the Nebraska Department of Economic Development. Mr. Knutson told us there is no data available on boundaries prior to 2015.",
        "Hence, it was impossible to determine how the boundaries change from 1992 to 2015. Thus, we use both the 1992 dataset and the 2015 data to infer as much as possible about changes between 2000-2010. For instance, if an enterprise zone covered an area in both 1992 and 2015 (which we observe), then we can assume that the enterprise covered the area between 2000 and 2010.",
        "New York In New York, the program is called \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093Empire Zones.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d We found data that was updated in 2017.",
        "Most of the zones were effective between 2006 and 2007. The information from New York City was downloaded from this website: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Empire-Zones/3aim-ipk8. We found the rest of the state enterprise zone areas using Google search codes to find shapefiles related to the program. The link to the file is: http://www.nysgis.state.ny.us/gisdata/fileserver/?DSID=895&file=empirezone.zip.",
        "Ohio Erick Linder from the Development Services Agency of Ohio claimed that they did not have any shapefiles. He invited us to Columbus to take pictures of all the old paper maps in their archive. We C.v visited the Development Service Agency in Columbus, and we created a digital file of all the maps from 2000 to 2010.",
        "Once we were there, we had access to shapefiles updated in 2015 by Daniel Strasser from the Development Services Agency that were not available publicly. We use these 2015 shapefiles as a guide to redraw some of the maps (when needed), and we create a shapefile that contains all the changes in enterprise zone boundaries. We use this file to calculate the covered area by Census tract and year.",
        "We use this information to create a time series of the enterprise zones from 1998 to 2010. We merge the data with the Census tracts to calculate the covered areas. However, the database indicates that sometimes there were changes in the boundaries and we do not know the precise changes, but only what the boundaries were in 2010. We have data about which enterprise zone was designated in a specific year, but we do not know the changes in the boundaries that occur after that.",
        "The propensity score matched control tracts are the same controls used to produce the estimates in Table 2. For each dataset, we restrict the sample to tracts with non-missing information for all outcomes and non-zero population counts in 1980 and 1990 according to the NCDB.",
        "Unemployment taxes averaged $50-115 per employee per year during the 1990s. Weak Wisconsin 40% of wages for the first and second year of employment for targeted groups. 10% credit for non-targeted groups who were residents of the enterprise zone. Max credit of $6,000 per employee."
