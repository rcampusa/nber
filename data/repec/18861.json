        "In 1977, it was possible to publish provisional 1972-74 average food balance sheets for 162 developed and developing countries. For the first time, tables were included showing for all countries, continents, economic classes and regions and the world, long-term series of per caput food supplies in terms of calories, protein and fat by major food groups for the average period 1961-63 and individual years 1964 to 1974. The following issue included 1975-77 average food balance sheets for 164 countries, together with long-term series of per caput food supplies and tables showing the conversion ratios applied and the various assumptions made in arriving at the published figures. For the first time in this series, the table of per caput food supplies also showed, in addition to calories, protein and fat, the supply by food groups of selected minerals (iron, calcium) and vitamins (retinol, thiamine, riboflavine, niacine, ascorbic acid).",
        "Starting with the 1979-81 issue, three-year average food balance sheets were published in a standardized format; 146 countries were covered. The publication showing standardized food balance sheets for the average 1984-86 included, in addition to the food balance sheets for individual countries, tables showing long-term series of per caput supplies, by major food groups, in terms of product weight, calories, protein and fat. These tables were shown also for the world, developed and developing countries. The tables were based on information for more countries than those included in the publication, and covered almost 100 percent of the population in both developed and developing countries. The 1992-94 issue covered 175 countries and the 1994-96 issue about 180 countries.",
        "Food balance sheets were the main source of data used in the assessment and appraisal of the world food situation which FAO made for the pre-war period in its First World Food Survey (1946), for the early post-war period in the Second World Food Survey (1952), for the late 1950s in its Third World Food Survey (1963), for the early 1970s in its Fourth World Food Survey (1977), for the 1970s and 1980s in the Fifth World Food Survey (1985) and, covering the two decades from 1969-71 to 1990-92, in the Sixth World Food Survey (1996) . Food balance sheets also provided a major source of information for establishing the statistical base of FAO&apos;s Indicative World Plan for Agricultural Development, for which purpose 1961-63 average food balance sheets were prepared for all the 64 developing countries included in the study.",
