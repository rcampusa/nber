For 1871-1925, I use the returns including dividends to the valueweighted portfolio of NYSE stocks constructedby the Cowles Comaission[1939, op. 168-169), as corrected by Wilson and Jones[l987, p. 253, with erratum).",

(.000422) (.013594) predicts the level of the Cowles returns from the observed Macaulay returns, where standard errors are in parentheses under the coefficient estimates. This is essentiallyequivalent to adding a dividend yield of .56 percent per month (6.7 percent per year) to the percent changes in railroad stock prices. The correlationbetween the Ccwles and the Macaulay returns is .99 from 18711879.",
        "2. Common Stock Yields. 1871-1986 For 1926-1986, I use the dividend yield. D/P, on the S&P composite index (from Cicibaae[1978}fcc 1947-86 and from the Federal Reserve[1976b, Table 12.19, pp. 788-7903 for 1926-46). For 1871-1925. I use the yield expectations series from the Cowles Commission[l939,pp. 270-271], adjusted to splice with the 54? series in 1926 by multiplying the Cowles data by the ratio of the Cowlea Dip to the S&P DIP for 1926 \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d .928571.",
        "The earnings yield series, El?, for the 54? composite index is available monthly for 1954-1986 from Citibase[1978]. This series is available quarterly for 1935-1953 and annually for 1926-1934 in the Federal Reserve[l976b, Table 12.19, pp. 788-750]. To create a monthly series for 1926-1953, I use the regression of the growth rate of El? on the growth rate of DIP from 1954-1986. 81n(E/P) \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d .000148 + 1.017220 dln(D/P) + U (.001139) (.032186) t where standard errors are in parentheses under the coefficieot estimates. The correlation between these monthly growth rates is .85 over this period.",
        "The F/P ratios are interpolated forward from the beginning of the petiod using these ptedicted growth rates, and interpolatedbackward from the end of the period. The monthly F/P series used in the paper for 1926-1953 is an average of the forward and backward interpolations. For 1871-1925, I use the annual F/P ratio from the Cowles Commission] 1939, pp. 404-405] . This is spliced with the S&P series by multiplying the Cowles data by .914428, the ratio of the SiP to the Cowles t/P ratios for 1926. I assume that the payout ratio (0/F) is constant within the year, and equal to the ratio of D/P for December divided by F/P. Thus, for 1871-1934 the earnings yield numbers behave like the dividend yield series within each year.",
        "3. Short-term Inrerest Rates. 1857-1986 For 1926-1986, I use the monthly yields on the shortest term U.S. Government security (with no special tax previsions) which matures after the end of the month from the GovernmentBond File constructed by CRSP. For 18571925, I use the 4 to 6 month commercialpaper rates in New York from Macaulay]l938, Table 10, pp. A14l-Al6l]. The commercial paper yields are adjusted so the level of the series is comparableto the Treasury yields, using the regression of CRSP yields on Macaulay yields from 1926-1937, CRSPt \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d - .000761 + .9737368 Macaulay + (.000085) (.0309330) where standard errors are in parenthesesunder the coefficient estimates.",
        "This is equivalent to subtracting an average risk premium of .076 percent per month (.91 percent per year) from the Mscsulay yields to reflect a small default premium in commercial paper. The correlationbetween the CRSP and the Macaulay yields is .94 for 1926-1937.",
        "4. Lens-term Interest Rates. 1857-1986 The high-grade corporate bond yield for 1919-1986 is the Moody&apos;s Aa bond yield (Federal Reserve[l976a,Table 128, pp. 468-471] for 1919-40, Federal Rasarve[1976b, Table 12.12, pp. 720-721] for 1941-47, and Citibase]l978] for ii 1948-86). For 1857-1918, I use Macaulay&apos;s[1938,"
