        "Semiconductors Industry Association (1980) and Hatsopoulos (1983).",
        "For example, Hatsopoulos and Brooks (1986) and, especially, Hatsopoulos, Krugman, and Summers (1988).",
        "The three-way breakdown has been calculated by Friend and Tokutsu (1987), among others.",
        "The charts are borrowed from an uncirculated paper by Lawler, Loopesko and Dudey (1988). [Chart 1 may understate the Japanese real interest rate in the 1970s, both because the actual inflation rates that are used overstate expected inflation rates and because the government bond rates that are used were too low to be willingly absorbed by private investors.]",
        "Lawler, Loopesko and Dudey (1988, 26) show real interest rates on Japanese 1-year government bonds that have been below U.S. yields during virtually the entire 1965-1988 period. [This paper not ready for circulation.] Friend and Tokutsu find that the real cost of debt, weighted between short-term and long-term, was .80 per cent lower in Japan than the U.S. on average over the period 1962-1984 [1.70 lower over the period 1970-1984].",
        "The increase in the U.S. real interest differential from 1981 to mid-1984 is often credited with much of the explanation for the contemporaneous appreciation of the dollar. The differential vis-a-vis the real interest rate in Japan was no larger than visa-vis Germany and some other countries. But then the movement of the dollar against the yen was actually less than against the mark and other major European currencies (contrary to widespread impression), and actually peaked in 1982 rather than February 1985.",
        "One of many possible references on the capital inflow that resulted from the shift in the U.S. monetary/fiscal mix in the 1980s is Frankel (1988a). References on the forces behind the inflow from Japan in particular are given in Frankel (1988b).",
        ".58 according to French and Poterba, 1989, p.40 (average of first quarters of 1986, 1987 and 1988)? they use long-term government bond yields, minus previous year&apos;s inflation rate.",
        "On August 23, 1989, the nominal interest differential between the United States and Japan was 3.3 % for 10-year government bond yields, 3.5 % for one-year Eurocurrency rates, and 5.6 % for bank prime lending rates. A survey of forecasters conducted by Alan Teck on that day put the difference in expected inflation rates at 2.5 per cent for the 10-year horizon [4.75 % in the U.S., versus 2.25 % in Japan] and 2.6 % for the one-year horizon. I currency Forecasters&apos; Digest. White Plains, N.Y., Sept.1989.) The CPI inflation differential was 3.3 % in 1988 and 2.0 % in the first 5 months of 1989. [IMF data.]",
        "A similar point is made by French and Poterba (1989, p.19). However, they conclude that, while a lower real rate of interest in Japan might be able to explain the high level of Japanese stock prices on average during their sample period (the 1970s and 1980s), it cannot explain the Increase during the last three years, 1986-88.",
        "E.g., Abegglen (1985), Crum and Meerschwam (1987) or Meerschwam (1989).",
        "On the so-called recession cartels, see Yamamura (1982) and Meerschwam (1989, p.17).",
        "Other reasons have been given as well why a given corporate balance sheet that might spell excessive risk in the United States would not be as worrisome in Japan. For example, Abegglen (1985, 165) argues in this connection that a typical Japanese firm does not consolidate the financial assets held by its subsidiaries into its own balance sheet \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d where a corresponding U.S. firm might do so \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d and carries land and securities on its books at original cost. [But the fact that much of Japanese equity is held by other firms, so that the total amount of equity in Japan is not as large as appears on the books, seems like a reason why Japanese debt/equity ratios might be understated.] Some of these accounting questions are discussed under the heading of price/earnings ratios below.",
        "Since 1986, actually falling to half the U.S. level in an estimate for 1988 [according to French and Poterba (1989, p.8 and Table 4)].",
        "C.Baldwin computes a risk-return frontier for each country and finds little difference between the two; i.e., the level of expected return for any given level of risk is similar. Ando and Auerbach (1985) is based on a fairly small sample of firms (for the period 1966-1981). [In addition to their calculation of the average rates of return, they also look at earnings/price ratios, discussed below.]",
        "They found that the before-tax returns were 6.5 per cent in Japan, versus 12.3 per cent in the United States. [After-tax returns were 2.5 per cent versus 5.6 per cent.] The time period was 1967-83.",
        "Also this approach amounts to looking at the problem from the viewpoint of the market investor, rather than the firm. The two do not necessarily face the same cost of funds. Hodder (1988b) dissents from the Ando and Auerbach approach on these grounds. He save until later the argument that firms may have access to some funds that are cheaper than the expected rate of return on capital [that internal financing is cheaper than both the cost of debt and the cost of equity].",
        "Minimum dividend-payout rates were established in the early 1970s (Meerschwam, 1989).",
        "Lawler, Loopesko and Dudey (1988, 25) point out that the Japanese rate of growth of earnings per share need not be correlated with the rate of growth of the Japanese economy. On the other hand, dividends would appear to be one step further removed than are earnings, via the (difficult to determine) procedure whereby firms set their payout rates.",
        "There is a fourth possibility, that the equity premium (defined as the expected rate of return on equity minus the interest rate) is smaller for Japan, which would in theory require that the Japanese stock market be less risky than the American stock market. Ueda (1989, 12-13) argues that the risk premium in the Japanese stock market declined sharply between 1982 and 1988, but can find little evidence of a corresponding decline in riskiness. Lawler, Loopesko and Dudey (1988, 26-27) conclude that uncertainty in the two stock markets was roughly similar in the late 1980s (despite some possible differences in the past), whether estimated from the standard deviations of monthly changes or expected volatilities implicit in stock index options. [As already noted, studies such as Baldwin (1986) claim to find no sign that the expected rate of return on Japanese securities is lower, even for a given amount of risk.]",
        "Consistent with the findings of Shoven and Tachibanaki (1988) .",
        "They artificially boost the U.S. real interest rate for the 1970s up a bit, because it was in fact observed to be negative, which would wreak havoc with the methodology that they adopt to evaluate tax systems [from King and Fullerton.]",
        "The tax rate on undistributed profits during the period 1984 to 1987 was 43.3 per cent. (Homma, Maeda and Hashimoto, 1986, p.14., and Homma, 1987, p.21.) However, it had been lower in the 1950s and 1960s, ranging from 35 per cent to 40 per cent. (Homma et al. 1984, p.124, Table 2.39, and Shoven and Tachibanaki, 1988, Table 3.6.)",
        "When state and local taxes on corporations are added in, the Japanese rate is about 50 per cent and the U.S. rate about 40 per cent. These numbers are taken from Shoven (1988). [One of several motives for the Japanese tax reform is that the Ministry of Finance fears that, in the absence of international harmonization of corporate tax rates, business would increasingly be able to find ways to arbitrage across tax jurisdictions.]",
        "Recall the figures from French and Poterba that by 1988 the debt/equity ratio in Japan had fallen below that in the United States. Noguchi (1985, p. 9, 18) lists the fall in the debt/equity ratio is one of several reasons why the tax burden on Japanese investment increased in the late 1970s and early 1980s [though, like Ando and Auerbach, Noguchi thinks that the Japanese burden has been higher than the U.S. burden all along]. The most important of the reasons [as with Shoven] is the fall in the inflation rate.",
        "Takenaka (1986) concludes that the Impact of the investment tax credit on Japanese investment is negligible.",
        "In addition to the U.S. tax reform of 1986 [which rolled back investment incentives for U.S. firms], the Japanese tax reforms that took effect in April of 1988 and April of 1989 raised the tax rate on Japanese saving in a number of ways [besides changing the corporate tax system in a way that would evidently would leave Ando and Auerbach (1985) and Shoven in disagreement as to the sign of the effect on investment incentives]. The previously existing pro-saving bias in the Japanese tax system, compared to the American system, constituted part of the difference in tax wedges computed by Bernheim and Shoven (1986). It is discussed below, under the topic of determinants of the real interest rate in Japan.",
        "Hale (1989) opines that the dramatic reversal of the rankings of U.S. and Japanese capitalization over the course of the 1980s represents the financial market&apos;s negative judgment on Reaganomics, as compared to policy-making by bureaucrats in the Japanese Ministry of Finance. But when Murphy (1989) observes the same reversal, he worries that Japan&apos;s policy-makers are not ready to accept the responsibility of greater weight in the world.",
        "Ueda (1989, p.7), however, computes the ratio of the market value of corporate shares to the value of corporate assets and concludes that, according to this result land prices are not a major factor in the recent rise in stock prices.",
        "In 1984, the value of land in Japan was 3.17 times GNP, while in the U.S. it was only .80 times GNP. (Sachs and Boone, 1988.)",
        "About five times higher than London. Boone (1989, 47) estimates that the price of land in Tokyo is 150 times that in New York, despite little difference in rental rates on apartments and buildings.",
        "The price of land alone went up even more than the price of housing over this same period. [The price/rental ratio for land increased by 14 per cent between 1975 and 1986 (27 per cent in the three big cities).] The source is Iwata and Yoshida (1988, p. 510) .",
        "The Ministry of Finance began to look after the stability of the Japanese stock market after a crash in 1965. Takagi (1989) discusses the history and institutional features of the market.",
        "Lawler, Loopesko and Dudey (1988, 31-33) and Murphy (1989).",
        "And that the apparent implications for the real interest differential and international capital flows vis-a-vis the United States were greatly exacerbated by the U.S. fiscal expansion of the early 1980s.",
        "Indeed, Balassa and Noland (1988, p. 84) report that the Japanese corporate sector was in surplus in the years 1974-77, although others show only a declining deficit [where both financial and nonfinancial corporations are included; Lincoln, 1988, Table 3-2, pp.76-77],",
        "According to Blades (1988, p.18-19), adjusting for consumer durables in 1986 raises the U.S. household gross saving ratio from 11.5 % to 22.1 %, while only raising the Japanese ratio from 21.2% to 25.8 %. [When the saving ratios are averaged over 19701986, adjusting raises the U.S. ratio to 23.6 % and the Japanese ratio to 26.1%.] See also Balassa and Noland (1988, p.80-96). Takayama et al (1988) go so far as to say, on the basis of several accounting corrections, that the Japanese saving rate is not high at all.",
        "Over the next 30 years, Japan will go from having the highest ratio of working age population to elderly out of the G5 countries (5.9 in 1985) to the lowest (2.3 in 2020); Shoven (1989). A simulation by Auerbach, Kotlikoff, Hagemann and Nicolletti (1989, 117), based on the rapid ageing of the Japanese population, predicts that the national saving rate in Japan will decline from 22 per cent [close to Germany&apos;s], to a minimum of 1 per cent, over the period 1990 to 2028 [falling below the U.S. national saving rate in the year 2020].",
        "An additional possible explanation \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d not on standard lists -- for the high saving rate in Japan is that it is the only non-nuclear country of the G-5. Slemrod (1986) points out that a higher perceived threat of nuclear annihilation should reduce people&apos;s saving rate by reducing their expected horizons, and offers supporting evidence from U.S. time series.",
        "Horioka (1988, p.219) reports that Japanese families plan downpayment ratios of 45 to 55 per cent, but that actual downpayments are as low as 20 per cent. He argues that an increase in the availability of mortgage credit would not increase total saving, but would only result in a combination of lower pre-purchase saving [to make the downpayment] and higher post-purchase saving [to pay off the loan] (p.229).",
        "Arguing against the idea that Japanese are culturally predisposed to save more is the fact that the high saving rates are only a phenomenon of the post-war era [as pointed out by Hale (1987, p.26) and Balassa and Noland (1988, p.81)]. Also sometimes listed as reasons for high saving rates in Japan are obstacles to consumption such as the inefficient retailing system, the lack of space in living quarters for consumer durables, and the lack of leisure time in the work-schedule. (See, for example, Balassa and Noland, p.94.) But economic theory is dubious as to the implications for the saving rate of institutional impediments that apply to future consumption as much as to current consumption. [Wealth is only of use to the household to the extent that it is consumed sooner or later.]",
        "Hale (1987, p. 27) believes that Any set of structural reforms which reduce the price of housing while increasing the tax incentive to own it could have a more dramatic effect on savings and consumption than many policies seemingly targeted on savings behavior itself.",
        "The figure is from Shoven (1989). Furthermore, many households held more tax-free accounts than the number to which they were legally entitled; the total number of accounts in the postal savings system was said to be twice the population.",
        "So far, there has apparently been no sign of a significant decrease in the household saving rate in Japan since the April 1988 abolishment of the maruyu. (It should be noted that the latest tax reform also instituted a sales tax \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d indeed this was its politically most controversial feature \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d which could in theory have either a positive or negative effect on the saving/consumption decision, depending particularly on whether households believe that the government will raise the sales tax rate in the future.)",
        "The saving-retention coefficient finally began to decline in the 1980s however, according to the latest studies: Feldstein and Bacchetta (1989) and Frankel (1989). The latter paper contains 65 references on the subject (many of them demonstrations that one can have a high correlation between saving and investment despite perfect capital mobility).",
        "For example, Mishkin (1984). Glick (1987) applies to Japan and other Pacific countries in particular.",
        "The story of the U.S. Treasury campaign for the liberalization of Japanese financial markets, which began in 1983, is told in Frankel (1984).",
        "The interest differential could in theory be explained by either of two terms [after the possibility of a covered interest differential, or political premium, has been eliminated], both of them associated with the currency: expected depreciation or an exchange risk premium. The possible exchange risk premium between the dollar and yen is examined by Fukao and Okuba (1984), Fukao (1987), Frankel and Froot (1987), Ito (1988), and Frankel (1988).",
        "The real appreciation of the dollar against the yen and European currencies beginning in 1981 was widely considered an example of Dornbusch overshooting caused by shifts in monetary or fiscal policy: the real exchange rate change would disappear over time as U.S. traded-goods prices adjusted downward in response to excess supply and Japanese traded-goods prices adjusted upward in response to excess demand.",
        "One problem with identifying capital controls as the source of the U.S. Japan real interest differential throughout the 1970s is that during the period 1976-1978, when the covered interest differential was the largest in absolute magnitude, the nominal interest in Tokyo was above the yen interest rate in the London Euromarket, demonstrating that controls were acting to discourage capital inflow, not outflow, at least at the short-term end of the spectrum.",
        "On pricing-to-market by Japanese firms, see Branson and Marston (1989), Froot (1988), Marston (1989) and Ohno (1989)."
