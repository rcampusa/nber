        "Keynesians view business cycles as the inevitable reflection of the instability of investment spending, which in turn justifies government intervention to reduce the amplitude of cycles. Keynesian interpretations of the Great Depression, especially Temin (1976), minimize the role of monetary factors in the first two years of the 1929\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d33 contraction. Monetarists reverse the roles of the government and private sector and view the basic source of business cycles as autonomous and largely unexplained fluctuations in the money supply that lead to fluctuations in private spending. A reduction in the amplitude of business cycles requires a reduction in the instability originating in government management of the money supply.",
        "The second contribution is the use of a new set of quarterly data for major expenditure categories of GNP extending back to 1919. The data file also contains quarterly data back to 1919 for other variables that have been suggested as explanatory candidates in investment equations. These include the capital stock, interest rates, the cost of capital including tax incentive effects, a proxy for Tobin's Q, and the real money supply.",
        "Chirinko's (1983a) systematic review of assumptions and results distinguishes four classes of econometric models describing business investment behavior\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dJorgenson's neoclassical approach, Tobin's Q, the General Forward\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dLooking approach based on explicit modelling of 9 expectations, and Feldstein's Return\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dOver\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dCost and Effective Tax Rate models. Because they have accounted for the vast majority of empirical studies completed to date, we concentrate only on the neoclassical and Q frameworks for investment research. Extended surveys are presented by Eisner and Strotz (1963), Jorgenson (1971), Helliwell (1976), and Chirinko (1983a), whereas here we treat only a few selected issues that lead to our skepticism that traditional structural parameters can be identified.",
        "The Neoclassical Paradigm As of the mid 1970s, the neoclassical paradigm was so dominant (at least outside of New Haven) that Helliwell's (1976) survey makes no mention of any other framework. Prior to the mid 1960s, investment equations had been dominated by the accelerator approach and had added interest rates, profits, or other variables as determinants of investment without explicit constraints based on optimizing behavior.",
        "Another peculiarity of the approach is apparent in (1), which allows the desired capital stock to be a function only of the relative price of capital rather than the relative price of all inputs. Yellen (1980) has shown that (1) can be derived only by assuming that real wages are inversely related to C/P and respond fully and instantaneously to any changes in C/P. As a result all factor price changes must be assumed to leave the profitability of the firm unaffected, even in the short run. Thus the neoclassical approach leaves no room for theories that predict a profit squeeze, investment slump, and growth slowdown following a period of excessive real wage growth (see Malinvaud 1982).",
        "However, even if one were to accept the formulation in (1) with the single relative price variable, the measurement of capital's user cost is fraught with ambiguity. As shown recently in Auerbach's (1983) survey, taxes and inflation may not change the cost of capital in the same way for all firms, leaving the feasibility of aggregation an open question. Simple formulae for C/P are also elusive when markets are incomplete, and when managers use financial leverage and dividend policy to influence market perceptions.",
        "This point can be illustrated in a generalization of a simple model set forth recently by Andrew Abel and Olivier Blanchard (1983), that falls into the class of general forward\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dlooking models. In place of (1) we allow the desired capital stock to depend on a sequence of expected future sales, with a discount factor a; unlike Abel\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dBlanchard we also allow the desired capital stock to depend on the sequence of expected future rental rates (C/P):4 (4) a(l\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009da)a' E{{X\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00b7+.,(C/P).]j]}. Here t is the time an investment order is placed for delivery at t+n, vith n the length of the delivery or gestation lag. The parameter a is the steady\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dstate ratio of capital to output, and is the information set relevant at time t to the formation of expectations about all future variables. The relevant information set might, for instance, include past values of output, the interest rate, and the money supply.",
        "Numerous authors, including Abel (1979) and Hayashi (1982), have derived Q investment functions in the following form that adds lags to allow for delivery or gestation lags:9 (9) = + s0ts + e.",
        "The theoretical derivation involves marginal Q,' which is forward\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d looking and hence unobservable. Actual estimation of (9) involves replacing marginal Q with average Q, the ratio of the market value of firms to the replacement cost of their assets. (Hayashi (1982) has shown that actual and marginal Q are equal under specified assumptions but does not test whether these assumptions are empirically sup\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d ported.) If (9) is estimated for data on net investment, then the constant term should be zero, since net investment should be zero in the steady state when Q is unity. When data on gross investment are used, then the constant term implicitly measures the depreciation rate. At a Q ratio of unity, the firm should just replace its old capital but should not buy any new capital. More generally, the constant term reflects the mean value of any omitted variables.",
        "Quarterly data on the four investment categories for 1947\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d83 come from the National Income and Product Accounts. Investment and real GNP data for 1919\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d41 are created by the Chow and Lin (1971) method of interpolation from a variety of sources, as described in the data appendix. We have been careful to interpolate each component of real GNP on the basis of separate data sources, in order to avoid a spurious correlation between dependent and explanatory variables in this study. The Chow\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dLin method is an iterative procedure in which a regression is run to explain a data series available only annually (e.g., real GNP), using as explanatory variables the annual average of one or more series available monthly (e.g., industrial production and real retail sales). In this example the coefficients from the regression are used to create monthly (or in our case quarterly) values for real GNP.",
        "(2) Real Money Supply and Real Monetary Base. The High Powered Money series is from Friedman\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dSchwartz (1970), divided by the interpolated GNP deflator, and linked to the corresponding postwar series. The Ml series has been created by Benjamin Friedman back to 1915 on a basis that is consistent with the current (early 1980s) definition.",
        "(3) Average Q'. First a Q Proxy series is calculated as an index number, with 1972:Q2 1.0, since the numerator and denominator are in different units. The numerator is the Standard and Poors 500 stock price index, and the denominator is the replacement\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dcost net capital stock index described above. This quarterly series is used to interpolate Summers' annual average conventional Q series (1981, Table 34 3, column 1) for the period 1931\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d1979. Data for 1919\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d30 and 1980\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d83 are obtained by linking Q Proxy to the interpolated Summers series in 1931 and 1980.",
        "Fixed Investment in Recessions, 1920\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d1982 Descriptive statistics on the variables used in this paper are provided in Tables 1, 2, and 3. The first of these calculates the percentage decline in three ratios to over the 13 recessions in our sample period, five in the interwar period and eight in the postwar period. NBER reference cycles are used throughout, and this creates an inconsistency between the cycle dating procedure actually used (see the chronology paper by Moore\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dZarnowitz in this volume) and the growth cycle concept that would be more relevant given our deflation of real variables by xN.",
        "While these percentages are quite small for the first two postwar recessions, in other recessions they range from 30 to 78 percent, with the recessions in which investment played the largest role ranked as 1920\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d21, 1960\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d61, and 1980. Interestingly, the relative contribution of investment to the Great Contraction of 1929\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d33 was less than in all five of the postwar recessions between 1957\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d58 and 1980. There seems to be no systematic difference between the interwar and postwar recessions in the division of the investment decline between the two business types and the two household types. The two business types accounted for a larger contribution in eight of the 13 recessions, and the two household types for the remainder.",

        "Figure 2 exhibits each of the four categories of investment, also expressed as a ratio to xN. The investment boom of the 1920s and the unusual share of boom contributed by nonresidential structures are clearly visible. The 1930s are characterized by a simultaneous collapse in all four categories, as well as by a milder slump of consumer durable spending. By 1939\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d40, the two equipment categories had each recovered to within a percentage point of the 1926\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d29 average, but residential structures had only recovered to about half of the 1926\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d29 level, and nonresidential structures to less than one\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dthird. Postwar business cycles exhibit a continuing shift from structures to equipment, together with a general tendency for booms in residential structures to lead booms in PDE, with consumer durables in between.

Or the investigation may start from the flexible accelerator hypothesis, in which investment depends on the current level of output and one lagged value of the capital stock.

Our purpose here is not to review the controversy stirred up by Tenth's result (see Mayer, 1980), but rather to reexamine his hypothesis using the more definitive microscope provided by our quarterly data set. Table 9 exhibits quarter\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dby\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dquarter residuals from our interwar VAR models for the sixteen quarters covering 1929\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d32. 59 Asterisks are used to mark off residuals greater in size than 1.0 standard error of estimate (see notes to Table 9).",
        "The five variables of the model are the first differences of, respectively, investment in structures (ISTR), investment in durables (IDG), non\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dinvestment real GNP (N), the real monetary base (B/F), and the money multiplier. All variables (except m) are expressed as per\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d ,centage ratios to natural real CNP, and beneath the residuals the table shows the level of these ratios in 1929:Q2, ranging from 5.6 percent for the monetary base to 77.6 percent for non\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dinvestment real GNP. Here we treat the behavior of non\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dinvestment real GNF as representing consumption,  actually nondurable consumption, since in 1929 nondurable consumption made up 85.2 percent of N, and accounted for 74.6 percent of the decline in N from 1929 to 1930.",
        "The emphasis in this paper on autonomous movements in investment, particularly structures investment, is supported in Table 9. There were three large negative innovations in 1929\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d30 to ISTR, including one in 1929:Q3, one quarter prior to the business downturn and stock market crash. There was a large negative innovation in lOG in 1929:04. The cumulative residuals of ISTR and IDG in 1929\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d30 amount, respectively, to \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d25.2 and \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d17.2 percent of their levels in 1929:Q2. In contrast, the only large N residual for 1929\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d30 is positive in 1929:Q3. The cumulative N residuals in 1929\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d30 amount to only \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d1.6 percent of its level in 1929:Q2. Thus we find no evidence that negative residuals for nondurable consumption played a key role in the initial stages of the Great Contraction.",
        "Overall, these results are consistent with our interpretation of two sources of the business cycle, real and financial, with the negative innovations in real investment playing a dominant role in 1929\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d30, and with the nature of the negative financial innovations shifting from a contribution of the monetary base in 1929\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d30 to one by the money multiplier in 1931\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d32.",
        "Our first empirical task is to establish the importance of fixed investment in historical business cycles. Using procedures described in the Data Appendix, we have created a new set of quarterly data on major expenditure components of GNP extending hack to l919:Q1. We include four types of real investment expenditures in our study\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dproducer's durable equipment, nonresidential structures, residential structures, and consumer durable expenditures. The decLtne in the sum of these four components ('I) contributes between one\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dthird and one\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dhalf of the decline in real GNF in recessions, even though the share of I in GNP at 62 the typical business cycle peak is about one\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dquarter. Total investment actually was relatively more important in postwar recessions between 1957 and 1980 than it was during the Great Contraction of 1929\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d33. A decomposition of variance allows a description of the relation between investment (I) and non\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dinvestment real GNP (N) in major episodes.",
        "Our empirical work casts doubt on the importance of the accelerator hypothesis of investment behavior that has been supported by some past work, e.g., Clark (1979). The simple device of including four lags on the dependent variable in equations explaining total I eliminates the significant explanatory contribution of lagged values of real GNP, except in the equipment equations for the postwar period. However we find that it is possible to obtain significant sums of coefficients for an accelerator effect in a postwar durable equipment equation only when real GNP is entered as a second rather than first difference. These findings support our basic interpretation that there is a sharp difference between the behavior of structures and equipment investment, 65 with the former behaving mainly in an autonomous fashion, whereas the latter reflects feedback both from investment in structures and from financial and monetary variables.",
        "Deeper Issues and Unsettled Questions for Future Research In a recent paper Blanchard (1981, p. 154)) reached the conclusion that . . . the multiplier is dead and the accelerator alive.' This paper reaches the opposite conclusion, particularly for the structures component of investment. The accelerator muchanism, interpreted as the feedback from autonomous movements in non\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dinvestment GNP to investment in structures, seems to be considerably weaker than the multiplier mechanism, interpreted in the elementary textbook fashion as the effect on total GNP of autonomous movements of investment, particularly the structures component. While there is a substantial effect of monetary and financial variables on investment, nevertheless there are major and persistent movements in investment that occur in both the interwar and postwar periods that cannot he explained by prior changes in output, money, stock prices, or interest rates.",
        "A second factor, more relevant for investment in structures than in 67 equipment, is the element of speculation. The Florida land boom of the 1920s, the stock market bubble of 1928\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d29, and earlier investment excesses like the South Seas bubble of the early eighteen century, all have some similarity to the construction boom of the 1920s. For six years (1923\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d28) real residential construction achieved a level more than double the average of the entire decade before World War I, and in four successive years (1924\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d27) the ratio of real residential construction investment to GNP reached by far its highest level of the twentieth century. Hickman estimates that even with a continuation of population growth at the 1924\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d25 rate, rather than a post\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d1925 decline, housing starts would have fallen by 35 percent between 1925 and 1930 (as a ratio to natural real GNP, it actually fell by percent).",
        "Nor is the phenomenon of overbuilding confined to the interwar period. Figure 6 shows that the postwar own innovation to structures investment peaked in 1972\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d73. Several years later contemporary accounts recognized the phenomenon of overbuilding: 'In Chicago, new apartment construction has just about ceased. In Atlanta, where there is at least a three\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dyear supply of unsold condominiums overhanging the market, mortgage companies are auctioning off high\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009drise units to the public at two\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dthirds their original asking price . . . .

        "The third factor that may be an important explanation behind the apparently autonomous structures investment boom of the 1920s and slump of the 1930s is the Schumpeterian bunching of innovations. This hypothesis is developed by R. A. Gordon (1951), who argues that the 68 buoyancy of both residential and nonresidential construction in the 1920s reflected in large part the influence of the automobile in expanding the boundaries of urban areas: Between 1923 and 1929 the growing use of automobiles and trucks had a more important impact on total investment and employment than did the expansion of motor vehicle output.",
        "Motor vehicle registrations in 1929 were about 75 percent greater than in 1923 and nearly three times the number in 1920. . . . large scale investment was necessary for roads and bridges, oil wells, pipe lines, garages and service stations, and tire and automobile supply stores, as well as for oil refining and tire manufacture. In addition, the automobile accelerated the trends toward urbanization and 'suburhaniza\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d tion', stimulating thereby residential and commercial building. Other industries were also involved in the bunching of investment opportunities in the 1920s. Among these were electric power\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dwell over half of the installation of electric generating capacity during 1902\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d40 occurred during the decade of the 1920s. Other important new industries were radio, telephone, and chemicals.",
        "Past studies of structures investment need to be reviewed for problens of identification and simultaneity that may have led to a misleading emphasis on the investment accelerator, rather than autonomous movements, as the driving force behind structures investment. Our inability to find a strong influence of the stock market (working through our Q variable) on investment, except for postwar nonresidential structures, needs to he reconciled with the recent findings of Fischer and Nerton (1984), who find a stronger connection between economic activity and prior movements in the stock market. Finally we hope that our new quarterly interwar data on components of expenditures will stimulate further research into the interrelations of real and financial variables during the Great Depression.",
