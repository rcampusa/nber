        "In only one instance prior to March 1986, namely the zero-maturity rates for May 1958, did the cubic spline indicate a negative interest rate, of-0.11%. This value was not significantly negative, however (its estimated standard error was 0.54%), and so it was replaced with a zero in the tables. The zero at m \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d 0 for May 1947 is the actually estimated value. Since March 1986 forward rates in the range 27 to 29 years have often been negative, but these maturities are beyond the range of the tables.",
