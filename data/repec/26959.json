        "Figures Figure 1: Average earnings by advanced eld Note: The gure presents the weighted average of earnings by advanced elds, in descending order of earnings (in 2013 dollars). Medicine is highest paid and humanities elds are lowest paid.",
        "Figure 2: Average ln(earnings) of advanced elds by average occupation premium Note: The gure presents the relationship between the averages of the log of earnings (in 2013 dollars) and the occupation premium for each advanced eld, using sample weights. The dots are the averages. The shaded circles around the dots indicate the share of each advanced eld among all graduate degree holders. The straight line is the tted simple regression line between the two averages, with the shares of the advanced elds as weights. The standard error of the slope is 0.10. The gure shows that much of the variation in earnings across advanced degrees is associated with occupational sorting.",
        "Figure 3: Average ln(earnings) of advanced elds by average BA major premium Note: The gure presents the relationship between the averages of the log of earnings (in 2013 dollars) and the averages of BA major premium of each advanced eld, using sample weights. The dots indicate the averages. The shaded circles indicate the share of each advanced eld among all graduate degree holders. The straight line is the tted simple regression line between the two averages, with the shares of the advanced elds as weights. The standard error of the slope is 0.34. The gure shows a positive relationship between the log of earnings and the BA major premium. Therefore, those who choose a high-paying advanced eld tend to have majored in a high-paying BA eld.",
        "Step 7. We dene the regression sample by imposing the following restrictions. First, people have to work full time. This is indicated by either the dummy variable for working full time in the raw data, or jointly by working at least 35 hours a week and at least 40 weeks a year. We do not have information about hours worked or a direct question about full time status for the calendar year prior to the survey. Consequently, we assume that full time status in the year prior to the NSCG and NSRCG survey is the same as full time status at the time of the survey. The full time status indicator for the 1989 earnings observation and the 1990 occupation variables is based on 1990 Census questions about usual hours worked per week and number of weeks worked in 1989. Second, people have to be aged between 23 and 59. Third, we drop people with a PhD by the last time we observe them and drop observations of people who are currently enrolled in an educational program.",
        "We adjust the NCSES weights for all waves of the NSRCG and NSCG so that the weighted distribution of c, g pairs in the pooled sample matches the distribution of c, g pairs that we estimated using the 1993, 2003, 2010, and 2013 NSCG. Separate weights are constructed for the earnings regressions and the occupational premium regressions that reect the mix of surveys that contribute observations. The pooled sample weights for earnings account for the fact that some interviews contribute earnings observations for two years. We trim the adjusted weights using 1/10 and 10 times of the median of the weights of all observations in the combined data.",
        "49Enrollment is inferred by completion time of the degree. We assume all master degrees, MBA, and other professional degrees take 2 years, Law takes 3 years, and Medicine takes 4 years. Surveys are conducted in April prior to 2000, and October after. 50If a person does not hold a BA or an advanced degree in a S&E eld, but is included in the database and has follow up interviews, we say this person becomes SESTAT-eligible because of an S&E occupation choice.",
        "Details Let weightis denote that survey weights provided by NCSES, where i denotes the person and s denotes a specic wave of a survey, such as the NSCG 2003. Step 1. Standardize weights across NSCG and NSCRG waves. First, we want to preserve the relative weights within each survey while accounting for varying sample sizes across surveys. We divide the survey weight by the sum of weights of all observations from the survey and then multiply by the number of observations. weightsurv\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00cb\u0086\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0099adj is = weightit PNs i=1 weightis \u00c3\u0083\u00c6\u0092\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Ns . Step 2: Estimate the population probabilities of each college major and graduate degree combination.",
        "In the second step, we estimate the fraction pbase cg of college graduates in each c, g cell over the period of full sample, where no advance degree (g = 0) form a separate cell for each major c. To do so, we use the NSCG 1993, 2003, 2010, and 2013. Each is a stratied random sample of the population of college graduates to estimate at the time of observation. For these waves of the NSCG, the weights provided by the NCSES weight the samples to the population of college graduates who have had a BA for 3 or more years."
