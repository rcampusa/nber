        "As in Olley and Pakes (OP) (1996) or Levinsohn and Petrin (LP) (2003), Wooldridge (2009) expresses the transmitted component \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u008fit as a function of the state variables and the a proxy variable. The proxy variable is investment in OP and intermediate inputs mit in LP; as discussed in the text, we prefer the LP to OP because of the well-known lumpiness of investment in plantlevel data (as a result of which the investment proxy is in practice is missing for a number of observations). Thus for some function g(., .): \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u008fit = g(xit, mit), t = 1, ..., T, where xit is the set of observed state variables. Typically, capital is considered as the state variable. In our context, because the job security laws introduce adjustments costs to labor, we include both blue and white collar labor in the set of state variables. So we have: \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u008fit = g(kit, lu it, ls it, mit), t = 1, ..., T.",
        "Generally under the Wooldridge (2009) approach (as in OP/LP/ACF), there are more instruments than endogenous variables, yielding an overidenti\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00afcation test for the joint validity of the instruments. The results (p-value) of the overidenti\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00afcation test are reported in column 9; in none of the cases can the joint validity of the instruments be rejected at the 1% level. For most cases, the validity cannot be rejected at a cuto\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00af of 10%; in industry 321 and 390, the joint validity is questionable at the 5% cuto\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00af level, and for industry 356 at the 10% level.",
        "Appendix D: Construction of Capital Series For 1981 and 1982, the Chilean Manufacturing Census (Encuesta Nacional Industrial Anual) has book value of capital split into four categories \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2 building, land, machinery and vehicles. For years 1992 to 1996, book value data is available for building, machinery and vehicles. In order to treat these series consistently, we aggregate land and building under \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2building\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2 for years 1980 and 1981 as well. Then for building, we construct \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00afrst a series using the base year data for 1980 as follows: rbldg1980 t=1980 = bvbldg1980 defcons1980 , where bvbldg1980 is the book value for building for 1980, defcons1980 is the base 1979 construction de\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00afator so as to express values in (thousands of) 1979 pesos. Then for the years after 1980, the real building stock is constructed as: rbldg1980 t = rbldg1980 t\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a21 (1 \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2 \u00c3\u0083\u00c5\u00bdbldg) + Ibldg t defconst ,",
        "where the depreciation rate for building \u00c3\u0083\u00c5\u00bdbldg is assumed to equal 5% (following Liu 1991), and Ibldg t is the investment in building reported in year t. Following the same logic, for years prior to the base year 1980, the real capital series is constructed as: rbldg1980 t = 1",
        "1 \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2 \u00c3\u0083\u00c5\u00bdbldg rbldg1980 t+1 \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2 Ibldg t+1 defconst+1 . The exact same procedure is followed to construct the real stock series for vehicles and machinery as well; the depreciation rate used for these series are 20% and 10% respectively, as in Liu (1991). The total real depreciated capital stock with base year 1980 is then the sum of the real depreciated stock of building, machinery and vehicles."
