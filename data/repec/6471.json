        "These papers were preceded by Auernheimer and Contreras (1990) and Leeper (1991). More recent work includes Bergin (1995) (who studies fiscal requirements for price stability in a monetary union), Daniel (1996) (who studies implications of fiscal policy rules for price and exchange rate determination), and Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (1997) (who consider the implications of a balanced budget amendment for the choice of monetary policy rules).",
        "This terminology originated with Canzoneri and Diba (1996). Woodford (1995) calls the regimes Ricardian (MD) and non-Ricardian (FD).",
        "This literature is reminiscent of Sargent and Wallace's celebrated papers (Sargent and Wallace (1981) and Sargent (1986)) on Unpleasant Monetarist Arithmetic. In our view, their fiscal leadership corresponds in spirit to our fiscal dominant regime; however, there is not a one to one relationship between the two notions. For example, even with fiscal leadership in setting taxation and spending, central bank transfers could in theory respond to the level of the debt in a way that satisfies the present value budget constraint and places the economy in a money dominant regime. It is interesting to note that Sargent and Wallace (1981) speculated that the US and other major industrial countries have exhibited fiscal leadership for some time now.",
        "See, for example, Sargent (1987, Chapter 7), which provides a very explicit example of how the FD regime is assumed when solving an OLG model.",
        "For example, the Federal Reserve Board's new model \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d FRB/US ~ assumes an endogenous tax policy that appears to ensure that the budget constraint is always satisfied. Brayton and Tinsley (1996) provide a guide to FRB/US. Endogenizing tax policy seems to be the favored approach to assuring a MD regime in this class of policy models.",
        "These results are not new, and our review of them will be brief. More detailed discussions appear in Auernheimer and Contreras (1990), Leeper (1991), Sims (1994) and Woodford (1995).",
        "The fiscal criteria written into the Maastricht Treaty can also be rationalized in this way. For example, Canzoneri and Diba (1996) show that the 3% deficit rule would insure a MD regime. See also Woodford (1996).",
        "It should be emphasized that this approach to price determination is not limited to models with flexible prices. Prices can be sticky or even fixed. See Woodford (1995,1996) for examples.",
        "Our formulation of the analysis differs from Woodford's (1995) only in that (for empirical purposes) we deflate liabilities by GDP instead of the price level. This difference only entails algebraic manipulation of Woodford's setup; his arguments extend directly to our formulation."
