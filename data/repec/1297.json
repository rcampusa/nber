        "2The arithmetic that demonstrates this is in Varian [1978, p. 18]. 3One might wonder how, if 1L = in the two\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dfactor case, LL = 5LLL in the multi\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dfactor case when we assume N = 2. Remembering that SLLL + SK = O 11LL = SK Since = \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d and KL is just alternative notation for , the two representations are identical. good mnemonic for these distinctions is that the q and p refer to the exogenous quantities and prices whose variation is assumed to produce changes In endogenous input prices and quantities respectively. 5To derive a.., perform the required differentiation and remember that g1=X.",
        "6One should note that the slope parameter on in WL in (48) is not the usual constant\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009doutput labor\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009ddemand elasticity, and that the latter needs to be calculated from the estimate using (4a). it is also worth noting that (48) is a trans-formation of the equation used by rrow LI al (1962) to estimate the elasticity of substitution in the CES function they had proposed: Under constant returns to scale (48) can be written as; In &apos;(IL aOwL, the-form originally used to estimate .",
        "7The issues from 1975\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d1982 of a large number of Journals were searched. For years before 1975 the references are taken from Harnermesh (1976). While we make no claim that our survey is exhaustive, it should give a fair representation of work on this subject. 8Remernber that this is an economic issue, not a problem of inferring the partial elasticities of substitution or complementarity. in the translog case, for exarnple,those can always be inferred, either easily or by inverting a matrix involving all the coefficients estimated. 9lndeed, one should be able to demonstrate that workers can be aggregated linearly, not merely that those within a subgroup are separable from those in other subgroups.",
        "Stapleton and Young &apos;1983) have attempted to apply this view to the United States for 1967\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d1977. The results support many of the findings summarized in the next section, though they are not uniformly consistent with the theory of product ion.",
        "1tThe issues from 1979\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d1982 of a large number of journals were searched. For years before 1979 the references are taken from Harnerrnesh\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dGrant (1979). 12This finding implies nothing about how uicidx an economy can adjust to such a change. Even though the required change in relative wages may be slight, adjustment costs may be sufficiently large to lead to long periods of disequil ibriurn in the markets for some o-f the groups of labor. By tself, though, this shows very 1 ttle, since small changes in the estimated parameters in a translog or general ized Leontief system often lead to large changes in the estimates of the underlying production or cost parameters, as the discussion in Section III indicates."
