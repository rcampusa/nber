See the actual surveys, for example, Treasury Department et al. (2002, 2009) or the Griever, Lee, and Warnock (2001) primer for details. Reporting on the asset surveys is mandatory, with both fines and imprisonment possible for wilful failure to report. The data are collected at the securitylevel, greatly reducing reporting error; armed with a security identifier, a mapping to the currency of the bond and the residence of its issuer is straightforward.",
        "Explanatory Variables In Table 4 we include the following bilaterally defined variables: Issuancei,j is the share of country i\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s bonds that are denominated in country j\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s currency as of end-2003 Linkagesi,j is the portion of country i\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s imports in 2003 that were from country j Volatilityi,j (exchange rate volatility between country i and j, calculated from monthly percentage changes in the nominal bilateral exchange rate from 1994 through 2003).",
        "In Tables 5-7, we use data series from a variety of sources as documented below: Yield, expressed in basis points, is the yield-to-maturity in the GBI indexes from J.P Morgan and enters our regressions as an annual average of monthly data. See J.P Morgan (2006) Appendix B. JPMorgan provided yield data through 2013; for 2014 and 2015 we gathered data from Bloomberg and for the Philippines created yield as the average of 5-year and 10-year government bond yields. USD_shr is calculated as the share of a country\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s bonds denominated in US dollars. RegCr (regulatory quality/creditor rights) is calculated as a weighted average of the Regulatory Quality Index from the World Bank\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s World Governance Indicators and the Legal Rights Index from the \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093Getting Credit\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d section of the World Bank\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s Doing Business report.",
        "The regulatory quality index measures a government\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s ability to formulate and implement sound policies and regulations that promote private sector development, while the creditor rights index measures the degree to which collateral and bankruptcy laws protect the rights of borrowers and lenders. We follow the GEMLOC Investability Indicator Methodology (Markit 2013) by constructing a composite measure with twice the weight on regulatory quality. Trade is bilateral imports and exports between the US and the foreign country, scaled by both countries\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 nominal GDP (source: IMF).",
        "Global variables VIX and USi10 are averages of monthly observations of the CBOE volatility index and 10-year US Constant Maturity Treasury rate, respectively. US_UMP is the sum of the Rogers, Scotti and Wright (2016) monetary policy shocks to the 10-year rate. For expository ease, we take the negative of the RSW shocks, so that a positive monetary policy shock (i.e., one that lowers 10-year rates) is positive.",

In our narrow more recent sample we rely on the BIS\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s classification of EMEs (which includes Korea and Israel)."
