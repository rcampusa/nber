Technical Appendix This appendix provides more detail about the methods used to construct our historical SPM series.",
        "Poverty Units Unmarried partners are directly identified in the CPS since 1995, so for years prior to that we must seek to identify them through other means. We use the well-established adjusted-POSSLQ routine (which stands for Persons of the Opposite Sex Sharing Living Quarters). We follow Casper, Cohen and Simmons (1999), who define an adjusted POSSLQ household as one that meets the following criteria: two unrelated adults (age 15+) of the opposite sex living together, with no other adults except relatives and foster children of the reference person, or children of unrelated subfamilies.",
        "Prior to 1988, it is not possible to identify foster children in the CPS (and instead they are coded as unrelated individuals), so foster children between the age of 15-22 are excluded from SPM family units from 1967-1987.",
        "From 2007 onwards, detailed relationship codes make it possible to identify and include both biological parents of a child in a household even if these individuals do not claim to be unmarried partners. However, prior to 2007, these detailed relationship codes are not available, so we must rely on relationship codes of individuals in reference to household head or family reference person. Prior to 1975, only relationship to household head exists, not relationship to family head. Equivalence Scale We follow the Census Bureau in using a three-parameter equivalence scale to adjust poverty thresholds for poverty-unit size and composition. This equivalence scale is as follows: Families without children: Equivalence scale=(adults)0.5 Single parents: Equivalence scale=(adults+0.8*first child+0.5*other children)0.7 All other families: Equivalence scale=(adults+0.5* children)0.7 Geographic Adjustment The SPM adjusts poverty thresholds for geographic differences in the cost of housing.",
        "Specifically, they use five-year American Community Survey data on rental payments in metropolitan areas to adjust the shelter and utilities component of the SPM poverty thresholds. In contrast, our historical-SPM estimates do not yet adjust poverty thresholds for geographic differences in cost-of-living given the paucity of consistent data back to 1967 necessary to implement geographic adjustments. Developing a method of implementing a consistent geographic adjustment over time remains an important area for future research. For more on geographic adjustment under the SPM, see Renwick (2011). Mortgage Status Data for constructing thresholds by housing status are not consistently available for all years.",
        "From 1976-2008, the CPS asks respondents whether they owned or rented their dwelling, but not about their mortgage status, a question has been included since 2009. There are no housing tenure questions in the CPS prior to 1976.",
        "To follow the Census SPM methodology, which require thresholds based on three housing status groups, we imputed mortgage status from the CEX to the CPS in 1980-2009 and in 1972/73.",
        "This imputation included poverty status, age, race, education and marital status of household head, family size and region as well as race*education interactions and race*age interactions. For the intermediate years 1974-1979 the coefficients were linearly interpolated and applied to CPS data to estimate predicted likelihoods of having a mortgage among home owners. For 19671971, the same annual rate of change in the relationships between 1972/3-1980 was assumed and extrapolated to the earlier years.",
        "Prior to 1974, a two-step imputation process was applied, first to determine ownership vs renter status and second to determine mortgage status among owners. The first imputation included the same covariates as the mortgage status imputation described above but also included deciles of income and welfare recipiency. The incidence rate of ownership was constrained to match the incidence in the CEX.",
        "School Lunch Program Our approach for imputing participation in the school lunch program is largely similar to our imputation of SNAP, and included the same set of predictors. Because no information exists on this program in the 1972-73 CEX, however, our dataset used for imputation is the 1980 CPS. As with SNAP, we constrain the percentage of heads down (or up) each preceding year scaled by changes in the administrative caseload. The administrative data here comes from the USDA and was compiled back to 1969 by Robert Moffitt and his colleagues. We extended the series back to 1955 using information from the Statistical Abstracts of the United States. To assign monetary values to those for whom we impute benefit receipt, we use the same model but predicting the 1980/79 family value of school lunch calculated by the Census. We then deflate this benefit by the CPI-U.",
        "WIC Our procedure for imputing WIC benefits into the CPS is a two-step procedure. First, for years prior to 2001, we imputed WIC incidence at the household level. Second, we calculate the benefit value for all years using administrative data on average per person WIC expenditures (see: http://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/wisummary.htm).",
        "To constrain the number of recipients, we first estimate the share of WIC income-eligible families from the CPS to administrative participation data for 2001-2010 and then constrain the number of recipients in earlier years to match this ratio. We use OLS regression to estimate the likelihood of WIC receipt among income eligible families, based on number of eligible kids, household income and poverty status. While WIC was permanently established in 1974, only a small number (88,000) individuals participated. As a result, we do not believe we can accurately identify recipients in this year and estimate WIC beginning in 1975.",
        "WIC Value: We calculate WIC value by multiplying the average annual WIC food costs per person (based on monthly USDA administrative costs*12 from http://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/wisummary.htm) by the number of recipients per household (which is 0-4 from 2001-2012 and 0-1 prior to 2001). This value is then divided evenly among household members and summed for SPM family units.",
        "The Census values housing assistance by taking the lesser of (a) the shelter portion of the threshold minus estimated rental payments, or (b) the market value of the housing unit minus estimated rental payments (for an extended discussion see Johnson et al., 2010). We lack adequate data to fully estimate rental payments and market values of housing units back to 1967.",
        "Taxes After-tax income is not available on the CPS files before 1979/80. So we used NBER\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s Taxsim Program to calculate our after-tax estimates for earlier years. The starting point for our tax programs are Stata programs provided by NBER and created originally by Judith Scott-Clayton.",
        "MOOP Medical out-of-pocket expenses (MOOP) are imputed from the CEX to the CPS for all years. We use a hot-deck imputation strategy to calculate deciles of MOOP expenditures for consumer units in the CEX for 10 imputation groups, based on: number of elderly in family (0,1,2), an indicator for families of 1, and poverty level (below 200% and >=200% FPL). The distribution of MOOP expenditures in each imputation group is preserved by randomly assigning deciles of expenditures to the same imputation groups in the CPS. Finally, total MOOP expenditures are then capped at $6,700/person (adjusted to nominal dollars using CPI-U), which is the 2011 Medicare Advantage Part D non-premium cap, per recommendations in Korenman and Remler (2012). This method indirectly imputes incidence for various demographic groups since deciles of $0 in expenditures would remain in both datasets, but it does not force an exact percentage.",
        "For 2011, the first year of overlap between MOOP expenditures asked in CPS and our imputed measure, our imputed estimate of MOOP estimates the overall median expenditures and the distribution fairly well, with some underestimation at the 95th and 99th percentiles of expenditures (see Table A1 below). However, using our capped, imputed MOOP measure as opposed to the CPS measure has a relatively minor impact on overall SPM poverty rates. A more comprehensive imputation measure would include health insurance status, but unfortunately that is not available in the CEX (unless premiums were paid for by the consumer unit).",
        "We use the same CEX sample as we do for poverty thresholds (see above), which is a five-year moving sample from 1984-2012 with progressively fewer years of CEX data back to 1980, and then single-year estimates of MOOP expenditures for 1972/73 and 1980. For the intermediate years 1974-1979 the decile expenditures were linearly interpolated. For 1967-1971, the same annual rate of change in the expenditures between 1972/3-1980 was assumed and extrapolated to the earlier years."
