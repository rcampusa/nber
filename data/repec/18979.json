SUPPLEMENTAL APPENDIX NOT FOR PUBLICATION A Extended Model with Skill-Biased Technical Change Educational attainment and the evolution of the gender wage gap are central in this framework. Although the benchmark model uses both exogenously closing gender wage gap and rising college premium, the model is easily amendable such that the general wage trends are the results of a general equilibrium model. The underlying mechanism for the closing gender wage gap and rising college premium is as follows.",
        "Assume that men and women are born with two factors of production\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dhuman capital (brain) and raw labor (brawn), as in Guvenen and Kuruscu (2010) and Rendall (2010). A linear combination of these two labor inputs determines the wage rate an individual can earn in the labor market. Specifically, individuals are born with a fixed amount of brawn, r, that is the same within each gender but can di\u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00ac\u00e2\u0082\u00acer across genders. In addition, individuals are born with some initial brain, h0, and can acquire more by attending college and acquiring education, e. The exogenous driving force we are interested in is a specific form of skill-biased technical change (SBTC), which we model as a rise in the wage of brain relative to brawn. Table A.1 summarizes the key parameters by gender and education level."
