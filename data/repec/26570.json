        "Japan 2011: On March 11, 2011, Japan suered a triple disaster (earthquake-tsunami-nuclear meltdown), with an earthquake of magnitude 9.0. According to contemporaneous reports, the economic damages were estimated to be about 6 to 7 percent of GDP. The earthquake hit Japans north-east section, responsible for 6 to 8 percent of the countrys total production. On April 27, several special national tax laws were promulgated and became eective immediately. Also, an expected cut of 5 percentage points of the corporate tax rate (announced on December 2010 by the Prime Minister) was deferred due to the earthquake. The time elapsed between the natural disaster and the passage and implementation of tax changes was of 47 days."
