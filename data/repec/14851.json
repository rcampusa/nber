        "9.2 U.S. Measures of Autonomy The 1950s U.S. of autonomy are derived directly from Moos and Rourke (1959). We standardize them as described in the text but otherwise do not manipulate them. Our recent measures of autonomy are based on Boatman and LOrange (2006), Education Commission of the States (various), and State Higher Education Executive Officers Association (various). We are also informed by Epper and Russell (1996), Fisher (1988), Rasmussen (2003), Volkwein (1986) and Volkwein et al (1997 and 1998).",

        "9.4 Measures of Patenting We use utility patents by year and state from Hall, Jaffe, and Tratjenberg (2001) and Hall (2006). Each patents is associated with the state of residence of the person who registers the patent. These data are available from the National Bureau of Economic Research (www.nber.org).",
        "9.7.2. Chairmen of State Education Committees Starting in 1975, the Council of State Governments began publishing a series of national directories to state legislatures. From the volumes entitled State Legislative Leadership, Committees and Stan, we collected the name of the chairperson of committees involved in education policy. Using the companion volumes entitled Selected State Officials and the Legislatures, we matched these legislators to their street addresses and district numbers. Before 1975, state legislative information is only available in states own political directories or states senate journals. These vary widely in their organization and detail.",
        "9.8 Measures of Population by Age Measures of population by single year of age are traditionally estimated using a combination of data from the decennial United States Censuses of Population, vital statistics data, immigration data, and state administrative data. The measures are known as intercensal estimates because, in the Census years, population data by single year of age are recorded. Intercensal estimates are prepared by the Population Division of the United States Bureau of the Census, and we use their estimates for 2000 to 2004 (United States Bureau of the Census, 2005). The Population Divisions webpage contains details on the methodology they use for the estimation. For the years from 1969 to 1999, we use estimates prepared by the National Cancer Institute using a methodology very similar to that of the Population Division (National Cancer Institute, 2005). The National Cancer Institute.s webpage contains details on their methodology."
