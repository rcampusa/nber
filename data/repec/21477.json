        "Attendance Rates Attendance in treatment is calculated as the fraction of sessions that parents attended in 2011-2012. As there were 18 sessions in total, this variable takes the total number of sessions that parents attended in the year and divides it by 18. Thus the variable is continuous and varies between [0,1].",
