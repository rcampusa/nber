        "The implausibility of central banks literally conducting policy in accordance with some simple formula is, I would guess, what Bernanke, Laubach, Mishkin, and Posen (1999, p.5) have in mind when they suggest that there is no such thing in practice as an absolute rule for monetary policy (italics in original).",
        "Bernanke, Laubach, Mishkin, and Posen (1999) have characterized inflation targeting as a policy framework that may be termed constrained discretion and which combines some of the advantages traditionally ascribed to rules with those ascribed to discretion (1999, p. 6, italics in original). Thus they implicitly reject the usefulness of a rules-vs.-discretion dichotomy. There is some merit to that position, but I find it useful to consider which of the two concepts predominates, along the lines suggested below.",
