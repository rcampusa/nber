        "Indian import tariffs had traditionally been low, reflecting the country\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s colonial status and the liberal inclinations of the British imperial power.39 Land, opium, and salt provided the bulk of the Indian government\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s revenues: customs duties only accounted for 10% of government revenue in 1860-61, and just 5% ten years later (Kumar, 1983, p. 916). Tariffs had been increased in the wake of the 1857 Mutiny, but under pressure from Lancashire cotton interests they were gradually reduced, and they were abolished altogether (except for on salt and alcohol) in 1882. Acts VIII and XVI of 1894 introduced a general tariff of 5%, with the duty on cotton yarns being offset by an equivalent domestic excise duty so as to ensure that Indian manufacturers were not unfairly favoured (Act XVI).",
        "However, in 1896 the import tariff on cotton piece goods was lowered to 3%, while the duty on cotton yarn was abolished (Act III). Since the excise duties on domestically produced cotton goods (both yarn and cloth), at a new rate of 3% (Act II), were not abolished , there was now a negative rate of protection for the Indian cotton spinning industry (Kumar, 1983, p. 921). On the eve of the war India was thus a virtually free-trading country, and such tariffs as were levied were designed to raise revenue rather than to protect domestic industries.40 World War 1 was an important turning point. First, the war effort required revenue, and the most obvious way for India to raise more was to increase tariffs.",
        "The general tariff was therefore increased from 5 to 7% in 1916, although cotton duties remained unchanged which greatly limited the fiscal benefit of the measure (Act IV).41 By late 1916 Austen Chamberlain, Secretary of State for India, was demanding a 100 million contribution by India to the war effort, while Indian nationalists objected to the exclusion of cotton from the general tariff increase. The Government of India eventually acceeded to Chamberlain\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s request, but only after the British government had agreed to allow India to raise duties on cotton goods (still not including yarn) to 7% (Act VI of 1917), 39While we make extensive references to the secondary literature below, an invaluable source remains the Indian legislation of the period.",
        "40Act XIV of 1899 allowed the government to impose countervailing duties in cases where other governments were subsidising exports to India. Act VIII of 1902 allowed the government to impose duties on imported sugar from countries protecting domestic sugar production by more than a specified amount. 41Act XI of the same year gave the Governor General sweeping powers to restrict international trade.",
        "The end of the world war did not bring peace to India: war with Afghanistan in 1919 was followed by the Waziri uprising which lasted into the following year.",
        "Interest rates on Indian government debt rose. The general tariff was further increased to 11% in 1921 (Act VI): cotton textiles were included and once again there was no offsetting increase in domestic excise duties (Dewey, 1978, pp. 43-4).42 The following year the general tariff was once again raised, to 15%, with imported cotton yarn now being subject to a duty of 5% (Act XII) (duties on cotton piece goods remained unchanged) (Mukherjee, 2001, p. 732).43 De facto, Indian cotton textiles were now enjoying substantial protection, despite the fact that tariffs were being imposed for revenue reasons (Drummond, 1972, p. 123), and were by this stage a more important source of government revenue than the land tax.",
        "43The rate on sugar was increased to 25%, and that on the afore-mentioned luxury goods to 30%, while tariffs on a range of iron and steel products were raised from 2 to 10%. a year, and involved among other things a boycott of imported cloth; noncooperation lasted until February 1922, when Gandhi cancelled the campaign as a result of an attack on a police station (although he continued to argue for a foreign cloth boycott in the years that followed) (Brown, 1985, pp. 213-8).",
        "This recommendation, accepted by the British government in 1921, that Britain acknowledge India\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s right to \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093fiscal autonomy\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d took the form of a \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093convention \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d rather than a statute, since the latter would have limited \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093the ultimate power of Parliament to control the administration of India\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d and \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093the power of veto which rests in the Crown\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d. Indian historians have pointed out that the Government of India was supposed to consult the British government before tabling fiscal policy proposals, and have argued that the British government de facto retained significant control over Indian trade policy (Mukherjee, 2001, pp. 734-5). Yet the succeeding two decades saw the gradual development of far more interventionist trade policies in the sub-continent.",
        "The newly constituted Tariff Board immediately set about considering the case for protection of the iron and steel industry. The Tata Iron and Steel Company (TISCO) had been founded in 1907, and proved a useful asset during the war. By 1921 it was in trouble, however, due to imported steel from the European continent, in particular Belgium: it was this which had led the Indian governemnt to set up the Fiscal Commission in the first place (Wagle, 1981).",
        "Since tariffs were at this stage the most important source of revenue in India the case for increasing customs duties became politically unanswerable, even in the face of stiff opposition from Lancashire cotton interests (Chatterji, 1992, pp. 347-8). And by this stage Indian politics required that at least some of these increases be protective in nature.",
        "Attention thus turned to the possibility of raising the tariff on cotton textiles from 11% to the general rate of 15%. In 1930, the Indian government faced pressure from two sides: Indian mill owners feared that 15% would not be sufficient to protect them from Japanese competition, while the British government (fiscal autonomy convention notwithstanding) worried about the impact of a 15% tariff on Lancashire. An obvious solution to this political conundrum was to extend the principle of differential protection to the cotton textile industry, imposing higher tariffs on foreign (and in particular Japanese) cloth than on British cloth.",
        "This however ran into the problem that the Indian Legislature was opposed to Imperial Preference. The eventual solution, adopted in April 1930, was to increase duties on British piece goods to 15% , with duties on foreign piece goods 50Act XIX of 1926.",
        "51Imposing differential duties on Japanese cotton goods would have been in breach of the Indo-Japanese trade agreement of 1904 (U.K. Parliamentary Papers, 1905), which entitled Japan to \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093the lowest customs duties applicable to similar products of any other foreign origin\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d (Art. I).",

        "In September 1931, Britain left the gold standard. The October election brought to power a National Government and strengthened the hand of those in Britain advocating for protection and Imperial Preference. The first moves towards protection were made in November 1931, and in the same month the British government started preparing for the forthcoming Imperial Economic Conference, to be held in Ottawa the following summer. Their hope was that bilateral tariff bargains could be struck between the participants there (the UK, 53Indian Finance (Supplementary and Extending) Act, 1931. 54The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi, Vol. 45, p. 433.

In February 1932 the UK Import Duties Act imposed a general 10% tariff on imports not already subject to duties, with exceptions being made for a variety of raw materials and foodstuffs, including raw cotton and wheat (Gordon, 1941, p. 219). Imports from India were exempted from the tariffs until November, giving time for an Anglo-Indian trade agreement to be signed at Ottawa.",
        "In March 1933 the 50% tariffs were extended through October; in April, India gave Japan six months notice of its intention to denounce the 1904 trade treaty, which would allow it to discriminate against Japanese imports ; later in the same month the Safeguarding of Industries Act empowered the Indian Governor General to impose \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093a duty of customs of such amount as he considers necessary to safeguard the interests of the industry affected\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d, in cases where goods were being imported \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093at such abnormally low prices that the existence of an industry established in British India is thereby endangered\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d (Act XIII). In May the UK further increased the pressure on Japan by giving twelve months notice of its intention to denounce those portions of the Anglo-Japanese trade treaty dealing with West Africa and the West Indies (Best, 2002, p. 83). On the 7th of June the tariff on non-British cotton goods was increased to 75%.",
        "57There was a final twist to the take of Indo-Japanese trade relations during this period (Friedman, 1940; Thackeray, 2017, p. 394). Traditionally, the Japanese role in Asian emancipation from Western rule had been a source of inspiration for Indian nationalists, but this image was damaged by Japan\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s imperialistic expansion in East Asia. Thus, Indian nationalists criticized the Japanese puppet state in Manchuria, and the Indian National Congress severely condemned the Japanese invasion of China in 1937. At the Haripura Congress of February 1938, Congress called for a boycott of Japanese goods by the Indian population. In August 1939, Nehru himself visited Chiang Kai-shek\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s headquarters in Chungking to demonstrate the solidarity of Indian nationalists with the Chinese Government.",
        "goods, although in the following year the Legislative Assembly asked the Indian government to denounce the Ottawa Agreement. There followed a long series of trade negotiations between the British and Indian governments which eventually resulted in a 1939 trade agreement that reduced the range of British imports accorded preferential treatment in India.58 Chaudhuri\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s (1983, p. 869) overall assessment is that \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093India, even before the Second World War, was coming closer towards the adoption of a much more positive policy of controlling her international economy, which was to become characteristic of official thinking after Independence\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d.",
        "58Another policy shift discouraging imports, especially from the UK, concerned the procedures for purchasing government stores. In 1924 control of these purchases was transferred from London to the Government of India, and by the 1930s \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093the bulk of stores were obtained by rupee tender in India rather than by sterling tender in London\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d (Tomlinson, 1979, p. 63). In this paper we are focussing on private imports, which were unaffected by this policy shift.",

        "What about the boycotts? Brown (1977, p. 129) argues that the 193031 \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093piece-goods trade boycott clearly had a marked effect since the decline in imports was greater than that of other commodities and affected British goods more than those from other countries\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d. Chatterji (1992, pp. 164-5) argues that while it is difficult to disentangle the impact of boycotts from all the other factors influencing Indian imports during the period, boycotts were a \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093factor working against Lancashire during the inter-War years\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d.

        "In addition to trade policy, Indian industries were also involved in a number of cartels which may have influenced trade flows during this period. Indian producers joined an international tea agreement in 1930. This was not renewed in 1931 and 1932, but from 1933 up to the Second World War it attempted to freeze the market share of the three participating countries, India, Ceylon and the Dutch East Indies (Gupta, 2001; Suslow, 2005). The tea agreements seem to have been moderately successful in 1930 in slowing the decline in tea prices, and to have stabilized and reflated tea prices after 1933, a period when prices for similar goods such as cocoa and coffee continued to fall (Gupta, 2001; Rowe, 1965, pp. 90, 148-51). Since the agreement mostly affected Indian producers and exporters of tea, its effect on tea imports remains unclear in the literature.",
        "The International Rubber Regulation Agreement of 1934 only came into force as international recovery after the Great Depression was already underway, and India was a fairly minor player in this market in comparison to Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, Ceylon and Indochina (Rowe, 1965, pp. 90, 152-4), so the consequences of the export quotas agreed upon by the contracting parties on the structure of Indian imports remains unclear as well. India was also probably affected by the Achnacarry and subsequent agreements in the petroleum industry (United States Congress, Senate, 1952), as well as by the Chadbourne sugar agreement, which India joined together with the UK in late 1937 (Dye and Sicotte, 2006).
