        "- Data for the United States on input output tables come from the \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093Benchmark Input Output Accounts for the US economy\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d (years 1992, and 1997). The U.S. input output accounts use a specific IO industry classification, which can then be transformed into the NIPA classification (Nacional Income and Product Account Tables) and then aggregated into the CPA classification of 29 manufacturing, mining and agriculture industries used in the paper. - Data for New Zealand on input output tables come from Statistics New Zealand. The data reports supply, use, and import tables for a total of 210 industries. We aggregate these industries into the CPA classification of 29 manufacturing, mining and agriculture industries. Calculation of distribution margins: We compute the distribution margins for total supply in the industry as the ratio of the value of trade and transport margins to the value of total supply in the industry at purchasers\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 prices.",
        "Purchaser prices include the cost of supply at basic prices plus the distribution (retail, wholesale and transportation) costs plus net taxes on products. To the extent that taxation differs significantly across countries for the same industry and across industries within a country, distribution margins may not be perfectly comparable in all cases. See Campa and Goldberg (2006). Calculation of imported input ratios: The Input Output tables report the value of the use matrix broken down the use of inputs by origin: domestic and imported. We calculate imported inputs into the production of each industry as the ratio between the total value of imported intermediate inputs by an industry to the value of total intermediate inputs.",
        "Techniques to construct the imported intermediate flows matrix in the input-output tables vary by country. Most countries used to some extent the import proportionality assumption. This technique assumes that an industry uses an import of a particular product in proportion to its total use of that product. This assumption is limiting since some industries might be using inputs from domestic and import sources in different proportions than the average of the economy. Countries made use of this assumption at very different levels of aggregation. For instance, the OECD reports that Germany and Denmark made used of over 2000 different commodities, while the U.S. and Japan used slightly over 500 and the United Kingdom less than 200."
