        "One of the early academic discussions is Corden (1972), which was inspired by the Werner Report and sets out many of the themes that the subsequent literature explores. Ingram (1973) is another notable early contribution. A recent comprehensive review of issues is contained in Kenen (1995).",
        "In the specific context of EMU, however, the prospect that the stability pact will hamstring national fiscal policies brings more urgency to the question of temporary shocks. See Eichengreen and Wyplosz (1998) for analysis of the stability pact's possible effects.",
        "McCormick (1997) discusses UK regional employment trends.",
        "A quick look at two other large European countries confirms the trend toward regional unemployment divergence on the continent. The standard deviation of regional unemployment rates in 19 French d\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a9partements has increased from 1.1 percent in 1980 to 3.7 percent in 1993 (compare with figure 1), while the average national unemployment rate has increased from 6 to 11 percent. For Spain the evolution seems even more unbalanced, as the standard deviation of 17 regional unemployment rates has increased from 3 percent in 1985 to 5.2 percent in 1993 with little net change in national average unemployment (Spain's unemployment rate stood near 21 percent in both years; see Eurostat, various years).",
        "The results are: Canada, slope = 0.78, /-statistic = 5.20, R2 = 0.75; Germany, slope = 0.77, /-statistic = 3.65, R2 = 0.58; Italy, slope = 1.35, /-statistic = 6.42, R2 = 0.68; United Kingdom, slope = 0.60, /-statistic = 8.77, R2 = 0.79; United States, slope = 0.26, /-statistic = 2.50, R2 = 0.15. Eichengreen (1990, p. 160) finds that unemployment rates in US regions are less serially correlated than the aggregate unemployment rates of European countries. He interprets the finding as evidence of slower labor-market adjustment in Europe. Here, we have shown that the empirical result carries over to regional unemployment rates outside the US.",
        "The distinction between means and deviations cannot always be drawn sharply, as benefits administration may respond endogenously to local unemployment, with further feedback effects on unemployment duration. In Canada, for example, the duration of unemployment benefits in a province and the minimum prior work requirement to qualify for benefits depend on the level of the provincial unemployment rate. See Green and Riddell (1997).",
        "The left-hand variable in the regression is the difference between average annual regional inflation and average annual national inflation (in percent per year). The right-hand variable is the average regional unemployment rate less the national average (in percent). Results are: Canada (1976-95), slope = -0.07, /-statistic = -0.62, R2 = 0.06; Germany (1976-95), slope = 0.01, /-statistic = 0.35, R2 = 0.01; Italy (1977-94), slope = -0.03, /-statistic = -2.46, R2 = 0.27.",
        "The left-hand variable in the regression is the per capita net transfer inflow in thousands of 1991 ECU. The right-hand variable is the average regional unemployment rate less the national average (in percent). Results are: Canada (1976-95), slope = 0.03, /-statistic = 3.12, R2 = 0.54; US (1976-85), slope = 0.10, /-statistic = 2.01, R2 = 0.05; Italy (1977-94), slope = 0.05, /-statistic = 3.57, R2 = 0.42. The transfer data for Canada, the US, and Italy, which we also use in econometric analysis in section 5, are not comparable, as those for Italy include social insurance payments only, and exclude, for example, flows related to tax payments. See the data appendix for details. We do not graph our German data, which are also severely limited.",
        "In Italy the official data on unemployment underestimate its true extent because of the Casa Integrazione Guadagni (CIG) program, which covers part of the wages of workers who otherwise might be laid off (see, for example, Bertola and Ichino 1995). Since CIG payments are quite persistent, classifying workers on CIG as unemployed would raise the correlation between social insurance inflows and true unemployment. Of course, many who are officially unemployed work in the underground economy. Notice that by entering the underground economy and evading taxes, officially unemployed workers automatically generate a net fiscal transfer into the region where they operate.",
        "Eichengreen (1993a) also documents that energy prices and national real exchange rates, which may be viewed as largely exogenous to regions, have asymmetrical effects on regional labor markets within the US, the UK, and Italy.",
        "Davis, Loungani, and Mahidhara (1997) and Blanchard and Katz (1992) provide alternative estimates for the US based on observable exogenous determinants of regional labor demand, for example, defense contracts. These results are broadly consistent with those for the US that we discuss below. Davis et al. find, however, some sensitivity of the adjustment pattern to the measure of employment used in estimation and suggest a somewhat slower response of migration in response to some shocks.",
        "Because of trends in technology or preferences, agglomeration economies, externalities, better local institutions, or for social and cultural reasons, some regions tend to attract more workers and firms over the long run while others have a secular tendency to decline in scale. Thus, employment trends may arise. (See Peri 1997 for an empirical study relating long-run employment growth in Italian cities and provinces to local socio-cultural characteristics).",
        "The choice of GDP deflators is meant to capture regional export competitiveness. Vaubel (1976, 1978), Eichengreen (1991), and von Hagen and Neumann (1994) study regional CPI-based real exchange rates. De Grauwe and Vanhaverbeke (1993) use data on regional unit labor costs.",
        "On redistribution in Germany, see Costello (1993).",
        "This is the approach taken by Persson and Tabellini (1996), who study the endogenous determination of risk-sharing and redistribution within a federal union. Their simplified model is not immediately applicable to making positive predictions about EMU because it omits certain elements, notably potential labor mobility, likely to be important in practice.",
        "The Werner Report is reproduced in Steinherr (1994, p. 25).",
        "Von H\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a4gen and Hammond (1997) illustrate some of the perils in trying to follow this route.",
        "Closely related securities have been proposed and studied by Shiller (1993). Nominal rather than real GDP indexing would protect buyers of the securities against inflation."
