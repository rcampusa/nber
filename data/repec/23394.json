        "For delisting that occurs on the last trading day of month t, we include only the regular monthly return for month t, and account for the delisting return at the beginning of the following month: DRt = rett and DRt+1 = derdt, in which rett is the regular full month return. Differing from Beaver, McNichols, and Price (2007), we do not account for these last-day delistings in the same month, because delisting generally occurs after the market closes. Also, delisting events are often surprises, and their payoffs cannot be determined immediately (Shumway 1997). As such, it might be problematic to incorporate delisting returns immediately on the last trading date in month t."
