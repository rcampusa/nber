The sample includes all i-z pairs for which i was purchased between 1992 and 1996, and z was a destination zip code for at least one such acquired plant in 1997.

        "To further explore the evolution of acquired establishments\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 shipping patterns, we run a series of logit regressions to estimate the probability that an acquired plant i will ship to any particular zip code z in 1997. In these regressions, the variables of interest measure the shipping patterns of the acquiring and acquired firms in 1993. In addition, we include the following variables as controls: establishment-by-destination-county fixed effects; controls for total sales to zip code z as well as the great-circle distance between i and z, an indicator variable equal to one if there exists an establishment from the same firm in 1997, and an indicator variable equal to one if establishment i shipped to z in 1993.",
        "To give an example, establishments in the motor-vehicle-related wholesale industries (SICs 5010-5019) had sales of $159 billion and purchases of $131 billion in 1993. We therefore set RJ = 0.82 (131/159) for all vehicle-related wholesale industries. For each commodity and industry within SICs 5010-5019, we impute aggregate purchases as 82% of the shipments of the respective commodity that we observe CFS establishments making. When J is a retail industry, we utilize the CFS data along with the Annual Retail Trade Survey (ARTS).",

        "Output. Plant output is its inventory-adjusted total value of shipments, deflated to 1987 dollars using industryspecific price indexes from the NBER Productivity Database. Labor Hours. Production worker hours are reported directly in the CM microdata. To get total plant hours, we multiply this value by the plant\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s ratio of total salaries and wages to production worker wages.

We measure labor productivity in terms of plant output per worker-hour, where output and total hours are measured as described above. Total Factor Productivity. We measure productivity using a standard total factor productivity index. Plant TFP is its logged output minus a weighted sum of its logged labor, capital, materials, and energy inputs.
