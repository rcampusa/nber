As a clarification, note that this conclusion does not deny the ability to screen out large numbers of very weak cases by reference to market power. In many instances, it will be fairly clear that market power is negligible in every sense, including post MP and thus, necessarily, \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u0086\u00e2\u0080\u00a0 MP , so that considerations of administrative costs and even a mild concern for false positives will warrant a prompt end to the investigation. Note further that the view that market definition is helpful in such cases \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c because often it is obvious that the correct market definition is quite broad \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c is misleading: we can only be confident that a narrow market definition is wrong if we already know that market power is low, as explained in subsection 2.2, so market definition does not, on reflection, assist in screening.",
