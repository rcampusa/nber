        "Comparisons of Income from the Monthly CPS to the CPS ASEC As a preliminary assessment of the validity of the family income measure in the Monthly CPS, we compare income reports in the Monthly CPS to those in the CPS ASEC (see Section VI of the text for additional analyses of the validity of this income measure). Because a majority of CPS ASEC survey participants also participated in the Monthly CPS, we can compare responses to the income questions in the CPS ASEC to those from the Monthly CPS holding constant either the interview date (i.e. looking at respondents who complete both the Monthly CPS and the 14 In 2020 we use 2019 CPS ASEC as the 2020 data will not become available until September.

        "withdrawals from the Unemployment Trust Fund should align closely with when UI benefits are actually received (Department of Labor, 1996).

These state level spending amounts are then aggregated to the recipiency rate tercile level.",
