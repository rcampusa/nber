Conceptually, the calculation of in\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a1ation is one that runs from the fourth quarter of the year before the survey to the fourth quarter of the year that is ten years beyond the survey year, representing a total of 40 quarters or 10 years. The fourth-quarter level is the quarterly average of the underlying monthly levels. Only the median response is provided for CPI10, and it is already reported as an in\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a1 ation rate, so we do not make any adjustments and cannot compute other moments or percentiles.",

        "In order to generate OOS forecasts that could have been made in real time, it is necessary to take a stand on the information set of the forecasters when each forecast was made. We assume that forecasters could have used all data released before the survey deadlines. Table A.1 lists the survey deadlines that are available, beginning with the 1990:Q3 survey. Before 1990:Q3, we make the conservative assumption that respondents only had data released by the \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6rst day of the second month of each quarter.",
