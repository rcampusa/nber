        "6. Estimation (backcasting method) was performed using BMDQ2T (a preliminary version of BMDP2T) on the UCLA computer. 22 TABLE 1 Test t-Statisties for Stationarity of - yt Country__t-Stati sties_ _WPI__CPI_Deflator United Kingdom -14.05 -15.03 + -4.77 Canada -11.40 -5.03 -8.48 France -5.02 -5.74 NA Germany -5.97 -5.53 + -6.19 Italy -6.90 -4.43 -1.53 t -10.60 f -11.18 Japan + -6.47 Netherlands -5.91 -5.95 NA Notes: 1. The t-statistics (11) are for the null hypothesis = 1 which would imply that Tt - yt is stationary (there is a deterministic parity value of log PPR) and that the moving-average process is noninvertible. These t-ratios are biased downward under the null hypothesis, but judging from Monte Carlo experiments reported in Plosser and Schwert (1977), ^ t < -4 should be sufficient to reject the null hypothesis at the 5 percent significance level or better.",

        "6See Stockman (1978a, 1980). Balassa (1954) and Samuelson (1964) provide different explanations for a trend. ^This applies to both a constant or a deterministic time trend which could be used for making predictions. 30 For non-random-walk cases, the early prediction errors are reduced by knowledge of past shocks, but this knowledge soon becomes unimportant. Nonetheless, the square-root rule is only approximate for these cases. g See Section II. ^For example, shifts in the real demand for money may be explained by real income taking a random walk and by random occurrence of institutional innovations. Or, permanent changes in purchasing power parity may reflect changes in commercial policy and changes in the relative prices of goods with differing weights in the price indices.",
        "3. All estimations are for the period July 1971-December 1978, except some of the deflators were not yet available for the whole period; for these cases (deflator only) the estimation ends as follows: United Kingdom and Japan in September 1978, Italy in December 1977. 4. The estimated standard error o of the white noise process is the single-period standard error of forecast computed by the conditional method. 5. Q(12) is the Box-Ljung variant of the Box-Pierce statistic for the \"portmanteau lack of fit test.\" It is approximately distributed as x (d.f.) where the degrees of freedom are indicated in square brackets following the value of Q. To reject the model at the 5 percent significance level, Q must exceed 21.0 for 12 d.f., 19.7 for 11 d.f., 18.3 for 10 d.f., and 16.9 for 9 d.f.; thus all the models pass this overall lack of fit test.",
