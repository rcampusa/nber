If they are not considered, Medicare accounts for about 11 percent of outlays. 2Medicare is a secondary payer for those over 65 actively employed with group insurance through their employer. Those few elderly not eligible for Social Security must pay a premium for Medicare Part A. 3Medicare eligibility for the disabled begins two years after eligibility for disability insurance. Those with renal disease are to be covered through any employer-based coverage for the first 30 months of eligibility.",
        "I5As a result of low volume increases, surgeons in 1994 and 1995 received 10.0 and 12.2 percent (nominal) increases in their conversion factor, whereas other non-surgical, non-primary care services only received increases slightly over 5 percent in each year. 16Nominal spending in Part A grew by a factor of 3 between 1984 and 1996, whereas federal tax revenue grew only by a factor of 2.2. 17The case on home health was Duggan v. Bowen, 691 F. Sup. 1487 (D.D.C. 1988) and on SNF services was Fox v. Bowen, 656 F. Sup. 1236 (D. Conn. 1986). l8The text oversimplifies in that there was a cost limit of 112 percent for each type of covered service (e.g., physical therapy, home health aide), although the limit was applied to aggregate agency payments. Also, the labor portion of the limit was adjusted by the hospital wage index for the area.",
        "19Routine services are room, board, and nursing services. This was the rule for freestanding SNFs. Reimbursement for hospital-based SNFs was somewhat greater. 20Ancillary services at SNFs grew particularly rapidly. In 1990 charges for physical, occupational, speech, and respiratory therapy were 15 percent of total Medicare SNF charges; by 1994 they were 30 percent (U.S. House of Representatives, 1996). 21 Although this comparison does not control for any age-specific factors affecting length of stay (it is not clear which direction they would go), it understates the contribution of the payment system because several private payers changed from paying hospitals a daily rate to a DRG basis of payment in this period. 22And the drop for users was greater than for non-users in each of the ten DRGs. 23Although it was to have been introduced on a budget neutral basis, the PPS was misnormed so that initial payments were too great.",
        "24Prior to 1981 eligibility required a hospital stay, but that requirement was dropped on the argument that making home health services more available would pay for itself by reducing nursing home costs, an argument which later data has not supported (Kemper, 1988). The lack of a hospital stay has led to a heterogeneous population of users. Some receive post-acute services (e.g., a few visits to verify normal recuperation), while others receive almost daily visits because they can barely manage to live independently. The 1988 court decision was directed at earlier regulations that required patients to need part time and intermittent services rather than part time or intermittent services."
