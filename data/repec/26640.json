        "D Macro Elasticities The capital-labor elasticity of substitution we have estimated is a micro elasticity and does not account for possible substitution across different firms andor industries. However, we can use our micro elasticity to derive an estimate of the macro elasticity by relying on the framework of Oberfield and Raval [2014]. The authors show that the aggregate elasticity of substitution is a weighted average of the micro elasticity of substitution and the elasticity of demand.",
