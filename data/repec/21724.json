One difference is that we do not exclude the self-employed or farmers from the sample, because we do not think that education decisions are made only in anticipation of becoming a wage-worker. Earnings We closely follow AKK, especially when handling top-coding. 1.

We use BLS crosswalks to change all occupation codes to OCC1990. To err on the safe side for our analysis, we define underemployment only for those cases that we can match the occupation code in the CPS to that in the requirements chart. Consequently, for approximately 25% of college graduates we are unable to determine whether they are underemployed. In these cases, we simply assume they work in college-level jobs.",
