        "'only in about three states, may a new bank elect against FDIC insurance and the additional balance-sheet regulation that cornes with it. Until universal reserve requirements dictated by Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act (D1DMCA) oi 1980 ..re fully phased in, member banks face higher res of ve r equirements than noimien.hers do. -22-7",
        "\"Kane (1983) discusses how deposit-insurance subsidies are shifted to selected borrowers and depositors, and suggests a series of reforms ranging from market-value accounting for insured institutions to changes in FDIC and FSLIC risk management, coverages, and pricing. Any subset of the reforms would allow scope economies to be pursued without surrendering control of the aggregate risk to which the FDIC and FSLIC are exposed. 3This act of redefinition recalls the Comptroller's unsuccessful attempt to rule that off-premises ATMs were not legally branch offices whose locations were subject to regulation under existing branch-banking laws."
