APPENDIX Let t = vec(A0 t) where At = [A0;t; A1;t:::; Ap;t] and vec( ) is the column stacking operator. We assume t evolves over time according to the following equation: t = t 1 + !t (6) where !t is Gaussian white noise vector process with covariance matrix .",
        "where 0 is n-dimensional column vector of zeros, Hn t and Hn 1 t are orthogonal matrices of dimension n n and n 1 n 1 respectively. To impose the restrictions we follow the standard algorithm of Rubio-Ramirez, Waggoner and Zha (2010). We draw Hn 1 t using the QR decomposition and compute the potential structural impulse response functions as in (??) with Qt = Bt(1) 1 StHn t , where St is the Cholesky factor of Bt tB0 t. We retain the draw if the sign restrictions are satis\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6ed. We collect a total of 500 draws at each point in time. With no loss of generality we order the shocks as follows: technology, demand, monetary policy and supply."
