Individuals with missing demographics (age, gender, marital status, and income) were excluded. We include data from North Carolina only and from the entire United States for comparison. The comparison to the ACS confirms the findings above. The analysis sample is more female, older, and higher earning relative to the average population. In addition, respondents are more likely to be married, have a college degree, and to be white.",
