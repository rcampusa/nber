        "We can measure the incidence of these specific infectious diseases as well as a broad array of other illnesses for the first time in the 1880 Population Census. Adopting specifications similar to Table 1, we find little evidence that individuals living on the frontier had differential (infectious) disease or illness.",
        "If the parasite-stress mechanism were salient, we would find that frontier locations exhibit significantly less prevalence of infectious diseases. While the relatively precise zeros in the table may be specific to 1880, this provides suggestive evidence that the parasite-stress channel is not a first-order factor in explaining the differential individualism on the frontier.",
        "C Data Sources and Construction Harmonization to 2010 Boundaries We harmonize all historical Census data to the 2010 boundaries using an approach suggested in Hornbeck (2010). First, we intersect the county shapefiles from each of the decadal census years with the 2010 county shapefile and calculate the area of each intersection. When the 2010 county falls in one or more counties of the earlier shapefile, each piece of the 2010 county is assigned a value equal to the share of the area of the piece in the earlier county multiplied by the total value of the data for the earlier county. Then, the data for each county in 2010 is the sum of all the pieces falling within its area. This harmonization procedure would be exact if all the data from the various years are evenly distributed across county areas.",
