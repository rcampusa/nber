        "5. An inflation-adjusted measure of the deficit would exhibit an even sharper increase between 1981 and 1983 because the inflation rate was falling. However, any particular deficit measure will suffer from a number of problems. On general measurement issues, see, for example, Eisner (1989) and Kotlikoff (1986).",
        "6. The seven-year Treasury rate is the constant maturity series from the Federal Reserve Bulletin. The mortgage rate and the volatility measure are both based on data from Flendershott and Van Order (1989). The mortgage rate is the conventional commitment mortgage coupon rate adjusted for points, where that adjustment is equal to (Points-1)/(4.2+ .106slope -.69 vol), where slope is the difference between the seven-year and sixmonth Treasury rates and volatility (vol) is one-half the cumulative absolute change in the seven-year Treasury rate over the previous 20 weeks. We plot semiannual averages of weekly data.",
