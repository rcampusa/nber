        "ONLINE APPENDICES A. Construction of Neighborhood Characteristics This appendix provides definitions and sources for covariates used throughout the paper or shown in the Opportunity Atlas as neighborhood characteristics. Our source data are primarily at the tract level. We use 2010 Census tract definitions throughout. For covariates defined using 2000 tract boundaries, we use the 2010 Census Tract Relationship Files from the US Census Bureau to crosswalk 2000 tracts to 2010 tracts, weighting the 2000 tract-level covariates by the fraction of the 2000tract population that lives within the 2010 tract boundaries.",
        "Tract-Level Characteristics: Jobs Within 5 Miles (2015). The number of jobs within 5 miles of a tract is constructed using block-level information on the total number of jobs from the Workplace Area Characteristics (WAC) data files in the LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES) provided by the Census Bureau. For each tract we compute the number of jobs within 5 miles as the total number of jobs in own and neighboring tracts whose centroids fall within a radius of 5 miles from the centroid of the tract.",
        "Number of High Paying Jobs Within 5 Miles (2015). The number of high paying jobs within 5 miles of a tract is constructed using block-level information on the number of jobs with earnings greater than $3,333 per month from the Workplace Area Characteristics (WAC) data files in the LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES) provided by the Census Bureau. For each tract we compute the number of high paying jobs within 5 miles as the number of high paying jobs in own and neighboring tracts whose centroids fall within a radius of 5 miles from the centroid of the tract.",
        "Job Growth (2004-2013). The measure of job growth at the tract level shown in the Opportunity Atlas is constructed using block-level information on the total number of jobs from 2004 to 2013 from the Workplace Area Characteristics (WAC) data files in the LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES) provided by the Census Bureau. We compute job growth in each tract as the average annualized growth rate from 2004 to 2013.",
        "Job Density (2013). The measure of job density at the tract level shown in the Opportunity Atlas is constructed combining block-level information on total number of jobs in 2013 from the Workplace Area Characteristics (WAC) data files in the LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES) provided by the Census Bureau and tract-level information on land area in square miles from the 2010 Census Gazetteer Files. We compute job density as the number of jobs per square mile in each tract.",
        "Employment Rate (2000). The rate of employment is constructed using tract-level data on labor market measures from tables NP043E and NP043C of the Census long form SF3a dataset obtained from the National Historical Geographic Information System (NHGIS) database. We construct the rate of employment in 2000 for each tract as the total employed population (the sum of employed females and employed males) divided by the total population 16 years and over.",
        "Poverty Rate (1990, 2000, 2006-2010, 2011-2015). The poverty share variable is constructed as the share of individuals below the federal poverty line in each tract. For the measure in 1990 we use table NP117 from the 1990 Census form SFT3, for the measure in 2000 we use table NP087B from the 2000 Census long form SF3a, and for the measures for 2006-2010 and 2011-2015 we use table C17002 from the American Community Survey in relevant years, all obtained from the NHGIS database.",
        "Single Parent Share (1990, 2000, 2006-2010). We define the share of single parents in each tract as the number of households with female head (and no husband present) or male head (and no wife present) with own children under 18 years old present divided by the total number of households with own children present. We use table NP19 of the 1990 Census form SFT3 for the measure in 1990, tables NP018E and NP018G of the 2000 Census SF1a form for the measure in 2000, and table B11003 of the 2006-2010 American Community Survey for the measure in 2010. All obtained from the NHGIS database.",
        "Racial Shares (2000, 2010). Racial shares are calculated from the Census long form SF1a, tables NP008A and NP004E, taken from NHGIS database. All races (except Hispanic) exclude Hispanics and Latinos.",
        "Share Foreign Born (2010). The share foreign born variable that is shown in the Opportunity Atlas is constructed as the number of foreign born residents in the 2010 Census divided by the sum of native and foreign born residents (long form SF3a, table NP021A) obtained from the NHGIS database.",
        "Share with Short Commute to Work and Mean Commute Time (2000, 2006-2010). The share of workers with a short commute to work and mean commute time are constructed using tract-level data from table NP031B of the 2000 Decennial Census or tract-level data from table B08303 of the the 2006-2010 American Community Survey, both obtained from the NHGIS database. Fraction with a short to commute to work is computed by taking the share of people who commute less than 15 minutes to work over all workers 16 years and over who did not work at home. Mean commute time is constructed using the share of workers commuting to work in specific bins (&lt; 5 minutes, 5-9 minutes, 10-14 minutes, etc.), imputing the mean time commuted in a given bin (i.e. for 5-9 minutes, imputing mean commute time of 7 minutes), and then calculating a sum of imputed mean commute times within each bin weighted by the share commuting.",
        "Kid Counts (2000). The counts of kids by race and gender used throughout the paper and shown in the Opportunity Atlas are constructed for kids under 18 using tract-level data from tables NP012F and NPCT012H of the 2000 Decennial Census using the NHGIS database.",
        "Census Return Rate (2010). The Census return rate variable used in Figure V and shown in the Opportunity Atlas is obtained from tract-level data from the Census 2016 Planning Database.",
        "It is calculated as the number of 2010 Census mail forms completed and returned over the number of valid occupied housing units where a Census form was expected to be delivered for mail return to Census.",
        "Mean Household Income (2000). The measure of mean household income used in Figure V is constructed using tract-level data from table NP052A of the 2000 Decennial Census found in the NHGIS database.",
        "Median Household Income (1990, 2012-2016). The measure of median household income shown in the Opportunity Atlas is constructed using tract-level data from table NP80A of the 1990 Decennial Census and table B19013 of the American Community Survey (2012-2016) found in the NHGIS database.",
        "High School Graduate Wage Growth (2005-2014). The measure of high school graduate wage growth is constructed using data from the 2005-2009 and 2010-2014 American Community Survey provided by NHGIS database. High school graduate wages at the tract level are computed by dividing the average high school graduate annual earnings by the product of overall average weekly hours worked and 52. High school graduate wage growth is then computed as the difference in logarithms between high school graduate wages in 2010-2014 and school graduate wages in 20052009.",
        "Share College Graduate (2000, 2006-2010). The share college graduate variable shown in the Opportunity Atlas is constructed using tract-level data from table NP037C of the 2000 Census long form SF3a or tract-level data from table B15002 of the 2006-2010 American Community Survey (both obtained from the NHGIS database), and is calculated as the number of people aged 25 or older who have a bachelor\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s degree, master\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s degree, professional school degree, or doctorate degree, divided by the total number of people aged 25 or older in a tract.",
        "Population Density (2000, 2010). The population density variable used in Figure VIIIc and shown in the Opportunity Atlas is calculated as the total tract-level population in the Census obtained from NHGIS database (long form SF1a, table H7V) divided by tract land area in square miles from the 2010 Census Gazetteer Files.",
        "Median Two-Bedroom Rent (2011-2015). The median two-bedroom rent variable that is used in Figure XIII and shown in the Opportunity Atlas is constructed from tract-level ACS data (20112015) and is defined as the median gross rent for renter-occupied housing units with two bedrooms that pay cash rent (table AD79).",
        "Characteristics at Other Levels of Geography: Job Growth (1990-2010, 2004-2013). The measure of job growth at the CZ or MSA level that we use in Figure VI and Online Appendix Figure III is constructed as the percentage change in employment between 1990 and 2010 in each CZ/MSA using county-level data from the Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS) released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The measure of job growth at the county and CZ level that we use in the Opportunity Atlas is constructed as the average annualized growth rate in employment between 2004 and 2013 in each CZ using county level data from the Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS) released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
