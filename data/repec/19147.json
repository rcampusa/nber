Atack (1987) provides some limited comparisons of hand and machine productivity using these data noting that they imply a much larger effect of scale than the census manufacturing data do. Other than Atack\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s preliminary analysis, these data have been neglected by economic historians.",
