        "\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2 We excluded households with total expenditures of over $400,000 per year (in $2005). These 98 households are the top 0.1% percent of the total expenditure distribution. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2 We excluded households that changed their state of residence during the year; in which the head\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s education was missing (4,134 households); where the household\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s region was missing (617 households); and from states with fewer than 30 minorities in the CEX over the entire sample period. Excluded states were: ID, MT, NH, ND, RI, SD, VT, WV, WY. The reason for this restriction is that in the second half of the paper we compare racial consumption patterns conditional on the mean income of Blacks, Whites and Hispanics in their state residence. Theory Appendix We provide the solution to a particular parametric utility specification, and a formulation of status given as own income, relative to average community group income.",
