Greenwood, Hercowitz and Huffman (1988) show that one con construct utility and production functions that allow consumption to move procyclically in response to a change in the expected productivity of investment, but this appears to be a knife-edge result. 6. Another explanation for procyclical productivity is endogenous technological improvement in response to aggregate-demand shocks. We argue that endogenous technological improvement through increasing returns, learning, and \"shake out\" of low-productivity firms were important historically for over long periods of time and were relevant for understanding Kuznets cycles. But given the long lags of technological change, endogenous technological improvement was likely not very important for year-to-year fluctuations.",

        "8. Interestingly, similar evidence for the nineteenth century (reported in Bowley, 1904) was cited by Keynes (1931, 165), and formed the basis for his view that nominal wage rigidity was greater than nominal price rigidity: It is decade from 1886 to 18% with which I am concerned, and chiefly with the years of declining prices from 1890 to 1896. Between 1890 and 18% Sauerbeck's Wholesale Index fell about 18 per cent, and the Economist's about 14 percent....But there was no evidence of Income Deflation. On the contrary, rates of money wages were moving slightly upwards, and other money-incomes were also on the up-grade, apart from a slight sagging in 1892-93 owing to the very severe unemployment in those years...Opp. 164-165).",
        "9. Intersectoral substitution is not the only explanation for higher historical labor turnover in manufacturing. Margo (1990a) argues that some of the relatively short duration of historical employment can be attributed to changes in the composition of the workforce, and changes in unemployment relief policies in the 1930s."
