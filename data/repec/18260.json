        "In contrast with Kroszner, Laeven and Klingebiel (2007) we are not able to measure R&D intensity as the median level of R&D expenses over sales in each 4-digit CIC industry. This is because many firms engage in no R&D and consequently the median levels of R&D many Chinese CIC industries is zero. Moreover, R&D expenses are reported in the data set only in year 2005-2006.",
        "Finally, we define imported input intensity as the imported inputs as a ratio to the total exports for each 4-digit CIC industry over the period 2002-2006. We also created an alternative measure, which defines imported input intensity as the ratio of imported inputs to total output for each 4digit CIC industry. However, our results were similar, regardless of measure chosen. In contrast with the Compustat dataset of US firms, which records capital expenditures directly (Compustat variable #128), the NBS does not have a direct measure. Capital expenditure are incurred when businesses spend money to buy fixed assets or intangible assets, or to add to the value of any existing fixed asset with a useful life extending beyond the taxable year. Since the NBS data set does not include a measure of payables, we are not able to include payables in our construction of cash flows from operations.",
        "Our measure of R&D intensity (R&D) is the share of industrial R&D expenses over industrial sales by 4-digit CIC industry for the period 2005-2006.37 We also create an alternative measure of industry R&D intensity which is defined as the median level of new product share in the total output (Newprod) for firms within each 4-digit CIC industry. Similarly, the Capital-to-labor ratio (K intensity) is the median level of the ratio of fixed assets over number of employees by 4-digit CIC industry for the period 2002-2006.",
        "External finance dependence is defined as the fraction of capital expenditures not financed by cash flows from operations. Since the NBS data set does not include direct measures of capital expenditures, we construct a measure of capital expenditure which is defined as the sum of the See http://tariffdata.wto.org/ReportersAndProducts.aspx. firm\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s increase in its long term investment, fixed assets and intangible assets as well as the firm\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s current year capital depreciation.35 Cash flow from operations is defined as in Rajan and Zingales (1998, p564): the sum of cash flow, plus inventory reductions, and reductions in receivables.36 The median level of external finance dependence in each 4-digit CIC industry averaged over the years 2004-2006 is used as the external financing dependence measure for each industry.",
        "Industry Level Variables To study how the benefits of imported intermediate inputs are related to industry characteristics, we used the NBS data set to construct industry level variables following Kroszner, Laeven and Klingebiel (2007). These industry variables include industry measures of external finance dependence, R&D intensity, new product intensity, imported input intensity and capital intensity. The industry medians for these variables at the 2-digit CIC level are reported in Table 1.",
        "Following Ahn, Khandelwal and Wei (2011), we identify the set of intermediary firms based on Chinese characters that have the English-equivalent meaning of \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093importer\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d, \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093exporter\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d, and/or \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093trading\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d in the firms\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 name. After firm-identifiers for the NBS and Customs data sets were matched, we merged the trade data to the information on firm characteristics and operations. The original Customs data record all firm-level trade transactions according to the Chinese 8-digit HS code and import country of origin, or export country of destination. Observations that list China as the export destination or China as the source country for imports were excluded. Finally, since processing trade imports are not subject to tariffs and may have different economic determinants than ordinary trade, our core data set is based on the subset of firms that were not engaged in processing trade.",
        "The NBS data set for 2002 to 2006 was matched to firm-level data on imports and exports, which is constructed from the transaction level Chinese Customs data (hereafter Customs data set). Since the two datasets use different firm identification numbers, the first round of matching is based on the firm names provided in the two data sets. However, to verify firm identity, and to maximize the number of successful matches while excluding spurious matches, the matching process is extended to a number of firm identifiers including zip-code, phone number, street address and manager\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s name.",
        "Data Appendix Firm Level Variables China&apos;s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) conducts an annual survey of manufacturing enterprises. When aggregated to the industry level, these data are the basis of the industrial statistics reported in China&apos;s Statistical Yearbook. Two types of firms are included in the survey: (1) all SOEs, and (2) non-SOEs with annual sales at or above five million Renminbi. From this data set, we attain information on individual firm operations and financial statistics, such as firm employment and firm sales. This data set also provides information on the ownership structure of the firms that allows us to assign firms to one of the following four designations: (1) State Owned Enterprise, or SOE, (2) Private, (3) Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, or HMT, and (4) other non- HMT foreign. Due to noise or misreporting in the data, the data are cleaned following the procedures of Feenstra, Li and Yu (2011).",
