        "A Appendix: Additional Features of Annual Earnings Test70 When current bene\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6ts are lost to the AET, future scheduled bene\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6ts are increased in some circumstances. This is sometimes called bene\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6t enhancement. As we describe, for workers NRA or older in the pre-2000 period (when they faced the AET), bene\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6t enhancement attenuates the eective AET BRR for individuals considering earning enough to trigger the bene\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6t enhancement, but it does not attenuate the eective AET BRR for those considering earning less than this amount.",
        "Note that in our empirical estimation, the region we dummy out near the kink z is [z 2800; z + 2800]. Thus, if all of the bunchers arrived at the kink from initial earnings levels between z and z + 2800, we could \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6nd zero bunching despite substantial actual bunching. However, the earnings densities clearly show that the polynomial does not substantially overpredict bunching in the region above the exempt amount. Moreover, the densities also show no evidence of bunching near notches in the budget set created by the DRC. We alternatively use a bandwidth of $500 and \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6nd similar results.",
        "This is just the constant term in the polynomial, since the zi is distance to zero. So our estimate of normalized excess mass is ^B = ^EM ^0 : (B.2) We consider two approaches for constructing standard errors. First, from Equation (B.2), it is straightforward to apply the Delta method. Second, we employ the parametric bootstrap procedure of Chetty, Friedman, Olsen and Pistaferri (2011). This bootstrap draws with replacement from the estimated distribution of errors i from Equation (B.1). For each set of draws, we get a new value of pi and use these new values to re-estimate B. The standard deviation across draws of B is our measure of the standard error ^B. In practice these two procedures produced extremely similar results, so we only report standard errors from the bootstrap.",
        "C Appendix: Social Security Data Our data come from the Social Security Master Earnings File (MEF), which is described more extensively in Song and Manchester (2007). The MEF is a longitudinal history of Social Security taxable earnings for all Social Security Numbers (SSNs) in the U.S. Our data are a one percent random sample of SSNs; we randomly extract SSNs from the database and follow each of these individuals over the full time period. The AET is based on earnings as measured in this dataset. Prior to 1978, the data have information on annual FICA earnings; since 1978, the data have information on uncapped wage compensation. Before 1978, the data do not clearly distinguish between earnings from self-employment and nonself -employment earnings, but we are able to distinguish them in the data starting in 1978. The data also contain information on date of birth, date of death, and sex.",
        "We supplement the MEF with information from the Master Bene\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6ciary Record (MBR) \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6le, which contains data on the day, month, and year that people began to claim Social Security (and other variables). The majority of workers excluded from OASDI coverage are in four main categories: (1) federal civilian employees hired before January 1, 1984; (2) agricultural workers and domestic workers whose earnings do not meet certain minimum requirements; (3) individuals with very low net earnings from self-employment (generally less than $400 per year); and (4) employees of several state and local governments. However, civil service and other government workers are covered by Medicare and are therefore present in the MBR. In choosing our main sample, we take into account a number of considerations. It is desirable to show a constant sample in making comparisons of earnings densities. Meanwhile, the AET only aects people who claim OASI, and thus we wish to focus on claimants.",
        "However, many individuals claim OASI at ages over the Early Entitlement Age (62), implying that they have not claimed at younger ages but have claimed by older ages. This implies that to investigate a constant sample, we cannot simply limit the sample to claimants at each age (because many people move from not claiming to claiming). To balance these considerations, our main sample at each age and year consists of individuals who ultimately claim in the year they turn 65 or earlier. We show that the results are robust to other sample de\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6nitions. Because we focus on the intensive margin response (consistent with Saez (2010) and subsequent papers on bunching), we further limit the sample to observations with positive earnings in our main analysis.",
        "Information on AET parameters is from table 2.A.20 and 2.A.29 of the Annual Statistical Supplement to the Social Security Bulletin. Friedberg (1998, 2000) provides a thorough description of these rules. All dollar amounts are de\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a1ated to 2010 dollars using the CPI-U.",
        "The standard deviation is large because of very rare abberrant large values of earnings (as documented in Utendorf 2001/2); these do not aect our estimates in the \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6gures or tables because they are far above the AET exempt amount, and they aect mean earnings far less than they aect the standard deviation. The results are robust to winsorizing.",
        "In 1983-1999, the AET is assessed on earnings until the month in which the individual turns age 70. For simplicity, in our baseline sample we measure age as calendar year minus year of birth. Thus, if an individual turns age 70 later in the year\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the extreme case, on December 31\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d she will have had an incentive to bunch at the kink during nearly the entire year when she is classi\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6ed as age 70 in our data. As a result, her yearly earnings may appear to be located at or near the kink even though she is bunching at the kink applicable to 69-year-olds through almost all of the calendar year over which her earnings are observed. However, the \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6gure shows that signi\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6cant bunching occurs at age 71, which cannot be due to this coarse measure of birth dates. Thus, the results do show a delay in complete adjustment.",
        "We have also found substantial and signi\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6cant (p < 0:01) bunching at age 70 among those born in January, who no longer face the AET immediately in January of the year they turn 70 and therefore should not show excess bunching at this age in the absence of adjustment frictions. Likewise, we \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6nd a spike in mean earnings growth from age 70 to age 71 among those born in January. In our sample period, the AET applied to ages 62-71 before 1983, and it applied to ages under NRA in 2000 and after. In these time periods, examining only those born in January also shows a delay in responding to the removal of the AET.",
        "We select data from 1990-1999. During this period, the AET explicit bene\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6t reduction rate was constant. 1990-1999 also represent natural years to investigate because large sample sizes are not available in the LEHD prior to 1990. When we include other years and age groups in the LEHD sample, we \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6nd similar results to those reported here. Note that the population we investigate is not constant over this period, because (among other reasons) an increasingly broad set of states is included in the LEHD over time. Data are available on 13 states in 1990, climbing to 28 states by 1999. In a given quarter, we include in our sample all states whose data are available. Holding the sample constant yields very similar results.",
        "In other words, we answer the question: if there are adjustment costs and we mis-specify our estimate of the elasticity by assuming that we are in a frictionless setting, in what way do we mis-estimate the elasticity? As we show, if we face an adjustment cost as in the Sharp Change model, but we estimate the elasticity using the Saez (2010) formula applicable to a frictionless setting, we will see the elasticity estimate increase when we move from a larger kink to a smaller kink (as in our empirical application, and as we observe empirically in Figure F.21). Thus, an increase in the Saez (2010) estimate of the elasticity\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the sort that we observe empirically\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a telltale sign that we are operating under a Sharp Change model.",
        "We \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6rst present the formula for the elasticity in a frictionless model, as in Saez (2010).",

        "Thus, eS 2 eS 1 is weakly greater than zero: the Saez (2010) frictionless elasticity estimate weakly increases (as we observe empirically).

E.7.4 Sharp Change Approach with Linear Adjustment Cost Note that under the Sharp Change approach, with a linear adjustment cost we can derive an approximation for bunching (analogously to Section E.6.2) to show that: ~b2 =  z2 d 2 2 L 1 0 L (z2 z ) F d 1 L :",
        "Speci\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6cally, we use the distribution of earnings at age 61 over 1986-1988 and 1992-1994 to estimate the parameters of a lognormal earnings distribution, ( z; z), using maximum likelihood. (Individuals age 61 are not subject to the AET but are not far removed in age from those at retirement age, making this a reasonable counterfactual earnings density for those subject to the AET). We then solve for bunching using: Bk( k; zk; ; ) = log zub k z z log zlb k z z where ( ) is the standard normal CDF. We estimate bootstrapped standard errors. Observe that the estimated vector of parameters (^; ^) is a function of the estimated amount of bunching; call this function (b). To compute bootstraped standard errors, we use the bootstrap procedure of Chetty et al.",
        "(2011) to obtain 200 bootstrap samples of b. For each bootstrap sample, we compute ^ and ^ as the solution to (E.7). The standard deviation of ^ and ^ across bootstrap samples is the bootstrap standard error, and we compute con\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6dence intervals analogously. We es64 timate whether an estimate is signi\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6cantly dierent from zero by assessing how frequently the constraint 0 binds in our estimation. Given this constraint, p-values are from a one-sided test of equality with zero. We have also estimated the standard errors using the delta method and obtained similar results.",
