        "Immigration Status: In each year, only people who are not citizens or who were naturalized citizens are counted as immigrants. This is done using the variable CITIZEN and by attributing the status of foreign-born to people when the variable is equal to 2 or 3. In 1960, the variable is not available and the selection is done using the variable BPLD (birthplace, detailed) and by attributing the status of foreign-born to all of those for which BPLD\u00c3\u00af\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00be15000, except for the codes 90011 and 90021 which indicate U.S. citizens born abroad.",
        "Weeks Worked in a Year: For the censuses 1960 and 1970 the variable used to define weeks worked in the last year is WKSWORK2, which defines weeks worked in intervals. We choose the median value for each interval so that we impute to individuals weeks worked in the previous year according to the following criteria: 6.5 weeks if wkswork2=1; 20 weeks if wkswork2=2; 33 weeks if wkswork2=3; 43.5 weeks if wkswork2=4; 48.5 weeks if wkswork2=5; 51 weeks if wkswork2==6. For the censuses 1980, 1990, 2000 and ACS we use the variable wkswork1 which records the exact number of weeks worked last year.",
        "Hours Worked in a Week: For census years 1960 and 1970 the variable used is HRSWORK2 which measures the hours worked during the last week, using intervals. We attribute to each interval its median value and measure the number of hours per week worked by an individual according to the following criteria: 7.5 hours if hrswork2=1; 22 hours if hrswork2=2; 32 hours if hrswork2=3; 37 hours if hrswork2=4; 40 hours if hrswork2=5; 44.5 hours if hrswork2=6; 54 hours if hrswork2=7; 70 hours if hrswork2==8. For the censuses 1980, 1990, 2000 and ACS we use the variable UHRSWORK which records the exact number of hours worked in a usual week by a person. Hours Worked in a Year: This is the measure of labor supply by an individual and it is obtained by multiplying Hours Worked in a Week by Weeks Worked in a Year, as defined above.",
