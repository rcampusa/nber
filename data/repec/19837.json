        "5 Appendix 5.1 Data Construction: Employment, Output, and Productivity Our industry-level employment, output, and productivity outcomes are derived from the NBER-CES Manufacturing Industry Database, which is based largely on the Annual Surveys of Manufacturing (Becker, Gray and Marvakov 2013).8 Because this database straddles the 1997 conversion from SIC industry codes to NAICS codes, the providers of the NBER-CES publish both a version expressed in 1987 SIC codes and a version expressed in 1997 NAICS codes.",
        "To minimize the risk of classification error, we aggregate the NBER-CES to the level of 387 consistent industries.9 First, we use a weighted crosswalk to convert the NAICS-based data from the years 1997-2009 into 1987 SIC codes, and append the SIC-based data from the years 1977-1996.",
        "Because we focus on productivity growth within IT-using rather than IT-producing industries, most of our results (except Figure 1A) exclude a set of computer-producing industries. Following Houseman, Bartik, and Sturgeon (2013), we define the computer-producing sector as NAICS 334. 8 While most of the variables in the NBER-CES are taken from the Annual Surveys of Manufacturing, price deflators and depreciation rates are derived from other data published by the Census Bureau, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Federal Reserve Board. NBER-CES data and documentation are available at http://www.nber.org/nberces. 9",
        "We observe each industry\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s expenditures on computers and peripheral equipment for the years 1977, 1982, 1987, 1992, 2002, and 2007 (comparable data are not available for 1997).12 After mapping all computer investment data into SIC87dd codes,13 we define an industry\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s raw computer investment rate as 100 times the ratio of its computer expenditures to its total capital expenditures.",
        "We impute a small number of missing values.14 Our preferred measure of computer investment rates is a weighted average of the 1977, 1982, 1987, 1992, 2002, and 2007 rates. To account for the unavailability of 1997 computer investment rates, we place weight 5/32 on the 1977-1992 rates and weight 3/16 on the 2002 and 2007 rates (so that the weighted average year is 1992, the midpoint of 1977\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c2007). We also report results using 1977/1982 rates, 1987/1992 rates, and 2002/2007 rates (in each case computing the simple average of computer investment rates in the indicated years).",
        "Our measure of technology usage is derived from the US Census Bureau\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s 1988 and 1993 Sur11 Specifically, our computer sector accounts for over 98% of NAICS 334 employment throughout our sample period, and our non-computer sector accounts for over 99% of non-NAICS 334 employment throughout our sample period. 12 Computer investment data for 1977, 1982, and 1987 were provided to us by Eli Berman. Data for 1992 were transcribed from the manufacturing industry series at http://www.census.gov/prod/www/economic_census.html.",
        "We impute missing 1992 values for 27 industries by linearly interpolating their 1987 and 2002 computer investment rates. We impute missing 2007 values for two industries by extrapolating from their 2002 computer investment rates using manufacturing-wide changes in computer investment rates between 2002 and 2007.",
        "This specification normalizes the coefficient on the IT variable to zero in the base year, and hence the series {\u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b281, \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b282, ..., \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b209} may be read as the level of the coefficient on IT in each subsequent year relative to 1980.",
        "Figures A.2, A.3, and A.4 show that IT-intensive industries have experienced relative declines in real shipments, nominal shipments, and employment since 1990. These figures provide some reassurance that our results are not sensitive to the precise timing of the IT measure. Supplementing the outcomes investigated in the main text of the paper, Figures A.5, A.6, A.7, and A.8 explore the connection between IT intensity and four additional outcomes: TFP, nominal value added, the shipments deflator, and the wage bills paid to non-production and production workers.",
        "Our TFP results (Figure A.5) reveal no evidence of relatively faster productivity growth in ITusing industries. When measured by technology usage, IT intensity is essentially uncorrelated with TFP growth between 1990 and 2009. When measured by computer investments, IT intensity is actually negatively correlated with TFP growth over this period. While we prefer real shipments per worker as a measure of productivity (since TFP relies on potentially erroneous input price deflators), these results underscore the non-robustness of the relationship between IT and productivity in manufacturing industries. The results for nominal value added (Figure A.6) parallel those for real and nominal shipments.",
        "Using either measure of IT intensity (computer investments or technology usage), IT-intensive industries experienced relative declines in nominal value added beginning in the early 1990s. Although real and nominal shipments are our preferred output measures because they are not susceptible to problems arising from changes in input deflators, it is reassuring that nominal value added yields similar conclusions. In Figure A.7, we find no evidence that IT-intensive industries have experienced relative declines in their shipments deflators (i.e., output prices). This is a surprising result: if IT allows firms to lower production costs, one would expect prices to fall in IT-intensive industries. It is theoretically possible, however, that declining production costs are offset by increases in product quality that cannot be detected in our data. Finally, Figure A.8 provides ambiguous evidence on the relationship between IT and skill intensity.",
        "The ratio of computer investments to total capital expenditures may be influenced by factors that have little to do with an industry\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s susceptibility to computerization, such as the depreciation rate of its non-computer capital. For each of our core outcomes, we therefore run a regression of the form \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u0086\u00e2\u0080\u00a0 log Yjt = \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b4t + \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b2 \u00c3\u0083\u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u0086\u00e2\u0080\u00a0ITjt + ejt, where log Y is 100 times the log of an outcome of interest, IT is 100 times the ratio of computer investments to total investments, the \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u0086\u00e2\u0080\u00a0 operator signifies annualized changes over 5- or 10-year periods, and \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b4 is a full set of time effects. In a departure from the rest of the paper, the computer investment rate used here is not standardized to have zero mean and unit standard deviation (results are qualitatively similar when we use standardized measures). We pool annualized changes over the periods 1977-1982, 1982-1987, 1987-1992, 1992-2002, and 2002-2007. Except for column (1), all specifications exclude computer-producing industries.",
