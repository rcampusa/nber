        "23This suggestion is related to a major theme of a recent paper by ciristiano and ichenbaujrj (1992).",
        "24A weakness of our procedure that pertaims to this sample period is as follows. Since our simulation exercise presumes that total reserves (not currency) is the component of the base that responds during the week to open market actions, we are implicitly assuming that the regime is not one with lagged reserve requirements (which makes the demand for reserves almost entirely predetermined), That is of course counterfactual for 1974\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d1979. 25There is a slight timing inconsistency in my procedure, since quarter\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dto\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dquarter growth rates based on quarterly averages have been used for each week within a quarter.

        "i984-Oct. 1987. But policy behavior during the 1988\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d1990 period should be more like that of 1974\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d1979, since both of these featured tighter control of the funds rate. During i984\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009di987 the operating procedure was one of the borrowed reserves targeting type.",
        "&apos;5For additional discussion of this point, see McCallum (1988).",
        "9Regarding this claim. Humphrey (1992, p. 572) asserts that Bagehot undoubtedly would have concurred I 10Cagan also puts forth the argument that the incremental social costs of maintaining the discount window (and reserve requirements) are low, given that elimination of deposit insurance and its associated regulatory apparatus is politically out of the question.",
        "7Although their main purpose is to present their own analysis and proposal, Merton and Bodie (1993) provide a large number of references. A synopsis of bank failures is provided by Goodtiart and Shoenmaker (1993). As I have not provided evidence on this point, my statement is actually a conjecture. To develop such evidence adequately, would itself consitute a major study.",
        "Store typical, I believe, is the view taken by Nakajima and Taguchi (1993).",
        "His proposal is significantly different from that of Goodfriend and King, however, since it calls for a system with 100 percent reserves and does not promote interest rate smoothing. Other recent arguments for closing the discount window have been put forth by Kaufman (1991) and Schwartz (1992). 4Since Bagehot&apos;s proposal involves a penalty rate, it would appear that one could replace at times of crisis with at all times. This implication was not mentioned by Bagehot, however, and has also been ignored by most writers on the subject.",
