A Description of Data Our individual-level data to which we have merged corporation information, are based on administrative registers maintained by Statistics Norway. We use three main data sources. First, we have individual income tax information (Individual Data). Second, we have information on all businesses (Corporation Data). Finally, we have the full shareholder register (Ownership Data). Each individual can be identified over time and across registers by the same unique personal identification number provided all Norwegians at birth or upon immigration, and each corporation can also be identified over time and across registers by one unique firm identifier.",
        "The second data source (Corporation Data) comprises of all businesses incorporated and taxable in Norway over the 1999-2013 period (including also corporations like banks, insurance companies and financial holding companies, but not public mutual funds). This data cover the balance sheet with detailed equity and debt information as well as the profit and loss statement of each corporation (information originating from the Norwegian Tax Authorities). Using these data, we construct a panel of 313,249 corporations for which we can compute the change in accumulated retained earnings for the period 2000-2013. In total, we have 2,059,972 corporation-year observations with changes in accumulated retained earnings that can be attributed to individual income tax statements.",
        "To link retained corporate earnings from the Corporation Data to the Individual Data, we use the shareholder register (Ownership Data). These data cover every shareholding of each corporate and individual shareholder (also originating from the Norwegian Tax Authorities). For example, in 2011, we have 2,051,354 unique shareholder-corporation pairs for 213,484 corporations, with 689,050 (direct) individual shareholders and 90,590 corporate shareholders.31 The retained earnings are attributed to the corporate and individual shareholders. As individuals can indirectly hold shares in a firm, we account for 10 layers of indirect ownership. The final individual shareholding of each individual in each firm accounts for such indirect shareholdings. We then sum the change in accumulated retained earnings across all shareholdings for an individual and then merge this information to the Individual Data.",
        "In all years, about 40% of the corporations had no earned equity or their equity level is below 10% of assets. Such firms have no ability to legally pay any dividends. In 2005 nearly half of the corporations that have the ability to pay dividends decide to maximize their payouts. Given that 39% pay any dividends in 2005, and 62% of those who have the ability to do so, the median corporation that pays dividends in 2005 does so to the maximum extent possible (see Alstads\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a6ter,"
