        "The Current population Survey is the regular monthly survey of about 59,500 households from which the national unemployment rate is derived. The CPS gathers data on average weekly earnings and average hours worked from a subsample of households in each month and gathers diverse other data. The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth is a detailed survey of over 12,000 young people from 1979 through 1987. The orginal 1979 sample contained 12,686 youths aged 14 to 21, of whom 6,111 represent the entire population of youths while 5,295 represent an oversampling of civilian Hispanic, black and economically disadvantaged non-Hispanic, non-black youth. An additional 1,280 were in the military. The survey had a remarkably low attrition rate \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d4.9 percent through 19B4 \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d and thus represents the largest and best available longitudinal data set on youths in the period under study.",
        "The unemployment rate averaged 4.5% in the 1950s, 4.8% in the 1960s, 6.1% in the 1970s, and 7.2% in the 1980s. While demographic factors explain some of the upward trend, there is no doubt but that the economic recession of 1982-83 created the highest rates of joblessness since the Great Depression. Data from the Council of Economic Advisors 198B.",

        "An MSA is defined by the Census Bureau as an urban area that meets specified size criteria \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d either it has a city of at least 50,000 inhabitants ... or it contains an urbanized area of at least 50,000 inhabitants and has a total population of at least 100,000. Primary and Consolidated MSAs are larger urban metropolitan areas. For their precise definition see appendix C of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, (1988). For ease of discussion I use MSA to refer to metropolitan statistical areas, primary metropolitan statistical areas, and consolidated metropolitan statistical areas.",
        "To see the logic of this procedure, assume that there are two groups of cities: those with high unemployment and those with low unemployment. Outcomes depend on whether the youth lives in a high- or low-unemployment area and on unobserved city characteristics that happen to be correlated with the 1987 group in which a city is found. If there is no correlation between the 19S7 category and 1983 category in which a city falls, then the only reason for differences in 1983 youth outcomes between cities that differ in their 1987 unemployment category is the effect of the unobserved city factor on outcomes. Hence, taking the 19B3-87 change in outcomes for cities in the same 19S7 category eliminates the effect of the omitted factor. If, more realistically, there is a positive correlation between a city s 1983 and 1987 category, the difference estimator is likely to understate the true effect of 1987 market conditions on outcomes.",
        "Standard metropolitan statistical areas are the geographic equivalent of the KSAs used to identify areas in the 1983 CPS. They are based on 1970 Census of Population definitions, whereas the KSAs are based on 19B0 Census of population definitions. I matched the relevant areas for comparability.",
