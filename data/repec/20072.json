        "I am grateful to Martijn Cremers for supplying this active share series, computed with respect to the Russell 1000 market benchmark. The plot displays within-year averages of quarterly values. In this interpretation, the trading cost is not viewed as a manager-specific price impact, such that if many other managers independently produce similar price impacts, the sum of such impacts aggregates to an implausibly large total price effect. Instead, one might imagine many intermediaries accessing different sources of liquidity or acting at slightly different times.",

Hedge funds represent an additional segment of equity ownership, in addition to mutual funds and institutional portfolios, that I do not include here.",
