ONLINE APPENDIX A Additional Data Source and Methods Tables and Figures In Section 2 we discussed the construction of our eligible-workers frame. Here we provide further details on which workers are excluded from the all-workers frame to arrive at the eligible-workers frame and how this impacts the earnings coverage of LEHD when compared to NIPA.",
        "A-4 the NIPA wage and salary estimates. The eligible-workers estimates follow a similar pattern as the all-workers estimates, with about two percentage points lower coverage relative to the all-workers frame after 2004.",
        "The coverage of both the all-workers and eligible-workers frames is very low relative to the NIPA estimates in the early 1990s but increases dramatically in 1995 once the historical data for the more populous states (CA, FL, NY, and TX) have entered the LEHD infrastructure files. When the frame is complete (date regime 4), there is an apparent coverage gap of about eight to nine percentage points for the all-workers frame and ten to 11 percentage points for the eligible-workers frame. About half of this gap is due to differences between the statutory-employer population for UI wage records and the NIPA definition of wage and salary income. When comparing frames with similar coverage definitions (UI wage records vs. QCEW), our results suggest that the gap between the two frames is about four to five percentage points for the all-workers frame and five to six percentage points for the eligible-workers frame.",
        "LEHD Total presents total annual earnings for the all-workers frame. This total is decomposed into earnings attributed to workers included in the eligible-workers frame (Eligible Workers) and to workers who are not included (Immigrant Candidates). Units are in billions of real (2000) dollars, converted using CPI-U. The frame is complete from 2004 forward.",
        "To see this more clearly, Table B.1 presents the average percentile values from 1995-2013 for both the all-workers and the eligible-workers frames, and the last row computes their ratio (eligible workers to all workers). First, notice that the ratio is always above one, meaning that each percentile computed from the eligible-workers frame is greater than the equivalent percentile computed from the all-workers frame. Removing the immigrant candidates from the all-workers frame to construct the eligible-workers frame eliminates an unknown number of individuals who make very low earnings and, thus, tend to be at the bottom of the all-workers earnings distribution.",
        "B-2 Starting with the all-workers frame in Figure B.3, notice that all the measures show a decline in earnings inequality from 1995 to 2000. This can also be seen in Table B.2. The first row presents the average of each ratio from 1995-1999. Notice that they are all above one, meaning that earnings inequality was greater in the late 1990s than in 2000. Then, after 2000, except for the 99/1 ratio, which has a slight upward trend, all other measures of earnings inequality remain relatively stable.",
        "The second row of Table B.2 presents the average of each ratio (relative to 2000) from 2001-2013.",
        "Notice that aside from the 99/1 ratio, which on average increased by about 5% after 2000, the other measures have remained around their 2000 levels. Thus, aside from differences at the very top or the very bottom of the earnings distribution, earnings inequality among all workers has apparently seen little or no change over the last 10 years.",
        "P99 to P1 P95 to P5 P90 to P10 P80 to P20 Variance Notes: Subplot (a) presents measures of earnings inequality for all workers in all states relative to 2000 from 1990-2013. Subplot (b) presents measures of earnings inequality for eligible workers in all states relative to 2000 from 1990-2013. The measures of earnings inequality considered are (i) P99 to P1: the ratio of the 99th to the 1st percentile; (ii) P95 to P5: the ratio of the 95th to the 5th percentile; (iii) P90 to P10: the ratio of the 90th to the 10th percentile; (iv) P80 to P20 the ratio of the 80th to the 20th percentile; and (v) Variance: the variance of log annual earnings.",
        "Both the all-workers and the covered-workers samples show a decline in earnings inequality during the late 1990s that reverses after 2000. However, in the all-workers sample, the magnitude of this increase in inequality in the post-2000 period strongly depends on the measure considered.",
        "P50 to P5 P50 to P10 P50 to P20 (d) Covered Workers - Bottom Notes: Subplots (a) and (b) decompose the 99/1 ratio, the 95/5 ratio, the 90/10 ratio, and the 80/20 for all workers in CPS/ACS relative to 2000 from 1990-2013 relative to the median. Subplot (a) plots the following ratios for the top half of the earnings distribution: (i) P95 to P50: the ratio of the 95th to the 50th percentile; (ii) P90 to P50: the ratio of the 90th to the 50th percentile; and (iii) P80 to P50 the ratio of the 80th to the 50th percentile. Subplot (b) plots the following ratios for the bottom half of the earnings distribution: (i) P50 to P5: the ratio of the 50th to the 5th percentile; (ii) P50 to P10: the ratio of the 50th to the 10th percentile; and (iii) P50 to P20 the ratio of the 50th to the 20th percentile. Subplots (c) and (d) present the same decomposition for covered workers in CPS/ACS relative to 2000 from 1990-2013.",
        "All three of the inequality measures increase substantially as the proportion of eligible workers included in the calculation increases. Not surprisingly, including a large block of workers with only $1 of annual earnings greatly increases measured inequality. Comparing our results with another administrative data source, estimates of inequality using SSA data, we find that ours are somewhat larger, although the exact source of the difference is unclear due to coverage differences imposed on the SSA estimation sample. For example, in 2004 the estimated Gini coefficient using a restricted sample of currently eligible SSA recipients is 0.471, while in our data the estimated Gini is 0.510 (Kopczuk et al., 2010).",
        "In Section 3 we documented the increase in inequality post-2000 using ratios of various percentiles of the earnings distribution. For the eligible-workers frame, the increase in earnings of the top 20% relative to the bottom 20% of earners accelerates during the Great Recession, with annual earnings increases for workers at the 80th percentile and small declines or no increases for at the 20th percentile. The increases for the 99/1 ratio, the 95/5 ratio, and the 90/10 ratio are even larger, with the ratios increasing faster the more extreme the comparison (Figure 3). Here we have taken an alternative approach. Instead of comparing two specific points in the earnings distribution, the portmanteau inequality measures presented here weight the changes occurring across the earnings distribution and combine them to produce a single measure of overall inequality. Each measure uses different weights and combining rules, therefore it is useful to compare each approach.",
