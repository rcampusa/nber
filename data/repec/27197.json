A Appendix A.1 Estimating the marginal replacement vehicles We report rough estimates of the fuel efficiency of the marginal replacement vehicle, using the potential outcome framework with never-takers (NT), compliers (C), and always-takers (AT). We consider this framework in the context of the intent-to-treat in with the difference-indifference specification. Defining zi as the intent to treat indicator, and Di to be the treatment \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093take-up\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d, i.e. the adoption of EVs. Given that the observation i is at the zip-year level, we interpret that within each observation, a fraction of it has Di = 1, and 0 for the rest. (Does this even make sense?) The fractions of populations within zip-quarter that fall into each of the treatment- and assignment blocks are shown as follows:"
