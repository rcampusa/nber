The data is obtained from COMTRADE. (region at the 99th percentile), for instance, concentrates 2.95 percent of national employment. These ratios show that even the most specialized regions represent a small fraction of commodity employment.",

We restrict the sample to individuals aged 20 - 60 employed in the commodity, tradable, or nontradable sector. To make the results as comparable as possible to the earlier literature we restrict the sample to stayers - workers employed the two entire and consecutive years in the same firm, and we define wages that stay constant as those that change less than 0.5% [see Kurmann and McEntarfer, 2017]. We pool all year-to-year wage changes over the period 1999-2013. During the period of interest, we document substantial microeconomic evidence of downward nominal wage rigidity. Nominal wage cuts are rare, even in low-growth years or in regions facing downturns.",
        "Figure A2 shows the kernel density of the pooled distribution of wage changes.58 We find that 16.0 percent of wages fall from one year to the next, 2.7 percent stay constant, and 81.3 percent rise.59 For comparison, Kurmann et al. [2016]] report that 30 percent of hourly wages fall in the U.S. private sector in a 30-state sample during 1999-2011.",
        "Figures A3a and A3b show that the distribution of wage changes is similar for skilled and unskilled individuals, as well as across sectors.60 Additionally we document that the asymmetry in the distribution and the small frequency of nominal wage cuts holds in both high and low growth years, as figure A3c shows. We also classify region-year pairs into quartiles according to the intensity of regional commodity price shocks. As figure A3d shows, there is very little impact of these price shocks on the asymmetry of the wage change distribution and on its left tail. Various percentiles and statistics of the pooled distribution of wage changes are shown in figure A3e. 0 2 4 6 8 \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00cb\u0086\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0099.2 \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00cb\u0086\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0099.1 0 .1 .2 (log) Wage Change Figure A2: Distribution of Nominal Wage Changes Note: This figure displays the distribution of nominal wage changes pooled over 1999-2013.",
        "To further document the existence of downward nominal wage rigidity, we compute three measures used in the literature that capture asymmetries in the wage change distribution. Following Kurmann and McEntarfer [2017] we define the mass at zero as M0 = F(0.005) \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00cb\u0086\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0099 F(\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00cb\u0086\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u00990.005), the excess zero spike These include, for example, Card and Hyslop [1997], Dickens et al. [2007] and more recently Kurmann and McEntarfer [2017]. 58 The path over time of the percentiles of this distribution are shown in figure A3e. 59 Following Kurmann and McEntarfer [2017] we define wages that stay constant as those that change less than 0.5%. 60 This justifies why in the model we impose the same downward wage rigidity restriction to skilled and unskilled labor. This similar behavior of wage changes for skilled and unskilled workers is also consistent with a labor code that treats these two types of workers similarly.",
        "Panel (b) shows the distribution of nominal wage changes for workers in the commodity, tradable, and nontradable sector pooled over 1999-2013. Panel (c) shows the wage change distribution for high-growth years (the two years with highest GDP growth: 2007 and 2010); mid-growth years (the two years with the closest to the median GDP growth: 2005 and 2006); and low-growth years (the two years with lowest GDP growth: 2003 and 2009). Panel (d) shows the wage-change distribution separately for quartiles of intensity of commodity price shocks in region-year pairs (see text). Panel (e) shows the evolution of the percentiles of the wage change distribution over time. Panel (f) shows evolution over time of the following statistics of the wage change distribution: the mass at zero, the excess zero spike, and the missing mass left of zero (all defined in the text).",
        "Macroeconomic evidence. In addition to the micro-level results, we find macroeconomic evidence of downward nominal wage rigidity. Following Schmitt-Grohe\u00c3\u0083\u00c5\u0092\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u0081 and Uribe [2016] we examine the path of aggregate wages in a context of rising unemployment, relatively low inflation, and a crawling peg of the Brazilian Real to the U.S. dollar during the period 1996 - 1998 (immediately prior to the 1999 devaluation). Under a cumulative 29% increase in the unemployment rate, nominal wages rose slightly and real wages were practically flat. In contrast, in a flexible labor market, one would expect a decline in nominal wages. As Schmitt-Grohe\u00c3\u0083\u00c5\u0092\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u0081 and Uribe [2016] (who study a similar episode in Argentina) point out, this is highly indicative of downward nominal wage rigidity. In fact it was only following the 1999 devaluation that real wages (in dollar terms) fell.",
