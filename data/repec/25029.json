A. Micro data The source database for this analysis is Orbis by Bureau Van Dijk. This is a cross-country firm level database containing ownership link information connecting subsidiaries through their direct owners to their ultimate (global) owners. These data are sourced from a variety of documents (company reports and accounts, stock exchange filings, and regulatory records) and includes ownership percentages, types of relationships (such as global or domestic ultimate owner) and dates related to each relationship."
