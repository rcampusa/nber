        "In the yearly data between 2011 and 2016, there is a downward trend in AOD data during the entire sample period, suggesting an overall improvement in air quality in these cities (plotted in Figure A4). In comparison, the official reported PM10 concentrations significantly increased in 2013 and 2014, during which the central government automated the air quality monitoring system. For cities in the first wave, for example, reported annual PM10 levels increased by more than 30 g/m3 from 2012 to 2013, which was about the same magnitude as the total improvement in PM10 reduction in the following four years (see Appendix A3 for the summary statistics of key variables).",
