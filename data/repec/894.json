        "See, for example, Blaug (1968, p.648) Gordon (1981, pp. 160-3), Sargent (1979, pp. 63-65), and Patinkin (1959) (1965). These authors mention, but do not emphasize, the dynamic considerations with which the present paper is concerned.",
        "The discussion here, and in what follows, is not meant to imply that the \"full employment\" rate of employment or output is constant, smoothly growing, or clearly discernable to econometricians. It might be better to use the term \"market-clearing,\" as in Barro and Grossman (1976). This paper will, however, retain the more traditional terminology.",
        "For discussions of the desirability of using rational expectations in macro-economic analysis, see Lucas (1975) and McCallum (1980).",
        "This treatment is consistent with Tobin&apos;s (1975).",
        "Tobin (1980b) is on record as objecting to the inclusion of lagged output terms in equations like (6). He is of course correct in claiming that the inclusion has no relation (one way or the other) to rational expectations. Whether it has \"very thin intrinsic justification\" (p. 791) is debatable. In what follows, the exclusion of y 1 - y would not alter the main theoretical conclusions but would impart a characteristic to the model\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dabsence of unemployment persistence\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d that seems counterfactual.",
        "This last conclusion is similar to those reached by Bailey (1971, pp. 51-54) and Sargent (1979, p. 63) in static contexts.",
        "This statement ignores the possibility of \"bubble\" or \"bootstrap\" paths, involving solution equations more general in form than (7), that can occur in dynamic models with rational or irrational expectations. The issues raised by this possibility of multiple solutions are only weakly related to those of concern in the present paper. For an extensive discussion, see McCallum (1981).",
        "On this point, see McCallum (1979).",
        "The assumptions in McCallum (1980), for example, imply that it is prohibitively costly to change prices within a period, but relatively costless to do so across periods. In addition, it presumes that period length is determined exogenously.",
        "Unlike the analogous equation (25) in McCallum (1980), expression (26) does not support the controversial \"policy ineffectiveness\" proposition: monetary policy rules may affect the magnitude of tt^ in (27) below and thereby the variance of y - y. This difference results from differing assumptions regarding information available to agents in forming expectations about p that are relevant to t+1 perceptions of the real interest rate. For some discussion of the relevant issue, see McCallum (1980, pp. 736-8).",
        "Even if the time periods are years, the values of y and will be small relative to 1.0. A value for y of 0.1, for example, reflects the well-known rule-of-thumb that \"the cost of a 1 point reduction in the basic inflation rate is 10 percent of a year&apos;s GNP\" (Okun, 1978, p. 348). While rational expectations analysis leads one to doubt the validity of Okun&apos;s estimate of the unemployment costs of a policy change, it does not suggest that the implied \"estimate\" of y is seriously wrong."
