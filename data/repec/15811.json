        "The relevant numbers come from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Insurance Component. For each year, state, and each firm size (Less than 10 employees, 10 - 24 employees, 25 - 99 employees, 100-999 employees, 1000 or more employees) 4 different values were copied and pasted into cells: the total amount paid by the employer, the total amount paid by the employee, for both single and family policies. In the CPS, the firm size values are under 10, 10 \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c 24, 25 \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c 99, 100 \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c 499, 500 \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c 999, 1000+, so the two categories 100 \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c 499 and 500 \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c 999 were collapsed for the purpose of merging the two data sets, so there are 5 firm size categories that are tracked.",
        "In the case of some small states, the MEPSIC does not report separate estimates for each state in some of the years. In the years 1996-2000, there are 11 such states whose identity changes slightly from year to year (e.g. in 1996 the list is Alaska, Delaware, District of Columbia, Idaho, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming, while in 2000 it is Alaska ,Delaware, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Montana, Nevada, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wyoming). In 2001 there are 9 states, and in 2002 there are 8 states. There are no missing states after that. In these cases, we use the national average for that year and firm size.",
        "The created series cover 1993, 1996-2008. However, there is no way to obtain a 1995 value from surveys. Thus, we used the values for the Medical Care CPI (Series id CUSR0000SAM), and deflated values of 1996 by (225-2-216.6/225=) 3.8% to create the values for 1995.10 The series also excludes data for 2007 since the survey was not conducted in that year. We deflate the 2008 values by the inflation factor 5% for single coverage employer portion of premium and 5.4% for employer portion of the single plan premium. We obtain these deflation values by observing how the employer portion of premiums reported in the Kaiser Employer Health Insurance Survey 2008 report differ between 2007 and 2008 at the national level.",
        "Data Appendix B: The Current Population Survey Dataset We use the March files from 1996 to 2008 (containing data from 1995 to 2007). We first create individual indicators of health insurance, using the Census Bureau definitions, thus our estimates are identical to the published tables.11 We create indicators first that record a value of 1"
