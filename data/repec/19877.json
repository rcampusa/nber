Table A.1 lists the 54 scantrack markets covered by the KNCP data, together with the fraction of observed expenditure in 2007:Q1 that comes from each market. Table A.2 lists the departments covered by the KNCP data, the number of product groups and product modules in each department, together with the number of different UPCs purchased from each department and the fraction of expenditure coming from each department in 2007:Q1. Table A.3 lists the types of retailers covered by the KNCP data, together with the fraction of expenditure coming from each category in 2007:Q1."
