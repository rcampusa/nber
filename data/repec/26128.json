Hence, we use the \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u008f\u00c3\u0082\u00c6\u0092 imputed in the previous step as an input into the computation of the thresholds for time discount. We again start with 3005 potentially valid response. We drop those with a missing value of \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u008f\u00c3\u0082\u00c6\u0092. This leaves us with 2613 valid responses. A total of 459 responses have reversals (switch back to A). We use the last switch to B. We report in Table A.4 the distribution of switch points. A significant fraction of respondents (close to a third) switch at the first element which indicates a high degree of patience.",
