        "A Large Canadian Mergers On January 1, 1993 TD Bank acquired, under duress, Central Guaranty Trust. Even though Central Guaranty Trust had a poor balance sheet, there was substantial interest by several financial institutions in acquiring its assets from Central Capital Corporation, which owned 87 per cent of trust. At the official auction TD won over the joint bid from National Bank, Canada Trust, and Montreal Trust. Given the conditions of the Central Guaranty Trust balance sheet (they had very high risk mortgages and commercial lending activities), the Canadian Deposit Insurance Corporation provided financial support to TD in the takeover. In terms of branches, TD acquired 156 locations. TD also inherited nearly 11 billion dollars in deposits.",
        "The Competition Bureau also did not place restrictions on Bank of Nova Scotia\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s (BNS) acquisition of Montreal Trust on April 12, 1994. In this instance BNS acquired 9 billion dollars in deposits and 125 branches located mostly in Quebec and Ontario. Montreal Trust had experienced some losses in the early 1990s because of market value deficiencies in the investments and assets, but was considered a sound financial institution and a good purchase by BNS.",
        "On August 14, 1997 Bank of Nova Scotia acquired National Trust and Victoria and Grey Mortgage Corporation, without restrictions by the Competition Bureau. In this case BNS acquired nearly 12 billion dollars in deposits and 199 branches located in Quebec, Ontario, and Manitoba. Most of what is known about National Trust is confidential. We do know, however, that the transaction was valued at approximately 1.25 billion dollars even though National Trust was considered a poorly run institution that had acquired an excessive number of small, failing trusts throughout the 1990s. It was largely the mis-management of the infrastructure that led National Trust to look for a buyer.",
        "The last bank merger to be approved in Canada was Toronto-Dominion Banks\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 (TD) acquisition of Canada Trust in 2000. The price tag was roughly 8 billion dollars (TD financed the purchase by issuing 700 million dollars in equity) and it resulted in 440 branches located across the country being acquired as well as a strong share of the mortgage market. The merger was analyzed by the Competition Bureau and allowed to be completed under minor conditions.",
        "For example, TD had to divest in some of its branches in three of the seventy-four markets defined by the Bureau (Kitchener-Waterloo-Cambridge-Elmira, Port Hope, and Brantford-Paris). TD also had to sell CT\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s MasterCard credit card business (they sold the consumer credit card business to Citibank in November 2000). TD was issuing Visa credit cards at the time of the acquisition, and it was not until 2009 that Canadian banks could sell both brands simultaneously. B Additional tables"
