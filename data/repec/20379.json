        "Davis et al. measure job flows between new and old job descriptions and find that 10% of jobs is created and destroyed annually. However, the study was limited to manufacturing and changes in job description do not necessarily imply creative destruction (Davis, Haltiwanger and Schuh, 1996).",
        "The fashion industry is another example of a sector in which new products mostly replace existing products for which they are close substitutes and which would not have been devalued had it not been for the creation of the new products (Veblen, 1899). By creating and promoting new fashion part of our inventory of clothing is rendered obsolete. That means that we do not obtain as much utility from the clothing we now have as we anticipated at the time of purchase. We are not told how long a particular fashion will last.",
        "The new fashion suddenly and unexpectedly depreciates the value of the old but because they are close substitutes ScR is probably small: the fashion industry has a large destructive component but it is big business with $250 billion annual product in the U.S. and $1.2 trillion world-wide. Hence, its contribution to the mis-measurement of NNP is likely to be substantial and likely increasing as the products of fashion have become a bigger part of our expenditure.
