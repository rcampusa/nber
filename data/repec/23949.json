Specifically, we look at how independent and integrated suppliers differentially adjust their behavior to important variations in production conditions.",

        "Peruvian fish suppliers face a trade-off between taking quantity- and quality-increasing actions because of the technology they operate under. This trade-off is particularly pressing when production conditions are difficult. At such times, integrated suppliers seems to adopt their behavior to prioritize the quality of their inputs over the quantity even more. As in Forbes & Lederman (2009, 2010), this evidence suggests that vertical integration is a way for the downstream firm to insure that suppliers adopt the right (qualityincreasing) behavior when there is important variation in production conditions upstream. 63We also checked these results are not sensitive to how we define difficult production conditions. The corresponding tables are available from the authors. 64These results are also not sensitive to the way we define difficult production conditions. The corresponding tables are available from the authors."
