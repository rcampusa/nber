Similar to the procedure above, we use a ten-year window, [t-10, t-1], for each crisis country to construct the index, where t is the start year of the crisis. We first compute the ratio of inventories to the cost of goods sold for each U.S. manufacturing firm, and obtain in each firm the median value of the ratio over its ten-year window. Then we take the median ratio across firms with the same three-digit U.S. SIC code as the proxy for that industry.",

It equals the average of ex-ante and ex-post private control of selfdealing. The ex-ante component is the average of permission of disinterested shareholders and ex-ante disclosure requirements for the transaction purchasing company, the main owner of the selling company, and the independent review by a professional third party, while the ex-post component is the average of requirements for periodic detailed disclosure on the transaction and the ease of proving wrongdoing. It ranges from zero to one, with higher value indicating stronger minority shareholder protection against self-dealing transactions.",
