        "Engineering Manpower Commission (EMC) Beginning in the late 1960\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s, the Engineering Manpower Commission (EMC) collected similar institution-level counts of the number of bachelor\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s level engineering graduates, with more detailed information about field of degrees in engineering or engineering technologies. These surveys include earlier counts by race than the NCES data, but the racial counts are not disaggregated by sex. The advantage of this data source in the early years is that black engineers are counted separately from black bachelor\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s degree graduates with majors in engineering technologies.",
        "These data were not available in electronic form. They were collected from published volumes, and matched to the NCES institution-groupings by institution name (Tolliver and Armsby 1959, Tolliver, Armsby, and United States 1961, 1963, Engineering Manpower Commission 1972, 1975,1977, 1978, 1981, 1984, 1987, 1988, 1989).",
        "Current Population Surveys (CPS) Statistics on the number of new black engineering graduates have been collected since the late 1960s, but counts of the number of new black college graduates do not begin until nearly a decade later. Estimates of the number of bachelor\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s degrees earned by black students in earlier years are computed based on a combination of data from different sources, including the total number of degrees conferred each year (from NCES) and estimates of the share of college graduates in the corresponding birth cohort who are black (separate estimates made from CPS data and from NSCG data are averaged).",
        "National Science Foundation Additional statistics on the number of men and women graduating with degrees in Engineering or Computer Science in the early years were drawn from National Science Foundation publications in the Surveys of Science Resources Series (National Science Foundation 1977, 1982a, 1982b, 1984, Hill 1992)."
