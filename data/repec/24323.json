Information on private nonfarm employment and number of establishments and sector (NAICS) shares is from the Census County Business Patterns.",
        "We restrict our sample to interviews that either were or could have been conducted in English. The GSS did not begin interviewing in Spanish until 2006, so we first drop the Spanish language interviews (SPANENG equals 2) that would not otherwise have been conducted to maintain consistency. Specifically, we drop cases where the interviewer reported that the respondent would have been excluded due to lack of English proficiency (SPANINT equals 2).",
        "Observations are weighted to be representative of the non-institutionalized English speaking adult population within each year. We begin with the weight (WTSSALL) that takes into account the number of adults in the household, since the GSS only interviews one adult per household, as well as the sub-sampling of non-respondents starting in 2004. We then interact this weight with multipliers that adjust for oversamples conducted in 1982 and 1987 (OVERSAMP) and imperfect randomization of survey forms in 1978, 1980 and 1982-85 (FORMWT). The composite weight maintains the original sample size for the weighted sample, by design.",
        "Then, in order to minimize changes in the composition of taxpayers induced by the stimulus and other less dramatic tax policy changes, we identify the subset of tax returns filed by \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093policy constant\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d taxpayers. We define these taxpayers as those who would be likely to file taxes if the 1996 tax law were held fixed and extended to all later years. This set includes three groups.",
        "The first is taxpayers that meet minimum income thresholds for filing. The thresholds are based on total income less social security benefits and vary by tax filing status and age. To identify this group, we apply the relevant 1996 threshold, indexed for inflation. The second is taxpayers who report negative total income. These cases tend to be high wealth taxpayers experiencing business losses in a given year, and who are likely to file taxes in most years. The third group of taxpayers includes people below the filing threshold who are likely to file in order to claim the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which is refundable. Specifically, these individuals are identified as having positive earnings (wages and self-employment income) and adjusted gross income below the inflation adjusted income limit in 1996. Notably, the overall structure of the EITC was quite 58 stable over this period, so that inflation adjusting the 1996 policy closely mimics the actual policy.",
        "For both all taxpayers and policy-constant taxpayers, we then aggregate the amounts and counts from the 1040s to the county level (using the zip codes from the tax returns and a crosswalk from zip codes to counties that we constructed using mappings available from the Census, US Postal Service and the IRS). We exclude the counties in Northern Florida and New York that include zip codes for which a large number of records were deleted from the system in 1999.",
        "The main consequence of limiting the sample to policy-constant tax returns is to eliminate the spike in returns attributable to the 2007 and 2008 stimulus programs. This is demonstrated in Figure B1. The figure plots the average number of tax returns per capita by year for all filers and policy constant filers, as well as gross income attributable to each type of filer.",
        "The policy constant version of gross income (less capital gains) subtracts state income tax refunds and unemployment compensation. The logic is that state income tax refund amounts may reflect tax policy and compliance, and taxable unemployment compensation is net of the first $2,400 only in 2009. When subtracting adjustments to arrive at policy constant AGI, we then only allow adjustments that existed in 1996 (i.e., IRA deduction, moving expenses, selfemployment tax, SEP/SIMPLE plans, penalty on early withdraw of savings and alimony paid).",
        "For those that existed, we apply the 1996 parameters and adjust for inflation when relevant. In practice, the policy constant version of AGI is almost always within 3% of the original version."
