Footnotes This has been the convention in the human-capital based endogenous growth literature, on the implicit assumption that human capital and physical capital are complements in production. Although restricting the life span to just three generations puts a limit on human longevity and life expectancy in this framework, this does not automatically assures an interior-equilibrium solution for our key variables, nor would our basic results change if we allowed for continually increasing life phases and overlapping generations.",
        "Our model expands the basic elements of the endogenous growth models of Lucas (1987), Becker, Murphy, and Tamura (1990), and especially Ehrlich and Lui (1991) and Ehrlich and Kim (2007) to integrate health and life expectancy as a basic endogenous variable in addition to fertility and human capital formation.",

The weighted OLS regression included both probability measures and initial (1960) per-capita GDP as covariates. The inclusion of the latter was required by the model.",
        "This finding at the macro level supports recent literature indicating that health investment at early childhood produce favorable schooling benefits at later ages (see Bleakley, 2007 and Lucas, 2010)."
