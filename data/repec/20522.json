Once migrants realize that raising remittances leads to shifts in recipients\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 reference points, they may cease responding to future temporary discounts. Whether migrants do learn about remittance-recipient reference dependence is an empirical matter that should be investigated in future work.",
