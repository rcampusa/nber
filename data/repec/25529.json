        "We define the share of foreign sales as the ratio of foreign affiliate sales to the sum of foreign affiliate sales and U.S. parent sales. We use Majority-owned affiliates because they correspond to the activities over which U.S. parents exert unambiguous control; and which are consolidated in parent financial accounts.8 Industry categorizations are based on SIC segments before 1998 and NAICS segments afterwards, and nearly match those of GDP by industry accounts. We select the level of aggregation that most closely matches Gross Output accounts, using SIC codes before 1998 and NAICS codes afterwards.",
        "Foreign sales were relatively stable in the 1980s, so we hold the share of foreign sales flat at the 1983level for all prior years.9 We also fill the share of foreign sales forward after 2015. Firms that cannot be mapped to a particular MNE industry are assigned the value for all private industries.",

        "Figure 6. Total contribution of industry stars defined as above. Aggregate labor productivity growth defined as the 5Y centered moving-average labor productivity growth of Fernald (2014). Non-star contribution equals the difference between the (smoothed) labor productivity growth and the industry-star contribution.",
        "B Additional Results Figure 7 compares the labor productivity of the stars to that of other companies. The Top Panel uses other publicly traded firms (i.e., Compustat) in the same industry as a benchmark: it plots the weighted average log difference in total sales per employee. It shows that the stars of the 1980s and 1990s had higher sales per employee than other established firms. In the 2000s, however, that difference has vanished. The Bottom Panel uses industry productivity as a benchmark, using industry data on gross output per employee from the BEA. For industry stars, we again observe no trend. For the Top 20 we observe a relative increase, but as we show later, this is entirely explained by increasing differences in labor quality (the top 20 stars higher more productive and expensive labor inputs).",
        "Figure 8 shows that the stars\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 profit margins have increased and remained high since the late 1990s. Much of the increase, however, is shared by other non-star firms. Still, it is true that margins have increased in recent years somewhat more for the stars. Figure 9shows the impact of oil price shocks on our measure of productivity growth by reallocation. Figure 10 shows our wage adjustment series, which is based on non-manufacturing industries at the Top-4 firms vs. the rest. Figure 7: Productivity and Profits of the Stars Note: Figure plots weighted average log-difference in sales per employee between star firms and their corresponding Compustat industry and BEA sector, respectively.
