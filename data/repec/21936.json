The sample consists of all children in the PSID observed at age 30 who have non-missing parental income measures. We define employment as being currently employed or temporarily laid off (see Appendix A for details). We define parental income as mean labor income averaged over all years when the parents are between the ages 30 and 50 for which we observe them in the sample.",

Panel A replicates Figure 1 defining employment as an indicator for having either a W-2 form or non-zero non-employee compensation in Form 1099 (box 7) in the tax year during which the child turns 30 years old. Non-employee compensation includes payments to independent contractors as well as other forms of income that may not be from employment, such as prize winnings. Panel B replicates Figure 1 defining employment as an indicator for having either a W-2 form or non-zero Schedule C income in the tax year during which the child turns 30 years old. The Schedule C form includes self-employment income, but only one form is filed for married spouses filing jointly. As a result, unemployed individuals whose spouses have self-employment income would be counted as employed in Panel B.",

        "Estimates of Causal Effects. Chetty and Hendren (2015) estimate gender-specific causal effects of spending an additional year growing up in each CZ by analyzing families who move across CZs. Their estimates are identified from differences in the ages at which children move to different CZs. Intuitively, if children who move from New York to Boston do better as adults the earlier they move, one can infer that growing up in Boston has a positive causal effect relative to New York.",
        "Note that Chetty and Hendren (2015) do not compute causal effects on employment rates for children who grow up low-income families. Instead, they estimate effects on individual income ranks at age 26 for children whose parents are at the 25th percentile of the parental income distribution. Individual income is defined as the sum of individual W-2 wage earnings, UI benefits, SSDI payments, and half of household self-employment income (see Online Appendix A of Chetty et al.",
