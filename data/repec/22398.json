        "It is common for students to correctly double 1.2MHz and get 2.4 MHz in 1979, but then to continue adding 1.2 at a constant rate every two years.  Most will self-correct as they check in with their neighbors, but be on the lookout for that misunderstanding of the pattern. Once students have finished the table, and some have started to think about the next question, you can display the answers and prompt students to explain their reasoning. \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a2 Restate Moore's Law in your own words.",
