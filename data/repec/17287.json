        "Social Security benefits generally go up the longer you wait to claim them, up until age 70. For each year you postpone claiming, your retired worker benefits increase by about 9.5% of the amount you'd get at age 62. For instance, a worker who would get $1000 in monthly retired worker benefits if he claimed at age 62 could expect about $1330 in benefits claiming at age 66, while postponing claiming until age 70 would translate into about $1760 in monthly benefits (see graph on next page). In addition to the increase from delayed claiming, working a few more years generally raises your Social Security benefits because most people's benefits depend on their work history. Postponing your retirement typically means more money for a more comfortable retirement. 2",

Retirement benefits are increased each year by about [PCT_70 / 8]% of the amount [ILL_HESHE] would receive at age 62.

[ILL_HESHE] could expect: Age 62  Age 66  Age 70 $1000 $[1000*(1+PCT66/100)] $[1000*(1+PCT70/100)] Therefore, this worker could expect the highest first-time benefit if [ILL_HESHE] claimed at age 70.",
