The key outcome measures include labor supply and earnings of women, consumption, household, financial assets, and mental health.

Key outcome measures included antisocial behavior such as crime and economic performance and preferences. In our meta-analysis we include the effects of the cash grant for those who did not receive the CBT intervention on an index of depression and mental distress, which asked about depressive symptoms, bad thoughts or feelings, and worry. The authors report the average size of the cash grant as $216 and the registration and administration costs for both programs as $125, at market exchange rates. We conservatively assume that all of the latter costs are fixed and thus estimate the implementation cost of the cash transfer program as $216 + $125 = $341.",
        "3. Haushofer et al. (2019). This study examines the impact of cash transfers and health insurance on 789 informal Kenyan workers. The workers were randomized into three groups: (i) received a free health insurance policy (ii) an unconditional cash transfer (worth the price of the policy) (iii) no intervention. The key outcome measures include insurance ownership, assets, willingness to pay for insurance, labor mobility, labor productivity, job risk, psychological well-being index, and log cortisol levels. The coverage was for 1 year and follow-up surveys were conducted a year after the completion of the program. The psychological well-being index was measured as self-reported well-being (stress and depression) and log cortisol levels. The average cash transfer per household was $338 PPP.",

While applicants had to apply in small groups and submit a business proposal, the grants were unconditional once awarded. About half of 535 eligible groups were randomized to receive the money, which for most was between $200-$600 per person. Key outcomes included employment, earnings, and consumption. Implementation cost data was not available for this program; instead, we use the average grant per participant ($382 MER).",

The follow-up survey was conducted 1.5 years after the intervention was rolled out. The psychological well-being index was measured using depression, happiness, life satisfaction, and stress scales.",

This study examines the effect of an Ecuadorian cash transfer program, the Bono de Desarollo Humano (BDH), which provided unconditional cash transfers averaging $10.51 per month to eligible mothers. The program was randomized across 77 rural and 41 urban parishes (small administrative units), though the authors only report results among rural parishes. Key outcome measures are cognitive, behavioral, and physical outcomes for children. The paper also reports effects of BDH on mothers\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 mental health as measured by the CES-D depression scale.

The program was randomized across 28 locations, covering 1960 households. Treated households received monthly transfers of $20. The key outcome measure is an indicator of depressive symptoms using the 10question CES-D scale. The treatment effect we report in our meta-analysis is derived from the unadjusted means in the treatment and control groups reported in Table 2 of Kilburn et al. (2016). (Note standard errors are not adjusted for clustering). Implementation cost data was not available; thus, we use the total undiscounted value of the transfer: $20/monthx48months = $960MER.",

Randomization was conducted at both household and village level, and within the treatment groups: gender of recipient, timing of transfer, and size of transfer. The key outcome measures include consumption, assets, financial inclusion index, and psychological wellbeing index. Follow-up surveys were conducted 9 months after the intervention was rolled out. The psychological well-being index was measured as a weighted average of scores on the CES-D, WVS, Cohen\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s stress scale, and the log cortisol levels obtained from saliva samples.

        "The value of the transfer was $1076 PPP ($485 MER). The authors conservatively assume a cost of delivery of 10% of the transfer value (section 4.4), reasonably given that the transfers are delivered by mobile money, implying a total implementation cost of $1184 PPP ($534 MER)."
