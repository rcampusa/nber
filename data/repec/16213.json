        "Specifically, Istrail et al. (2004) compare the Celera whole genome shotgun assembly (WGSA) as of December 2001 with the NCBI-34 (Build 34, October 2003) release of the public sector human genome assembly. Table 6 in Istrail et al. (2004) gives a list of RefSeq numbers for which the RefSeq mapping was longer in WGSA relative to NCBI-34, and Table 7 in Istrail et al.",
        "(2004) gives an analogous list of RefSeq numbers for which the RefSeq mapping was longer in One reason why an mRNA transcript may be included in the RefSeq data but not in the NCBI-34 assembly is if the transcript was sequenced but it was not clear where the transcript fit in terms of its location on the full human genome assembly. NCBI-34 relative to WGSA.",
        "I obtained an archived version of the mRNA transcripts included in NCBI-34 from the NCBI website (downloaded 27 April 2009), and used a Python script to extract the RefSeq numbers for each mRNA transcript in this data.73 Three RefSeq IDs in this list were duplicates, and I drop one of each duplicate set. Matching this list to the RefSeq release 34 data described above, some records are included in NCBI-34 but not in RefSeq release 34 (largely suspended records), and some records are included in RefSeq release 34 but not in NCBI-34 (as expected, since RefSeq release 34 is a more recent dataset). I discard records in either NCBI-34 or in WGSA that are linked to mRNA transcripts listed in RefSeq release 34 as suspended records."
