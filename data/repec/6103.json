Changes in stocks data for 1861-1900 are from N. G. Butlin (1962, T. 7, p. 22), livestock accumulation, market prices, calendar years, thousands of pounds. Butlin (1962, p. 21) argues that \"Livestock assets form a large part of the total private Australian assets, and changes in livestock assets are very large in relation to total private gross capital formation.\" Butlin proposed a measure of domestic capital accumulation equal to capital formation plus changes in livestock. This procedure is used for Australian data prior to 1901.",
        "This inclusion of livestock accumulation estimates in capital formation data is often controversial, however. As Boehm (1965, p. 211) argues \"The alternative sequence warrants close attention in income and growth analyses because the general effects on output and expenditure of changes in livestock are not necessarily comparable with the effects of changes in fixed assets.\" For Australia, increases in livestock average around 1.07 percent of GDP from 1861 to 1900, and then 0.94 percent from 1900/01 to 1944/45.",
        "From the perspective of national accounts classification, the System of National Accounts advocates the classification of livestock accumulation into estimates of changes in stocks. According to the UN Statistical Office (1952, p. 80), the value of the increase in stocks should be classified in the same way as fixed capital formation in the national accounts. The System of National Accounts was adopted by many countries in our dataset and applied retrospectively to historical data. Thus, for the purposes of this thesis, we will follow this procedure and include livestock accumulation in estimates of changes in stocks. s Net national product if GDP is unavailable.",
