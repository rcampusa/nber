        "One example of this Kind of response is the introduction of bills requiring prior notification o-f a plant closing. The. 'National Employment Priorities Act,\" 98:1, H.R. 2847, mandates at least one year's prior notification of a permanent layoff or a plant closing involving more than 100 workers. Such legislation is similar to what exists in many other developed countries.",
        "See Congressional Budget Office, Pi\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00ablnra+aH UnrKers; Issues And Esdenal Opt i nns, July 1982, Chapter 3, for discussion of various approaches to defining the issue.",
        "In the 1960s this difficulty coupled with politics to prevent any payments to workers under the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act of 1962. Beginning in 196? payments were made increasingly to workers whose employer's product market merely contained foreign competitors.",
        "Congressional Budget Office, op. cit.. uses the Current Population Survey to cl ass i fy unemployed workers, but does not base its criteria for displacement on the reason for job loss. Sandel1-Shapiro (1983) estimate the economic and demographic characteristics of job losers, not classified by reason for loss, in a sample of older workers only.",
        "This finding contrasts with the evidence in Wilcock and Franke (1963, p. 40) showing a median age above 45 among workers displaced in the closings of a group of meat-packing plants.",
        "That the previous wage, not merely the components of the vector X, affects the reservation wage is suggested by the results of Kiefer-Neumann (1979) and Sandell (1980).",
        "I assume, following Farber (1983), that such jobs must be rationed.",
        "That there are such skills is suggested by Shaw (1984). In addition to the -25-labor-market costs that are ignored, there are other costs, such as unexpected capital losses on immobile housing stocks, that must be included in a complete accounting of the social costs of adjustment to industrial change.",
        "See, for example, Mincer-Jovanovrc, 1981, for an example linking these profiles to patterns of firm-specific investment. While the argument here and in most of the literature has based the wage-tenure profile on investment in firm-specific training, one might inquire whether a similar link could be established in a model of bonding such as Lazear's (1981). If both parties' hortzons suddenly shorten in such a model, new workers will be 1 ess wi11ing to forego current wages in exchange for higher wages later. Indeed, with a sufficiently short horizon workers will not sacrifice any current wages, and the profile will be flat. Thus the bonding model seems observational1y equivalent to the model developed here; in both a flattening of the wage-tenure profile implies workers have acquired substantial information. (However, the models may have substantially different implications for appropriate policies on compensation.)",
        "Hashimoto (1975) was the first to recognize the importance of the specific-general distinction in discussing worker displacement. However, he ignored the game-theoretic aspects of specific investment and the effect of changing hortzons, and provided no link between empirical results and the theory of specific investment. Barte1-Borjas (1981) were also aware of the role of specific training in separations, but they did not focus on the wage-tenure profile's relation to time remaining on the job as we do below.",
        "As people separated involuntarily in 1977-81 are included in the sample, wage rates are made comparable across calendar time for T-i, i=l,..,4, by inflating using the growth in private nonfarm hourly earnings between the time the worker's wage is observed and 1980.",
        "This conclusion corroborates the sense of surprise expressed by workers and their representatives when plants close. One local union president discussed how his employer expanded for several years and then, \".. ,we were notified that in three weeks we would be shut down. The people in the town were quite shocked---- It completely caught us off guard.\" (James Savoy, \"Statement,\" House Subcommittee on Labor-Management Relations, 98:2, Hfiarinns May 4, 1984. '",
        "This range brackets the estimates of the rate of depreciation of on-the-job training in Johnson (1970)."
