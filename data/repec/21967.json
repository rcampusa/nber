        "A significant shortcoming in the DCP database is that financial variables that are reported as zero are converted to missing values (p. 14 del, 2011). Moreover, there are a large number of missing values for certain measures, including the appropriated state and local grants measure. For this measure in particular, one could imagine that many schools actually had zero appropriations. For the estimation of the cost function, we of course require that a cost observation be non-missing. Since costs are computed as a residual, this also requires the endowment, investment, and tuition measures to also be non-missing. This results (after trimming) in 23,718 observations for costs (as well as endowment). Investment and net tuition have a total of 30,517 observations. The other variable we take from IPEDS, federal plus state government grants to students, has 23,047 observations (which may be a result of incorrectly missing values).",

        "To map these limits into our model, where we do not distinguish between dependent and independent students, we need to make an assumption. Choy (2002) shows that in 1999-2000, 37.6% (36.7%) of students at public (private) 4-year schools were financially independent."
