        "The DHS are nationally-representative household surveys that are available from ORC Macro (http://www~measuredhs.com). DHS surveys include a household questionnaire, a womens questionnaire, and a mens questionnaire. An exception is the 2003 DHS for Tanzania (also referred to as the HIV/AIDS Indicator Survey (AIS) and which covers only mainland Tanzania); this survey has an individual questionnaire (administered to both men and women), rather than separate mens and womens questionnaires.",
