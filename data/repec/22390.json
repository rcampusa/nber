Data Appendix Overview We are grateful to the authors of the various studies who have generously shared data and answered questions about their charter school projects. This data appendix details the sources of the data that goes into our analyses and details any modifications we needed to make to the original studies in order to combine materials. Our goal was to generate second-stage (LATE), per-year estimates of charter school impacts in both math and ELA, which were directly obtained from the Massachusetts, NYC, SEED, and UP studies.",
        "We were able to estimate per-year local average treatment effects from the student level data for the IES and KIPP 2015 studies. However, for the CMO and KIPP 2013 studies, we needed to modify reported estimates to get our best estimate of the per-year, LATEs (student level data for these studies was not available). When studies reported estimates for a specific year (e.g. year two), we divided reported estimates by the number of years to generate a per-year impact. When studies reported intention-to-treat estimates, we divided by our best estimate of the associated first stage. We also divide the standard errors by the same factors we divide the coefficients. In the cases where we are converting intention-to-treat estimates to second stage estimates, this will not correct the standard errors as a typical 2SLS procedure would in a statistical software program. Thus our standard errors are likely slightly too small for a subset of the charter school impact estimates."
