        "As described above, despite the extensive literature on the effect of food programs on food sufficiency, there are surprisingly few papers focusing on the marginal impact of cash welfare on food security. Borjas (2004) finds evidence of such a relationship using variation induced by state responses to welfare reform to identify the effect. Similarly, studies of \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00c5\u0093welfare leavers\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u009d following the implementation of TANF show some evidence that families leaving welfare experienced food hardships after exiting (see Acs, Loprest, and Roberts, 2001, for a summary). Winship and Jencks (2004) find no evidence that welfare reform aggravated foodrelated problems among single mothers or their children between 1995 and 2002. By focusing on general trends, however, they are largely picking up effects of economic growth and stagnation, rather than on effects of cash assistance per se.",
        "Papers examining the effect of cash assistance on consumption are also informative for our analysis. Meyer and Sullivan (2004) find improvements in consumption of single mother families relative to comparison families following welfare reform. Gruber (2000) examines how the maximum cash assistance benefit level in a state affects consumption of families where a woman becomes a single mother through divorce. He finds that raising the state maximum benefit level by one dollar raises the level of food and housing consumption by 28 cents.",
        "SSI. The Supplemental Security Income Program (SSI) is a federally funded program that provides income support to disabled individuals with limited financial resources.29 The SSIdisabled program has been expanding dramatically over time, with the number of adult recipients growing 89% between 1990 and 2010, and the number of child recipients quadrupling over this same time period. Some of this increase is likely due to movements of individuals from AFDC/TANF to SSI in the aftermath of welfare reform (General Accounting Office, 1997; Wamhoff and Wiseman, 2007). Individuals cannot enroll in both TANF and SSI, though many families have members participating in both programs.",
        "There has been very little research examining the effects of SSI on either general wellbeing or food security, despite evidence that suggests that the disabled have high levels of overall material hardship and food insecurity (She and Livermore, 2007; Parish, Rose, and Andrews 29 The SSI program also provides means-tested income support to the elderly, but that is beyond the focus of this paper.",
        "Coleman-Jensen and Nord (2013) find that disability income recipients are more likely to be food insecure than other disabled individuals, but note that this likely reflects differences in the severity of their disabilities. However, Schmidt and Danziger (2012) analyze a sample of former welfare recipients and find that disability benefit recipients are significantly more likely than unsuccessful applicants to report food insufficiency, even after controlling for detailed health conditions, activity limitations, and individual fixed effects.",
        "Though SSI benefits are set at the federal level, a number of states provide additional optional supplements. In 2010, 21 states provided SSI supplements that ranged in maximum dollar amounts from $1 to $362. These supplement amounts also vary over time, both in nominal and in real terms. Higher state supplements have been shown to be associated with the share of children on SSI (e.g., Garrett and Glied, 2000).",
        "EITC. The federal Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is a refundable credit administered through the tax system for low-income families with earned income. It has grown rapidly since its creation, from $5.0 billion (2009$) in 1975 to $60.4 billion in 2009 (Tax Policy Center, 2012), in part due to a series of expansions to the credit in the 1980s and 1990s (Hotz and Scholz, 2003). The EITC differs in several important ways from the other programs considered in this project. First, it is targeted at families with workers. Second, because it is administered through the tax system, most EITC recipients receive their credit in a lump sum in February or 30 For example, She and Livermore (2007) find that of the poor and near-poor individuals in the SIPP who experienced hunger, 62% reported a disability.",
        "March, rather than spread throughout the year. Research that examines how recipients spend their credit focuses on the one-time nature of the cash transfer. Using the Consumer Expenditure Survey, Barrow and McGranahan (2000) find that EITC-eligible households spend 9% more on durable goods in February than do similar households that are not eligible for the credit. Smeeding, Ross Phillips, and O\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0084\u00a2Connor (2000) surveyed low-income households in Chicago that filed tax returns about their plans for using their EITC.

        "A related literature examines the effects of food programs on food consumption. Theory predicts that food programs raise the quality and quantity of food consumed in a household in two ways: by increasing the total resources available to the household and by shifting the allocation of household resources towards food. Gundersen and Ziliak (2003) find that due to SNAP, food consumption is significantly less volatile than income. A number of papers have found that the marginal propensity to consume food out of a dollar of food stamps is higher than that out of a dollar of cash income (e.g. Fraker 1990; Breunig and Dasgupta 2002; Fraker, Martini, and Ohls 1995; Fraker et al. 1995). Using the diffused introduction of the Food Stamp Program across counties, Hoynes and Schanzenbach (2009) estimate that the marginal propensity to consume food out of a dollar of food stamps is comparable to that out of a dollar of income.",
        "Medicaid/CHIP. These programs provide health insurance for children and some parents in low-income families. Although originally linked tightly to eligibility for AFDC or SSI, eligibility limits have steadily risen since the mid-1980s, allowing children in families with incomes as high as 200 percent of the federal poverty line or higher to be eligible for public insurance. This expansion of eligibility means that roughly a third of all children are incomeeligible for Medicaid and about half of all children are income-eligible for Medicaid or CHIP (Dubay, Haley, and Kennedy, 2002). The income limits for eligibility vary substantially across states and, following seminal work by Currie and Gruber (1996), exogenous state variation in eligibility is typically captured by a variable measuring the fraction of a national sample that would be eligible under the rules in effect in each state.",

        "Individuals are eligible for SSI if their countable income is less than the federal benefit rate, and the benefit level is the difference between the two. In calculating countable income, there is a $20 general income exclusion. The first $65 of earned income is excluded, then 1/2 of earnings over $65. These exclusion amounts were constant in nominal terms throughout the 2000s. Married couples are subject to the same $20/$65 income exclusions as an individual regardless of whether they both have income.",
