        "In all, we have 7,910 inventions, on which 3,382 patent applications were filed, and 2,659 patents granted (which we identify by linking serials to granted patents). 2,657 of these patents were granted by 1980, when our sample for this paper ends.",
        "For completeness, we also search for continuations, divisions, and continuations-in-part of OSRD patent applications. To do so, we parse the first 800 characters of the text of patents filed between 1935 and 1969 (application series 2, 3, and 4) to identify patents which mention an OSRD serial, and manually check these cases to determine whether they were continued or divided from earlier short form in 1942, when the research program was spun off into a weapons development program (the Manhattan Project), to ensure that the government controlled the intellectual property.",
        "OSRD-supported filings. Through this process we find an additional 104 OSRD-supported patents, bringing our total to 2,763 patents (2,761 granted by 1980).",
        "Note that serial numbers, filing dates, and the network of patent citations were also retrieved from the Derwent database for comparison against the FPO data, as a validation exercise.

(2019): indicators for government-owned or-supported patents A small subset of patents are missing filing dates and assignees. Table A.1 shows the number patents with missing data, by decade of grant. For the period sampled in this paper (1930-1970), approximately 2.3% of patents are missing a filing date and 2.3% missing an assignee (note: these percentages are calculated for patents granted between 1930 and 1970, whereas the paper uses the sample of patents known to have been filed between 1930 and 1970).",
        "See Petralia et al. (2016) for the HistPat data and documentation, as well as Berkes (2018) and Andrews (2019) for additional discussion of historical patent geography data. Although these corrections are valuable for matching patents to secrecy orders, the low error rate for this sample also indicates that such errors are not widespread in the data.",
        "This classification procedure was developed over several years, and although \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c like the name harmonization \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c it is neither perfect nor exhaustive, random spot checks suggest it is overwhelmingly effective at categorizing assignees into the right bins. In total, 60.1% of patents with an assignee in the 1920-1979 sample are assigned to a firm, 0.2% to a university, 0.8% to a government agency, and 39.1% to an individual (numbers sum to &gt;100% because 5% of patents have multiple assignees, and 0.2% have assignees in multiple categories).",
        "Measuring inventor locations from patent text for the universe of patents is too large a problem for manual transcription efforts, and researchers who have tried to do so typically rely on a mix of OCR with rule-based regex string parsing, machine learning, and manual correction. Although the earliest release of the Petralia et al. (2016) data contained errors which caused the geolocation rate (the fraction of patents with a location) to drop precipitously in certain grant years, the most recent data release (v8, January 2019) patches these errors and is the version we use.

An additional advantage of this dataset is that it provides FIPS codes for each county, with fixed (modern) county boundaries (i.e., accounting for county boundary changes over time), which we can use to merge the patent data with other county-level datasets.",
        "Throughout this paper, we use these data as given, identifying the first-listed inventor\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s location as the principal place of invention (as is convention). In parallel, we have undertaken a multi-pronged effort to validate these data ourselves. We begin by comparing counts of granted patents in our data by state and year to administrative totals from the USPTO\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s 1977 Technology Assessment & Forecast report.9 We also collect two hand-entered, patent-level validation samples. For the first validation sample, we pick 200 random patents from 1930, 1940, 1950, 1960, and 1970, and have Mechanical Turk workers load the patent document and record inventor and assignee locations.",
        "Figure A.4 plots the state-year totals in our data against the USPTO administrative totals, by state, for the 1930 to 1970 period. With the exception of deviations in a handful of state-years (e.g., NY in the 1930s, RI around 1950, VT in 1940, ID in 1950), and one or two states (e.g., WV), the totals from the HistPat data closely track those in the USPTO data. 9",

        "1. Changes to SIC classification. Between 1947 and 1980, the SIC classification underwent multiple revisions, adding new industries, combining/dividing/reclassifying existing industries, and updating industry definitions to shift some types of businesses across industries. These changes primarily occur at the level of 4-digit industries. We use the 1945, 1957, 1967, and 1972 editions of the SIC Classification Manual (the latest editions preceding each of our sampling years) to build year-to-year crosswalks between all SIC industries on the 366 and 367 branches of the classification tree, but at these more aggregated levels, definitions are stable: all changes to 4-digit industries occur entirely within these branches. This stability is another motivation for performing our analysis at the 3-digit SIC level.",
        "2. Data suppression. A more challenging problem is data suppression: the CBP historically suppressed employment and wages in county-industries with very few establishments, to avoid disclosing data on individual establishments \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c and this is particularly the case for later editions (the 1947 edition does not appear to have suppressed data). Because data suppression was much more common for 4-digit industries than for the 3-digit industries we study, and because the industries we study are relatively geographically concentrated, this is less of a problem for this paper than it would otherwise be \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c this is yet another reason to study industrial activity at these more aggregated levels. However, employment values are nevertheless suppressed for our focal industries (366 and 367) in some counties and years.",
        "We handle these changes by combining the affected counties and independent cities into single units for analysis of CBP outcomes, since we can safely add their values together whereas we do not have solid grounds for how to divide counties into smaller pieces. For the counties and independent cities which were eliminated between 1947 and 2000, we combine them with the absorbing county in the CBP data (bringing the data forward to 2000). For the counties and independent cities which were established between 1947 and 2000, we add them back to their parent counties in the patent data (bringing these cases back to 1947).",
        "The Historical Atlas and the Census webpage also discuss other boundary changes, most of which are boundary redefinitions or transfers of small areas between counties \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c often between counties and independent cities in Virginia, specifically. Because the affected population is small, these adjustments would not have a material impact on the data or results, and they are omitted. We also run our analysis of the CBP data excluding all of Virginia, and find our results unchanged, particularly as many of these cases are already omitted due to county-independent city binning in the 1959 data.",
        "We use records from the Harvard and MIT university archives to compile rosters of technical staff from each of these labs. The MIT archive\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s collection of Rad Lab records contains three documents useful towards this end: (i) a list of former RL staff members published in June 1946, which lists the name, field, highest degree, year of degree, and years spent at the RL; (ii) the most reliable known address of former staff members, as of March 1946; and (iii) the post-war job (or grad school) placement of former staff members, as of January 1946. We digitize these data sources, harmonizing name formats in the process so that we can successfully link individuals across them.",
        "Although some individuals appear in only a subset of these records, for most we have complete records. From the Harvard archive, we observe only RRL staff member addresses, as of March 1946, without the ancillary information on educational background or post-war job placement. We supplement this information by collecting data on all pre-, mid-, and post-war patents by these individuals, which we can use to study the effects that these individuals might have had on local inventive activity after the war in the fields where they were active.",
