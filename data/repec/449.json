        "Previously Argy and Kouri (1974) had also found evidence of sterilization, but GSberg (1976) using a very rudimentary reaction function (the only variables ware the scaled balance of payments and government deficit) did not. Prom their review of the earlier literature on sterilization and monetary control, Sweeney and Willett (1976, p. 444) conclude that \"there is little evidence that such automony is impossible in the short\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009drun, and considerable evidence it is possible.\" 3The analysis is properly applied only to nonreserve countries if the reserve country (such as the United States) is on a fiat standard as discussed in Darby (1980). 4By way of information, the evidence cited in footnote 2 above generally finds cx to lie between 0 and 0.2 or at most 0.3.. This implies that substantial but not necessarily complete sterilization was the standard practice for those nonreserve industrial countries which were examined.",
