        "The latter survey is conducted every three months, with the \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093Monthly Survey\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d (a shorter version of the \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093Effects of the financial crisis\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d survey) conducted in the intervening two months. As of the writing of the paper, data from November, 2008 to March, 2011 (25 waves of data) was publicly available through the RAND website, with data through March, 2012 embargoed. Both of the repeated modules used in the paper are ongoing; as a result, new modules are added each month. After March, 2011 (wave 25), however, changes were made to the sample design that were beyond our control (i.e., the sample size was reduced and a portion of the reduced sample was not asked the subjective response questions that comprise our main variable of interest). For this reason, we have not used subsequent waves of the sample in our analysis.",
        "Appendix D: Likelihood calculation The derivation of the likelihood is provided below for the likelihood of an individual observation. Individual subscripts have been omitted for notational simplicity. The covariate matrices \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c which are row vectors in this case, as they refer to an individual observation \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c are represented with lower case instead of capital letters. The likelihood of a non-focal response is given by: P(w*&gt;0) = 2 2 0 1 2 2 0 1 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 The likelihood of a focal response is then given by: 1 2 2 2 2 Where \u00c3\u0090\u00c2\u00a4 is the standard normal cumulative distribution function. When there is a non-focal response p, the density, is given by the beta distribution with parameters \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b11 and \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b12 (Mendenhall, Scheaffer and Wackerly, 1981): | , 1 1 with \u00c3\u008e\u00e2\u0080\u009c the gamma function and \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b11, \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b12, and \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00bc given by: 1  and \u00c3\u008f\u00e2\u0080\u00a0 a constant. When there is a focal response, the likelihood for a response of 50 (v*&gt;0) is given by 3 3 and that of zero or 100 by 3 3 ."
