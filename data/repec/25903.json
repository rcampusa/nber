B.1.1 Pay for Percentile In the Pay for Percentile design there are L rank-order tournaments based on student performance, where L is the number of student types or the number of groupings, such that students in the same group are similar to each other. Under this incentive scheme, teachers maximize their expected payoffs, net of costs, from each rank-order tournament.

        "As the equilibrium behavior for teachers under Pay for Percentile was described in detail in Barlevy and Neal (2012), we refer our readers to consult their findings for additional insights. B.1.5 A Comparison of Optimal Teacher Effort We compute equilibrium teacher responses under two different stylized scenarios (or assumptions about the productivity of teacher effort in the production function) to illustrate how changes in these assumptions can alter equilibrium responses. The goal of this exercise is to highlight the impact of the production function specification on the distribution of learning gains in both our treatments.",
        "Since this study was built on the RCT by Mbiti et al. (in press), we used the endline tests that were administered in 2014 for that study as the baseline for this study. The material covered by our tests in Kiswahili and English included reading syllables, reading words, and a reading comprehension. In math, the tests covered simple counting, number recognition, inequalities of number (i.e., which is greater), addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.",
        "For each subject we present Lee (2009) bounds for all the treatment estimates (i.e., trimming the left/right tail of the distribution in Levels and P4Pctile schools so that the proportion of test takers is the same as the number in control schools). Standard errors, clustered at the school level, are in parentheses. \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00cb\u0086\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0094 p &lt; 0.10, \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00cb\u0086\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00cb\u0086\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0094 p &lt; 0.05, \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00cb\u0086\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00cb\u0086\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00cb\u0086\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0094 p &lt; 0.01 D.6 National Assessments We test the effect of both interventions on the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) taken by students in grade 7. We retrieved records for all schools in Tanzania from the National Examinations Council of Tanzania (NECTA) website (https://necta .go.tz/psle results) and then merged them with out data using a fuzzy merge based on the school name, region, and district. We were able to match over 80% of schools in our data."
