These county-level payments are tied to historical Traditional Medicare (TM) costs in the county, although the exact formula determining payments varied over time.36 Between the start of the MA program (formerly Medicare+Choice) in 1985 and the end of our study period, there were three distinct regimes determining capitation payments.",
        "1. From 1985 to 1997, MA capitation payments were set at 95% of the Average Adjusted Per Capita Cost (AAPCC). The AAPCC was an actuarial estimate intended to match expected TM expenditures in the county. TM costs were adjusted for local demographic factors so that payments reflected local TM costs for the \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00c5\u0093national average beneficiary.\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u009d 2. From 1998 to 2000, county payments were updated via a complex formula created by the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997. Specifically, plans were paid the maximum of (i) a blended rate, which was a weighted average of the county rate and the national rate, subject to a budget neutrality condition; (ii) a minimum payment floor implemented in the BBA and updated annually, and (iii) a 2% \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00c5\u0093minimum update\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u009d over the prior year\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s rate, applying in 1998 to the 1997 AAPCC rate. Because of a binding budget neutrality condition in 1998 and 1999, blended payments in practice applied only to year 2000.",
        "3. From 2001 to 2003, county payments were set as the maximum of a 2% minimum update and a payment floor created by the Benefits Improvement and Protection Act (BIPA) of 2000. (For updating the 2001 rate only, there was an additional 1% increase mid-year.) Unlike the BBA 1997 floor, BIPA floors varied with each county\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s rural/urban status. The floors were indexed to medical expenditure growth via the national per capita Medicare+Choice growth percentage.",
        "For 2002 only, these Medicare+Choice growth percentage adjustments exceeded the 2% minimum update applied to the prior year\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s floors. For 2003, the 2% minimum update applied to the prior year\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s floors exceeded the floor levels determined by the Medicare+Choice growth percentage, and therefore the minimum update was the binding increase for floor counties.",
        "After 1997, there was no explicit link between TM costs and MA payment updates. However, in practice, MA payments continued to be linked to historical TM costs since the rate that formed the basis to which all annual updates and floors were applied was the 1997 AAPCC.",
        "In addition to the formulas, the Balanced Budget Refinement Act (BBRA) of 1999 created a temporary system of bonuses (5% in the first year and 3% in the second) for plans entering \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00c5\u0093underserved\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u009d counties. Underserved counties were those in which an MA plan had not been offered since 1997 or from which, as of October 13, 1999 (the day prior to BBRA\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s introduction in Congress), all insurers had declared exit. Thus, plans reversing their exit decisions could receive the bonus. These payments did not directly affect capitation rates but rather provided temporary bonuses in addition to the capitation payments. A.2 Pass-Through under Risk Adjustment Equation 7 in Section 5 gives the first-order condition for price setting, ignoring risk adjustment. To incorporate risk adjustment, let us define the aggregate risk adjustment function R(Q) = R",
