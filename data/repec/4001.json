ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This paper was written while I was visiting the Research Department of the International Monetary Fund. I am grateful to the IMF for offering an extremely congenial research environment, and to the Joint Bank-Fund Library for giving me access to the Bretton Woods Files. Marcel Cassard provided outstanding research assistance, and Reena Mithal helped us with the construction of the dataset used in the paper. Zhaohui Chen has allowed me to use some results from our joint research, and has generously helped running the statistical models we have developed elsewhere on the gold standard data.
