        "Notes: In Figure 6a, the x-axis represents dierent percentiles of the distribution of the average noisiness measure; the higher the percentile, the noisier the signal. The y-axis is the predicted percentage change in the probability of promotion of increasing OCP performance by 1 per 1000. The gure is plotted using estimates in column (4) of Table 3. In Figure 6b, the x-axis represents dierent percentiles of the distribution of the average competitiveness measure; the higher the percentile, the more competitive the tournament.",
        "The gure is plotted using estimates in column (4) of Table 4. Figure 6c plots marginal eects of increasing OCP performance by 1 per 1000 on the probability of promotion using estimates from Table A.4. For ease of interpretation, the gure only displays statistically signicant eects.",
        "Birth rates in 1990-1994 from the 2000 Census and in 1985-1989 from the 1990 Census Migration rate before 1995 is below 4%. For 1985-1994, migration information in the census is limited. The 2000 Census did not have the prefecture-by-year migration information for migrants who moved to the current prefecture before 1995, and it is the same for migrants in the 1990 Census.",
        "In 1985-1994, we are not able to use the exact migration information in computing birth rate. See the formula for 1985-1994 below: Bratecpt = Births1 cpt Populationcpt+1 \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00cb\u0086\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Births1 cpt+1 . Nevertheless, we use available information from census to control for migration in our estimation.",
        "We construct two sets of aggregate migration measures at the prefecture level: 1) The number of out-migrants by the province they moved out in 1990-1994 and in 1985-1989, respectively 2) The number of in-migrants by the current province in 1990-1994 and 1985-1989, respectively To control for migration in these years, we include interactions of each aggregate measure at the prefecture or province level interacted with time dummy, for example, the number of out-migrants in province p in 1990-1994 interacted with a dummy indicating the time period 1990-1994."
