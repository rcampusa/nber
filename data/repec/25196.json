HHI Destination is the SBL market concentration in the destination (host) market. HHI Origin is the SBL market concentration in the closest branch (home) market. HHI Difference is the difference in SBL market concentration between destination (host) market and the closest branch (home) market. Coefficient Variation HHI is the coefficient of variation of the market concentration in counties where banks have a branch presence.",
        "Local market concentration is measured as the HHI of the small business lending market in each county measured in 1996. The specification includes borrower county-by-year and bank fixed-effects as well as baseline controls for natural logarithm of Total Assets, Share of Commercial & Real Estate Loans, Share of Residential Loans, and Share of Commercial & Industrial Loans. The specification also conditions on the interactions between HHI and the business cycle indicators, and HHI and Distance.",
