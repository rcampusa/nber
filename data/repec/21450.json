Between 1543 and 1547 the Court of Augmentations oversaw the sale of two thirds of all expropriated land. By 1558 virtually land had been sold (Habakkuk, 1958). The sale of the monastic land was in hands of the Court of Augmentations.28 Most sales of monastic land were concluded 26For an exact chronology of the dissolution of the lesser monasteries see Jack (1970) and Hoyle (1995).

In Norfolk, the gentry possessed 70% of 1527 manors by 1545; by 1565 this was 76% (Swales, 1969). Not all these gentry were established before and merely expanded their possessions. Of the leading gentry families in Hertfordshire in 1642 less than 10% had been settled there before 1485. In Essex this figure stood at 18%, in Norfolk 42% and in Suffolk 13% (Mingay, 1976, p. 9).

Yet as Heal (2008) documents, by 1650 the lands of the bishops and cathedrals were sold off as a consequence of them siding with Charles I in the Civil War. Though after the Restoration the bishops got their land back it was generally leased out to the new occupant in very long leases (typically 99 years). At the end of this process, the only remaining lands in the hands of the Church were held by Oxford and Cambridge colleges and some cathedrals, and parish churches which owned the plot of land they were on.",
        "Connecting the Dissolution and the Industrial Revolution In the introduction to the paper we suggested that even though this connection has not been explored much before, there is a great deal of case study evidence that suggests that the gentry played important roles in the Industrial Revolution.

Among the Lancashire families, the Listers alone appear to have been on yeoman extraction.
