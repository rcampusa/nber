Graph (a) assumes that the density is strictly increasing, which is impossible given that 65% of taxpayers claim the standard deduction. This scenario would fail to account for most of the population of taxpayers. Graph (b) accounts for most of the population and is continuous at the standard deduction but the density is double peaked. This is possible but unlikely given that densities are usually single peaked. This however does not rule out densities that are double-peaked because of the standard deduction. Graph (c) assumes that there is a discontinuity at the standard deduction threshold because of compliance costs creating a missing mass.",

They are based on IRS surveys of taxpayers at the time of filing and are reported in the 1040 instructions (on page 3 in 1989). There is no information on Sch. R in the SOI public use files so its cost is not estimated in this paper."
