        "Announced changes in Ml-B are analyzed here because of the emphasis placed on Ml-B by the Federal Reserve policymakers and market participants. It should also be noted that the Ml-B data for 1981 are not the shift-adjusted Ml-B figures which reflect the introduction of nationwide NOW accounts. While the Federal Reserve's target range was in terms of shift-adjusted Ml-B, weekly announced changes were not shift adjusted.",

        "The discount rate dummy variables are defined as follows: D^ = 1 when discount rate raised 1/4 point = 0 otherwise D^ = 1 when discount rate raised 1/2 point = 0 otherwise D^ = 1 when surcharge raised 3 points = 0 otherwise D. = 1 when discount rate lowered 1 point 4 = 0 otherwise D,. = 1 when surcharge lowered 1 point = 0 otherwise D = 1 when discount rate lowered 1 point and surcharge lowered 1 point 6 = 0 otherwise.
