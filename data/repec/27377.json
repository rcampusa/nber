India thus joined more than 100 countries including United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, Belgium, Norway and others where the right to education is a fundamental and justifiable right of every citizen in the country from 1",
        "The two cases were Mohini Jain v. Union of India (1992) 3 SCC 666 and J P Unnikrishnan v. State of Andhra Pradesh, 1993 SCC (1) 645. In the case of J P Unnikrishnan v. State of Andhra Pradesh, 1993, the Supreme Court stated that: \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093The citizens of this country have a fundamental right to education. The said right flows from Article 21. This right is, however, not an absolute right. Its content and parameters have to be determined in the light of Articles 45 and 41. In other words, every child/citizen of this country has a right to free education until he completes the age of fourteen years. Thereafter his right to education is subject to the limits of economic capacity and development of the State.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d 2",

        "April 1st , 2010.4 Consequently, the state governments enforced the RTE Act by passing it in their own state legislatures. It should be noted that not all states passed the Act in their legislatures at the same time (see Appendix Table 1 for details of time period of enforcement in each state). To elaborate, seven states/UTs - namely Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chandigarh, Dadra & Nagar Haveli, Daman & Diu, Uttar Pradesh, and Uttarakhand - were first to pass the RTE Act in their state legislatures. But even these states took about nearly eight months to pass the Act in their own legislatures. About 20 other states passed the RTE Act in their legislatures nearly after one year and more - where four states passed it only in 2012 which is nearly two years after its enactment in the Indian Parliament. We exploit this feature of staggered enforcement by region and time to build causal strength in our analysis as we describe below.",
        "Although nationally enforced from August 2009, as we have discussed above, Taneja et al. (2011) find regional heterogeneity in implementation and report that there were only ten states which had come up with its State RTE rules by 2011. It wasn\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2t until 2013 that all states and union territories had drafted its RTE rules. In a report assessing the RTE implementation in 2015, prior work shows that there exists very poor compliance with the RTE Act, 2009, across all the states. In general, the RTE Act has been implemented as \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093yet another scheme\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d (Sachdeva et al, 2015).",

        "Despite these issues, the state governments have enforced and regulated the private unaided schools more strictly under RTE Act. During 2015-2018, the National Independent Schools Alliance (NISA) reports that there were 2,469 private schools closed, 13,546 private schools served closure notice and 4,482 private schools are on closure threat owing to noncompliance of RTE norms across fourteen states in India.11 While this shows that the government have enforced compliance as mandated by RTE Act, it has raised debate over the financial viability of low-cost private schools to run its operations. A recent study points out that the closing of these schools owing to one or other technicality of RTE Act would result in 60 percent of children being forced out of the school education system in Patna city (Rangaraju, Tooley, & Dixon, 2012).",
        "In sum, the RTE Act enacted in August 2009 held promises of ensuring greater access to good quality primary and upper primary education to all children up to the age of fourteen years.",
