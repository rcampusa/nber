        "(21) Recognizing that with the form of the power function in (2), ptA2p = (I 2(,P_)pP) P2 and sub- stituting for peal, PA, and FIB (the values of the latter two terms are from the first order conditions) in U~A2, we can show that unit =\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0094U2B. = 0 AISO, the negativity of second order conditions in equilibrium ensures that U] \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b7 U2B2 > 0. Hence (21) holds. 37 Proof of lemma 2: Totally differentiating the first order conditions, Us (gA,gB,AA) = O U2B (gA, gB, ~A) = 0, we get UI} \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b7 6)A ~ UI2 \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b7 o>A = - UI>A"
