The variable is calculated as KLi = ln(jKAPWUS KAPWij), where KAPWi is the capital to worker ratio for 2005. Market Size: Market size was measured as the logarithm of real GDP (GDP). This data is constructed from the Penn World Tables, V 7.1, at the natural logarithm of the product of real GDP per capita, CGDP, and population, POP.",

It is the cost share of non-production workers, which is calculated as wage bill of non-production workers by industry (total wages - production worker wages) divided by total value-added by industry. The data were obtained from the Annual Survey of Manufacturers data for the year 2009.",
        "Skill Endowment (Skillend): The skill endowment of a country was measured using the human capital per worker variable calculated by Hall and Jones (1999).

We added 0.001 to R&D intensity before taking logarithms to avoid throwing away a large number of observations with zero R&D outlays, while we dropped observations for which R&D expenditures exceeded sales. The R&D intensity for each NAICS industry in columns I-V was then calculated as the weighted average value of log(0:001 + R&D=Sales) over the years 2000-2006. Following Antr\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a0s and Chor (2012), the R&D intensity for the average buyer in columns VI-VIII was calculated by taking a weighted average over the years 2000-2005 of the R&D intensity of the industries that purchase the input in question, with weights equal to these input purchase values as reported in the 2002 U.S. I-O Tables.",
        "Skill Intensity: From the NBER-CES Manufacturing Industry Database (Becker and Gray, 2009). Skill intensity is the log of the number of non-production workers divided by total employment. A simple average of the annual values from 2000-2005 was taken to obtain the seller industry measure of skill intensity in columns I-V. For the buyer skill intensity measure in columns VI-VIII we followed the same procedure as for the R&D intensity measure.",
        "Capital Intensity: All the capital intensity measures (Buildings, Equipment, Autos, Computers, and Other Equipment, all divided by total employment) were taken from the Annual Survey of Manufactures (url http://www.census.gov/manufacturing/asm/), where they are available at the NAICS level (but at a slightly less disaggregated level than the skill intensity measure taken from the NBER-CES data). A simple average of the annual values from 2002-2010 was taken to obtain the seller industry measures of capital intensity in columns I-V.

(2002).) We took one minus this value as a measure of the own contractibility of each IO2002 industry. The average buyer contractibility was then calculated using the same procedure described for computing the average buyer R&D intensity.",
