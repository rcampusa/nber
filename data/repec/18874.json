The author gratefully acknowledges the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada for continuing research support. 64 Charts This chartbook considers the evidence on 40 real commodity price series which are drawn from seven product categories\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009danimal products, energy products, grains, metals, minerals, precious metals, and soft commodities\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dand which are enumerated in Table 1.",
        "Figure 1a applies three weighting schemes to the real commodity price series from 1900 to 2013: equal shares, shares based on 1975 production values, and shares based on 2011 production values. Here, we treat the index based on 1975 production values as our preferred measure of general commodity price movements.1 Figures 1b and 1c represent an exercise in trend-cycle decomposition for this series as described in Jacks (2013). Table 2 reports the proportionate changes in the estimated long-run trends for the 40 commodities while Figures 2a through 8d depict the evolution of the underlying series. Figures 9a through 48b replicate the previously mentioned exercise in trend-cycle decomposition at the individual commodity level.",
        "Figures 49 through 88 combine the logged real price series for the 40 commodities under consideration and the characterization of boom/bust episodes detailed in Jacks (2013). Finally, all data related to real commodity prices, long-run trends, medium-run cycles, and boom-bust episodes are now freely available at http://www.sfu.ca/~djacks/data/boombust/index.html 1",
