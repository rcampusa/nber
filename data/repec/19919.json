        "C Additional Parametrization Details C.1 Cost and Expenditure Shares We parametrize the model using the data described below and national values. Starting with income shares, Krueger (1999) argues that sw is close to 75 percent. Poterba (1998) estimates that the share of income from corporate capital is 12 percent, so sI should be higher and is taken as 15 percent. This leaves 10 percent for sR, which is roughly consistent with estimates in Keiper et al.",
        "(1961) and Case (2007).43 Turning to expenditure shares, Albouy (2008), Moretti (2008), and Shapiro (2006) find that housing costs approximate non-housing cost differences across cities. The cost-of-living differential is sy \u00c3\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u00a0 pj , where \u00c3\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u00a0 pj equals the housing-cost differential and sy equals the expenditure share on housing plus an additional term which captures how a one percent increase in housing costs predicts a b = 0.26 percent increase in non-housing costs.44 In the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX), the share of income spent on shelter and utilities, shous, is 0.22, while the share of income spent on other goods, soth, is 0.56, leaving 0.22 spent on taxes or saved (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2002).45 Thus, our coefficient on the housing cost differential is sy = shous + sothb = 0.22 + 0.56 \u00c3\u0083\u00e2\u0080\u0094 0.26 = 36 percent. This leaves sx at 64 percent.",
        "We choose the cost shares to be consistent with the expenditure and income shares above. \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b8L appears small: Beeson and Eberts (1986) use a value of 0.027, while Rappaport (2008a, 2008b) uses a value of 0.016. Valentinyi and Herrendorff (2008) estimate the land share of tradables at 43 The values Keiper reports were at a historical low. Keiper et al. (1961) find that total land value was found to be about 1.1 times GDP. A rate of return of 9 percent would justify using sR = 0.10. Case (2007), ignoring agriculture, estimates the value of land to be $5.6 trillion in 2000 when personal income was $8.35 trillion. 44 See Albouy (2008) for details. 45 Utility costs account for one fifth of shous, which means that without them this parameter would be roughly 0.18. v",
        "Determining the federal deduction level requires taking into account the fact that many households do not itemize deductions. According to the Statistics on Income, although only 33 percent of tax returns itemize, they account for 67 percent of reported Adjusted Gross Income (AGI). Since the income-weighted share is what matters, 67 percent is multiplied by the effective tax reduction given in TAXSIM, in 2000 of 21.6 percent. Thus, on average these deductions reduce the effective price of eligible goods by 14.5 percent. Since eligible goods only include housing, this deduction applies to only 59 percent of home goods. Multiplying 14.5 percent times 59 percent gives an effective price reduction of 8.6 percent for home goods. Divided by a federal tax rate of 33.3 percent, this produces a federal deduction level of 25.7 percent.",
