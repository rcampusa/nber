        "The 2018 CDC document contains estimates, to the nearest 50k, of the number of people within each group within each tier. These numbers come from \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093information provided by Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Health and Human Services, and U.S. Census Bureau.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d These priority tiers sometimes overlap. If someone qualifies for two or more tiers, they are vaccinated with the highest tier they qualify for. However, the document and surrounding CDC sites do not specify whether they would be included in each tier&apos;s estimated numbers or only that of the highest tier. In our process, we are assuming that the CDC numbers encompass those who qualify for higher tiers as well.",
        "As the CDC&apos;s data is unavailable to us, we use the American Community Survey (ACS) 20142018 5-year Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) (U.S. Census Bureau 2014-2018). The 5year PUMS contains two datasets, one containing housing unit characteristics for a sample of housing units and another containing individual characteristics for the individuals within those same housing units. We use the person data, which has over 15 million observations, for our labelling of tiers.",
        "The PUMS person data is a weighted sample. Every observation of an individual in the PUMS person data is associated with a weight called \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093person&apos;s weight for generating statistics on individuals\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d (PWGTP). This weight is \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093used to bring the characteristics of the sample more into agreement with those of the full population by compensating for differences in sampling rates across areas, differences between the full sample and the interviewed sample, and differences between the sample and independent estimates of basic demographic characteristic estimates of population characteristics\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d, according to the ACS Design and Methodology report (U.S. Census Bureau 2014).",

We supplement with 2018 data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) (CDC 2018b). As the observations in the BRFSS are unrelated to those in the PUMS, we rely on randomization to link the two datasets by computing the proportion with a high-risk condition for each characteristic demographic group in the BRFSS and assigning each observation in PUMS person data as high-risk using weighted coin flips. More details are in the \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093Tier inclusion criteria\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d section of this document.

This is not a Monte Carlo simulation.",

Missing values and omitted observations Most of the PUMS variables we use are not counted for the ~8 million living in group quarters, which include prisons, nursing facilities, and college/university housing (US Census Bureau 2017). We do not compute a raw numerical ADI for those people and those people are excluded from the deciles. People in group quarters are automatically excluded from the high-ADI for reserve purposes. High-ADI is defined as being in the top 3 deciles of people who do not live in group quarters. Thus, the proportion of people designated as high-ADI is slightly less than 30%.",
