        "The weights were the shares of industrial production accounted for by each industry. For 1955\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d1960 the 1955 weights were used; for 1961\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d1969 weights from 1963 were used; for 1970\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d1978 weights from 1970 were used, while 1979 weights were applied to the data from 1979\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d1982. 5' \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d, It is also worth noting that the Box\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dPierce test cannot reject the hypothesis that the residuals from this simple bivariate regression of p on p_1 are white noise. Using the contemporaneous correlatlon2and three lags, ana making Haugh's correction for degrees of freedom, the x test\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dstatistic is 8.39. While this is significantly different from zero at the 90\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dpercent level, it is not so at the 95\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dpercent level.",
