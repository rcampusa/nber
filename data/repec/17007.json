        "Both floor (58) and put (63) formulae assume that the underlying flow s or asset S follows the stochastic differential equation dst st = dSt St = (r ) dt + dZt (64) with initial values s0 and S0, respectively. Clearly, (64) describes a geometric Brownian motion under risk-neutral measure where Zt is the standard Brownian motion,  is the volatility, r is the riskless rate and  is the service flow. We assume that (64) describes the dynamics of the repayment flow s. Similarly, (64) also defines the dynamics of the value S of the real estate property. Alternatively, the model could be specified under the actual probability measure, extending Shiller and Weiss (1999) to allow for computation of floors, for example along the lines of Shackleton and Wojakowski (2007).
