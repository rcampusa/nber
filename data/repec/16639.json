        "The dynamics are determined by Marshallian conditions if a natural advantage site loses its innate importance. If local Marshallian forces are strong, agglomeration can persist absent the original natural advantages. If local Marshallian forces are weak, the cluster may be vacated over time. The former scenario is in line with the related empirical work by Bleakley and Lin (2010) on the persistence of US cities originally centered on portage sites. This natural advantage has lost its economic importance, but Bleakley and Lin (2010) find continued and growing importance of these locations.",
        "44We say that natural advantages are fully transmissible if when j(i') 2 BpA (j(i)) and dj(i))fc < pK, then i' receives utility equal to GK(dj(i)jfc), the full value of the natural advantage to i. 39 Empirical Appendix This appendix begins with a deeper presentation of the technology flow maps discussed in the introduction. Color images of these maps are available at http://www.people.hbs.edu/wkerr/. We then introduce the US Census Bureau data employed and our approximation of the continuous Duranton and Overman (2005) metric. We close with additional descriptive statistics on US industrial concentration. The main text summarizes this material.",
        "Technology Flows in Silicon Valley We start with a characterization of technology flows in Silicon Valley and its surrounding region. The underlying structures of these technology flows exhibit several properties that are central to our location choice model, making this visual description a useful reference point. We employ individual records of all patents granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) between January 1975 and May 2009 to inventors in the San Francisco Bay Area. We define the San Francisco Bay Area as any zip code that is within 75 miles of Redwood City, CA. Our analysis only considers industrial patents and the citations among them (e.g., we exclude technology transfer from Stanford University). We exclude self-citations.",
        "This mapping exercise is a quick tour of the structure of technology flows in the San Francisco Bay Area. We find similar outcomes in unreported variants. Examples include using four zip codes to define technology sourcing zones, separating major technology groups, separating entrants from long-lived incumbents, and examining only the most recent citations. More important for the development of our theory, Figure 1b in the main text shows similar patterns using predominant commuting zones for scientists and engineers from the 2000 Census of Populations.",
        "US Census Bureau Data Our estimates of industrial agglomeration patterns are developed through confidential data housed by the US Census Bureau. The Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) provides annual observations for every private-sector establishment with payroll from 1976 onward. The Census Bureau data are an unparalleled laboratory for studying the industrial structure of US firms. Sourced from US tax records and Census Bureau surveys, the micro-records document the universe of establishments and firms rather than a stratified random sample or published aggregate tabulations. In addition, the LBD lists physical locations of establishments rather than locations of incorporation, circumventing issues related to higher legal incorporations in states like Delaware.",
        "We define industries through the three-digit level of the 1987 Standard Industrial Classification (SIC3). Industry assignment is at the establishment level for multi-unit firms. We focus on 362 SIC3 industries that are consistently measured from 1976 to 2001, after which time the transition to the NAICS industry classifications occurs. Our data contains 4.0 million establishments employing 68 million workers in 1977. In 1997, the data include 108 million workers and 5.8 million establishments. While we calculate agglomeration in all 26 years, our current discussion focuses just on 1997.",
        "Computational restrictions require that we simplify how the confidence bands are calculated. Our first simplification is that we only calculate confidence bands using data from 1977 and 1997, rather than annually as in the base index calculation above. These two years are chosen as sample end points when economic censuses are conducted using the SIC system. When calculating our agglomeration measures, we find very similar patterns across all years 1976-2001 when using either the 1977 or 1997 baselines. Our current discussion focuses just on the 1977 and 1997 cross-sections, and the confidence intervals are specific to these years.",
        "Second, we approximate the establishment count in the industry. Industries differ substantially in their establishment counts, ranging in 1997 from 18 industries having fewer than 100 establishments to 12 industries having more than 100,000. The maximum number of establishments was over 400,000 for Eating and Drinking Places (581). It is computationally prohibitive to match exactly the establishment count in all industries and years. We thus randomly draw without replacement 100,000 establishments for a hypothetical industry; this sampling is repeated 1000 times in both 1977 and 1997.",
        "5More precisely, the percentiles of unweighted establishment distances in 1997 are 1013 miles (50th), 573 (25th), 280 (10th), and 106 (3rd). The 1977 percentiles are 967, 541, 259, and 95, respectively. Employment weighted percentiles are shorter than count percentiles. 7 to be expected if agglomeration forces exist, however, as the counterfactuals are built upon all industrial establishments. The counterfactuals are not selected such that only 5% of industries will be deemed agglomerated. This result is expected if, as in our model, sites are distributed uniformly but agglomerative forces exist in nearly all industries.",
        "Moving from Panel A to Panel E, the share of industries that are localized and the values of their localization increase as the distance threshold increases. By 1000 miles, 88% of industries exhibit localization. Our combined metric (4) also increases in value four fold. This is again despite the fact that the confidence intervals are being continually widened at longer thresholds to maintain only 5% of the counterfactual series reaching them. This confirms the model's implication that an increase in the distance horizon should typically lead to increased agglomeration.",
        "Unreported analyses find that these patterns also hold within each one-digit SIC sector up to 1000 miles. It is important to note, however, that global localization can decrease across some distance ranges. For example, law offices can be concentrated at short distances within each city but also present in many cities. A short threshold captures the initial spike. As the threshold lengthens, the confidence intervals against which the densities are compared widen. This results in a weaker measured concentration and, in some case, even a determination that the industry is not globally concentrated at all.",
        "Table 1B describes the local deviations that are behind these patterns. We also graph in the main paper the fraction of industries that are localized at each distance level to 1000 miles. Localization is most powerful at short distance horizons, with substantial attenuation commencing after 125 miles or so. Whereas about 60% of industries show localization at short spatial scales, only 30% or thereabouts are localized at distances of 900-1000 miles. This pattern is predicted in our model so long as some agglomerative force exists. Manufacturing industries are more agglomerated at short spatial scales than non-manufacturing industries, a pattern that reverses at longer horizons. This is to be expected given the transportable and tradeable nature of manufactured products.",
        "Tables 2A-2D document extreme localization and dispersions values for 1997. Table 2A begins with the global metric. Some industries are extremely localized regardless of the threshold chosen. Most prominently, many of the tobacco, textiles, and apparel industries are very concentrated in the southeast of the US; moreover, these industries are very concentrated spatially at small distances within this region. Other cases are due to very concentrated natural advantages (e.g., mining industries) or idiosyncrasies in definitions (e.g., freight transport on Great Lakes).",
