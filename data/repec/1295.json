        "^White (1978), Darby (1979b), and Kotlikoff and Summers (1981) all report evidence that \"bequest assets\" dominate \"life-cycle assets\" in total U.S. wealth, and this finding supports the assumption of concern about ones children&apos;s welfare. Barro (1974, 1978), Kochin (1974), and David and Scadding (1974) all present evidence in support of the \"ultrarational\" or \"Ricardian\" view. Note that saving increases if the government finances a tax cut with increased borrowing not in anticipation of future increased taxes but in anticipation that otherwise total NNP would fall.",
        "Plosser (1982), for example, finds that asset prices are unaffected by the extent to which a given level of government expenditures is financed by borrowing instead of taxes.",

A52. 12 High ex post real interest rates experienced during 1981-1982 appear to be a result of slowing inflation (compare 1929-1933) and not a matter of a \"regime change\" to unprecedentedly high deficits."
