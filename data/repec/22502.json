Two-year and four-year college results are coded similarly. All students missing from these files are assumed to have not enrolled in any college. Sample Restrictions School Level: We employ three sample restrictions at the school level. First, we restrict our analysis to open-enrollment charter schools that target the general population of public school students.",
        "College preparatory charters are further classified as either No Excuses schools or regular college preparatory charters. Compared to regular college preparatory charters, No Excuses charters have higher behavioral expectations, stricter disciplinary codes, are more likely to have uniform requirements, and are more likely to have an extended school day and year. We classify No Excuses schools using information from school mission statements, charter applications, and public statements. We verified our No Excuses categorizations with numerous school administrators in Texas. The No Excuses classification in this paper largely follows the classification system used by Dobbie and Fryer (2013) and Angrist, Pathak, and Walters (2013), but is somewhat more strict than the classification system used by Baude et al. (2014). We use this stricter definition of No Excuses to focus on exemplar schools in the category.",
        "In practice, the parameters needed to construct the EB adjusted estimate are unknown and must be estimated. The estimated school effects \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b2\u00c3\u008c\u00e2\u0080\u009as are the unadjusted coefficient estimates from our main student-level estimating equation described in the text. The standard errors on these unadjusted coefficient estimates are an estimate of the standard deviation of the asymptotic distribution of \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b2\u00c3\u008c\u00e2\u0080\u009as. We estimate \u00c3\u008f\u00e2\u0082\u00ac2 s by squaring these standard errors. We estimate the mean of the distribution of school effects \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b2\u00c3\u008c\u00e2\u0080\u009e and the variance of the error term \u00c3\u008f\u00c6\u00922 using the method proposed by Morris (1983), which uses an iterative process to calculate the feasible best estimate of the appropriate shrinkage factor \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00bbs. This method also incorporates a degrees of freedom adjustment to account for the fact that we are estimating the mean and variance parameters. The above EB procedure yields unbiased estimates of the expected effect of attending each school in our sample for any particular outcome."
