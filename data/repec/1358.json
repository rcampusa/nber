        "The investment-real wage effects of supply shocks might be expected to dominate, suggesting a negative value for A,.. The results presented in Wilcox (1983a, 1983b) and Peek and Wilcox (1983) can be so interpreted.",
        "This has been pointed out by Levi and Makin (1978), Melvin (1982), and Peek (1982).",
        "Cargill and Meyer (1980) found significantly greater than unity estimates for the 1960s, but they disappeared when the sample period was extended into the 1970s. Wilcox (1983b) suggested a cause for this coefficient decline.",
        "These point estimates differ somewhat from Peek and Wilcox (1983) due to minor data revisions and because here the dependent variable is calculated as the bond-equivalent yield as opposed to a discount factor. The results are not sensitive to the choice of yields. When the interest rate is calculated on a discount basis, the estimated value of 6 is 1.23 (t = 2.65)."
