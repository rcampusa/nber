How High are the Giants' Shoulders: An Empirical Assessment of Knowledge Spillovers and Creative Destruction in a Model of Economic Growth. In O. Blanchard A natural and interesting extension to this study is to look at how the size of The Commons influences the survival rate of startup firms producing OSS products. However, of the firms introducing new OSS products in our sample, only one firm exited before the end of the sampling period. As a result, there is insufficient variance in our data to measure the impact of The Commons on the survival of start-up firms who produce OSS. and S.

        "that code. While such endeavor to identify patent classes across software markets has been undertaken by prior research, in particular Cockburn and MacGarvie (2006, 2011), we constructed our own classification for several reasons. First, our sample period is more recent than theirs, so the mapping between patent technologies and product markets may have changed over time. Second, Cockburn and MacGarvie (2006, 2011) examined 28 specific CorpTech product codes that have incomplete overlap with the open source product markets that we study. Finally, we took the intersection of the patent classes from the patents in The Commons with the above mapping, which lead to 34 US patent classes and their corresponding product codes."
