        "The CPS first asked these questions in 1969 but data prior to 1973 are reported in broad intervals and are thus not readily useable.",
        "The March CPS asks respondents annual earnings and weeks worked over the past calendar year; the data from 1964 to the present are available in micro files. Until 1976 the CPS did not include continuous measures of weeks or hours worked, so that estimates of hourly or weekly earnings are subject to measurement error due to the bracketing of earnings and hours before 1976. The yearly earnings data in the Annual Demographic Files tell a similar story to the one in this paper [Bound and Freeman, 1989].",
        "Because blacks have less schooling than whites, differentials based on regressions that include controls for education are invariably smaller than those without education controls. In the 1960s and 1970s the difference between the two sets of estimates fell as the black-white education gap narrowed substantially. In the 1980s, by contrast, there was a roughly constant gap between differentials with and without education controls. This is not because educational attainment narrowed less in the 1980s \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d it narrowed about as much as in the 1970s \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d but because returns to schooling rose, benefitting the more educated whites by enough to offset the effects of the reduced gap.",
        "We examined whether the difference in the 1973-1989 trend in relative earnings shown in Figure I and Figure II is due to Figure I treating hourly earnings while Figure II treats weekly earnings. Our analysis shows the contrary: that the trend in racial earnings differentials is greater in usual weekly earnings than in usual hourly earnings. We also examined whether seasonal or rotation effects on earnings created an incompatibility between the data from the May CPS and that from the Annual File by looking rotation effects on the race coefficient using the May Tapes from 1973 through 1978 and looking for calendar month effects in the Annual files. We found no such effects.",
        "This pattern is found in the raw (unstandardized) employment/population rates and in comparable published data for similar age groups [U.S. Department of Labor, 1989].",
        "Our data shows that in the mid-1970s over 40% of young black men in the midwest were employed in durable manufacturing. By 1989 this had fallen to 12% \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d a 28 point drop! By contrast, among young white men in the midwest the drop in durable manufacturing employment was just 10 percentage points. We suspect that an important part of this differential change is the closing of older plants in the central cities of the midwest.",
        "That is, we average industry coefficients from our annual 197389 regressions; form the vector product of these differentials with differences in the shares of blacks and whites in each industry; regress the resultant effect on time to obtain the trend effect of changes in industry employment on earnings differentials; and derive the effect of changes in industry pay as a residual,",
        "The percentage of young blacks in manufacturing was 33% in 1970-79 and 20% in 1988-89; the percentage of young whites in manufacturing was 28% in 1970-79 and 23% in 1988-89 The percentage of young black college graduates in education and public administration was 38% in 1970-79 and 17% in 1988-89; the percentage of young white college graduates in those sectors was 28% in 1970-79 and 14% in 1988-89.",
        "Had we used an average of a4 for the 1973-79 period we would have obtained similar results.",
        "To some, the implied elasticities may seem low, as blacks and whites with the same years of schooling should, absent unmeasured differences in school quality, be nearly perfect substitutes. We explored this issue with data from the 1970 and 1980 Censuses of Population and found support for the notion that young blacks and whites with similar years of education are imperfect substitutes. Using data on the 31 states with a high concentration of blacks, we regressed changes in black-white earnings differentials on changes in relative demand indices (defined as in equation (3)). Depending on specification the estimated coefficients on the demand indices were between .44(.29) and .50(.26) for college graduates and between .77(.38) and 1.24(.41) for high school graduates and dropouts combined. These coefficients are consistent with modest elasticities of demand, implying imperfect substitution between black and white workers",
        "He estimated racial earnings differentials for the age cohorts that had 0-9 years of experience from 1973, 1979, and 1983, and compared trends in racial earnings differentials for these cohorts over time. For instance, we compared the differentials for men with 0-9 years of experience in 1973 with figures giving the differential for men with 15-24 years of potential experience in 1988. The data showed that during the 1973-89 period of erosion in earnings the relative earnings of older cohorts of black workers fell roughly as much as did that of entering cohorts.",
        "In addition, we examined the effect of past incarceration experience on earnings of dropouts: for 1983 we have negligible statistically insignificant effects; for 1988 sizeable effects. As other data sets show little impact of incarceration on future earnings for youths from the same poverty neighborhoods [Freeman, 1991], we focus solely on the employment relation.",
        "To get the number of black men in prison in 1986 we took the number of males in state and federal prisons from the U.S. Bureau of the Census Statistical Abstract 1990 table 328 and the number in jail from table 323. We multiplied the prison figures by 0.47, the proportion of proportion of state prison inmates in table 32 3. To get the number of black men in jail we took 41% of the number of men in jail from table 323. Our estimates of the high school dropout population are based on our own calculations of the proportion of 18-29 year olds not enrolled in school and civilian noninstitutional population figures in Bureau of Labor Statistics Employment and Earnings. Jan 1987.",
        "This is a conservative figure. The black proportion of men in jail rose between 1986 and 1989 so that the black male prison population increased more rapidly. However, we lack data on the educational distribution of these prisoners. Adjusting our estimated .20 incarceration rate by the 2 0% increase in the overall prison and jail population and by the 10% drop in black dropouts yields a 1989 incarceration rate of .266, for a 1980-89 trend increase of 19.2 percentage points.",
        "The Sentencing Project [table 1, p. 8] estimates from Justice Department data that among 20-29 year old blacks, 8% were incarcerated in 1989, 12% were on probation, and 3% were on parole, implying that there were roughly 1.9 times as many persons on parole or probation as in jail or prison. This is of comparable magnitude to our estimates.",
        "Some of those who were on probation committed additional offenses and went to prison: 17% in our black dropout sample. However, others who were not on probation in 1980 were convicted of crimes and given probationary sentences in later years. Thus, our use of the 1980 ratio of persons on probation to those incarcerated is only a crude approximation.",
        "The number of employment discrimination suits in federal district courts stabilized in the 1980s at about 9,000 per year after having risen rapidly (Administrative Office of U.S. Courts); the number of class action discrimination suits fell; and most employment discrimination cases involved termination rather than hiring [Donahue and Siegelman, 1989]. From 1979 to 1985 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which monitors Title VII, reduced its staff by 20 percent while holding real expenditures virtually constant; and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance, which administers afffirmative action, reduced its employment by 10 percent and its real budget by 20 percent [Leonard, 1987],"
