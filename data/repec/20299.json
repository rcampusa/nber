        "Muralidharan, Niehaus, and Sukhtankar (2014) is an example of just such an experimental evaluation, in the context of an ambitious initiative by the Government of Andhra Pradesh (AP) to improve governance in public welfare programs through biometric payments infrastructure. Working with the government of AP, they randomize the rollout of the new payments infrastructure over a potential universe of 20 million beneficiaries, and estimate that the program reduced \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00cb\u009cleakage\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 in the rural employment guarantee scheme by an amount that was eight times the cost of the program. Interestingly, this effect is of a similar magnitude to the returns that we estimate to investing in better monitoring of teachers in this paper.",
