        "at 2815UGX = 1USD. General Fee: A fee required to attend school. Because the government discourages General Fees, most schools do not charge them, but some schools, especially in urban areas still do. Food Fees: include lunch fees and chef/grinding fees. The chef/grinding fee can either be monetary or in-kind (e.g., maize). We imputed the value of maize at 450 UGX/kg.

School Infrastructure Fees: include Development Fee and School Necessities Fee.
