        "In particular, suppose that, conditional on x the value of r is determined independently of the potential outcome y(r) = (y(0, r), y(1, r), ..., y(H \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u0086\u00e2\u0080\u0099 1, r)). In other words, if r reflects the choice of interest rates made by a policymaker, the assumption would imply that x contains all the information used by the policymaker in determining r up to random variation, and therefore the value of r conditional on x is as if it had been randomly assigned. If r were a discrete variable that took on only a small number of values, such as r \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u0086\u00cb\u0086 {\u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u0086\u00e2\u0080\u00991, 0, 1}, then we would be in the familiar territory of the policy evaluation literature (see, e.g., Angrist 1995) and the full panoply of matching estimators would be at our disposal (for examples based on inverse propensity score weighting see Angrist, Jorda\u00c3\u008c\u00e2\u0082\u00ac, and Kuersteiner (forthcoming) and Jorda\u00c3\u008c\u00e2\u0082\u00ac and Taylor (2016)). Here we assume that r takes on continuous values and therefore we seek identification through a different avenue."
