        "Starting in 2002, DES stops reporting the first graduating class for which a new HSGR 49 will apply. As a result, we collect the implementation year data from the state board of education or department of education of each state when it is unclear from the DES reports.",
        "3.0 Graduation Requirements Beginning with the Class of 2011 (Freshman Class of 20072008) 3.1 Beginning with the graduating class of 2011, a public school student shall be granted a State of Delaware Diploma when such student has successfully completed a minimum of twenty two (22) credits in order to graduate including: four (4) credits in English Language Arts, four (4) credits in Mathematics; three (3) credits in Science, three (3) credits in Social Studies, one 29 Source: http://regulations.delaware.gov/register/july2006/proposed/10%20DE%20Reg%2030%2007-0106. htm 50 (1) credit in physical education, one half (1/2) credit in health education, three (3) credits in a Career Pathway, and three and one half (3.5) credits in elective courses.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d From this state code, we can pin down the exact graduation class for which the new requirements apply. In this case, starting with the graduating class of 2011, the minimum required units in mathematics were changed from 3 to 4.",
        "For some states, students are given the option to select different types of diplomas that have different sets of requirements. For example, Indiana offers students who entered school before the fall of 2007 two types of diploma (\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093general\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d and \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093core 40\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d) with two different sets of requirements. We are unable to separate students who choose the general diploma from those who choose the \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093core 40\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d diploma in YRBS. In this case, we must use our own judgment to pick a set of requirements that is applied to all students. Our criterion is to choose the least stringent of the possible sets of requirements (since we are trying to define a minimum course requirement) unless it is clear that the non-academic requirements associated with the least stringent set are so onerous that it is unlikely to be a choice for the vast majority of students.",
        "To continue with the example from above, the Indiana General Assembly made completion of \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093core 40\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d a graduation requirement for all students beginning with those who entered high school in the fall of 2007. Therefore, for the class of 2010 and after, there is only one unique set of requirements. However, for the class of 2009 and before, there are two sets of requirements. Here we choose the requirements of the \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093general\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d diploma since this is consistent with the standard diploma requirements of other states. In addition, it is the minimum graduation requirement one could face.",
        "Another example is Texas. There are 3 different programs: \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093recommended\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d, \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093advanced\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d, 51 and \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093minimum\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d. We choose the \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093minimum\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d program requirements for the graduating class of 2007 and before as the their HSGR because it is the minimum requirement. However, for the class of 2008 and after, we choose the \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093recommended\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d program requirements because a newly implemented law made it very difficult for most students to enroll in the minimum program. The law requires parents\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 consent, age restrictions, and failing to enter grade 10 once as qualifications for a student to choose the \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093minimum\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d program. 30 In this sense, the \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093recommended\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d program appears to be the standard one, which is also consistent with the DES report.",
        "For the state of South Dakota, the DES reports from different years are inconsistent with each other, and we could not find additional information from the South Dakota Department of Education to help correct the information despite our best efforts. As a result, we have to use DES data without knowledge of the implementation year even after 2001 for South Dakota\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s HSGR.
