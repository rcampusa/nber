The average price varied regionally from a low of $73,000 in the Western Upper Midwest to a high of $168,300 in California/Nevada. The nationwide median was $107,000.",
        "Less than 10 percent of the outstanding stock of home mortgages had adjustable rates in 1986, and the refinancing incentive of a decline in interest rates is much stronger for fixed than adjustable rate loans. Thus over 95 percent of refinancings were likely fixed rate.",
        "^ The statutory FHA limits were unchanged between 1980 and 1987, although the effective limit increased moderately because some areas shifted from lower to higher regional limits (minimum of $67,500; maximum of $90,000).",
        "6 This presumes that all loans originated in a year were originated on the first day of the year. A more accurate, but also more awkward, statement would be that 250 million represents the interest saved in years after 1986, ignoring repayments, owing to the saving on loans originated in 1986.",
        "7 The $630 million is a gain from lower loan limits. The gain from a zero loan limit, or the cost to the thrifts of the agencies lowering the FRM rate by 30 basis points, is $900 million (all conforming loan volume in 1986 and 1987 times 30 basis points plus the $13*5 billion just-above the limit times 15 basis points)."
