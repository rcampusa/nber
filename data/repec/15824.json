        "By February 2009, most of the loans modified under the program had been held by failed banks, although the FDIC had begun requiring that some banks receiving bailout funds also use the program\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s procedures (Keoun, 2009).",
        "Glaeser and Gyourko (2001) argue that negative economic shocks lead to decreases in housing prices that are greater in absolute value than decreases in population. During the 1930s, nearly every geographic area experienced a negative shock between 1929 and 1933 and despite recovery in real incomes to 1929 levels by the end of the decade, the unemployment rate remained above 10 percent for the rest of the decade. The comparisons here show that a severe negative shock can have a substantial negative effect on housing values that can last for an extended period of time. The Building and Loans combined two contracts to create an amortized loan.",
        "One contract was the standard mortgage (interest only with balloon of principal) and the other was a subscription to buy shares in the Building and Loan association in installments that added up to the principal of the loan. The money for the shares went into a sinking fund for the association, and after 11 or 12 years enough had accumulated to cancel the debt on the principal. Since the borrowers were now members of the association, the sinking fund feature created problems in the 1930s when many people failed to finish paying into the fund. Those who were still paying in had to increase their share payments to get the debts of the Building and Loan cancelled. This gave many borrowers even more incentive to stop making share payments and many Building and Loans were frozen and then worked to liquidate the loans and the real estate on behalf of the members of the association. See Snowden 2009.",
        "The HOLC\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s shift to longer term amortized mortgages with lower down payments coincided with and likely contributed to a shift in the terms in the entire mortgage market. Data from Grebler, Blank, and Winnick (1956, 236) on loans for 1-to4 -family houses made by commercial banks, savings and loan associations, and life insurance companies show a 50 percent rise in the average contract length of loans and a 16 percent rise in the loan-to-value ratio between 1930-34 and 1935-1939. The average nominal interest rate also fell by 12 percent (roughly one percentage point). Cumulative earnings from interest and dividends from the HOLC\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s $224 million investments in Federal Savings and Loan Associations and state-chartered members of the Federal Home Loan Bank System or insured by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation added $44.8 million to the plus side of the HOLC balance sheet.",
        "Dividends on investments in the FSLIC added another $28 billion from inception through 1951 (Comptroller General of the United States 1949, 6; 1952, 27).",
        "For definitions of the variables, see U.S. Bureau of the Census, Housing, 1943, Volume I, Part 1, pp. 1-7 and U.S. Bureau of the Census, Families, 1933, Vol. IV, pp. 511.",
        "The 1930 census asked questions about families, while the 1940 census asked questions about dwelling units. Thus, the 1940 census contains information on vacant dwelling units that are unavailable in the 1930 census.",
        "Given the costs of moving, each homeowner\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s decision to choose to stay in his own home, purchase a new home, or move to a rental in the next year will be influenced by his current status. Owners of rental property typically find it costly and time consuming to change the property in ways that make it attractive as owned property, and vice versa. Renters have more mobility but still face some costs to switch. In the analysis data availability requires a ten-year lag. The persistence might be weaker across a ten-year period, although cross-sectional regressions show a very strong relationship between the 1940 and 1930 levels.",
        "When we use the data set we created and use our instrument strategy in a crosssectional model for 1940 with lagged housing values in 1930, we find results that are similar to those found by Courtemanche and Snowden (2009). The results are available from the authors. Although they do not focus on rental markets, they do find that the HOLC is associated with a rise in home ownership rates. Our results, in contrast, suggest that the HOLC increases the number of renters by more than the number of homeowners."
