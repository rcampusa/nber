        "(5.54) (6.74) (5.04) Notes: Table shows estimated coefficients and robust standard errors clustered at the state level in parentheses from linear probability model. Two sets of regressions are estimated: \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093no control group\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d where the sample is restricted to publicly-insured children, and \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093with control group\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d where the sample also includes privately-insured children. Table shows estimated coefficients on three variables only: fee ratio; sum of fee ratio and interaction between child has public insurance and fee ratio; interaction between child has public insurance and fee ratio. Models also include child age, female, race/ethnicity, household size, parental education, severity indicator, state fixed effects, an indicator for 2010 survey, and state-level controls. The sample size is 48,405 for all outcomes, except for those in Panel C: not getting needed routine care (40,624), specialty doctor (24,676), mental health care"
