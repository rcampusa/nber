Online Appendix Real-Time Forecast Evaluation of DSGE Models with Stochastic Volatility Francis X. Diebold, Frank Schorfheide, and Minchul Shin A Evaluation of 90% Probability Interval Forecasts We repeat the evaluation of interval forecasts presented in Section 6 for 90% probability intervals. The results are summarized in Tables A-1 and A-2. Including stochastic volatility generally improves the actual coverage rate of 90% predictive intervals. A-1",
