I have benefited from comments by 4arvin Goodfriend, Bob King, Greg 4ankiw. Allan Meltzer, Ben McCallum, and Bill Schwert. 1Since rn refers to the monetary base, the money-demandshocks could reflect shifts in reserve requirements or in other financial regulations. In this broader sense, monetary policy can alter the quantity of real money demanded at a given nominal interest rate. But these kinds of policies are not consideredhere.",
        "2Lucas (1984) views the tax rate on money as a determinant of the relative cost of cash and credit goods. Therefore, if the tax rate on final output is set optimally, it is unclear that the tax rate on money should be positive\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dthat is, that money-using goods should be taxed more heavily than credit- (or barter-) using goods. (For a similar argument, see Kimbrough, 1986.) However, a positive tax rate on money does allow the government to tax some black-market activities where final product is not taxed. Also, if the main existing taxes are on some of the factor inputs, especially labor, then it may be desirable to tax other inputs, such as monetary services.",
        "3Given that Pt is not observed at date t, it is possible that Pt should be replaced by Ep in equation (1). However, in a setting such as Barro (1976), equation (1) can arise as the aggregation over local markets, each of which observes the current local price, p(z). 41t would be possible to assume that the monetary authority knows but the private sector does not. However, in the present model, the equilibrium value for would reveal anyway. 5Because is observableat date t, the lagged price level, turns out not to enter in equation (5).",
        "6Shiller (1980, p. 130) recognizes this possibility but regards it as implausible: \"he usually think that increasing high-powered money is, if anything, a signal of higher inflation. It would seem implausible, then, that these lower interest rates are due to lower inflationary expectations. It is conceivable that exogenous increases in the money stock might be a sign of lower inflation over a certain time horizon if the parameters of our model were just right.\" In the present model the parametersturn out to \"just right\" as a consequence of the monetary authority&apos;s optimizing behavior.",
        "use McCallum&apos;s (1983, 1986) procedure for selecting the unique bubble-free solution.",
        "8The choice A3 -+ m seems also to work. However, A3 (1+) can be ruled out on grounds discussed by McCallum (1986, p. 140, n.7). In particular, if A3 (1\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00b7fl), then the realization of a shock\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dsay 17__causes an unstable dynamic response of the price level.",
        "9Results for the nominal interest rate are similar with the 3-month time loan rate used by Mankiw, Miron and Weil (1986).",
        "The nominal interest rate applies to 4- to 6-month commercial paper (6-month paper in recent years). as reported since 1890 in IJ.S. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Banking and Jionetary StaJistics; Banking and lonetary Statistics, 1941-1970: 1nnual Stalisttcal Digest. 1970-1979 and later issues; and the Federal Reserve Bulletin. Earlier data, from 4acaulay (1938. Appendix Table 10), refer to 60-90 day commercial paper.",
        "(These were adjusted upward by .014 to merge with the other series in 1890.) The monetary base since 1914 runes from the Federal Reserve sources noted above. Earlier data come from the National Bureau of Economic Research. The CPI since 1913 is from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (CPI-IJ, with the CPI less shelter used since 1970 to avoid problems with mortgage interest costs).",
        "The PPI (all commodities) since 1913 comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Data from 1890 to 1912 are from U.S. Department of Labor, 1928 (kindly provided by Jeff (iron). Data before 1890 are from &apos;warren and Pearson, 1933. Table 1.",
        "12Schwert (1987b, Table 9) shows that an ARIMA (0,1,4) process works well on seasonally adjusted monthly data for the growth rate of the monetary base, CPI inflation, and PPI inflation.",
        "&apos;3Weak evidence of seasonality in the nominal interest rate appears in some sub-samples of the post-1954 period\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dfor example, for 1954.1-1959.4 and the 1970s. However, the seasonals look very different for these two periods.",
        "The seasonal found for the 1954-1959 period seems to be consistent with the results of Diller (1969, Ch. 3).",
        "t4Schwert&apos;s (1987a, Table 3) Monte Carlo results indicate that the Dickey- Fuller test for a unit root works well if the underlying process is ARIMA (0,1,1). Therefore this test should be appropriate in the present context. 15The estimated residual standard errors for inflation and monetary growth correspond to amd e for equations (22) and (19), respectively. The corresponding standard errors for Ft and are .028 and .042, respectively."
