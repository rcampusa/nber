The upper bend point is where the marginal replacement rate in converting AIME to PIA changes from 32 percent to 15 percent. The sample includes DI beneficiaries within $1,500 of the upper bend point (see the text for other sample restrictions).

        "As in Imbens, Rubin, and Sacerdote (2001), given that DI transfer payments are constant from year to year, in the lifecycle model with no myopia, we can also derive this specification by assuming that utility is Stone-Geary. In particular, we can assume that utility is given by: Ut = 1 (1+\u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b4 )\u00c3\u008f\u00e2\u0080\u009e \u00c3\u008f\u00e2\u0080\u009e =t T",
