        "FOOTNOTES 1. Whether quits are truly exogenous to the employer is an extremely complex issue. That they are logically separate categories that can usefully be distinguished, though, is clear (McLaughlin, 1991). By using the published data we implicitly rely on each employers classification of separated workers into the two main categories, quits and layoffs."
