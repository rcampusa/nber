        "This figure plots daily buy-and-hold average returns (BHRs) for PPP-eligible small public firms versus the S&P 500 index (Panel A) and buy-and-hold average abnormal returns (BHARs) for PPP borrowers versus PPP-eligible non-borrowers (Panel B), from January to August 2020. We define the abnormal return as the stock return over the S&P 500 return. We exclude penny stocks, which we define as stocks with an average share price of less than $5 in December 2019, because of illiquidity. BHAR is set to zero for the first trading day of the year, which is January 2, 2020. Figure 3. Density of PPP loan grant announcement dates. This figure plots the density of announcement dates for PPP loan grant announcements. Figure 4. PPP loan size distribution. This figure plots the density of PPP loan size for all PPP applicants. We set PPP loan size equal to $10M for loans above $10M, for the ease of exposition.",
        "Figure 7. Cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) around PPP loan grant announcement dates. This figure plots daily CARs for PPP loan grant announcements. The abnormal return in Panel A is the stock return minus the S&P 500 return, where the abnormal return is set to zero for Day-5. The abnormal return in Panel B is calculated using the market model based on S&P 500 return, where the abnormal return is set to zero for Day-5. The dots are the daily CARs and vertical error bars are the 90% confidence intervals. We exclude penny stocks, which we define as stocks with an average share price of less than $5 in December 2019.",
