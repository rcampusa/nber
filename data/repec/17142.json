Notes on the Unobserved Effort Model A.1. Computational Strategy for Solving the Baseline Model Computing an equilibrium when the cash constraint, (4.8), is not binding (i.e.,  = 0) is straightforward. Here, we describe an algorithm for computing an equilibrium when the cash constraint is binding, so that   0 There are ten equilibrium conditions. This includes the six conditions associated with the banks, (4.21), the three conditions associated with household optimization, (4.3), (4.2) and (4.16) and the definition of  the marginal utility of second period consumption, (4.17). The ten variables to be solved for are: When   0 the  and  equilibrium conditions associated with the banks can simplified and we do so first.
