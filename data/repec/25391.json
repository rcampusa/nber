Online Appendix: Are Energy Executives Rewarded For Luck? Lucas Davis and Catherine Hausman An Illustrative Example During the last three decades one of the most influential, and highly compensated oil and gas executives in the United States was Aubrey McClendon, the cofounder of Chesapeake Energy. His professional story provides an illustrative example about what oil and gas executives do and how they add value to companies, but also about how executive compensation is set, and how conflicts of interest can easily arise with board-of-directors.",
        "A history major at Duke University, Aubrey McClendon cofounded Chesapeake Energy in 1989. The company would go public in 1993, and during the 1990s focus on land leasing and drilling for oil and gas in Oklahoma, Texas, and, less successfully, Louisiana. Chesapeake is one of about 130 publicly-traded U.S. oil and gas producers sometimes called the \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093independents.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d Whereas the \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093majors\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d (e.g. Shell, ExxonMobil, BP) are large integrated companies active along the entire petroleum supply chain (including giant offshore and international projects, operating refineries, and even retail), the independents are companies focused almost entirely on onshore domestic oil and gas production.40 Independents are less corporate, and more dynamic; the natural descendants to the entrepreneurial \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093wildcats\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d that have long operated in U.S. onshore oil and gas drilling.",
        "In what would end up being a remarkably prescient move, McClendon steered Chesapeake in the early 2000s sharply toward unconventional drilling for natural gas. McClendon didn\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2t invent hydraulic fracturing, indeed he wasn\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2t an engineer at all, but he was one of hydraulic fracturing\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s most vocal early proponents, and McClendon was uniquely skilled at convincing Wall Street to finance Chesapeake\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s aggressive push in this direction. As Russell Gold described in the Wall Street Journal, \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093He didn\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2t just see the energy boom coming. He helped create it.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d (Gold, 2016).",
        "For much of the 2000s, these investments were extremely profitable. U.S. natural gas prices were above $6 per thousand cubic feet between 2005-2008, and Chesapeake made a fortune.",
        "On nasdaq.com, 130 U.S. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093Oil & Gas Production\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d firms are listed as traded on either NASDAQ, NYSE, or AMEX. Another 17 U.S. companies are listed as \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093Integrated Oil Companies.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d A-1 In 2005, Fortune magazine named McClendon one of the best-performing U.S. executives, and Chesapeake\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s stock price surged from $2 in 2000, to above $40 in 2008.",
        "Alas, the 2008 market crash was not good for McClendon or Chesapeake. The stock price for Chesapeake crashed back to below $20, leading to margin calls that erased almost all of McClendon\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s $2 billion personal fortune. Aware of McClendon\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s great personal losses, the Board of Directors chose that moment to give McClendon a new five-year contract and a $75 million retention bonus (Gold, 2014), making McClendon in 2008 the second highest-paid U.S. executive in any industry.",
        "McClendon appears in our data receiving $112M total compensation in 2008. This is a strikingly high level of executive compensation; it is in the top 0.1 percent of all executivefirm -year observations in the broader dataset, including not only oil and gas but all industries.",
        "It is also striking because Chesapeake, while a major oil and gas producer, was not even in the top 200 most valuable companies for 2008.",
        "At Chesapeake\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s shareholder meeting in 2008 one long-time investor put it like this, \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093Your greed and your ego took over, and you bet the farm that your success would continue. So, your two billion dollar fortune was not enough; you wanted more. But this time your hand got stuck in the cookie jar, and you couldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2t let go until your own cookies were taken in the process. And after your embarrassing losses, but with a carefully picked and extremely wellcompensated board of directors, Chesapeake shareholder funds were partially used to cover your losses.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d McClendon responded directly to the investor, \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093I\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2ve worked one hundred hours a week, at least since 1989 building this company So I\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2m sorry that you find me as egocentric and greedy.",
        "But I\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2ll tell you there\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s not a harder-working guy out there who thinks every day about how to create shareholder value.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d Both quotes from Gold (2014).",
        "The fallout over the 2008 compensation package was the culmination of many years of questionable arrangements between McClendon and Chesapeake\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s Board of Directors. Several of the members of the board were longtime friends of McClendon (Shiffman et al., 2012), and board members were rewarded with large salaries, use of corporate aircraft, and other generous perks. Financial conflicts-of-interest were common. For example, back in the 1990s, several members of the board-of-directors made personal loans to McClendon, an unusual arrangement that raises clear conflict-of-interest concerns.",
        "McClendon would lead Chesapeake for another five years, but would never quite get past these concerns about the independence of the board. Finally, with mounting concerns about corporate governance, McClendon stepped down as chairman of Chesapeake in 2012, and A-2 was forced out of the company entirely in April 2013. Then in March 2016, McClendon was indicted, charged by a Federal grand jury with colluding with another company to manipulate prices for land leases. The following day McClendon died in a single-vehicle accident when the Chevrolet Tahoe he was driving ran straight into a bridge at 60 miles per hour, killing him instantly.",
