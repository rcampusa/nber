        "It is worth noting that in his 1997 book The Dilbert Future (Harper Collins, June 1, 1997, ISBN 07522 11617) Scott Adams first defined confusopoly as A group of companies with similar products, who intentionally confuse customers instead of competing on price. (p. 159).  Examples of industries in which confusopolies exist (according to Adams) include telephone service, insurance, mortgage loans, banking, financial services and retail electricity markets (but not health care or pharmaceuticals).

        "Lakdawalla and Sood (2009) point out that the presence of an insurer allows for supply prices for new drugs to be maintained at high levels exceeding marginal production cost to encourage innovation, but demand prices to be set low to encourage efficient consumption.  Social and private benefits and costs of drug insurance are also considered in Glazer, Huskamp and McGuire [2011]."
