        "One key concern with this strategy is that it would not be suitable in a world where university exits are commonplace. Say a number of universities were present in the past and closed down before WHED 2010. A region could have actually seen a fall in universities, but our method would not capture this since it includes only surviving universities. Anecdotally we know that the period since the 1960s has been one of university growth across the globe, but we investigate this issue further in order to gain more comfort on the validity of our approach. We do this by obtaining historical records of the universities and higher education institutions",
        "present in the 1960s, and assess whether significant numbers of these are missing from WHED 2010.",
        "The main exercise we carry out is to name match between 1960 yearbooks and WHED 2010.",
        "There are 2,694 institutions listed across 110 countries in the three yearbooks in 1960, this compares with 5,372 institutions (in 132 countries) which according to WHED 2010 were founded pre 1960 \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c this is higher because WHED counts universities from the date they are founded, even if they are not founded as a fully-fledged university (as discussed above). The country level correlation of the number of universities present in 1960 in the two sources is 0.95. The matching process involves a number of iterations: exact matching, \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093fuzzy\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d matching, and manual matching. The process is complex because name changes and mergers are commonplace, therefore internet searches on Wikipedia or university websites were necessary.",
        "Where an institution was found to have been merged into a university that is present in WHED 2010 we considered it a match. The results of this process are summarized in Table A10. We find that university closure is extremely rare, and we only find evidence of this in the US, where 33 small (mostly religious) colleges are present in the 1960 yearbook and were found to have closed down, mainly due to bankruptcy. 155 institutions worldwide were found to still be in existence but not be listed in WHED. This was usually because they do not meet the WHED listing criteria (a university that offers at least a four year degree or postgraduate courses).",
        "Indeed, of the 155 institutions in this category, 115 were not considered fully fledged universities in 1960, and 33 of the remaining 40 were US colleges (mostly religious). Based on these facts, we believe that it is reasonable to use the WHED founding dates as an (albeit imperfect) basis for a time series of university presence by region.",
        "A1.3 DESCRIBING UNIVERSITY GROWTH IN SELECTED COUNTRIES This section gives a historical overview of the diffusion of universities from the 1880s in four advanced economies: France, Germany, the UK and US, and two emerging economies: India and China. We compare the timing of historical university expansions to growth and industrialisation (see Figure A5 for a measure of industrialisation over time in the UK, US, France and Germany sourced from Bairoch (1982)). This analysis provides a visual \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093sensecheck \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d for the thesis developed by Mokyr (2002) that the building and dissemination of knowledge played a major role in the Industrial Revolution.",
        "In the United Kingdom, universities have been established in waves: the \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093Ancient universities\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d starting with Oxford in 1100s were the first seven universities which were founded before 1800.",
        "In France, Figure A9 shows that university density really started picking up in the 1800s with the opening of the \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093Grande \u00c3\u0083\u00e2\u0080\u00b0coles\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d which were established to support industry, commerce and science and technology in the late 19th Century. Indeed industrialization in France was more gradual, and started picking up in the late 1880s, early 1900s. The next dramatic increase in universities numbers and density occurred in the 1960s during de Gaulle\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s reforms of the French economy.",
        "Cantoni and Yuchtman (2014) discuss the opening of the first universities in Germany following the Papal schism in the late 14th Century. However, during the 1800s, Figure A10 shows that university density actually fell, as population growth outpaced the gradual increases in university numbers which can be seen in Panel B. Historically, Germany had a low share of college graduates as higher shares of the population were educated via the apprenticeship system. A deliberate push to expand university education began in the 1960s, with new public universities founded across the country (J\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a4ger, 2013). This was motivated by economic reasons; in particular the need to compete in technology and science against the backdrop of the Cold War; but also social reasons, namely the notion that education is a civil right to be extended beyond the elites, and is crucial for democracy.",
        "China and India saw much later expansions as shown in Figure A11 and Figure A12. China started opening up to Western advances in science in the 1800s, and followed Soviet influence in the 1950s with centrally planned education. We can see a sharp rise in university density",
        "from the 1900s to 1960. The spike in the 1960s is due to the Cultural Revolution, when higher education institutions were shut down for 6 years, and all research terminated. When the universities were reopened, they taught in line with Maoist thought. It was from the 1980s that institutions began to gain more autonomy and when China began its rapid growth trajectory, though so far growth in universities has not outpaced population growth. In India, expansion occurred after independence in 1947. During the colonial era, the upper classes would be sent to England for education. The British Raj oversaw the opening of universities and colleges from the late 1800s, but university density only started rising more rapidly after 1947 and recently has picked up pace again. We note that the in both countries, there are around 0.4 universities per million people, which is still a lot lower than in the UK or US.",
        "Finally, we note that in general, expansions in university numbers have been accompanied by increases in university size. As we saw in Figure A8 (using UNESCO data that are only available from 1970), university students normalized by population have been growing overall in the US and the UK since the 1970s (with a dip in the late 1990s in the US) and more recently in China and India.",
        "We investigated which countries appear to be driving this negative relationship and found, for example, that the Philippines (a country with high levels of corruption) has high university density but low approval of democracy. Column (7) clusters at the country level and significance holds. Column (8) weights by population, to account for the fact that some regions with low population may have less representative responses. Column (9) drops students and graduates and the main result gets stronger. Finally, column (10) shows that the results are robust to estimation using an ordered-probit model. 45 The average growth rate in students per university implied by the UNESCO country level enrolments data over the period since the 1970s is 2.5% per annum.",
