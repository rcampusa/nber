The on]', theoretical discuior; of this issue is in Adams (1985), who only nate that compensating differentials for unemployment could differ depending on whether- the increased like] ihood of iciss s due to greater incidence or longer duration. 2. Multiple tangencies between the wage frontier arid worker' indifference curves are possible, even if indifference curves are all identical, because the wage frontier is responsive to market demands for products requiring varying risks of wane loss.",
        "3. If the worker perceives that wages are reduced by a fraction E of the xpected loss P in order to help to finance wage replacement, and if w represents the worker's true marginal product, then the second term in (15) becomes PY[ +3 4. One would also like to test the equations using job changers, those for whom fixed effects can be removed. This would, as Duncan\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dHoimlund (1983) point out, reduce biases in the estimates of compensating differentials, though the reduction is less in our data than it would be if we used self\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dreported risks.

        "5. The data are from BLS, Occupational Injuries and Illnesses in the United States by Industry, 1980, 1981, Bulletins 2130 and 2164. 6. Clearly, since the data cover- industries and the observations are on individuals1 there is no simultaneity problem. There is, however, a potential prc'blem o-f truncation of the duration data, as only days lost during the particular year are included in the calculation of DUR for an industry. Unfortunately, without additional information it is impossible to tell whether this measurement problem produces different biases on the estimates of the separate effects of duration and incidence."
