        "The net stock issues (NSI) are the annual change in the logarithm of the number of real shares outstanding, which adjusts for distribution events such as splits and rights offerings. Following Fama and French (2008), we construct the net stock issues measure using the natural log of the ratio of the split-adjusted shares outstanding at the fiscal year end in t\u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u0086\u00e2\u0080\u00991 divided by the splitadjusted shares outstanding at the fiscal year end in t\u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u0086\u00e2\u0080\u00992. The split-adjusted shares outstanding is shares outstanding (Compustat annual item CSHO) times the adjustment factor (item ADJEX C). If the Compustat shares or adjustment factors for calculating net stock issues are missing, we set the measure to be zero. NSI calculated in this way can be positive or negative.",
