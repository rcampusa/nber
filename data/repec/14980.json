        "We use information available in the 1981-2003 STRIDE which has a total of approximately 780,000 observations for a number of different drugs and acquisition methods. The STRIDE data include the type of drug obtained (heroin, cocaine, marijuana, methamphetamines...), method of acquisition (undercover purchase or seizure), price (in the case of a purchase), city and date of acquisition, quantity, as well as the purity level of the drug.33 We have approximately 115,000 observations for heroin and 330,000 for cocaine (crack and powder). We keep the observations acquired through purchases and clean the data of missing values, observations whose weight is lower than 0.1 gram and other unreliable observations, as suggested in Arkes et al (2004). We are left with 29,181 observations for heroin, 47,743 for crack cocaine and 46,050 for powder cocaine which we use.",
