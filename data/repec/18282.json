        "Finkelstein and McGarry [2006] note that rejections could pose an issue and provide a speci\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00afcation that excludes individuals with health conditions leading to rejection (Table 4), but they do not exclude individuals over age 80 who would be rejected solely based on age. Fang et al. [2008] does not discuss the potential that rejections limits the extent of adverse selection in Medigap. Although Medigap insurers are not allowed to reject applicants during a 6-month open enrollment period at the age of 65, beyond this grace period rejections are allowed and are common industry practice in most states.",
