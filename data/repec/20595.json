Like Jacob and Lefgren, they find a relatively modest effect of funding on subsequent productivity, although this effect varies by researcher seniority.",
        "5 The three institutions dropped from our sample included two academic medical centers\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dthe University of California San Francisco and the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dwhich reported no chemistry faculty, graduate students or postdocs for much of the study period, and the Oregon Institute of Science and Technology, which disappears from the data after 2001. 6 Additional details on the construction of the dataset used in our analysis are provided in the appendix to this paper. 7 Aggregate faculty numbers were essentially constant over these 20 years. We are in the process of hand collecting data from biannual faculty directories produced by the American Chemical Society, but because individual departments are not represented in all years, the data are not yet of sufficient quality to be reported here. Nonetheless, we can rule out the possibility that there was any significant increase in aggregate faculty numbers.",
