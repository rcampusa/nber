In contrast, households that default in a strategic manner satisfy the first criterion (negative equity) but not the second criterion (they can a\u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00ac\u00e2\u0082\u00acord the mortgage payment).

        "There are some benefits, however, since the SCF includes measures of credit limits as of the survey date (see Elul et al. (2010)), and credit denial between the 2007 and 2009 survey dates. Unfortunately, in any study with prior default over the last 12 months as the dependent variable and credit utilization as the independent variable, there is severe endogeneity.",
        "There is also an interesting correlation between credit denial and default; roughly 38 percent of defaulters were denied credit between 2007 and 2009 versus 16 percent for the entire mortgagor sample. The typical story is that defaulters have low credit scores, and therefore are denied credit more often. A more interesting question is whether or not credit denial leads to default. B.1.2. SCF Results Table B.2 reports the OLS regression of the SCF default indicator on equity, unemployment, and other shocks. This table corresponds to Table 4 for the PSID. Column (4) is the most basic specification, which includes LTV and unemployment shocks, but no other controls.",
        "interact. The coe\u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00ac\u00c6\u0092cient on the interaction term shows that being unemployed roughly triples the propensity to default for any given equity shocks. In Table B.3 we include additional variables in the regression, such as a household\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s credit limit (aggregate unsecured revolving credit limits, for example credit cards) and previous loan denial status (measured as a denial of any form between 2007 and 2009), which are unobservables in the PSID. Table B.3 shows that the interaction between unemployment and equity is unchanged, with unemployment tripling the e\u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00ac\u00e2\u0082\u00acect of any given equity reduction. Overall, Tables B.2 and B.3, both based on the SCF, confirm the PSID patterns illustrated in Table 4 and mitigate concerns regarding the e\u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00ac\u00e2\u0082\u00acects of unobserved credit limits /credit denials in the PSID.",
