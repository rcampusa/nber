A Appendix A.1 Existence in the Second-Stage Game Assume the firm allocates a fixed amount Bf > 0 to R&D in a given period, so c \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u0086\u00cb\u0086 [0, Bf /M].

        "B Method of Identifying Faculty Patents We started with the names of every scientist and engineer in PhD granting departments at Cornell, Georgia Institute of Technology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Purdue, Stanford, Texas A & M, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin reported in the National Research Council\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s (1995) survey of PhD granting departments in the US. The list is for faculty in residence in 1993. The names were compared to inventor names on US patents granted between 1993 and 1999. Once names had been paired we used a multi-staged name screening process to insure that the faculty member and the inventor are the same. The first step was to check the distance between the zip code of the university and the zip code of the city of residence of the inventor. If the distance was more than 50 miles the patent was removed from the database. The average zip code distance in the final data is less than 7 miles.",
        "We then used the surname data from the 1990 Census to evaluate the incidence of each name. At this point we used various filters to eliminate common names. The filter was least dense when we had a match on first, middle and last name for the university faculty listing and the name on the patent. The filter was most dense when we could only match a last name and first initial. About 10% of the matches are eliminated because of common names.",
        "From the NRC survey we know that a faculty member is at a respective university in 1993 (the year of the survey). Our procedure for verifying institutional a\u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00ac\u00c6\u0092liation for inventors on applications filed in years other than 1993 was the following. If the assignment was to the inventor\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s 1993 university we assumed the inventor was with the university. If the assignment was not to that university, we used a combination of web searches and the faculty listing in the National Faculty Directory to verify a\u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00ac\u00c6\u0092liation. If we determined that a faculty member was on the faculty in any year after 1993 we assumed she was on the faculty in the intervening years between 1993 and the latter year. If we could not verify faculty a\u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00ac\u00c6\u0092liation for the patent application year the patent was dropped."
