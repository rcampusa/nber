        "For examples from eighteenth-century writers, see Davis (1964, v. 1: 113-4, 122, 154-5, 212, 378, 403); Labaree, Oberg, and Willcox (1959, v. 1: 144-5, 148); and Smith (1937, 22-3, 32). All that is required is that area (F + G) &gt; area (B + C). This can be met by (OCsm - \u00c3\u008f\u00cb\u0086) \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0080\u00b0\u00c2\u00a5 [(TCeb - TCsm)/2] where \u00c3\u008f\u00cb\u0086 &gt; 0 by some amount depending on the elasticity of demand.",
        "However, given that colonial tax payments were under a few percentage points of colonial income (Rabushka, 2008), this effect was small and so will be ignored. Fiscal disruptions via tax changes to accommodate paper money creation are assumed to be small enough and handled credibly enough not to alter Y.",
        "A more sophisticated version has \u00c3\u008e\u00e2\u0080\u009dMp = -\u00c3\u008e\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c3\u008f\u00e2\u0080\u00a0EB where \u00c3\u008f\u00e2\u0080\u00a0 is a continuous nonlinear function with 1 \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0080\u00b0\u00c2\u00a5 \u00c3\u008f\u00e2\u0080\u00a0 \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0080\u00b0\u00c2\u00a5 0. Most likely \u00c3\u008f\u00e2\u0080\u00a0 would start near 1 and decline toward zero as the proportion of monetized exchange neared 100%. In other words, Mp would have some excess utility value or positive transactions opportunity cost advantage as a medium of exchange over EB, an advantage that declined toward zero as \u00c3\u008f\u00e2\u0080\u00a0 declined toward zero. This idea is behind the assertion that increasing Mp could increase Y by making transacting more efficient. However, given that longrun growth in real output per year per capita was at best 0.5%, it is hard to see much room for this effect, see Grubb (2004, 351-6; 2012a). To the extent that colonial governments would not accept EB in place of either Mp or Ms for paying taxes and government fees, Mp would have some excess utility value or positive transactions opportunity cost as a media of exchange in the local economy, see footnote 12.",

        "From 1727 to 1733, the Maryland assembly debated passing its first paper money act. In 1728, London merchants dealing in Maryland tobacco wrote to Maryland colonists, published in the Maryland Gazette, 15 April 1729, encouraging them to change how trade took place within their colony (Gould, 1915, 70). They said, Indeed, we think it will be the interest of your province, that all debts be contracted in money, it is now time to leave off the old way of barter. On specie being scarce before paper bills were issued, see Brock (1975, 141-5, 165, 169, 240-1, 350-1, 361, 365, 462, 466, 468, 550); Davis (1964, v. 1: 200, 336; v. 2: 69, 170, 174-6, 237, 307, 396; v. 3: 94, 198-200, 456); Nettels (1934, 8, 13, 20, 59, 126, 144, 160, 162-78, 202-8, 231-49, 253-5, 280-3); Newell (1998, 120).",
        "For example, Hume called bills a commodity, i.e. a barter good, and called specie money (Rotwein, 1970, 69). See also Baxter (1965, 14); Brock (1975, 107, 113-4, 120); Davis (1964, v. 1: 163, 245, 259, 310, 376, 380, 382; v. 2: 101, 178-9, 193-4, 396, 429; v. 3: 369-74, 384, 398-9; v. 4: 100); Labaree, Oberg, and Willcox, (1970, v. 14: 34).

This money-versus-barter language is somewhat arbitrary. All that is needed is terminology that expresses a hierarchy or degree of money-ness. See footnote 2.",
        "The maximum amount of bills per white capita in these initial emissions for Pennsylvania was 1.2 Pennsylvania pounds in 1724 and 2.3 in 1731. For Virginia this number was 2.0 Virginia pounds for 1760. These amounts represent only 4 to 7.5 percent of the yearly income of laborers in Philadelphia (Carter, 2006, v. 5: 652; Grubb, 2011, 260-1; 2008; 2012a). As such, they were insufficient to transact all the internal trade within these colonies. Many domestic transactions had to be executed using other means.",
        "This model simply assumes money (M), i.e. assumes that the transaction opportunity cost of M is infinite. No alternatives to M for executing exchanges of Y exist. The non-applicability of this assumption, however, is at the heart of comprehending initial money creation in colonial America. For applications of the quantity theory of money to colonial America, see Grubb (2004); McCallum (1992); Smith (1985a, 1985b, 1988); West (1978); and Wicker (1985).",

        "See Redish (1984); Redish and Weber (2008); Wallace and Zhou (1997). These studies explain specie scarcity by the low quality and indivisibility of the coins in use. By contrast, the model here assumes that people are smart enough to figure out how to create change and evaluate coins (as embedded in the model&apos;s specie transactions cost function).
