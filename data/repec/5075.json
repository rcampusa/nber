        "Persson and Tabellini (1994), the CB needs to violate the problems incentive constraints. It can do so because these are not actually constraints placed on the CB from outside, but reflections of its own misplaced ambition to move the economy from a second best towards the first best. Is the equilibrium without incentive constraints implementable? My presumption is that if the CB consistantly behaves in any fashion, then private agents will come to expect it to do so--i.e., that expectations are rational.",

        "Bennett McCallum (1993). There it is argued that the distinction between the two types of policymaking behavior is not well conveyed by the rules vs. discretion terminology. The distinction is, 11 instead, between rules that do and do not accurately take account of private sector expectational behavior in their design.",
