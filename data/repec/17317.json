        "A Tax data In this appendix, we describe how we build our sample of tax data. In particular, we follow (most of the) methodology of Leeper et al. (2010), who construct aggregate e\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00afective tax rates using readily available national account information. Their work in turn is based on earlier contributions by Mendoza et al. (1994) and Jones (2002). We aggregate all levels of the government (state, local, and federal) into one general government sector. While state, local and federal governments are legally di\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00aferent entities that could merit a separate treatment, in practice, the di\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00aferent levels of government are closely interconnected.",
        "For instance, there are joint programs such as Medicaid or federal matching funds for UI and education, and, as we have seen in the last several years, changes in federal policy such as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 have a direct impact on the \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00afscal situation of state and local governments."
