        "Data Appendix A. Cross-country comparable unemployment rates from the IADB The unemployment data from the Interamerican Development Bank are based on household surveys in each country in its sample. The IADB seeks to produce harmonized statistics that are as comparable as possible across countries and over time. The data are described in IADB (2004). Unemployment Definition: The IADB measures unemployment as the number of unemployed divided by the labor force (employed plus unemployed). For most countries, an individual's status is determined by his situation during a reference week. He is counted as unemployed if he was not employed and did not search actively for work during the reference week. Active search includes activities such as contacting potential employers or employment agencies, interviewing for jobs, or filling out applications. The labor force is restricted to ages 15 through 64.",
        "In Colombia and Mexico, the reference period is one month rather than one week; in Chile, it is two months. A longer reference period increases the unemployment rate. Brazil's monthly employment survey reports unemployment rates based on one-week and one-month reference periods in June and July, 2002; the unemployment rate based on one week is 0.92 times the rate based on one month. Based on this example, we multiply all unemployment rates in Colombia, Mexico, and Chile by 0.92 to make them comparable with other countries. IADB staff have told us that this adjustment is reasonable. Our adjusted version of the IADB data are presented in Table A1."
