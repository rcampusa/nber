        "In related work, Heckman, Pinto, Shaikh, and Yavitz (2009) take a more conservative approach to the problem of compromised randomization using weaker assumptions. Their inference is based on a partially identified model in which the distribution of D conditional on X is not fully known because the rules assigning persons to treatment are not fully determined. Unmeasured variables that determine assignment are also assumed to affect outcomes. They estimate conservative bounds for inference on treatment effects that are consistent with the verbal descriptions of the criteria used for reassignment. This paper is less conservative than theirs because it adopts stronger assumptions: conditional exchangeability of treatment assignments within coarse strata of pre-program observables. As expected, this less conservative approach produces sharper inferences, although the inferences from the two approaches are in surprisingly broad agreement.",
