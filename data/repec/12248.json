A Proof of Propositions A.1 Proof of Proposition 1 The well known recursive pricing relationship governing the term structure of these bond prices is Prz n,t = Et Mt+1Prz n-1,t+1 (35) where Prz n,t is the price of a real zero coupon bond at time t with maturity at time (t + n). The following proposition summarizes the solution for these bond prices. We solve the model for a slightly generalized (but notation saving) case where the qt = \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b5q +qqqt-1+"
