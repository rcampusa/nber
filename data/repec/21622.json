        "A Data Appendix The migration data used in this paper are taken from Ozden et al. (2011) and include matrices of bilateral migrant stocks in five available census years spanning 1960\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d2000, for 226 countries of origin and 226 countries of destination. To compute the emigration rates used in the estimations, first we compute bilateral emigration net flows as di\u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00ac\u00e2\u0082\u00acerences between bilateral stocks in two consecutive censuses. Then we sum all bilateral flows for the same countries of origin j, setting negative values to 0, as they are likely be due to mortality of the stock of emigrants abroad. The emigration rate from country of origin \u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u0081\u00c2\u00aa is the ratio between the aggregated net flows from origin country \u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u0081\u00c2\u00aa and the origin country population at the beginning of the decade. The computed emigration rates span the period from 1970 to 2000.",
        "The temperature and precipitation data are taken from Dell et al. (2012). The (terrestrial) monthly mean temperature and precipitation data at 0.5X0.5 degree resolution obtained from weather stations (Matsuura and Willmott, 2007) are aggregated into countryyear averages using the population in 1990 at 30 arc second resolution as weights or alternatively using area weights. By merging the two datasets and considering only Poor and Middle-income countries, we were able to compile final datasets with 114, 115 and 116 countries. The exact number depends on the weights used to aggregate the weather station data (population or area), and on the way we defined \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093Poor or Middle-income countries, whether by excluding OECD countries, or by considering the country GDP per capita."
