        "Boudoukh et al. do hint at this by looking at the prepayment of the different coupons. They find that for lower coupons, which have a lot of relocation-based prepayment, prepayment variables explain a significant fraction of the pricing errors. 4 Berndt, Douglas, Duffie, Ferguson, and Schranz (2004) present similar evidence based on data from credit default swaps. They find large swings in the risk-premia incorporated in default swaps."
