        "Online Appendix 2: Sample Development Figure A1 provides a description of our overall sample and the analysis sample. CHECC enrolled 2,185 children ages 3-5 in four cohorts (2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013). Since the experiments were voluntary, only 854 of the children have experimental data. These children are used in our factor analysis. Five hundred and one children have disciplinary data because they are part of the school district (Chicago Heights) that agreed to share data with us. These are the children in the analysis capturing the association between early life skills and discipline. Since the experiments were conducted at various points in time of the intervention, separating our data into baseline and endline time preferences (as is done in the far right panel of Figure A1) shows that we have generally small numbers of children for whom we can evaluate the impact of the programs on time preferences."
