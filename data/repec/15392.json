The sample was obtained using an internet panel of individuals maintained by Knowledge Networks (KN), a commercial survey firm. The members of the KN Panel are recruited froman initial sample obtained by random-digit-dialing sampling that is representative of the U.S. noninstitutionalized population in terms of demographics and socioeconomic status. Participants are provided with web TV hardware to respond to periodic internet surveys with content from both commercial and academic clients. KN Panel members are compensated for participation. For a detailed discussion of representativeness of the RPS sample and of the weighting procedures employed, see Heiss, McFadden, and Winter (2007, 2009).",
