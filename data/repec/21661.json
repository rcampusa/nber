Our sample starts with potential country pairs of MSCI Emerging Markets source countries to MSCI destination countries, which could be emerging markets or developed markets (refer to Appendix A for a full listing of countries and their classification into EMs and DMs). We excluded source countries for which there does not exist any investment data for the years 2001-2011. In addition, we excluded potential country-pair observations for which there did not exist investment data in some years. We further excluded missing benchmarks (Vietnam in 2001 and 2002).",
