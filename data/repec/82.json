        "Various schemes to insure convergence have been found to help: these are all based on the principle that the objective function fTV_lf should not be allowed to increase from one iteration to the next. If the step based on Newton's method would cause an increase, it is not taken, but a step based on some sort of gradient meti-od is taken instead. The specific algorithm that was found to be most effective is a derivative based modification of Powell's (1970) dog-leg, which was suggested by John Dennis. Even with this method, Iwever, we have encountered models where G was not zero, yet H1@ was. This means the algorithm got stuck in a valley or rut, even though a minimum had not been found. The only way out would be to start again with a different initial guess.",
        "A further problem for which we have no solution is that not all values of U are allowable. The admissibility condition given by Box and Jenkins (1970, pp. 5+ and 67) is rather messy to compute, so we do not attempt to verify athiissibility of the estimated U. As a consequence we may occasionally return ridiculous estimates. In general, as pointed out by Box and Jenkins, great care should be exercised when fitting this sort of model. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d 32 \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d Finally a few words on initial guesses. The following seemed to work reasonably well. 1) Fit f( ) by ordinary nonlinear least squares. Let r f( ). 2) Fit the Box-Jenkins model for P(p) only to r. Let these new residuals be r2. 3) Fit the Box-Jenkins model for T() only to r2. 14) Use the estimated , p, as initial values for the full model.",
