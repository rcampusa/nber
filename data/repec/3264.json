They are available for the full sample of 19 countries examined in this paper. The values used are: USA 1.00; JAP 258.51; CAN 1.149; FRA 5.941; GER 2.702; ITA 866.974; UKM 0.517; ASL 1.042; OST 16.626; BEL 42.918; DEN 8.517; FIN 5.022; IRE 0.543; NET 2.734; NZL 1.004; NOR 7.334; SPA 70.554; SWE 6.888; SWI 2.449.",
        "In the constant growth model, the technical progress index is modelled to grow at a constant rate. The model is estimated by ordinary least squares by regressing the logarithm of the measured efficiency level which is the logarithm of the value provided by (5), referred to as In jt^, for country &apos;i\\ on an annual time index. Given the final value of r, the fitted values In 7r, can be estimated for each year. Using the latter, the value of u is calculated by setting 1^=1.0 in 1980. Given that the value of u is constant throughout the sample period, the labour efficiency index IIj is defined simply as the exponent of In jtj minus 1980 In jTj, which ensures it has a value of 1 in 1980.",
        "A-ll Table A.3 Non-Nested Tests of US Output Equations The following models of labour productivity were estimated and tested using non-nested tests of the US output equations. HO denotes the maintained hypothesis, which is tested against the competing models. The output equations were estimated by two stage least squares over the sample 1963-1985 for all models. See Appendix for variable definitions.",
        "(3) GODFREY TEST: The statistics are derived using Godfrey&apos;s (1983) test of competing non-nested models estimated by an instrumental (IV) estimator (e.g., two stage least squares). Let the two models be: HO: Yt\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dft(xt. Beta)+e0t HI: Yt=gt(Zt, Gamma)+elt Let w be the set of exogenous variables included in the 2SLS estimation. He first estimate HO and HI by 2SLS and obtain the sample values of b and c (the 2SLS estimates of Beta and Gamma given W). We calculate the OLS predicted values Xht and Zht from the regression of X and z on W. We then obtain the residual vector from the OLS regression of Xht*b on Zht and add it as an independent variable in the regression of the maintained hypothesis. The table reports the t-statistic for the variable. If it is significant it indicates that HI adds significant explanatory power to HO and it implies the rejection of the null hypothesis against HI.",
        "A-13 Table A.3.3 Non-Nested Tests of Output Equations for the Industrial Countries The following models of labour productivity were estimated and tested using non-nested tests of the output equations for the 19 industrial countries. For all non-break models, the constant case is used for the US. In the break case, the break model is used for US and non-US models, consistent with the hypothesis that the productivity slowdown was a feature of all the industrial countries. In the tests below, HO denotes the maintained hypothesis, which is tested against the competing models. The output equations were estimated by Zellner seemingly unrelated regression technique with instrumental variables, using the sample period 1963-1985 for all models."
