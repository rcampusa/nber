        "Studies documenting changes in the U.S. wage structure during the 1980s include Blackburn, Bloom, and Freeman (1990), Bound and Johnson (1989), Juhn, Murphy and Pierce (1991), Katz and Revenga (1989), Katz and Murphy (1990), and Murphy and Welch (1988).",
        "The net labor supply contained in imports for skill group j in year t using the production worker only allocation scheme is given by: LPjt = z, Py Lj, aycy. where p^ is the average proportion of production workers in industry i from the jth skill group for the 1967-85 period. We classify as production workers those workers in the manufacturing sector in the following broad occupational categories: craft workers, handlers and laborers, operatives, transport operatives, and service workers.",
        "The CPS data set utilized is described in detail in Juhn, Murphy, and Pierce (1991) and Katz and Murphy (1990).",
        "Abowd (1991) provides detailed discussions of this data set and the construction of trade data on a four-digit SIC industry basis. The data on output and employment in each industry given by the NBER data set are from the Annual Survey of Manufactures.",
        "The figures for 1984 and 1985 are likely to be fairly representative of the rest of the decade, as the trade deficit was at comparable levels on average in the 1986-89 and 1984-85 periods.",
        "Woodrow, Passel and Warren (1987) provide a detailed discussion of the quality of the immigration data from the June 1986 CPS, and Woodrow and Passel (1990) provide an analysis of the immigration data from the June 1988 CPS.",
        "We also made estimates assuming that SO percent of the uncounted illegal workers were Mexican, on the basis of the Warren and Passel estimate that approximately SO percent of the counted illegals in the 1980 Census are of Mexican origin. The results differed only modestly from those reported here.",
        "As Bhagwati (1991) has pointed out, the changes in relative wages implied by this procedure have implications for import and export prices (lower wages for the less skilled should reduce the price of import-substitutes and of low-skill service sector activities) and thus for the sectoral composition of output.",
        "The fixed-weights used for computing the average wage for each education group were the average share of the gender-education-experience cell in employment for the education group over the entire 1963-87 period.",
        "The relative earnings measure is a fixed-weighted average of the In college/high school weekly wage differential for full-time workers in 16 sex-experience groups (both sexes by 8 five-year potential experience brackets). The fixed-weights are the average shares of each of the 16 sex-experience groups in total employment for the entire 1963-1987 period. These estimates are based on all full-time workers with 1 to 40 years of potential experience who participated in the labor force for at least 39 weeks in the calendar year prior to each March CPS survey, including immigrants. While we would have preferred to record earnings differentials for native workers only, to get a better fix on the effect of trade and immigration on the labor market for natives, the March CPSs do not provide information that allows us to distinguish between native and foreign-born workers.",
        "More precisely, the regression of In relative earnings (RE) on In relative supplies (RSUP) and a time trend for the 25 year period, 1963-1987 yielded the following: RE = constant - 0.709 RSUP + 0.033 Time (0.150) (0.007) where standard errors are in parenthesis. The R2 in this equation is 0.52. The relative earnings measure is the In college/high school weekly wage differential described in footnote 15, and the relative supply measure is the In ratio of college to high school equivalents for workers counted in the March CPSs (native workers and counted immigrants).",
        "More precisely, the regression of In relative earnings (RE) on In relative supplies (RSUP) and a time trend for the 25 year period, 1963-1987 yielded the following: RE = constant - 0.322 RSUP + 0.023 Time (0.138) (0.010) where standard errors are in parenthesis. The R2 in this equation is 0.48."
