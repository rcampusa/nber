Health care, much of which is paid by employers and not in the household\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s budget constraint, was $2.5 trillion.",
        "23The JCT\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s 26 March 2020 publication JCX-11-20 predicts disbursements of $267 billion in 2020, followed by $24 billion in 2021. 24While $260 billion was widely reported in the press, back-of-the-envelope calculations show this to be an extreme number. Furthermore, the origin of this reported number is unclear. 25This is the case even during the pandemic and lockdown, so the death and replacement of simulated agents is a second order contribution to the profile of the unemployment rate."
