        "Our methodology for measuring overconfidence on surveys uses three innovations. The first two are due to Ansolabehere et al. (2011). First, the questions we use are about either quantities that everyone knows the scale of, such as dates, or the scale is provided, as in the case of unemployment or inflation. That is, when asking about unemployment rates, the question gives respondents the historical minimum, maximum, and median of that rate.",
        "This has been shown to reduce the number of incorrect answers simply due to a respondent not knowing the appropriate scale (Ansolabehere et al., 2013). Second, confidence is elicited on a qualitative scale, which is easily understandably by survey respondents and allows for more conservative controls for actual knowledge.",

        "Barber and Odean (2001) use male as an instrument for overconfidence in a study of financial risk taking. We have not adopted this strategy as being male is likely correlated with numerous other factors which may also affect the dependent variables we are interested in (Grinblatt and Keloharju, 2009). The curious reader may be interested to know that doing so approximately triples the effect size of overconfidence in the regressions presented in the main text.",

For self-reported ideology, there is no statistical difference in average ideology between men and women before 1982, and, consistent with Proposition C.1, men are equally more ideologically extreme, regardless of their ideological direction. After 1982, men are significantly further to the right then women on average, and, consistent with Proposition 3, being male exhibits greater correlation with ideological extremeness for those to the right of the population median than for those to the left of the median.2 For the thermometer scores, the difference in correlation between right and left expands as the ideological difference between men and women increases.",
        "While any political economy model where turnout is exogenous implicitly uses an expressive voting model (and others use it more explicitly, see Knight, 2013), there are a number of other approaches in the political economy literature. As each approach has its partisans, we thought it worthwhile to discuss those models, and show, where possible, how our model relates to them.",
        "Before discussing alternative models, we should note that we focused on the expressive approach because we believe it is correct, and because it is compatible (as shown below) with a promising approach in the literature, that voters are choice- or regret-avoidant (Matsusaka, 1995; Degan and Merlo, 2011).",
        "In addition, this modeling approach allows for both non-trivial turnout and strong partisan identification even if the policies proposed by political parties are similar to each other, as seems to be the case in reality (Snowberg et al., 2007a,b). This is generally not possible in more traditional models. To make this specific, suppose that both parties propose very similar platforms, and consider a citizen who is very confident that the best policy for her is proposed by party R. According to our model, this citizen would strongly identify with, and turn out to vote, for party R. However, if these behaviors were rooted in expected utility, and the parties espoused similar platforms, this would not hold. For any reasonably smooth Appendix\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c25 utility function there is a small difference in utility between the two parties\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dand hence no reason to strongly identify with one party or the other, or turnout.",
        "Regret Avoidance: Matsusaka (1995) argues that voter turnout is driven in part by whether citizens anticipate they will regret their vote. We view this theory as descriptively accurate: indeed, we ran a survey on a convenience sample using Mechanical Turk, and found that over 60% of respondents reported that they took into account whether they might regret their vote when deciding whether or not to vote. Almost 40% could name someone they regretted voting for.1 1",
        "Sugden (1993), applied to politics. 2 We emphasize that, although we pick a particular formalization, (expected) regret can be seen as either a reduction in the benefit of voting, or an increase in the cost of voting."
