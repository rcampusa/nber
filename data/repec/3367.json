        "In the main example of Kydland and Prescott (1977), time inconsistency arises in an environment in which tax policy affects the incentives for capital accumulation.",
        "SThe idea that reputation may support optimal policy has been studied in a different context by Barro and Gordon (1983).",
        "6Strictly speaking, the government need only define a gold coin in terms of the unit of account. Private mints could then supply the demand for coin. Indeed, this was the case shortly after the California gold discoveries. [Bancroft 1890, p. 165], In most countries, however, the mint was under government authority.",
        "8Goodfriend (1989) describes how the evolution of contractual arrangements In the financial system In eighteenth and nineteenth century England had to overcome the problem of fraud. Private markets developed an elaborate system of monitoring financial arrangements, but ultimately convertibility into gold lay behind them.",
        "An additional source of discretion was government policies to regulate gold production, such as taxation, the enforcement and relaxation of environmental regulations, and subsidies to encourage gold production In periods of depression. For examples of the use of such policies, see Rockoff (1984, pp. 632-639).",
        "l\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0McKlnnon (1989, Chapter 3), however, views the Bretton Woods system as a dollar standard which Incorporated many of the features of the classical gold standard.",
        "UEven under the pre-1914 gold standard, however, weight mattered for sovereigns. Bankers had tiny scales for weighing sovereigns, which might be credited at less than twenty shillings. Loss on light gold was clearly a consideration for George Rae, himself a leading banker at the time, In The Country Banker, 1885, Letter XIX. (Our thanks to Leslie Presnell for bringing this to our attention). l2By contrast to England, In medieval France and Burgundy, monetary authorities often would change arbitrarily the face value of sliver coins to raise revenue \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d a discretionary breach of the rule \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d a policy which would succeed until the public caught on, raising prices In proportion to the change in unit of account.",
        "l30ne Interpretation of England's early abandonment of bimetallism is continuous difficulties encountered In providing a fractional sliver coinage. [Redish, 1990]. Alternatively, Lord Liverpool's decision to adopt gold may have been strongly Influenced by Rlcardo's (1819) belief that technical change In silver mining would lead to a massive Increase in Its supply. See Friedman (1990).",
        "14Though the Bank of England was a private institution until 1946, we treat its policies as not Independent of the wishes of the government. The government had two powerful checks over the Bank: periodic renewal of its charter, and its role as the government's banker. For a contrary view, see Gallarotti (1989).",
        "1SIn interpreting this exchange rate, adjustments have to be made to allow for the Hamburg currency being on silver and sterling effectively on gold, as well as the Interest charge implicit In the prices of bills of exchange used to derive the series. As Rlcardo pointed out, when account Is taken of these factors, the Hamburg exchange rate understated the depreciation of the Bank of England note In terms of gold (Fetter, 1965, p. 28).",
        "19According to Neal (1989), the Bank was opposed to resumption after hostilities ceased because it feared the loss of its gold reserves as capital was repatriated to the continent.",
        "20Initially, resumption would be at \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a34, 15s, Od on gold bars. The price would then be reduced in stages and the terms extended finally to include coin at mint par of \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a33. 17s, lO^d. (Clapham, 1944, p. 71).",
        "24See Pollard (1970) editor's introduction and especially the articles by Brown (1929), Sayers (1960) and Hume (1963).",
        "2SSmith and Smith (1988) view resumption in 1925 as an example of a stochastic-process switch. Their numerical estimates suggest that, contrary to some contemporary views, the appreciation of sterling prior to April 1925 appears to have been due to fundamentals, such as restrictive monetary policy, rather than to the expectation of a change in regime.",
        "26According to Calomiris (1988), following Mitchell (1903) and Roll (1972), the pace and timing of resumption depended solely on fiscal news \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d legislation and policy announcements affecting the government's budget. Rolnick and Wallace (1984) also view interpretation of this episode as dependent only on overall government fiscal expectations.",
        "^Garber and Grilli (1986) present estimates of silver risk in the yields of dollar-denominated assets in this period. Also see Garber (1986) for estimates of the value of the silver option on bimetallic bonds.",
        "28The U.S., unlike the British example comparing World War I to the French Wars, financed a smaller fraction of its expenditures in World War I by debt and fiat money issue than in the Civil War. The fractions are: A. Civil War 1861-1865 B. World War I 1917-1918 % Fraction of wartime expenditure financed by: . ; ' (1) Taxes 21 43 (2) Bonds 61 51 (3) Hlgh-Powered Money 18 4 Sources: 1861-1865 Friedman (1952) 1917-1918 Walton and Rockoff (1989), p. 443 29Accordlng to Pope (1989), private bankers In Australia strictly enforced the gold standard rule In the absence of a central bank. For Canada's similar experience, see Rich (1989).",
        "^See Eichengreen (1985, p. 5) for a chronology of countries adopting gold.",
        "33According to Eichengreen (1989b) the Bank of England's ability to ensure convertibility was aided by cooperation with other central banks. In addition, as mentioned above, belief based on past performance that England attached highest priority to convertibility encouraged stabilizing private capital movements in times of threat to convertibility such as in 1890 and 1907.",
        "3*According to Glovannlnl's (1988) regressions, the French and German central banks adapted their domestic policies to external conditions whereas the British did not. This can be interpreted as evidence for British management.",
        "3SSee Eichengreen (1989b, p. 17) and Fishlow (1987, 1989).",
        "37According to North and Weingast (1989) this process was complete by the Glorious Revolution of 1688. After that date capital markets developed in an environment free of the risk of sovereign appropriation of capital.",
        "38An alternative and complementary explanation to that offered in this paper relates to political economy considerations and the distribution of income. The configuration of political interest groups in the nineteenth century was favorable to the hard-money pro gold standard rule position. This may have been related to the more limited development of democracy and less than universal suffrage. Thus a comparison of the debates over resumption in England 1797-1821 and the U.S. 1865-1878 suggests that the more limited suffrage in England in the early period served as a brake on the soft-money forces favoring permanent depreciation. In the U.S. case, the soft-money forces favoring redistribution of income to debtors and other groups (e.g., Midwestern manufacturers) almost carried the day."
