For example, our M1 model is structurally analogous to the model that Katz, Gelman and King (2004) apply to specific years,11 and our M2 model is similar to the model that Silver (2016) used to predict the distribution of potential outcomes prior to the 2016 Presidential election. Some papers in this election-specific literature consider counterfactual policies, as in our Figure 3, but without a probabilistic approach. Cervas and Grofman (2019), for example, apply a set of counterfactuals to determine whether they would have yielded an inversion in several actual historical inversions, assuming that vote totals were the same as what historically occurred.",

Partisan bias is indeed important to quantify, but is distinct from the probability of an inversion: for example, a two-tiered system that added high-variance, mean-zero noise to election outcomes would generate zero ex ante partisan bias, but would yield a high probability of inversion.",
