A Online Appendix: A.1 Plan Heterogeneity and the Extensive Margin Our model addresses selection at the extensive margin and abstracts from selection amongst differentiated plans: the intensive margin. Our modeling decision follows naturally from the policy intervention, the individual mandate, which a\u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00ac\u00e2\u0082\u00acects the demand for health insurance in general. While our framework may not be accurate in other contexts, we think that the modeling assumptions are sensible in this application for the following two reasons."
