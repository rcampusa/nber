        "Online Appendix B: Matching Algorithm We follow the matching algorithm developed in Chetty et al. (2011) to link the school district data to tax records. The algorithm was designed to match as many records as possible using variables that are not contingent on ex post outcomes. Date of birth, gender, and last name in the tax data are populated by the Social Security Administration using information that is not contingent on ex post outcomes. First name and ZIP code in tax data are contingent on observing some ex post outcome. First name data derive from information returns, which are typically generated after an adult outcome like employment (W-2 forms), college attendance (1098T forms), or mortgage interest payment (1098 forms). The ZIP code on the claiming parent\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 s 1040 return is typically from 1996 and is thus contingent on the ex post outcome of the student not having moved far from her elementary school for most students in our analysis sample.",
        "Step 5 [Rule In on First Name]: After exhausting other available information, we return to the \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6rst name. In step 2 we retained potential matches that either matched on \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6rst name or for which there was no \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6rst name available. In this step, we retain only potential matches that match on \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6rst name, if such a potential match exists for a given student. We also use information on \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6rst name present on 1040 forms \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6led by potential matches as adults to identify matches at this stage. We then isolate students for whom only one potential match remains in the tax records. We declare such cases a match and remove them from the match pool. We classify the match quality of matches identi\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6ed at this stage as MQ = 4."
