        "Among these are items by Blinder ( 1981)(1984) , Bryant ( 1980 (1983), B.M. Friedman (1982)(1984), Gordon (1983), Hester (1981), Kaldor (1982), Morris (1982), and Tobin ( 1983).",
        "In this category some leading items are Brunner and Meltzer (1983), M. Friedman (1982)(1983 )(1984 ), Hetzel (1984b), and Poole (1982). Most of the writings by members of the Board of Governors staff fall cleanly into neither category, as they usually support the notion of monetary targeting in principle but argue against tight short-run adherence to targets. However viewed, some significant items from the Board staff include Axilrod (1981)(1983) and Lindsey ( 1983 )(1984). In addition, papers by Board members Wallich (1984) and Volcker (1983) are of considerable interest.",
        "A convenient and useful account of some of the complexities involving reserve requirements appears in Tinsley et al (1982).",
        "For most of the uses to which the model will be put, the assumption that the disturbances are serially uncorrelated is not crucial. On this point, see McCallum and Hoehn (1983, p. 100).",
        "This well-known type of analysis originated with Bailey (1961) and Poole (1970), and was first applied to a money-market model by Pierce and Thomson (1972). An extension to a dynamic setting with rational expectations is provided by McCallum and Hoehn (1983). Also see Hoehn (1984).",
        "See, for example, charts in Bryant (1983, pp. 96-97), Hoehn (1983, pp. 2-3), and Lindsey (1984, pp. 15-17).",
        "The estimates (standard errors) are 0.0138 (0.0038) for October 1976-September 1979 and 0.0709 (0.0180) for October 1979-September 1982.",
        "Some readers have pointed out that this argument is not convincing; it is possible that the Fed was letting interest rates adjust more promptly to all sorts of influences without any special commitment to monetary targets. In that case Hoehn's regression would have many omitted variables and the coefficient * on mt\"mt would accordingly be unreliable. It is therefore fortunate that the conclusions that I draw in this section do not rely upon the validity of my working hypothes is that the Fed was in fact more strongly committed than usual to monetary targets during 1979-82.",
        "It is of course conceivable that the high interest rates and the recession were not attributable to monetary policy at all, but I am not inclined to make that argument. I am, however, inclined to emphasize that the period was one of monetary stringency only in relation to the path that would have resulted from an extrapolation of trends of the period prior to October 1979. By absolute standards--e.g., the growth rate of the monetary base--the period does not appear to be one of monetary stringency.",
        "During the period studied, October 1979-October 1980, NR was the operating instrument so the base was not set in advance.",
        "See Tins ley et al (1981, pp. 36-42) (1982, pp. 840-842).",
        "Indeed, Goodfriend et al (1984) have argued that the Fed's actual procedure led borrowings\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dand thus the funds rate and the money stock\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dto evolve in a fashion analogous to a random walk! The point is that BRt, borrowed reserves in week t, would be planned so that the expected value of BRt would be BRfc Thus if the stochastic discrepancy between actual and planned BRfc values were white noise, the BRt process would be a random walk. This tendency is also mentioned by Pierce (1984, p. 396).",
        "In the words of Tinsley et al (1981, p. 53): \"The 'annual' money stock volatility performance ... is measured by the standard deviation of the gap in the tenth month of the policy horizon between the annual money stock path ... and the simulated outcome in the tenth month.\"",
        "This one specific conclusion should not be interpreted as constituting a general disagreement with the reservations expressed by Anderson and Rasche (1982), in the final section of their useful paper, concerning the unreliability for some purposes of existing money market models.",
        "The example is reminiscent of the well-known Goldfeld specification of the money demand function. Goodfriend (1985) has argued \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d persuasively, \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2in m \\7 n n i n i nn- - t-iia f f- K o cnrf -P t-n r-x f- -P 1 -ir-x incfmAnf ^ J.*.\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00bb I ikj W J.*.* w t i. \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00bb- n&lt;\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d uvt >. &lt;J ay JUD LU1C W O U O UllG U QIC relevant for money demand cannot plausibly explain the lags that are typically found in the money demand literature.

Goodfriend's analysis is, in any event, supportive of my main thesis.",
        "An argument that is essentially the same as mine, but worked out more thoroughly and in a more complete model, has recently been developed by Lane (1984).",
        "That can be determined by inspection\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009das m and are the only relevant state variables in the system\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dand the tt values can be found by using (19) and (20) in (18) via the undetermined-coefficients procedure. Formally, there exist other solutions, of course, as is the case in most rational expectations models of asset prices. The solution described in (20) is, however, the unique solution that is free of bootstrap effects\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dones that exist only because they are arbitrarily expected to exist. For a lengthy discussion of this point and a rationalization of the (standard) practice of focussing attention on the bootstrap-free solution, see McCallum (1983).",
        "Useful summaries have been provided by Cagan (1980) and Hester (1981), among others.",
        "See, for example, Brunner and Meltzer (1983).",
        "If complete, the elimination of currency would lead to the existence of a non-monetary economy, so difficulties with monetary control would become unimportant. For a discussion of some recent literature involving hypothetical economies with sophisticated accounting systems of exchange, see McCallum (1985).",
        "Thus Bryant (1982, p. 598) says that \"It needs to be emphasized at the outset that the issue discussed in this paper [i.e., the ability of the Federal Reserve to control the money stock] is not of major importance.\"",
        "The force of the position is also weakened, of course, by the existence of political pressures of various sorts. While such pressures are obviously of enormous actual importance, this paper is not the appropriate place to attempt a systematic discussion. For one interesting recent effort, see Hetzel (1984a).",
        "Interesting evidence, supportive of the view that better performance would be available with a nominal GNP target, is provided by Tinsley and von zur Muehlen (1983). Specifically, their simulations with the Board's quarterly econometric model suggest that the volatility of inflation and unemployment would be lower than with targets for Ml (or some other variables). These simulations, it should be stressed, do not presume that the intermediate target variables can be accurately controlled, but only that the Fed can control \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d use as an instrument \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dthe federal funds rate.",
        "Tobin's (1983, pp. 509-511) arguments against \"purely nominalist\" targets do not address the claim being made, namely, that adherence to nominal targets can enhance social welfare as expressed in an objective function that includes real variables among its arguments.",
        "Thus Solomon (1984, p. 4) objects to nominal GNP targeting because \"it is simply not appropriate for the Federal Reserve to set broad economic goals. That is the task of elected officials.\"",
        "Volcker (1983, p. 620) fears \"that attempts to target GNP within a narrow range would, deliberately or not, provide an unwarranted sense of omnipotence for monetary policy ... ultimately leading to a sense of disappointment.... In addition, the impression conveyed that monetary policy would be 'held responsible' for meeting targets would, I suspect, only weaken the will of the Congress and the body politic to deal with other difficult issues, such as the budget, essential to the success of economic policy as a whole.\"",
        "This is Tobin's (1983) term.",
        "For example, in an argument against rules, Volcker (1983, p. 619) suggests that \"attempts to follow a preset and inflexible money growth rule with Ml based on historical trends would have resulted over the past year, in my judgement ..., in a appreciably 'tighter' policy than intended at the start of the period.\" An exception is provided by Lindsey (1984).",
        "Lindsey (1984, p. 7) has objected to this proposal on the grounds that \"lags in the impact of policy actions would raise the potential problem of dynamic instability, since money base growth would continue to rise even during the early to middle phases of expansion in the business cycle, when nominal GNP rapidly approaches its target from below.\" The precise pattern of weights on various past target misses should, of course, be chosen with such possibilities in mind.",
        "Hall (1985) has analyzed the properties of his rule under the assumption that a particular nominal-contracting model of John Taylor's provides a reasonable description of the economy.",
        "Carried out by Lindsey and others (1981) and Tinsley et al (1981).",
        "The current (1985) regulations do not, of course, feature full contemporaneousness. Goodfriend (1984b) has discussed procedures under which the two day lag could be damaging."
