Data compiled using the 1968 System of National Accounts (SNA) standards (1955-1998). 2.) Data compiled using the 2005 release which follows 1993 SNA standards (1980-2003). 3.)

From 1955-1979, the saving rate is computed using the methodology in Modigliani and Cao (2004). After 1979 the saving rate is disposable income less consumption as a share of disposable income. India: The Indian data comes from the Indian Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. Household saving in India is defined as financial and physical asset saving as a share of disposable income.",
        "5.2 Demographics Data We use two data sources in conjunction for the year-by-year, age-by-age, age distribution from 18702139: 1.) United Nations Population Prospects 2012 Revision (http://esa.un.org/wpp/) and 2.) Angus Maddison Historical Data (http://www.ggdc.net/maddison/oriindex.htm).",
        "The UN data includes the number of people by single age group for ages 0-100 for every year beginning in 1990 and projected through 2100. Beyond 2100, we assume the number of births remains constant at the 2100 UN value and set the survival probabilities (from age a to a + 1) to their 2100 values.",
        "The UN data also provides historical estimates from 1950-1990, but only for ages 1-79. To complete the age distribution (i.e. ages 80-95), we do the following.",
        "1. For ages 80-85, we set the survival probabilities equal to the survival probability projected (by the UN) for individuals aged 90-95 but 100 years in the future (e.g. we assume the survival probability for an 80 year-old in 1989 is the same as a 90 year-old in 2089). This is approximately what is observed in the UN projections for later years.",
        "2. For ages 86 and above, we set the remaining population by age according to the share of the population in each age group in 1990. For example, if 25% of those over 85 are age 86 in 1990, then we always have 25% of those over 85 be age 86.",
        "Prior to 1950, we use the Maddison data to backcast the total population. To do this, we calculate the implied population growth rates from 1870-1950 from the Maddison data (note: for India, we assumed flat population growth over the period 1947-1948 due to missing observations). We use those rates to calculate the total population going back in time. The resulting time series of total population is very close to the Maddison estimates. It is not exact because the UN estimates and Maddison estimates do not exactly agree for 1950.",
        "Finally, we break the total population from 1870-1950 down into an age-distribution. We assume that each age group\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s share of the population remained constant at its 1950 share (for ages 1-79). For ages 80+, we used the same method described above for 1950-1990.",
        "The results for Japan are in line with (but do not exactly match) the estimates given by the 5-year Japanese census. The UN 1955 and Japanese census age distributions (and total population estimates) do not exactly coincide; therefore our backcasts are slightly o\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0080\u00a0\u00c2\u00b5 from the Japanese census (but still fairly close, e.g. the share of the population aged 1 in 1884 in our projections is similar to the Japanese census data). 5.3 Dependent Children in the Cross Section 5.3.1 Number of dependent children per household In the full model, the number of children in the household varies with the age of the household, producing a hump shaped age-to-family size profile (i.e. the average 20 year old and 59 year old have fewer children to support than the average 40 year old in a given year). Below details the construction of these profiles by country.",
        "of live births for mothers in 5 year age groups from 1947-2004. We assume that the number of births is uniform across mothers within a 5 year age group to get the number of births in single year age groups.",

As in the model, we assume that there are no births before age 20 and children remain at home until age 20. We find the number of children per woman (by age) in the cross section for one year, 1990. We calculate the total number of children per age group j in 1990, Wj, as the sum of total children born in the past 20 years for that age group Wj = X i=0 bj i,1990 i.",
        "Since our model is described as single parent households, we assume that the father and mother\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s age is the same and estimate the number of children per household in 1990, b nj, by dividing the number of children by mother\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s age by the total number of people in that age group. We use the predicted number of children by age of the household head, nj, for the rest of the series by assuming the relative number of children across cohorts stays the same (although the total number of children changes), using (8) for the Japanese data. We experimented with using di\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0080\u00a0\u00c2\u00b5erent years for the cross section, but this choice had little e\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0080\u00a0\u00c2\u00b5ect on the quantitative results.",
        "For example, an 85 year-old in 2009 receives transfers from more workers than a 65 year-old in 2009 because the 85 year-old cohort had more children on average than the 65 year-olds. 5.4 Age Specific Wages In the full model, the wage varies by the age of the worker, producing a hump shaped profile of wages by age (i.e. the average 20 year old earns less than a 50 year old). Below details the construction of this profile by country.",
        "China: We use the 2007 RUMiC survey to calculate the average wage by worker\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s age. The series is hump shaped with some high frequency variation. To smooth the series, we estimate the average wage by age j, called b wj, with the following regression b wj = \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0080\u00a0\u00c2\u00b5 + 1agej + 2age2 j + 3age3 j + 4age4 j + \u00c3\u00a2\u00c5\u0093\u00c2\u008fj. (9) We use the predicted wages as the average wage by age and construct the age-profile weights as b wj/w where w is the average wage across all age groups.",
        "India: We use the 2004 wave of the Socio-Economic Survey to calculate wages by age. The series is hump shaped with some high frequency variation. To smooth the series, we estimate the average wage by age j, called c wj, with (9) using this data. We use the predicted wages as the average wage by age and construct the age-profile weights as b wj/w. 5.5 Wage Growth and Interest Rates We use various data sources to construct the wage growth and interest rate series for the full model. Since we are interested in capturing the trend in saving rates, we average wage and interest rate series over intervals to capture the salient economic conditions in those periods. When simulating the model, we use the Hodrick-Prescott filtered trend (smoothing parameter = 100) to smooth the transition of the series between the intervals.",
        "Japan: We use the wage growth and interest rate series from Hayashi and Prescott (2002) who report estimated wages and after tax marginal product of capital from 1947-2001. We use their average wage growth and marginal product of capital as our interest rate from 1947-1991. The wage growth and interest rates from 1992-2100 are the averages from Hayashi and Prescott (2002) from 1992 to 2001.",
        "We chose 1991 as the break point as this year marks the beginning of Japan\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093Lost Decade\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d, which has persisted through to today. Prior to 1947, we assume wage growth is 0 and interest rates are the same as they were from 1947-2001. The results in the 1955-2012 interval are not sensitive to the initial wage growth and interest rates.",
        "China: The wage and interest rate series come from Curtis et al. (2015). We use their average wage growth and interest rate series from 1851-1978, 1979-2015, and 2015-2100. We chose 1979 as a break point in the series to capture the changes in factor prices following the major economic reforms."
