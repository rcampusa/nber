For 1950, when the complete-count census is unavailable (and the 1% sample is insufficient for generating age-specific population counts in individual cities), we estimate age structures for urban populations at the state level using the 1% sample.21 We interpolate the logged age-specific populations A handful of cities report age-by-cause mortality statistics in some years, but these cities are highly selected: they are mostly very large cities that vary little by region.",
        "Seventy cities do not appear in the 1940 IPUMS. To avoid interpolating age distributions over long periods, in the case of those 70 cities and the 70 dropped observations described above, we extrapolate the IPUMS data that remain only to the end of the ICD period. For this purpose, we treat 1920 as included in the 1921-1929 ICD period. Thus, a city with good IPUMS data for 1920 but IPUMS data dropped in 1930 due to data error would have its 1920 age distribution extrapolated to the 1921-1929 ICD period, but would be missing from the 1930-1938 period. Additionally, for all populations, we can interpolate age distributions only for cities present, without data error, in IPUMS data for at least two Census years.",

        "In our analysis, we omit every variation on rheumatic fever and rheumatism because of the inconsistent handling of this category of death over the course of the series. Figure A.2 shows the infectious mortality rates by region, re-classifying infectious deaths to include every variation on rheumatism and rheumatic fever in both the city rates and the standard age schedule of mortality. Including rheumatism and rheumatic fever does not change any of our main results: the relatively flat infectious mortality before the 1918 flu, the steep decline in the 1940s, the exceptionally high southern mortality across the series, and the partial southern convergence with other regions during the 1940s all remain.",
