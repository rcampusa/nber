FOOTNOTES This paper has been written while on sabbatical at the National Bureau of Economic Research. It has not undergone the full critical review accorded the NBER studies.",
        "Research on this paper was supported by a grant to the National Bureau of Economic Research from the Rockefeller Foundation. The paper was inspired by discussions with Yoram Weiss and Robert J. Willis. I am thankful to Orley Ashenfelter, Gary Becker, Victor Fuchs, Zvi Griliches, Robert Michael, Jacob Mincer and Donald Parsons for their comments on earlier drafts of this paper, and to Kris Chinn and Kyle Johnson for computational assistance. ^One exception is (Perlman, 1969, Ch. 1). After writing the initial draft of this paper, I have become aware of another two exceptions; namely, Bloch (1973) and Sharir (1975). Both suggest models that are in many respects similar to the one suggested here but do not analyze all the implications of this model.",
        "Ben Porath (1973) explained this relationship in a somewhat similar fashion, arguing that If the elasticity of substitution between time and goods in the production of children exceeds unity, children may be a time-intensive commodity for low-wage mothers but a goods-intensive commodity for high-wage mothers.",
        "Fuchs (1974) reports that the sex differential in hourly earnings of white non-farm employed hardly changed in the last decade (from .61 in 1959 to .64 in 1969). Moreover, the differential for the young (less than 35) married (the group more prone to divorce) has even slightly increased (from .73 to .70). 2 7 One can easily incorporate in the analysis additional proposals (e.g., a subsidy confined to formal source of childcare) and complicate it by introducing additional activities or exchange within the household, but this would not change our basic conclusion.",
        "Using Israeli data (the Family Expenditure Survey 1968/9) , I found that, even when one controls for the wife&apos;s education and employment status, the income elasticity of housemaids exceeds unity.",
        "One has to qualify somewhat this conclusion because the wage rates used in the imputations may exceed the nonworking wives&apos; expected wages (Gronau, 1973). It may very well be that the observed goods intensity of children can be traced to joint consumption and production. Much of the satisfaction one derives from his children and much of the childcare activity involves just having the children around while doing other things, e.g., cooking, watching TV, etc. Children may not require, therefore, an increase in leisure to allow the enjoyment from them."
