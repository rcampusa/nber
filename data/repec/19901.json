        "We supplement the plant-level data from prefectural governments\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 statistics by several other data sources. In particular, we employed the data containing the same variables as above collected at the firm level by the All-Japan Cotton Spinners\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 Association (hereafter \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093Boren,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d using its name\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s abbreviation in Japanese) and published in its monthly bulletin (Geppo). Even though the data were collected at the firm- and not plant level, there were no acquisitions and mergers to speak of until 1898 and all but 2 firms were single-plant firms, so the data are usable for pre-acquisition plant-level comparisons. We thus converted monthly Geppo data for 18961898 to annual data and use these in our estimations alongside government-collected annual plant-level data for 1899 and beyond.",
        "Third, while we have direct measures of capital input in the data in the form of the number of spindles in operation, spinning frames are just one part of capital equipment which accounts for 25-30 percent of the total equipment cost of a mill (Saxonhouse, 1971, p. 55). Correlation between spindles and other equipment (cards, draw frames, slubbing frames, intermediate frames, roving frames, etc.) is, however, extremely high (over 95 percent), so \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093there is no question that spindles are a good proxy for equipment as a whole\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d (Saxonhouse, 1971, p. 56). We also have the data on the number of spindles installed in each plant in each year, which allows us to measure capacity utilization rates and follow any plant upgrades as the new equipment is installed.",
        "B. An example of management turnover in our data In August 1898, the shareholders of the decade-old struggling Onagigawa Menpu (Onagigawa Cotton Fabrics) company in Tokyo, Japan appointed a new board member. His name was Heizaemon Hibiya, a cotton trader and also founder and CEO of Tokyo Gasu Boseki (Tokyo Gassed Cotton Spinning) company, one of the more recent and successful high-tech entrants in the Japanese cotton spinning industry at the time. When Hibiya first toured the Onagigawa factory, he was reportedly in shock at what he saw. Workers brought portable charcoal stoves and smoked inside the plant. Women cooked and ate on the factory floor, strewing garbage. Cotton and other materials were everywhere, blocking hallways, while workers in inventory room gambled.",

        "Therefore, the gap in machine quality between different firm types is not as dramatic as the 50 difference in vintages may indicate, but it is still considerable as shown in Table A3. Table A3 follows the same format as Table 1 in the main text, but it shows differences in machine characteristics and therefore differences in potential rather than actual productivity across these categories (recall that these figures are computed for 1896-97, when no acquisition had yet taken place)."
