In particular, our results suggest that for every ten permanent modifications induced by the program there are about seven fewer foreclosures. One could potentially compute the benefit of the program based on studies that quantify the deadweight losses of foreclosures. Such benefits could be compared with the direct cost of providing incentives for the additional HAMP modification (around $4,500 per modification).",
