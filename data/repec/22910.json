We include only respondents who are 30 years old.

Baseline Income Definitions Children\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s income is defined analogously to parents\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 family income, namely as the sum of spouses\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 total personal income minus income from welfare and Supplemental Security Income.

        "C. Copula The copula we use is the 100 x 100 percentile transition matrix constructed by Chetty et al. (2014a, Online Data Table 1).29 We briefly summarize the methodology used to construct this copula below; see Chetty et al. (2014a, Appendix A) for further information.",
        "Sample Construction The sample consists of the set of children in Social Security Administration population records who are born between 1980-1982 and are U.S. citizens as of 2013. For each child, we then define the parent(s) as the first person(s) who claim the child as a dependent on a 1040 tax form. Ninety percent of children born between 1980 and 1982 can be linked to parents based on dependent claiming. We limit the sample to children who can be linked to parents.",

In years where the individual files a tax return, we define family income as Adjusted Gross Income (as reported on the 1040 tax return) plus tax-exempt interest income and the non-taxable portion of Social Security and Disability benefits. In years where the individual does not file a tax return, we define family income as the sum of wage earnings (reported on form W-2), unemployment benefits (reported on form 1099-G), and gross social security and disability benefits (reported on form SSA-1099). In years where the individual has no tax return and no information returns, family income is coded as zero.",
        "Taxes and Transfers We estimate taxes using the NBER TAXSIM model (Feenberg et al. 1993). TAXSIM provides federal tax estimates starting in 1960. We use it to estimate federal tax liability after credits for children in all cohorts and for parents in 1960 and thereafter. To estimate taxes for parents prior to 1960, we use data on federal marginal tax rates and exemptions from Wilson (2002).",
        "We compute taxes in TAXSIM using the following variables: year, marital status, age of the primary and secondary taxpayers, wages and salary income (replicating the definitions in our baseline income specification), and number of dependents. We use the output variable FIITAX, the federal income tax liability after credits. When using marginal tax rates (prior to 1960), we determine exemptions based on marital status and the number of dependents. We use two sources of data to measure transfers. First, we use the CPS and Census to measure the value of cash transfers from welfare programs and Supplemental Security Income. In particular, we  add in the variables incwelfr and incssi in IPUMS-CPS, and incwelfr and incsupp in IPUMS-USA.",
        "We are able to measure these transfers for children in all years and for parents from 1970 onward.",

In our baseline analysis, we use wage and salary income to measure incomes in the 1940 Census (supplemented by imputed non-wage, non-salary income) because measures of total family income and spousal income are not available. The wage and salary income measure is consistent across all years starting with the 1940 Census. Section II: Additional Robustness Checks In this section, we present a set of supplementary robustness checks that address various limitations of the data we use.",

B. Robustness to Alternative Counterfactuals Measuring Income at Older Ages Our more broadly shared growth counterfactual reallocates income not just across different income groups but also across individuals of different ages. In this subsection, we assess whether this reallocation across ages affects our conclusion that a broader distribution of growth across income groups would substantially increase absolute mobility.",
        "We evaluate this concern by repeating our counterfactuals, measuring incomes at age 40 instead of age 30.

The results of this alternative approach are presented in Panel B of Figure S12. We find an even larger impact of the broadly shared growth counterfactual relative to the high growth counterfactual than in our baseline counterfactuals.

For these groups, allocating growth in accord with how it has been allocated between 1980-2010 (i.e., using negative growth shares) decreases their incomes further. Conversely, changing the distribution to the more equal shares of growth experienced by the 1940 cohort has very large effects.",
        "In Panel C of Figure S12, we replicate the growth shares counterfactuals in Panel B, measuring incomes at age 40 for the 1970 cohort. These counterfactuals are constructed in the same way as above, except that they use income growth to GDP growth ratios for the years 1950-1980 rather than 1940-1970 in the more broadly shared growth counterfactual. The results at age 40 are very similar to those at age 30. In sum, these alternative counterfactuals reinforce the conclusion that higher GDP growth itself cannot increase absolute mobility unless it is more broadly distributed.",
