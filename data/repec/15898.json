Reducing drop-out rates was identified as a key component of CPS reform efforts. Preliminary analysis of CPS data revealed a connection between graduation and the number of credits accumulated during freshman year in high school.

BACKGROUND AND OVERVIEW During the 2003-2004 school year, Roland Fryer, Richard Freeman, and Alexander Gelber implemented a pilot incentive program at PS 70, an elementary school in the Bronx, NY. The pilot informed the design of future incentive projects related to: type of reward (monetary vs. social), frequency and timeliness of rewards, level of randomization (within vs. across schools), and teacher and administrative expectations.",
        "During the 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 school years, EdLabs implemented NYC Spark to measure the impact of incentives on student achievement. In year 1, the program was administered to 4th and 7th grade students in a sample of New York City public schools. In year 2, eligibility expanded to 8th graders in about half of the participating middle schools to test two-year treatment effects. During the first year, EdLabs assigned two Boston-based project mangers to oversee program implementation, and one to oversee the payment process. In the second year, EdLabs\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 project managers were stationed at the New York City Department of Education in order to be more accessible to schools via in person visits, local phone and fax numbers and a familiar DOE email address.",

Roland Fryer then visited the 143 schools that expressed initial interest in response to our letter. All 143 schools signed up for the experiment. Twelve schools were removed due to their participation in other Opportunity NYC programs. Sixty-three schools were randomized into treatment. The schools that were not selected served as a control group and were told that they would be given first priority if the NYC Department of Education decided to expand the program.",

If a student attended multiple schools for the same maximum number of days, then he was assigned to the school with the lower school ID.

        "Demographic variables Demographic variables that should not vary from year to year (race, gender) were pulled from New York City enrollment files from 2003-04 through 2008-09, with precedence given to the most recent files first. Race consisted of the following categories: Black, Hispanic, White, Asian, and Other. These categories were considered mutually exclusive.The \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093Other\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d category consisted of students that were coded as \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093American Indian\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d. Gender was coded as male, non-male, or missing.",
        "Demographic variables that may vary from year to year (free lunch, English language learner, and special education) were only pulled from the 2008-09 NYC enrollment file. A student was considered free lunch if he was coded as \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093A\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009dor \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u00931\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009din the raw data, which corresponds to free lunch or \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u00932\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009dwhich corresponds to reduced-price lunch. A student was considered non free lunch if the student was coded as a \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u00933\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009din the NYC enrollment file which corresponds to Full Price. All other values, including blanks, were coded as missing. For English Language Learner status, a student was given a value of one if he was coded as \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093Y\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009din the limited English proficiency variable.",
        "All other students in the NYC 2008-09 enrollment file were coded as zero for English Language Learner status. Special education was coded similarly.",
        "New York State Test Scores NYC state test scores were pulled from the NYC test score files for 2008-09 and 2007-08. Scores were standardized by grade level to have mean of zero and standard deviation of one in the experimental group (the experimental group mean was subtracted from each student\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s score, and the result was divided by the experimental group standard deviation). Proficiency levels were also taken directly from these files.",
        "Grades Grades were pulled from files containing the transcripts for all students in NYC from 2008-09 and 2007-08. Grades were averaged to create a yearly GPA for each student. If a student had multiple grades for the same course in the same semester (usually because he switched schools) both grades were used. As with test scores, GPAs were standardized to have mean of zero and standard deviation of one in the experimental group.",
        "School-level variables School-level variables were constructed for each school based on the population of students assigned to that school, using the same method of assignment described in the School-level variables in Dallas section of the Appendix. The method of determining the first school was slightly more complicated than in other cities because of the format of the attendance data for 2008-09. In previous years\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 data, observations were student-school level and had the number of presents and days enrolled in each month. In 2008-09 the data was still student-school level, but each month kept track of the cumulative number of days a student had spent in NYC public schools over the year. We assumed that a student attended first the school with the lowest number of cumulative days present. These school-level variables included the percents of the student population that were black, Hispanic or classified as free lunch.",
        "Behavior The number of behavioral incidents for each student was pulled from a NYC file listing all behavioral incidents from 2008-09. Students not listed in this file were assumed to have zero behavioral incidents. The total number of behavioral incidents for each student was summed and then standardized to have mean of zero and standard deviation of one in the experimental group.",
        "The number of behavioral incidents for 2007-08 was constructed similarly using a NYC file listing all behavioral incidents from 2007-08. School-level behavior variables were constructed similarly, but behavioral incidents were summed within a school rather than at the individual level.",
        "A dummy was constructed for bad behavior in 2007-08, with the dummy equal to zero if a student had had zero behavioral incidents in 2007-08, and equal to one if the student had had any behavioral incidents in 2007-08."
