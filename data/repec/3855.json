        "Endnotes See Hartland (1949) Lerner (1951) , Meade (1957) The phrase \"optimum currency area\" was coined by Mundell in his classic (1961) paper.",

        "Although they did not use the phrase \"optimum currency area\" the concept of unique currency for regions with high labor mobility was already outlined by both Lerner (1951) and Meade (1957). From a Keynesian perspective therefore, the question of the appropriate exchange rate regime cannot really be separated from the debate question the importance and causes of nominal rigidities. Of course the existence of nominal rigidities is at the very heart of the current macroeconomic debate.",
        "Other criteria mentioned in the literature are \"the degree of openness\" (if marginal propensity to import, is very high, a small decrease in income in A and a small increase in B will restore equilibrium); the size of transaction costs (a unique currency reduces the transaction Costs and accounting costs); the extent of financial market integration (high capital mobility would facilitate borrowing and lending; of course that would not help with a permanent shift in preferences but it would certainly bevery important if the perturbations were temporary). We will not discuss them because we think that (at least in 1992) Europe will satisfy the two requirements Finally, some economists (Kenen 1969), argue that open economies should have fixed ER only if they have a variety of exports. If an economy exports only one good, then a single shock may require a major real adjustment.",
        "The debate over fixed versus flexible ER does not stop in the analysis of \"what kind of shocks are you more likely to suffer\". Some of the current debate stresses the \"disciplinary\" factors of having fixed ER (Giavazzi-Pagano (1988), Giavazzi-Giovannini (1988) and Canzoneri-Henderson (1989)). These researchers use a Barro-Gordon (1983) type of model to stress that the existence of fixed ER increases the anti-inflationary reputation of a single government and, therefore, reduces the real costs of an deflationary policy. For a criticism see Obstfeld (1988).",
        "8 The way this problem has been handled up to now in the EMS has been through devaluations. There have been 11 episodes of realignment in the 10 years of EMS existence (Giavazzi 1989).",
        "Kenen (1969) was the first to use this kind of argument.",
        "Hartland (1949) analyzes the implicit interregional transfers within the US. She looked at the treasury fund movements from industrialized to agricultural regions in response to the government policy of supporting farm prices in the 1930's. She concludes that \"the most important determinant in the maintenance of regional balance of payments equilibria in this country has been the mobility of productive factors, especially that of capital\". The argument is that the role of the government was not to carry out the actual transfers but to facilitate private capital movements. See also the Reply by Fels (1950) and Hartland (1950).",

        "The average marginal tax rate in the United States has fluctuated over the sample. It was 27% in 1970 and progressively increased until it reached a maximum of 38% in 1981. The Reagan tax cuts brought it back down to 34% by 1985. See Barro (1990) for a discussion of these numbers.
