        "For evidence on trends in women&apos;s employment extending back further, see Goldin (1990).",
        "These increases were concentrated among married women, as single women had high employment rates at the beginning of the century. Participation rates among black women display similar trends to those of white women, but started at much higher levels, and declined during the Depression (Goldin, 1990).",
        "Cain (1966) reports very similar results using a 1950 cross-city regression, and predicting changes over the period 1939-1957.",
        "Bowen and Finegan (1969) also discount the importance of the war per se, concluding that \"the increases in the participation of married women which took place between 1940 and 1950 need not be explained primarily in terms of the changes in social attitudes brought about by wartime experiences\" (pp. 224-5). This is because in their analysis of the ability of cross-sectional (cross-city) participation regressions to explain changes in participation over various decades, standard income, wage, and shadow wage variables are particularly powerful predictors for the 1940-1950 period. Cain (1966) reached a similar conclusion, focusing in particular on the decrease in family income owing to drafting of husbands, and the decline in the demand for women&apos;s household services."
