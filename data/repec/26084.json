What would it take to reduce us greenhouse gas emissions 80 Review of Environmental Economics and Policy, 11(2):319\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c335, July 2017. 6A similar issue arises with the U.S.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s nuclear power stations, which provide about 20% of the megawatt hours generated annually in the U.S. All but two or three will also be well beyond their usable lives by 2050, and will have to be replaced. I am implicitly assuming here that they are replaced by non-fossil, non-renewable power (nuclear, hydro, geothermal, etc.), as replacing them by renewables would probably increase the need for storage and or grid enhancements. 7See for example https://news.energysage.com/solar-farms-start-one/ and https://www.seia.org/research-resources/solar-market-insight-report-2018-year-review figure 2.4.",
