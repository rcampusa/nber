        "Under the assumption that the U.S. was at the steady state in 1950, i.e., = e, we can compute an the associated real interest rate implied by (89). Using the parameter values employed in the main text, a=213, 5=10, r5=.065 and = 1.01 (the Japanese population grew at 1% in the post war period\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dsee Sarro [1987], page 296) and choosing so that the steady state growth rate of per capita output is 2% per year, the value of the Japanese interest rate implied by the model is 560%. In terms of dynamics this model is almost identical to the baseline economy of section II. The system of Euler equations that governs the the competitiveequilibrium for this economy is identical to (Al), (A.2) with (oo) replaced by 73 and kt replaced by j.",
        "To study the models implications for the Japanese real interest rate in 1000 we start by using (8.9) and the )owledge of the steady state real interest rate, rt, to cornute the steady state value of i.
