        "We then aggregate these data at grade one school by year level and measure competition according to panels A to F in Table 3. Regressions include interaction between competition measure and school year along school year and grade one school fixed effects. Effects are presented relative to baseline (omitted) 2002/03 school year. Panel A presents results for predicted schoollevel averaged mathematics and reading scores, panel B presents results for predicted school-level mathematics scores, and panel C presents results for predicted school-level reading scores. Spikes present 95% confidence intervals based on standard errors clustered at grade one school level.",
