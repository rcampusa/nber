        "27 For our married white 26 year old, estimated wealth at various Hprices from two standard deviations below mean Hprice to two above is ($13,600, $15,230, $15,500, $14,370, and $12,870).",
        "22 The estimation procedure is generalized least squares (Greene, 1996, p. 299).",
        "17 This model was developed by Butler and Moff~tt (1982). Technical details concerning the maximum likelihood estimation procedure are given in the Limdep Manual, version 6.0 (P 440). 8 Age of respondent and spouse is 26 and both have 12 years of education. 9 The sample minimum and maximum Hprice observations occur at two std. and three std. from the mean.",

        "20 ENDNOTES The stagnant U.S. home ownership rate since 1980 has led to calls for Federal actions to lower this requirement (e.g., in the fall of 1994, the Clinton Administration proposed zero down payment loans). However, Greens analysis (1996) suggests that underwriting standards are not responsible for the stagnant aggregate rate in the 1980s. In 42 of 50 states, the ratio of house prices to income declined, and in 47 states the ratio of housing expenses to income fell.",
