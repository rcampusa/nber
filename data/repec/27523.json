        "Note from IPUMS: Census practice on collecting occupational data (in OCC) for persons not currently in the labor force changed over time. In the earliest samples, no time referent was specified for when the person was gainfully employed. In 1900, past occupation was specifically requested for persons unable to secure any work during the preceding year, but not for persons who had permanently retired. Similarly, for the 1910-1930 surveys, occupation was to be reported for persons temporarily unemployed, but not for those permanently retired. This changed markedly in 1940 and 1950. In those years, OCC was reserved for those in the labor force (working, with a job, or looking for work) in the week prior to the census. For 1940 and 1950, past occupation was separately collected via different questions and variables (UOCC and ROCC) for formerly-employed persons not currently in the labor force.",
