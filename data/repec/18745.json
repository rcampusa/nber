        "Table C2 presents results from comparable models estimated separately by cohort, but using a specification that mirrors that used in main analysis. Table B2 shows the odds ratios and standard errors from our conditional logit model described above, separately for the 1992 and 2004 cohort. Following the prior literature, we include log enrollment to control for school size. Given the cross-sectional identification concerns raised in the previous section, we do not interpret these specifications as providing good estimates of preference parameters for studentinvariant characteristics. Rather, this analysis provides a benchmark for subsequent analysis and illustrates the importance of including consumption amenities and accounting for selective admissions when estimating college choice models.",
        "In the ELS, students were asked in 2006 (two years after expected high school graduation) to list up to 20 schools to which they applied, and whether they were accepted and/or attended. It also allows them to list the start and end dates of attendance."
