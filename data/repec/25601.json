However, empirical evidence that announcements of major adjustments in official funding levels of San Diego pensions reduced home prices (MacKay, 2014) suggests exactly that voters do not see the true under-funding of the pension plan if it is not officially announced to them. The reality of the \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00cb\u009cshroudedness\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 of pension accounting means that most home buyers will not anticipate future taxes related to covering funding gaps.",
        "If the ability to under-fund pensions is key to the \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00cb\u009cshroudedness\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 of pension benefits, it also raises the question how union representatives and union members discount under-funded pension benefits relative to fully funded ones in practice. It is possible that there is no discount at all because under-funded benefits are still legally binding commitments. One caveat to that view is that even if all obligations end up being paid in full, many union members may belong to the tax base from which they are paid.23 However, this should be equally true of funded benefits. If, as suggested by Inman (1982), retired pensioners are more likely to move out of the tax base, then under-funding may actually be preferred.",
        "When public-sector unions expanded in the 1960s, they mostly organized themselves out of pre-existing trade associations (Freeman, 1986; Reder, 1988). Trade associations for police and fire-fighters had traditionally been organized at the city-level, and as a result police and fire-fighter unions are today mostly organized locally, and so are their pension plans.24 By contrast, teachers unions had traditionally been organized at the state or even federal level. The two largest teachers unions, the NEA and AFT, emerged out of associations that even in the early 1960s had operated nation-wide (Greenhut, 2009, 212). As a result, while teachers unions collectively bargain for wages at the city-level, their pension plans are almost exclusively organized at the state-level.",
        "The table also reports on one-year lags of the eight main fiscal outcomes in Ferreira and Gyourko (2009, TableII). Since these are all defined in per capita terms, the table also separately reports on the underlying totals. Of the fourteen covariates, only the percentage of revenues spent on salaries displays a marginally significant difference. 24 While many police and fire-fighter unions belong to larger umbrella organizations (there is even an International Association of Fire Fighters), these are loose federations that play little role in collective bargaining. 25 Vogl (2014) finds some evidence that in cities in the U.S. South black mayoral candidates are more likely to see close wins than close losses. However, as Eggers et al. (2015) note, his evidence is based on only 38 close mayoral races in the South between a white and black candidate."
