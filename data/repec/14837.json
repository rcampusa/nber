        "Specifically, the code produces output files sch_b - concordances - VER_ BEG - END. dta and hts_concordances_VER_BEG_END.dta, where VER, BEG and END reflect user-defined version dates (currently 20081101) and beginning-end years (exports: 1989 2007) or year-months (imports: 198906200707), respectively. These concordances include the same variables as the input files, but with setyr and effyr standardized across family trees, as described in Section 4 above. Variables in the concordance output files include: * obsolete: obsolete HS code; * new: corresponding new HS code; * setyr: synthetic code linking this mapping to all mappings in its family tree; * effyr: year (export) or year-month (import) in which the particular new-obsolete mapping first appears in the raw data.",
        "For those unfamiliar with Stata programming we also provide two additional output files in .txt format. These output files, named setyrxl989 2007.txt and setyrml989 2007.txt, provide a record of every HS code associated with every setyr that appears in the 1989-2007 concorded data.",
        "The first column of each file lists the setyrs, sorted from low to high. Each additional column lists the actual HS codes appearing in a particular year of the trade data that should be replace by the setyr. These actual HS codes also are sorted from low to high in each year. To concord U.S. trade data from 1989 to 2007, one would just replace all codes listed in the table with the synthetic setyr, and then collapse the data according to these setyrs. HS codes not appearing in these output files are consistent across all years of the data."
