Load and clean CBP data This step loads and cleans the raw County Business Patterns (CBP) data.3 Many smaller counties and industries have employment data that are suppressed by the Census Bureau for privacy reasons. In these cases, we use the number of establishments multiplied by the midpoint of the number of employees in each size class. 1 http://fact\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6nder.census.gov/ (IDs: EC0700CBDG1, EC0700CBDG2, EC0200CBDG1, EC0200CBDG2). 2 See here for an update: http://www.census.gov/econ/census/help/sector/core_business_statistics_series.html 3",
        "Raw CBP data are downloaded from: http://www.census.gov/econ/cbp/download/ If the selected level of geography is a Commuting Zone (CZ), this step also recodes county FIPS codes to their 2000 FIPS membership, for matching with the county-CZ bridge downloaded from http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/commuting-zones-and-labor-market-areas.aspx We replace any missing Geography X Industry X Year cell with a 0. 1.1.4 Step5 - Construct Bartik Shock This step constructs the Bartik shocks for each of the two datasets with dierent balance assumptions. The Bartik shock is de\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6ned as: bi;t = X k i;k; [( i;k;t i;k;t 1)= i;k;t 1] Where: i;k; is the employment share of industry k in geography i, i;k;t is the national employment share of industry k excluding geography i. is the base year, described in more detail below. First, we construct employment growth rates by industry, leaving out employment in the geography (the term in square brackets above).",
        "We pool samples from survey years 1997-2001 (which actually refer to calendar years 1996-2000 since the survey is retrospective) to get reasonable sample sizes at the state level and calculate the mean replacement ratio and takeup rate by state. 4",
