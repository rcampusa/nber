Its goal was to unite a number of fragmented far-right parties under one umbrella. Between 1966 and 1968, the NPD was elected into seven state parliaments, and in the 1969 federal election it missed the 5 percent minimum threshold by just 0.7 percentage points. Afterwards, support for the NPD declined and it took the NPD more than 25 years to re-enter state parliaments in Saxony (2004) and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (2006).",

        "During this time Smaller parties were struggling to put a party infratructure into place in East Germany. Accordingly, while all three extreme-right parties tried to establish themselves in East Germany after reunification, they did not gain major political attention until the late 1990s (Hagan, Merkens, and Boehnke (1995)). At the same time, we saw some of the worst excesses of far-right crime in East Germany in the early 1990s, when migrants\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 and asylum seekers\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 residences were set on fire and a mob of people from the neighborhood applauded. Research by Krueger and Pischke (1997) suggests that neither unemployment nor wages can explain these incidences of extremeright -driven crime from 1991 to 1993. It is more likely that the sudden increase in the number of immigrants and asylum seekers caused these xenophobic excesses in the early 1990s.",
        "In the mid-1990s, the initial euphoria of reunification passed and East German labor markets experienced stronger exposure to international competition. East Germany now faced almost twice as much unemployment as West Germany, and this economic malaise caused feelings of deprivation that often transformed into violent crime against immigrants.
