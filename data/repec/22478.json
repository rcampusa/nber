        "Column (2) shows the number of unique Medicare beneficiaries eligible for Medicare in each year 1992-2012. The number of enrollees grew from 36.9 million in 1992 to 53.4 million by 2012. Over that same period, the share of beneficiaries enrolled in traditional fee-for-service Medicare dropped from 93.3% in 1992 to 72.4% in 2012 (see column 3). This is important because claims are generally not available for the non-fee-for-service beneficiaries who are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans which are reimbursed by Medicare on a capitated basis. As a result, the characterization of physician behavior and practice environments in this paper is based on treatment patterns among the Medicare fee-for-service population only.",
        "Even in early sample years 1992-1997 when cath rates were low, over 70% of patients were admitted to hospitals with cath facilities. By 2012, nearly 92% of all heart attack patients were admitted to hospitals with cath facilities. As shown in column (7) of Table 1, the fraction of patients admitted to a hospital with a cath lab is even higher among patients seeing a cardiologist within two days of hospital admission. Especially over the period 19982012, these results suggest that whether a heart attack patient receives an early cath in most cases is not driven by lack of a cath lab at the hospital of initial admission.",
        "Rank preservation among top/bottom HRRs Table C.2 sheds light more directly on the stability of rankings of individual HRRs over time. I first assign each HRR a rank order from 1 (most intensive) to 306 (least intensive) based on each HRR\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s average 2-day cath intensity over the period 1998-2012. I also rank each HRR based on 1998 cath rates and again on 2012 cath rates. Panels A and B of Table C.2 list the top and bottom 10 HRRs, respectively, based on the average cath rate ranking. While the rank-order of these HRRs was not perfectly preserved from 1998 through 2012, there does appear to be a substantial amount of rank persistence. All regions in Panel A were in the top-25% of regions in both 1998 and 2012, and all but one were in the top-15% both years. Similarly, and regions in Panel B were in the bottom-33% both years, and all but two were in the bottom-10%.",
        "Panels C and D show the top and bottom 10 regions, respectively, based on ranking in 1998. While the most (least) intensive regions sill tended to be more (less) intensive than average in 2012, there is quite a bit of movement in the rank-order for some regions. Perhaps most prominently, McAllen, Texas was the second-most intensive region in 1998, with a 2day cath rate of nearly 70%, but was the 12th least-intensive region by 2012 with a cath rate of 46.1%. McAllen is an exceptional case in many respects, and was profiled as one of the most expensive health care markets in an influential New Yorker article in 2009 that even highlighted the propensity in McAllen to perform cardiac catheterization (Gawande, 2009).",
        "Columns (5-8) of Table C.4 explore whether the DD estimate appears to meaningfully differ between the first and second half of years in the sample.

I estimate the DD regression over the early sample movers, first using only patients admitted to the hospital prior to 2005 (column 5) and second using only patients admitted to the hospital within 3 years of the cardiologists move year (column 6). Columns (7-8) estimate the DD regression over analogous samples for the late sample movers. The DD estimate remains fairly stable across both the early and late samples, suggesting that environment effects on cardiologist behavior over the period 1998-2012 remained relatively stable."
