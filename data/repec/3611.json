Beck (1982) suggests that in addition to partisan effects, there are important administration specific effects as well. We do not incorporate this refinement into the model.",

        "This treatment of administration-specific \"competence\" was pioneered by Rogoff and Sibert (1988) and extended in a context similar to ours by Persson and Tabellini (1990). Notice that we could have emended this model by allowing the variance of the initial competency shock for a new administration to exceed c. However, the presence of only seven inter-party transfers of executive control in our sample period (1916-1988) makes estimation of this form of heteroskedasticity impractical. A-ll g",
        "This reflects the relatively high retention rates of members of the previous administration in key posts during the initial year of the successor administration's term of office. Since 1916, the beginning of our sample period, most presidential successions that left the White House In the hands of the same party were accessions by the incumbent vice president. 9"
