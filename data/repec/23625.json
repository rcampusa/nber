        "A. Present- or Future-Biased Discounting (Money) Time-inconsistent discounting has been linked, both theoretically and empirically, to low levels of saving and high levels of borrowing (e.g., Laibson 1997; Meier and Sprenger 2010; Toubia et al. 2013).",
        "We measure discounting biases with respect to money using the Convex Time Budgets (CTB) method created by Andreoni and Sprenger (2012). In our version, fielded in ALP module 315 (the first of our two surveys), subjects make 24 decisions, allocating 100 hypothetical tokens each between (weakly) smaller-sooner and larger-later amounts. See Data Appendix Figure 1 for an example. The 24 decisions are spread across 4 different screens with 6 decisions each. Each screen varies start date (today or 5 weeks from today) x delay length (5 weeks or 9 weeks); each decision within a screen offers a different yield on saving. Among the 1,515 individuals who take our first survey, 1,502 subjects make at least one CTB choice, and the 1,422 who complete at least the first and last decisions on each of the 4 screens comprise our CTB sample.",

BC\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s sample is drawn from the ALP, like ours (module 212 in their case), but they use a different adaptation of the CTB.",
        "High rates of non-monotonic demand are not uncommon in discount rate elicitation: Andreoni and Sprenger (2012) report rates ranging from 10 to 50 percent in their literature review. In Barcellos and Carvalho 26% of subjects exhibit some upward-sloping demand, among only 4 pairs of decisions. In our sample non-monotonic demand is strongly correlated within-subject across the four screens, and decreases slightly by the final screen, suggesting that responses are picking up something systematic. 3",

In the AS sample 14% exhibit any present-bias and 12% any future-bias.",
        "Interestingly, if we follow AS and use the CTB data to structurally estimate discounting-bias parameter values for each individual, we find that 90% of our subjects with no monotonicity violations lie within the interval [0.93, 1.07] (Data Appendix Table 1, Columns 11-13).5 This is noteworthy because behavioral macro papers sometimes assume representative agents with present bias that lies strictly below our 5th percentile (see, e.g., (\u00c3\u0084\u00c2\u00b0mrohoro\u00c3\u0084\u00c5\u00b8lu, \u00c3\u0084\u00c2\u00b0mrohoro\u00c3\u0084\u00c5\u00b8lu, and Joines 2003; Graham and Snower 2013; P\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a9rez Kakabadse and Palacios Huerta 2013).

        "Other papers have explored links between discounting biases and field behavior using direct elicitations on narrower samples, with narrower sets of covariates; see e.g., Chabris et al. (2008), Meier and Sprenger (2010), Burks et al. (2012), and Li et al. (2015). 7",

        "B. Present- or Future-Biased Discounting (Food) In light of evidence that discounting can differ within-subject across domains (e.g., Augenblick, Niederle, and Sprenger 2015), we also obtain a coarse measure of discounting biases for consumption per se, by asking two questions that follow Read and van Leeuwen (1998) : \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093Now imagine that you are given the choice of receiving one of two snacks for free, [right now/five weeks from now]. One snack is more delicious but less healthy, while the other is healthier but less delicious. Which would you rather have [right now/five weeks from now]: a delicious snack that is not good for your health, or a snack that is less delicious but good for your health? We fielded these questions in ALP module 352, the second of our two surveys.",
        "C. Inconsistency with General Axiom of Revealed Preference (and dominance avoidance) Our third and fourth behavioral factors follow Choi et al. (2014), which measures choice inconsistency with standard economic rationality. Choice inconsistency could indicate a tendency to make poor (costly) decisions in field contexts; indeed, Choi et al. (2014) find that more choice inconsistency is conditionally correlated with less wealth in a representative sample of Dutch households.",
        "We use the same task and user interface as in Choi et al. (2014) but abbreviate it from 25 decisions to 11.9 Each decision confronts respondents with a linear budget constraint under risk: subjects choose a point on the line, and then the computer randomly chooses whether to pay the point value of the x-axis or the y-axis. 1,270 of the 1,427 individuals taking our second survey make all 11 decisions, and comprise our sample for measuring choice inconsistency.10 See Data Appendix Figure 2 for an example.",
        "Following Choi et al., we average across these 11 decisions, within-consumer, to benchmark choices against two different standards of rationality. One benchmark is a complete and transitive preference ordering adhering to the General Axiom of Revealed Preference (GARP), as captured by the Afriat (1972) Critical Cost Efficiency Index. 1-CCEI can be interpreted as the subject\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s degree of choice inconsistency: the percentage points of potential earnings \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093wasted\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d per the GARP standard.

        "D. Risk attitude re: certainty (Certainty Premium) Behavioral researchers have long noted a seemingly disproportionate preference for certainty (PFC) among some consumers and posited various theories to explain it: Cumulative Prospect Theory (Daniel Kahneman and Tversky 1979; Amos Tversky and Kahneman 1992), Disappointment Aversion (Bell 1985; Loomes and Sugden 1986; Gul 1991), and u-v preferences 12 The second measure calculates 1-CCEI across the subject\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s 11 actual decisions and \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093the mirror image of these data obtained by reversing the prices and the associated allocation for each observation\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d (Choi et al. p. 1528), for 22 data points per respondent in total.",

        "E. Loss aversion/small-stakes risk aversion Loss aversion refers to placing higher weight on losses than gains, in utility terms. It is one of the most influential concepts in the behavioral social sciences, with seminal papers\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009de.g., Tversky and Kahneman (Amos Tversky and Kahneman 1992) and Benartzi and Thaler (1995)\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d producing thousands of citations. Loss aversion has been implicated in various portfolio choices (Barberis 2013) and consumption dynamics (K\u00c3\u0085\u00e2\u0080\u0098szegi and Rabin 2009) that can lead to lower wealth. 15 The theoretical mapping from late loan repayments to our index of financial condition is unclear under limited liability, and the average relationship (not conditioning on borrowing) more ambiguous, since borrowing could lead to (weakly) greater or lesser wealth if consumers are behavioral (Zinman 2014).",
        "We measure loss aversion using the two choices developed by Fehr and Goette (2007) in their study of the labor supply of bike messengers (see Abeler et al. (2011) for a similar elicitation method). Choice 1 is between a lottery with a 50% chance of winning $80 and a 50% chance of losing $50, and zero dollars. Choice two is between playing the lottery in Choice 1 six times, and zero dollars. As Fehr and Goette (FG) show, if subjects have reference-dependent preferences, then subjects who reject lottery 1 have a higher level of loss aversion than subjects who accept lottery 1, and subjects who reject both lotteries have a higher level of loss aversion than subjects who reject only lottery 1. In addition, if subjects&apos; loss aversion is consistent across the two lotteries, then any individual who rejects lottery 2 should also reject lottery 1 because a rejection of lottery 2 implies a higher level of loss aversion than a rejection of only lottery 1.",

We also order sets of deviations to indicate greater degrees of loss aversion, based on whether the individual respondent rejects the compound but not the single lottery, rejects the single but not the compound lottery, or rejects both.",

        "K. Exponential Growth Bias Exponential Growth Bias (EGB) produces a tendency to underestimate the effects of compounding on costs of debt and benefits of saving. It has been linked to a broad set of financial outcomes (Levy and Tasoff 2016; Stango and Zinman 2009).",
        "This is less EGB than Stango and Zinman (2009, 2011) see from questions in the 1983 Survey of Consumer Finances, where 98% of the sample underestimates, and the mean bias is 1,800bp or 3,800bp depending on the benchmark. The time frames of the questions differ, which may account for the difference (and is why we do not estimate an EGB structural model parameter to compare with our prior work or that of Levy and Tasoff).",
        "Stango and Zinman (2009; 2011) find that more debt-side EGB is strongly conditionally correlated with debt allocation, worse loan terms, and less savings and wealth.
