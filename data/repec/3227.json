Starr Center of Applied Economics at New York University. We thank the Starr Center for financial and technical assistance, and Chris Flinn, Mike Keane, Jacob Mincer and Ed Prescott for helpful discussion. 1 Although in the special case that they solve explicitly, the amount of labor allocated to each sector does not change over time. In the general case, however, it clearly would.",
        "6 Once again, the age composition our sample could affect these results but is unlikely to in a major way. Net flows are, indeed, smaller for older workers than for younger workers (Murphy and Topel, 1987, Tables 9 and 10). Since both gross and net flows fall with age, there is no reason to expect that their ratio would significantly fall. 7 If the net flows were generated by iid shocks :~t, this lack of significance would be expected. However, below we construct a more direct measure of sectoral shocks.",
        "8 Bull and Jovanovic (1988) assumed that productivity depended on a match-specific and a firm-specific term. They, however, treated firms' prices as exogenous processes, and moreover, did not define sectors -- the price of a firm was treated as independent of the prices of all other firms.",
        "9 This assumption is really a consequence of our earlier assumption that efficiency-units of labor in a given sector all trade at the same price. Because of risk-neutrality, this assumption about wages can be justified by appealing to an implicit contract view of wage-determination: If employers acquire reputations about the way the compensate their workers, then a pure piece-rate scheme (which is what we assume here) is an equilibrium wage contract. See Jovanovic (1979, theorems 1 and 2). Other compensation schemes will leave certain properties of the equilibrium intact -- see footnote 18. 10 If m were normally distributed, with F(m) - $((m-m)/a) (denoting by $ and &lt;b the standard normal CDF and pdf respectively) , we would have E(mjm > m*t) -'m + ah[ (m*c-i)/ff] , where h - \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00bf/(1-4) is the hazard-rate of the normal distribution. Eqs. (2) and (3) would then imply that xst  + ^[(m*t-S)/cr]n;t."
