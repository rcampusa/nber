        "*For example, Cochrane (1988a) presents an asset pricing model derived from firm's first order conditions. An economic theory of the contracting problems that prevent the emergence of markets in the ownership of people or other institutions that could remove the small surpluses of cyclical mis-allocation is beyond the scope of this paper. Beyond the obvious agency questions and the unobservability of utility (as compared to earnings), the fact that cyclical allocations ($7.50 more this quarter, $7.50 less the next) are so small compared to other elements of individual consumption decisions is probably part of the reason that we do not observe such institutions.",
        "Jones and Stock (1987) also consider this extension. 4, In a more formal presentation, we specify an underlying probability space (\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a31,F,P), and a nondecreasing sequence of sub a-algebras of F, sC, that comprise the consumer's information set. s*\" can be generated by current and past observations of a collection of observed random variables x(t). Then the object that the consumer chooses is a sequence of random variables t ct:\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a3l -&gt; R where each c^ is measurable with respect to s .",
