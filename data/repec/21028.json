        "For the purposes of simulating choices under the no inattention counterfactual, we can generate logit choice probabilities using the estimated demand model with frictions removed and sum across beneficiaries to generate market shares. The static nature of the choice problem makes this computation straightforward. For simulating choices under the baseline, the strong path-dependence implied by inattention makes simulating every possible path (of which there are K2006\u00c3\u0083\u00c6\u0092\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0094K2007\u00c3\u0083\u00c6\u0092\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0094K2008\u00c3\u0083\u00c6\u0092\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0094K2009 = A study by the Department of Health and Human Services Inspector General (Levinson (2011)34 ) found that, in 2009, rebates reduced Part D drug expenditures by 19% on average for the 100 highest-volume brand name drugs.
