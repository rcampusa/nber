Some transactions have missing data, and some judgments were necessary regarding tbe identitiesof producers (e.g.. individualproducers who appeared to be from tbe same family were aggregated), These data provide a rare opportunityto observe prices cbarged by each seller to each buyer. The difficulty, as usual in industrial organiration, is to define markets in an economically meaningfulmanner."
