        "16Williamson (1988, p. 114.) summarizes the rules as follows. Each participating country would have an endogenous target rate of growth of nominal income.... This would provide one intermediate target for each country. The other would be a target for the (real effective) exchange rate.... This set of (2n-l) intermediate targets would be pursued by the following set of assignment rules: (1) the average level of world interest rates [is dedicated to average nominal income growth]; (2) differences in interest rates among countries would be revised when necessary to prevent exchange rates from deviating from their target levels by more than, say, 10 percent; (3) national fiscal policies would be revised with a view to achieving national target rates of growth of nominal income."
