        "19. Extrapolations beyond small variations appear unwarranted. Evaluating the results at full compliance, for example, where Ho Complying = 100, gives an unreasonably large effect.",
        "18. Although it might seem odd to find zeroes in a Nationals accident series, remember that the HASS data are based on a sample of 20 hospitals, and that we aggregated them monthly by age group. Thus, a zero does not imply that there were no accidents anywhere in the United Kingdom. Rather, it reflects sampling error.",
        "17. We would expect the measured U.K accident rates to be lower because they exclude accidents outside the home and yard, which are included in the U.S. statistics.",
        "10. As in the U.S., age-specific estimates of bicycle use are not available.",
        "11. It is important to note that the descriptive sample characteristics do not use age specific estimates of bicycles in use, as these are, to our knowledge, not available. The heaviest use will almost certainly fall in the three youngest age categories. If, for example, each of these three groups used 25% of total bikes in use, the estimated mean rates would increase by a factor of four. We do not make such speculative adjustments here.",
        "5. The standard was challenged in court by a consumer group and two consumers, but with only a few minor exceptions, the standard was upheld.",
        "7. For the bicycle regulation we used product category 1202, bicycles or accessories.",
        "1. See U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (1989).",
        "3. The same conclusion is also true for other countries, such as the United Kingdom."
