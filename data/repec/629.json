        "In the main body of the paper they present evidence supportive of the usage of a Cobb-Douglas production function of this form (3). Kopcke (1980) argues that it is improper to include energy as an argument in the aggregate production function since energy is itself an intermediate product produced by capital and labor. This objection does not apply to imported petroleum which is produced by foreign labor and capital. Care must be taken, as seen below, however in going from the domestic output concept appropriate to the production function (3) to the value-added concept of real GNP. Unfortunately this last step has not been made in the three-factor analyses of the effects of oil-price changes."
