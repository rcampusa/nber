        "A Voter Turnout Data This study makes use of voter turnout estimates by gender to estimate the impact of females\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 electoral participation on school spending and resource trends. Precise data on the gender of 1920 voters are not available at the county level. Instead, we have county-level counts of total votes for every general election during this period (Clubb et al., 2006). We use Bayesian methods with informative priors to infer gender vote shares for each county, relying on total turnout statistics as well as demographic data from the U.S. Census. For each county i, we observe the number of voters Vi, the adult population Ni, and the gender composition xji, where j = 1, 2 indicates female and male groups, respectively.",
        "We start by modeling the number of voters Vi as a draw from a binomial distribution: Vi \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u0086\u00c2\u00bc bin (zi, Ni) , (3) where zi is the probability that an individual votes. That probability in turn is the weighted sum of the group-specific probabilities. It becomes: zi = x1ip1i + x2ip2i, (4) where p1i and p2i represent the probability that a female and male votes, respectively. Our goal is to find the posterior distributions that characterize pji for j = 1, 2 for the 1920 election.",
        "Our estimates indicate that female voter turnout rose over time. Figure 3 gives the estimated value of p1 between 1920 and 1940. Female turnout rates increased steadily through 1936 before falling somewhat in the 1940 election. B Extension: State Spending After Suffrage The analysis in this paper is limited to the provision of state and local education resources in three Southern states. The sample is thus limited in its ability to address the responses of counties other than those located in the three states included in our panel.",
        "Whether the three states in the panel are representative of the nation cannot be tested directly with county-level data from other states. We can, however, estimate the impact of female suffrage on state level education spending for these three states compared to the nation at large. We employ the same state-level finance data and socioeconomic control variables used by Lott & Kenny (1999) and Miller (2008) to replicate previous work estimating the effect of suffrage on state-level educational spending.40 We then go on to test whether the three sampled states reacted differently than the rest of the nation.",
        "To situate results with those of Lott & Kenny (1999) and Miller (2008), we estimate a dynamic fixed effects specification informed by both studies: ln(Yst) = \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b1 + SUFFRAGEst\u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b21 + SUFFRAGEst \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u0086\u00e2\u0080\u0094 THREESTATEs\u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b22 +Xst\u00c3\u008f\u00cb\u0086 + \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b8s + \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b1(t) + \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b8s\u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b1(t) + \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b8t + \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b5st, (5) where ln(Yst) is the natural log of states\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 per-capita education expenditures, SUFFRAGEst is a measure of suffrage treatment, THREESTATEs is an indicator equal to one for Alabama, Geor40 We thank Larry Kenny for graciously providing these data and associated documentation. State expenditure and revenue data from 1870-1915 were originally provided to Lott and Kenny by John Wallis.",
        "The principal threat to our basic difference-in-difference identification strategy is the possibility that areas with higher dosages of women\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s suffrage \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c that is, areas with higher female population shares \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c possess an inherent trend toward higher education spending regardless of women having the right to vote. If so, a difference-in-difference estimator could detect significant but biased shifts after 1920 in these locations.",
        "Second, we only observe literacy as of 1910, 1920, and 1930, so data for the last ten years of the panel must be extrapolated. Nevertheless, controlling for this imperfect measure of literacy has almost almost no bearing on point estimates. Column 6 results are nearly identical to baseline results in Column 1. C.2 Pre-treatment and Falsification Tests It remains possible that heterogeneous, unobserved, and endogenous trends are present and induced increases in education spending in high-dose counties, even in the absence of women\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s suffrage.",
        "To underscore the point that pre-suffrage conditions do not foretell post-suffrage outcomes, Figure 4 plots actual spending outcomes (dots) against projections (lines) from predicted values of Equation 8. Point estimates from the 1910-1920 model are fit to observed right-hand-side variables from 1921 and later. Solid lines trace average predictions (unweighted) across counties. The pre-suffrage model does a very poor job of fitting 1921 and later outcomes, greatly understating the path of each outcome\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s realized time series.45 Which is to say that \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c based on observable county characteristics, prevailing trends, and county fixed effects \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c post-suffrage school spending significantly exceeded expectations.",
        "To summarize robustness and falsification exercises, we find that results from the principal identification strategy are robust \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c with important caveats regarding economic significance \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c to denominator changes in the dependent variable and two alternative treatments of time-varying trends in the effect of other control variables. Moreover, pre-suffrage estimates of spending outcomes suggest that counties with more females were not on differential spending trajectories prior to the 19th Amendment. Overall, the evidence indicates that the 19th Amendment is responsible in part 45 Allowing for higher-ordered time trends exacerbates the poor performance of the pre-suffrage model. for post-1920 gains in educational spending, and that white students benefitted more than black students.",
        "D Event Study Estimates Other econometric tools are available to identify the effect in question in this paper. In particular, the post-1921 differential impact of women\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s suffrage dosage can be identified using an event study estimator. The event study estimator is conceptually similar to a difference-in-difference estimator, but the treatment effect is estimated in each year after the event in question. Pre-treatment effects are estimated as a falsification test.",
        "In this context, the event study estimator traces the impact of suffrage dose over time by replacing the POSTt \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u0086\u00e2\u0080\u0094 DF ct in Equation 1 with a set of interactions between year fixed effects and DF ct. For dosage, we utilize time-varying white female population shares (i.e., the dosage proxy from Table 5 results) and estimate the following: Yct = \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b40 + 1940 \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u0086\u00e2\u0080\u0098 \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00ba=1910 \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b4\u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00ba1(t = \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00ba) \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u0086\u00e2\u0080\u0094 DF c\u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00ba + \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b42DF ct + \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b8c + \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b8t + \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b2Xct + \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b5ct, (9) where variables are defined as for Equation 1 above. Each \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b4\u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00ba measures the suffrage treatment effect in that year. County fixed effects and year fixed effects account for variation in outcomes that are constant across counties or years.",
        "We present the point estimates for \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b41910 \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u0086\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b41940 when Yct represents per pupil expenditures in Panel A of Figure 5. Estimates are noisy, but the treatment effect of suffrage hovers around zero for 1910-1920 before beginning a steady upward climb. The treatment effect is consistently positive and frequently statistically significant after 1925, and reflects the increasingly important role of suffrage over time (also documented in Tables 4 - 6).",
        "Estimates of the suffrage treatment effect on white expenditures (Panel B of 5) follow a pattern similar to that for overall expenditures with statistically significant treatment effects in the 1930s.",
        "The annual treatment effect on black expenditures increases more slowly after 1921 and tapers off more quickly in the 1930s (Panel C). Point estimates in each case match those in the main results, which reflect and average effect across 1921-1940.",
        "Pre-1920 estimates serve as an important falsification test. Namely, as Figure 4 makes clear, school expenditures suffered substantially during the World War I era. If these reductions are some34 how related to the suffrage proxies incorporated in our analysis, the resulting estimates, although unbiased, are measuring not the impact of suffrage but, rather, the impact of having a particular population structure in the World War I years as captured by the proxies. Clearly this is not the effect of interest.",
        "Contrary to what we might expect if the World War I impact was correlated with suffrage dosage proxies, we observe no significant \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093effect\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d of suffrage in the pre-1920 years. The point estimates hew close to zero and show no particular deviation in the war years. This is consistent with the interpretation that the relationship between spending and the suffrage dosage proxies is attributable to suffrage per se. In short, event study estimates, although noisier than our main results, reflect a similar pattern of suffrage treatment effects on school expenditures in these three southern states.",
