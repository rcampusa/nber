        "END NOTES 1. See, for example, Hamilton (1990) which analyzes the effects of the MFA and its proposed reforms from a variety of viewpoints.",
        "2 This is the method used by Morkre (1984), for example, as well as by Trela and Whalley (1988, 1990.) 3. For example, Trela and Whalley (1988, 1990) compute the Hong Kong supply price by subtracting the quota price from the US price. They then compute the productiun costs of quota restricted products in other exporting countries by multiplying the unit cost in Hong Kong with the ratio of the exporting country's relative wage in the textile and apparel industry compared to Hong Kong. However, this approach assumes that the standard competitive model is the appropriate one, Krishna, Martin and Tan (1992) shows that this approach yields significant overestimates of actual license prices, casting into doubt all welfare calculations based on these estimates, as well as the standard static model on which this procedure is based.",
        "5. Textile Asia, March 1989, p.19. 6. We could also include U.S. costs of production as an explanatory variable since demand for Hong Kong apparel is defined as excess supply over supply from other sources, including the U.S. 7. In a competitive market, U.S. costs, given a license price, should not affect the supply of licenses, although they could affect the demand for licenses, as could the costs in other exporting countries. 8. The reference period is usually the most recent 12-month period for which shipment performance can be ascertained prior to the introduction of the restraint. 9. in the case of finished piece-goods, quotas are allocated on a 40/30130 basis among the exporter, the finisher and the weaver. In the case of finished fabrics manufactured using imported grey fabrics, quotas are allocated on a 50150 basis to the exporter and the finisher.",
