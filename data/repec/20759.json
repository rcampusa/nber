        "We obtained household rosters from each barangay captain, and we sorted households randomly then targeted the first listed households. Interviewers screened the first person they approached in the household. To be eligible for our study, the target respondent had to be between ages 20 and 45, and he or she must have not worked abroad in the past. Households that had current or past overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) were still eligible for the study. If the first household member was not eligible or did not want to participate in the survey, the interviewer asked if anyone else in the household might be eligible, and interviewed that person instead. We surveyed 5,008 individuals between March and August 2010, and 4,153 were ages 20-40.",
        "Passport follow-up (2011) In 2011, we launched the second stage of our project to provide some respondents with assistance obtaining a passport. We revisited a subset of our baseline sample. Specifically, of respondents ages 20-40, we included all who received the website treatment [T4], all Pilijobs.org enrollees in other treatment groups (32 respondents), 300 respondents randomly selected from each information treatment group ([T1], [T2], and [T1]+[T2]), and 300 respondents randomly selected from the control group. At the time of the passport survey, we also interviewed and offered passport assistance to a supplemental sample of Sorsogon Province residents who enrolled in Pilijobs.org through other means that we describe in the next section (A.2), but who were not a part of our baseline sample. We do not include these respondents in our analysis.",
        "However, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that all of the treatment effects are jointly zero.  A-5 A6.2013 supplementary survey of job-offer recipients At the time of the endline survey, 13.8% of those who had received overseas job offers but had not yet migrated reported that their migration was still pending (column 2, row 2, Table A8).",
        "One possibility we sought to examine was whether our endline survey took place too soon to capture migration effects. We conducted the endline survey from May through August 2012, which was between nine months and one year after we offered respondents passport assistance. Because the passport process was quite time-consuming, some respondents received their passports as late as three months before the endline survey, and they may not have yet had time to finish the migration process they initiated when we followed up with them.",
        "To address this concern, in March and April 2013 we re-surveyed respondents who reported that anyone in their household was offered a job overseas between 2010 and 2012, including those who had offers they had not yet accepted. We asked them about the status of the offers they listed in the endline survey, as well as any offers that were received but not listed in the endline survey, either because they were not reported or because the offer was received after the endline survey took place.",
        "Table A8: Reported reasons for not migrating, conditional on receiving an overseas job offer  Counts include all reported job offers respondents received from 2010-2012 that did not lead to migration, for which respondents reported why they did not migrate, as of the endline survey."
