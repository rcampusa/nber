        "In practice, there is some flexibility built into No Child Left Behind for states to define their own graduation standards. The law further states that Another definition, developed by the State and approved by the Secretary in the State plan (Title I Final Regulations, Sec. 200.19 (a)(I)(i)(B)) could also be employed. See Swanson (2003) for a detailed discussion of the implementation of NCLB graduation measures in each state.",
