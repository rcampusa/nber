NOT FOR PUBLICATION 7 Online Data Appendix 7.1 Student Level Variables Assignment to School and Grade A non-negligible number of students attended more than one schools and grades in each academic year. In order to ensure that results are not driven by students' self-selection into treatment schools, we assigned students to the first school and grade they were present in each academic year. If there are multiple schools and grades with the same attendance patterns, we assigned students to the school with the lowest alphanumeric order dbn and the the lowest grade.",
        "Assignment to Treatment or Control Students were assigned to treatment and control group if they attended treatment or control school, respectively, in the 2007-08 academic year. If students did not attend any school in New York City in September, they were not included in the sample. If there were more than one schools with the same attendance patterns, students were dropped from the sample. Treatment Variable in TOT regressions The fraction of an academic year spent in any treated school was calculated for each student, by taking the number of days spent in treated schools and dividing the number by the maximum number of days student could be present at a school. The treatment variable in TOT regressions was constructed by taking the cumulative years spent in treated schools. For example, if a student spent 0.9 year in treated schools in year 1, 0.8 in year 2, and 0.5 in year 3, his treatment variable would be 0.9 in year 1, 1.7 in year 2, and 2.2 in year 3.",
        "NYC DOE provided test score data that contained grade level, proficiency level, and scale test scores for each subject for academic years 2006-07 to 2009-10. We standardized scale scores to have mean zero and standard deviation one by grade level and by academic year over the full city sample. The 2006-07 academic year's ELA and math scale scores were included as control variables in all raw regressions, and the squared 2006-07 ELA and math scale scores were used in addition in all control regressions on the elementary and the middle school samples. The most recent 8th grade ELA and Math test scores taken before the 2007-08 academic year were constructed for high school students and similarly used as control variables in regressions on the high school sample.",
        "Regents Exam Scores New York State Department of Education requires high school students to pass a certain number of Regents examinations in core subjects to graduate and awards different levels of diplomas depending on the number of exams passed. For example, in order to earn a local diploma, a student who entered high school in 2007 would have to obtain 55 points or above in comprehensive English, mathematics, global history, U.S. history, and science Regents exams. To earn a Regents diploma, he would have to obtain 65 points or above in all subject areas mentioned above. Regents exams are administered in five subject areas - ELA, math, science, foreign language, and social studies - three times every year in January, June, and August. Students can choose when to take each subject exam, and they can also choose to satisfy regents requirements with approved alternative assessments such as the SAT subject tests.",
        "7.2 Teacher Level Variables Demographic Variables DOE provided Human Resources data, which contained teacher sex, race, date of birth, experience, and salary step, from academic years 2004-05 to 2009-10. Demographic variables, such as sex and race, were constructed and coded in the same way as student demographic variables. Teacher salary and years of teaching experience before the 2007-08 academic year were taken from the Human Resources data, and used as control variables in teacher level regressions, along with gender and race dummies.",
        "Teacher Value Added DOE provided multi-year teacher value added data, which contained TVA measured in standard deviation units in every classroom. Teacher value added measures the changes in student achievement attributable to classrooms controlling for a large set of student and classroom level variables18. We dropped TVA values in classrooms taught by more than one teachers or by teachers with blank IDs. TVA measures were standardized to have mean zero and standard deviation one by grade level over all classrooms in the city. If teachers taught multiple classrooms, the average of standardized teacher value added measures was taken across all classrooms taught in the academic year. The 2006-07 ELA and Math TVA values were used as control variables in all teacher level regressions.",
        "Teacher Absences DOE provided a supplement to teacher value added data containing teacher identifier, demographic characteristics such as gender, race, experience, and salary step, and personal or DOErelated cumulative absences in May of the academic year. We took the cumulative number of personal absences in May for 2007-08 and 2008-09 academic years. Teachers who left the system before May were set to have missing absences. For a detailed description of the model used to calculate teacher value added, please visit the NYC DOE's website.",
        "Progress Report Progress Report overall scores and sub-scores were obtained from the data files released on the DOE website. The overall scores and sub-scores were standardized by school type - Elementary, Middle, and High School - to have mean zero and standard deviation one each academic year. The progress report overall score and the squared overall score from the 2006-07 academic year was used as a control variable in all school-level regressions. Survey Results DOE posts school-level summary results for teacher, parent, and student learning environment surveys on its website. We took teacher survey response rates and subscores in the areas of academic expectations, communication, engagement, and safety and respect from the data files. The subscores were standardized by school level and by academic year to have mean zero and standard deviation one."
