For large companies (for which the payable credit rate is always zero), there are slight decreases in the corporate tax rate over 2006-12 (from 30% to 28% to 26%) coupled with slight",
        "increases in the enhancement rate (from 25% to 30%) over the same period. This resulted in a relatively stable tax-adjusted user cost of 0.190 throughout this period. It is therefore reasonable to use the baseline sample\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s average R&D over 2006-08 as a proxy for how much an average firm in the baseline sample would spend on R&D if it remained a large company over 2009-11, after the policy change. For SMEs, large increases in enhancement rate (from 50% to 75% to 100%) more than offset the slight decrease in corporate tax rate and payable credit rate (from 16% to 14% to 12.5%), leading to a steady reduction in SMEs\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 tax-adjusted user cost of R&D from 0.154 in 2006 to 0.141 in 2011.

        "Finally, as a robustness check, we also consider using the small profit rate (from 19% to 21% to 20% over 2006-11) instead of the main rate for corporate tax rate. As the tax deduction is less generous with a lower corporate tax rate, the resulting tax-adjusted user cost in the tax deduction case is higher for both SMEs and large companies and their gap is smaller in magnitude (average log difference over 2006-08 is -0.185 and over 2009-11 is-0.229).",

The fact that all the value for money ratios are well above unity indicates that the R&D Tax Relief Scheme is effective in inducing additional R&D at relatively low cost to the Exchequer.
