        "The most direct ancestor of European patent law, however, was the German Patent Act of 1877. This measure, the first patent law for the newly-unified German state, incorporated for the first time the \"first-to-file\" principle: patent awards should be granted not to the party who first makes a discovery, but to the one whose patent application is received first in the patent office. Another distinctive feature\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dthe publication of pending applications\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dwas not introduced until much later. In 1964, the Dutch patent office began unilaterally publishing patent applications (in Dutch) 18 months after they were filed, whether or not they had been examined yet. The German and Japanese governments, arguing that they did not want to put their researchers at a disadvantage, rapidly followed suit.",
        "A much more far-reaching reform was called for by the Convention for the European Patent for the Common Market. This agreement was signed in 1975, amended in 1985 and 1989, but has not yet implemented. The convention called for the EPO to award a single, European Community-wide patent. These awards would be enforceable in regional patent courts run by the European Community, with a centralized appellate court that would have the final say in all disputes. This effort to create a truly pan-European patent system, however, was only ratified by three countries, in the two decades after it was originally negotiated (Paterson, 1995). The likelihood that it will be implemented in the near future appears low.",
        "Particularly after World War II, the Japanese aggressively incorporated elements of foreign patent laws that they felt would help their industries \"catch up\" with technological leaders overseas. Among the key features were: \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2 the weaker novelty requirements of the American patent law, introduced in 1959. (By way of contrast, in many European nations, a single scientific publication is sufficient to disqualify a patent application.) \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2 the Dutch and German practice of publishing patent applications eighteen months after filing, first allowed in 1971.",
        "\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2 the American system for protecting chemical products, introduced in 1986.",
        "While these features were adapted from elsewhere, the Japanese system in practice was quite unique. In particular, the Japanese Patent Office (JPO) granted until 1988 only very narrow patents, typically with only one claim. This enabled firms to engage in a practice known as \"patent flooding\": the filing of numerous very narrow patents around the edges of a rival's patent (or application). Furthermore, firms could file oppositions to rival's patent applications before they were granted. The competitor's patent would not issue until this lengthy procedure was resolved.",
        "The prosecution of infringements of one's patents was also ineffective. A U.S. General Accounting Office survey (1993) estimated that patent cases took between 50 percent and 300 percent longer to be resolved in Japan than in the United States. Cases were frequently heard in a series of up to several dozen brief hearings, each punctuated by a break of several months. Judges often exerted strong pressure on the parties to settle. Meanwhile, the courts, lawyers, and even expert witnesses charged fees to the plaintiffs in patent cases as a percentage of the damages claimed. This led plaintiffs to be more cautious in making damages claims. Over the course of the 1980s, these features of the Japanese patent system led to increasing protests by U.S. firms.",
        "Formal negotiations over these issues were begun as part of the Structural Impediments Initiative (SII) talks in July 1989. These negotiations were designed to address a wide variety of impediments to free trade. The discussion of intellectual property issues in the joint report a year later, however, was confined to a general recommendation to speed the processing of patents through the JPO.",
        "Two additional agreements were signed in 1994. In January 1994, Japan agreed to allow U.S. firms to file patent applications in English, as long as they were promptly translated into Japanese. (The United States already allowed Japanese applicants the reciprocal privilege.) The United States agreed in turn to implement the just-signed GATT agreement. In August 1994, Japan agreed to: \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2 allow applicants to request accelerated patent examinations. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2 abandon the system of pre-grant oppositions (all other developed countries with this system, such as Germany, had previously abandoned it). \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2 streamline the hearings on oppositions filed after the patent was awarded. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2 stop threatening firms that refused to license patents with compulsory patent licenses to rivals.",
        "These moves have been criticized by observers, however, for their emphasis on changing the process of the Japanese Patent Office, rather than the substance of the examination and enforcement process. Many observers have argued that the reforms to date are unlikely to have much real impact. A.1.3 International Efforts A desire to establish a worldwide approach to patent awards inspired extended negotiations in the 1960s. [This section is based on Chaudhry and Walsh (1995), Tripp and Stokley (1995), and Wegner (1993, 1996).] These led in turn to the 1970 Patent Cooperation Treaty. This agreement systematized the timing of international patent filings, and made it easier to file for awards in multiple countries. Its impact on the differing structure of patent examination procedures and awards, however, was quite minimal (Cartiglia, 1994; Peterson, 1993).",
        "More recent harmonization efforts started in 1984, when diplomatic efforts were begun by the United Nations' World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). In a series of meetings over the course of the 1980s, diplomats strove to design a workable framework for a global intellectual property protection system.",
        "The fruits of these negotiations was the draft patent harmonization treaty released in December 1990. Among the key features of the proposed agreement were that applicants would have a grace period, as today, to file for international patent protection. They would only be required, however, to file a single application (in the inventor's native language, and later in English translation). The patent applications would be reviewed by a central office, which would include examiners from the various nations. The patent applications would be published eighteen months after the original application date.",
        "The WIPO effort foundered, however, after encountering resistance from several nations, who objected to changing their patent systems to correspond to the proposed treaty. Particularly detrimental was Commerce Secretary Ron Brown's announcement in January 1994 that the United States would not abandon the \"first-to-file\" requirement. (The decision was made despite a largely favorable recommendation from the President's Advisory Committee on Patent Law Reform in 1992.) Since then, the WIPO effort has been largely dormant.",
        "At the same time as the examiner assigns the patent to U.S. patent subclasses, he also assigns it to one or more International Patent Classification (IPC) subclasses. The IPC system had its origin in the Council of Europe's 1954 \"European Convention on the International Classification of Patents for Invention.\" The classification has been managed by an international (rather than a purely European) agency since 1969. Since that year, U.S. patents have been classified according to both the U.S. and IPC schemes (WIPO, 1981).",
        "Thus, the IPC scheme reflects the economic importance of new inventions, as opposed to the technical focus of the U.S. scheme. Finally, the first four levels of the IPC classifications are nested. This is in contrast with the U.S. system, where 435/40 is a subset of 435/39, which is in turn a subclass of 435/34, but 435/41 is not a subclass of any of these (USPTO, 1993)."
