        "Classification into experience groups: Following Bonjas (2003), OP define the workers into experience groups by assuming that high school dropouts enter the labor market at age 17, high school graduates at age 19, persons with some college at age 21, and college graduates at age 23, and define work experience as the workers age at the time of the survey minus the assumed age of entry into the labor market. They restrict the analysis to persons who have between 0 and 40 years of experience. Workers are classified into one of 8 experience groups: 04 years, 5-9, 10-14, 15-19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, and 35-40."
