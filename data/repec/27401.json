The specification is Equation 3/Table 6. The lower panel only plots the coefficient on Exposure to epidemic (18-25) whereas the upper panel plots the sum of the coefficients on Exposure to epidemic (18-25) and its interaction with bottom quartile government strength dummy. Confidence intervals are at 95% significance level.",
        "Wellcome Global Monitor The Wellcome Global Monitor (WGM) is a nationally representative survey fielded in some 160 countries in 2018. It is the first global survey of how people think and feel about key health and science challenges, including attitudes towards vaccines; trust in doctors, nurses and scientists. WGM also provides information on respondents\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 demographic and labor market characteristics. We use the Wellcome Global Monitor (WGM) to explore the mechanisms underlying our findings, and specifically whether these run through attitudes and feeling about the public health response to epidemics.",
        "Government Policy Responses We rely on the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) for information on public policy responses to the outbreak (Thomas et al., 2020). Specifically, we use the information on the following responses: (i) closing of schools and universities; (ii) workplace closures; (iii) public event cancellations; (iv) closing of public transport; (v) restrictions on internal movement. We again gather these data for the period between January 1, and March 31, 2020.",
