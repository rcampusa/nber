The new bank received an infusion of capital contributions from the BOJ. This rescue plan was heavily criticized and received opposition in the metropolitan congress given that the management of the bank had been involved in fraudulent activity. The use of government funds to rescue an institution that had failed because of fraud was questioned, even though management was purged and prosecuted.

Ruling and opposition parties clashed on the public bailout of Long-Term Credit Bank (LTCB was nationalized in October 1998). On the international front, the Russian financial crisis erupted in August, raising uncertainty and weakening the global economic outlook.",
        "June 2000: The ruling parties took a big loss at the Lower House elections (reduction in their share from 66 to 56 percent; the LDP lost the majority) due to PM Mori\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s unpopularity, but they maintained the government.",
        "February-March 2001: The BOJ cut the policy rate by 10 bps from 0.25 to 0.15 percent on February 28. Discussion intensified on quantitative easing as the policy rate neared the zero lower bound. On March 19, the BOJ introduced QE (switching the monetary policy target from the overnight call rate to the current account balance). PM Mori&apos;s approval rate had been on the decline and went below 10 percent partly because he mishandled a maritime accident in February. He was reported in March to resign soon (Mr. Koizumi replaced him after winning the LDP presidency in April).",
        "July 2001: PM Koizumi won the Upper House election. PM Koizumi&apos;s administrative reform triggered debate between fiscal consolidation and fiscal expansion. PM Koizumi was transforming traditional decision-making process. One key pillar was his heavy usage of the Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy (CEFP) to discuss big-picture policy issues. The CEFP produced its first annual report, Honebuto-no-Hoshin (big-boned principles), on June 26.",
        "October 2002: Conflict intensified between Koizumi administration and LDP regarding NPL issues. PM Koizumi dismissed the Minister of State for Financial Services, Hakuo Yanagisawa, and appointed Heizo Takenaka. Minister Takenaka submitted the Financial Revitalization Plan (known as the Takenaka Plan), which forced banks to apply a stricter approach for asset evaluation, to raise banks reserves and to compress deferred tax assets. If banks were evaluated as insolvent, public money was injected (e.g. Resona Bank and Ashikaga Bank). This plan was regarded as a hard landing scenario for the financial sector, and was opposed by LDP and the banking industry. The BOJ eased monetary policy by increasing the current account balances from JPY 10-15 trillion to 15-20 trillion, and by raising long-term JGB purchases from JPY 1 trillion to 1.2 trillion per month.",
        "March 2008: The Twisted Diet produced two large uncertainties. First, the government was trying to pass a tax law on gasoline before the end of the fiscal year (March), but eventually failed. Second, the nomination of the BOJ Governor was rejected a few times. Deputy Governor Masaaki Shirakawa became Acting Governor on March 20 and then Governor on April 9.",
        "September-October 2008: The global financial crisis \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093started\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d with the bankruptcy of the Lehman Brothers in September 2008. The Japanese economy shrank by 12.4 and 15.4 percent (saar) in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009, respectively. The Nikkei plummeted to below 7,000 from around 12,000 before the bankruptcy; the yen appreciated from around 120 in 2007 to 93 per dollar by end-2009. The global economy collectively and individually responded: the first G20 Summit took place in November 2008 in Washington, D.C. The Japanese government formulated two supplementary budgets in October 2008 and January 2009. The BOJ reduced the policy rate twice in October and December 2008.",
        "February 2009: The government published its estimate of growth of the fourth quarter of 2008 at negative 12.4 percent, the largest decline in about 35 years. The yen depreciated by around 10 percent. The US formulated a stimulus package, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, after long discussions in the Congress. The rise in uncertainty seems to reflect concerns over the delay in the passage of the stimulus package in the US.",
        "May-June 2010: The European sovereign debt crisis, which had been brewed since the fiscal deficit of Greece was found much larger than previously published, accelerated in May 2010, when the first plan to rescue Greece was announced. The Nikkei lost more than 10 percent in May. The yen-dollar rate briefly went below 90. Also domestically, PM Hatoyama resigned in June less than a year after his party took power for the first time. Anticipation of a Twisted Diet as a result of the July Upper House elections seems to have contributed to the rise in economic policy uncertainty.",
        "June 2012: The three major parties including the ruling DPJ and the largest opposition party, LDP, accelerated discussions on a comprehensive reform of tax and social security systems in June. They reached an agreement on the 21st, which included a two-step consumption tax increase in April 2014 and October 2015. Leading up to the agreement, policy uncertainty was elevated reflecting conflicts within DPJ on tax and social security reform.",
        "While the postponement of the tax hike was received well by the public, it also led to significant uncertainty about the feasibility of achieving the government\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s primary balance goal by 2020.",
        "November 2016-January 2017: Leading up to the elections in the US in November, policy uncertainty picked up reflecting the significant role of the US as a major trading partner and the potential implications of the election for the ratification of TPP. The election of Donald Trump came as a surprise and generated further uncertainty about the US fiscal, trade and other policies during the period immediately following the election. President Trump pulled the US out of TPP on January 23rd , 2017."
