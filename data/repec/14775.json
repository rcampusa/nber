        "32California implemented class size reduction beginning in 1996-97 at a cost of up to $850 per student.

However, evaluating the program is fraught with empirical difficulties. See CSR Research Consortium (2002). 33Source: NCES, US Dept of Education. how are they doing? RAND Education Report.",
