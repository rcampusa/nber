Footnotes The assumption that foreigners hold only the foreign asset is common in portfolio balance models. If relaxed, a two-country model would be needed. If, in that context, the assumption were made that each country&apos;s residents preferred their own asset, the results would be similar to the present model.",
        "Allowing foreign assets to pay an exogenously determined rate of interest, as in Dornbusch and Fischer (1980), does not affect the theoretical results. Since the model contains no interest bearing assets, it can be considered a currency substitution model in the sense used by Calvo and Rodriguez (1977). We call it a portfolio balance model becuase the term currency substitution has come to imply trade in currencies in addition to other assets. It is assumed that the ri&apos;s are not contemporaneously correlated."
