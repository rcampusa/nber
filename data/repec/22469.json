(Data are unavailable by age and skill level, so this likely underestimates the degree of turnover for our population of interest.) If we conservatively assume (1) a 5.5% monthly separation rate for the jobs held by young, low-skilled black men, and (2) that BTB reduces hiring rates for this population by 7%, then we would expect a 5% reduction in employment within 14 months. This is in line with our results from Table 8.",
