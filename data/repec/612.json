        "For certain combinations of rates of increase for an individual's risk and heterogeneity among individuals' risk, there will be no change in observed loss rates over time. Shepard (1977) examined the special case of an exponential increase in the individual's loss rate (at rate k per year) and a gamma distribation for initial loss rates among individuals (with scaling parameter 3). There is an infinite number of pairs (where k equals 3) for which the two effects precisely balance.",
        "A factor extraneous to our analysis\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dthe eligibility of patients and classification of deaths (Kolata 1980)\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dhas created a further complication in assessing the validity of this particular experiment; we shall leave this problem aside and assume all classifications are correct.",
        "Various studies have shown that practically all (96 percent) of lobar pneumonia is pneumococcal (Heffron 1979, pp. 1-2). Moreover, the other major type of pneumonia, bronchopneumonia, is believed to have a similar case fatality rate (Heffron 1979, p. 304).",
        "In computing the entries for the table, the odds ratio (approximately equal to the risk ratio) for the risk indicator other chronic disease for all causes of death was taken to be five. This is the ratio Shepard (1977) found applied to survivors of a heart attack compared to the general population of the same age and sex, and the ratio Fitzpatrick, Neutra, and Gilbert (1977) used for high-risk candidates for gall bladder surgery. The risk ratio for the treatment, vaccination, was taken to be 1.012. This ratio is calculated as one plus the product of the share of deaths due to pneumococcal pneumonia (39,600/2,000,000) times the percentage of pneumococcal pneumonias due to valences in the vaccine (75 percent) times the efficacy of the vaccine against included valences (80 percent) in the OTA (1979) study.",
        "See for example PIiskin, Shepard, and Weinstein (1980).",
        "Our fitting procedure did not prevent the mortality rates in the two risk groups from crossing. It so happened with the best-fitting parameters that the mortality of the weak risk group actually fell below that of the normal risk group in the last decade (between 1960 and 1970). The mortality of the weak group could have been constrained not to fall below that of the normal group with little degradation of the fit.",
        "The equation is: m(x,y) = (.1335x2 + .1259xy + .0197y2 - 1.4771x - ,9543y + 9.4501)e'6848x, where m(x,y) is mortality force per thousand per year, x = yg (age-30) is age decade, and y = yg (year-1870) is calendar decade. There is no unequivocal methodology by which one should compare two quite dissimilar models. That ours, with its logical underpinnings, outperformed the polynomial formulation is reassuring. The triumph is perhaps enhanced because this was the only functional form that was tried for our model."
