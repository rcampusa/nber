We then use the second identifier in the CCP data, an individual identifier that remains constant from period to period, to link household records from one quarter to another. To construct the longitudinal household record, we proceed as follows. Let i denote the identification number of a household in 2001. To identify the continuation of household i in year t, t &gt; 2001, we first determine what members of household i are present in year t using individual identifiers.",

If there is a unique household to which these members belong in year t and the new household does not have any members from any other household in year 2001, we identify this new household as a continuation record for household i. While the primary sample of individuals in the CCP is a random sample of all U.S. households with credit reports; the resulting sample of the households is not random. Following, Lee and van der Klaauw (2010) we define the sampling weights as the inverse of the probability to be included in the sample, . , where N is the number of individuals in the household who are in the primary sample.",
        "Variable Descriptions Here we provide a short description of the variables used in the CCP analysis. For a detailed description of the CCP dataset please see Lee and van der Klaauw (2010).",
        "APPENDIX C: DECOMPOSING U.S. INEQUALITY SINCE 1970 The decomposition is constructed using the following IPUMS samples: 1970, 1980, and 1990 1% metro samples and the 2000 1% unweighted sample. Within each of these samples we use the metro area geographies defined by IPUMS in the following way: \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00c5\u0093Metropolitan areas are counties or combinations of counties centering on a substantial urban area. METAREA identifies the metropolitan area where the household was enumerated, if that metropolitan area was large enough to meet confidentiality requirements.\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u009d We restrict the sample to the set of metro areas that can be identified in each year to get 117 metro areas containing roughly 60% of the entire sample within each year. We also restrict the sample to households where the respondent\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s age is between 25 and 65 and the respondent is the head of the household or the spouse of the head of the household. These restrictions are not important for the results.",
        "To calculate income we use family total income. While not exactly the same as household income it is available for all years whereas household income is not available in 1970. We estimate the following model of log family income on each year of the sample: log Estimating this function gives estimates of the variance of the fixed effects and the variance of the residuals for each year. We then calculate the share of variance explained by variance of the fixed effects as:  APPENDIX FIGURE C1: DECOMPOSING AGGREGATE U.S. INEQUALITY Note: The left-hand figure plots the ratio of \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00c5\u0093between\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u009d variance of mean incomes to the total variance of incomes. The right-hand figure plots the standard deviation of log income across all households. 54",
        "The figure reported below shows a high degree of correlation between inequality in 1970 and inequality in 2000. The R-squared is 0.26 and the Spearman correlation is 0.52, suggesting inequality is quite persistent.",
        "APPENDIX FIGURE C3: PERSISTENCE OF LOCAL INEQUALITY Note: The figure plots Gini coefficients for income inequality in U.S counties in 1970 versus 2000. 55",
        "The health of the mortgage market can be traced out by changes in the sample size. The number of applications reported peaked in 2007 and then declined steadily until 2011. Interestingly, the fraction of loans with high interest rates has also declined sharply, probably reflecting fewer loans with junior liens.",
        "Notice that the mean applicant income reported in the HMDA data is substantially higher than the average household income reported in the SCF data and the imputed CCP data. However, average income is comparable to the average income of homeowners as reported in the 2007 SCF, which is about $99,500.",
        "Table 2 provides some sample correlations from 2007, most of which are qualitatively similar to other years. Owner-occupied applications are less likely to be denied while applications with high LTI ratios are more likely to be denied. Applicants applying to HUD-regulated lenders are more likely to be denied, which could reflect the stress of mortgage companies in this period or an increased likelihood that the applicant is subprime. Applicants to HUD lenders tend to have smaller incomes and higher LTI ratios. 56",
        "Table 2 shows that using data from 2001 the aggregate income statistics computed directly from the SCF match those we impute in the CCP very closely."
