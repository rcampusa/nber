        "For example, John Hancock Financial Services (2004) finds that nearly one-half of defined contribution plan participants report that they have little or no investment knowledge and fewer than 20% consider themselves relatively knowledgeable. Moreover, many respondents think that employer stock is less risky than a stock fund.",
        "These figures are based on authors\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 tabulations from the 2001 Survey of Consumer Finances and are consistent with Aizcorbe, Kennickell, and Moore (2003). Throughout the paper, terms such as \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093state of birth\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d or \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093birth state\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d refer to the state in which an individual resided when they applied for a Social Security number. The panel was developed as a joint effort between the Treasury Department\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s Office of Tax Analysis and the IRS\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s Statistics of Income division. The panel uses confidential records and is not publicly available.",
        "Low-income households are not required to file returns, but many do so to claim a refund of over-withholding or a refundable tax credit such as the EITC. In 1987, the filing threshold ranged from $4,400 to $10,000, depending on age and filing status. We use appropriate sampling weights when reporting all tabulations and descriptive statistics.",
