(2018a).",
        "We convert the credit report variable for bankruptcy filings from a flow into a stock by defining a cumulative indicator variable based on whether the individual has filed for bankruptcy since entering the sample in 2002. This allows the event study specification to exploit variation in the timing of the hospitalization to identify the effect of the hospitalization on the likelihood of filing for bankruptcy.",

We define those hospitalized between January 2003 through December 2004 as facing the pre-BAPCPA bankruptcy code and hospitalizations between October 2005 through December 2007 for the post-BAPCPA sample. Most hospitalization-induced bankruptcies occur in the first 18 months following the hospitalization. In order to limit the impact of intertemporally substituted bankruptcies filed during the rush-to-file period just before BAPCPA went into effect, we limit the pre-BAPCPA sample to those hospitalized by the end of 2004. Any individuals hospitalized in or after October 2005 faced the post-BAPCPA bankruptcy code. C Appendix Tables"
