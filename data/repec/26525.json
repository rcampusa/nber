        "Additive separability requires that upwardly and downwardly mobile job movers have a proportional markup or markdown. We find plausible evidence for additive separability by examining changes in mean log earnings of upwardly and downwardly mobile workers in Figure A.1. We follow Card et al. (2013) by categorizing firms into four quartiles based on \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b8\u00c3\u008c\u00e2\u0080\u009aj. Clearly, employer identity matters for earnings determination of workers that change firms: the same workers who move from lowerquartile to higher-quartile firms, despite having the same fixed skills, receive an earnings boost. The most upwardly mobile workers experience larger earnings increases than less upwardly-mobile ones, and likewise the most downwardly mobile workers exhibit earnings penalties of greater magnitudes than the less-downwardly mobile.",
        "Note: The variance estimates arise from the estimated coefficients obtained by estimating equation 1 on the universe of workers in the largest AKM connected set subject to different sample restrictions. Specifically, whether observations for the comparison group or displaced workers (before displacement) described in section 3.2 are included when estimating AKM via equation 1. The share of the variance explained by each component is denoted in italics below its listed variance. The decompositions also include covariances between worker and employer fixed effects and year fixed effects. Since they explain around 1 percent of the variation, they are omitted from the table. Lachowska et al. (2018)\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s sample covers 2002-2014, while ours cover 1999-2012.",
        "Panel B compares non-layoff firms to firms that had multiple layoffs during 2002-2008. Panel C compares non-layoff firms to firms whose first layoff came in 2008. Panel D compares non-layoff firms to manufacturing firms that had layoffs in 2002-2008.",
        "In Table B.8, we consider several plausible hour-wage decompositions of overall earnings losses to inform estimates of (i) long-run total hourly wage losses for Ohio displaced workers and (ii) the proportion attributable to firm pay premiums for plausible hour-wage decompositions of overall earnings losses. We posit that long-run wage losses are between 13-18% for the Ohio sample, considerably larger than the 4.9% [1.3%] long-run hourly wage losses documented by Lachowska et al. (2018) for long [short] tenured workers.",
        "Lachowska et al. (2018) accurately captures this quantity by running AKM on the log of hourly wages (rather than total earnings) and using those resulting pay premiums in the JLSAKM framework. Due to our data limitations, we instead assume the variance in firm fixed effects \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b8\u00c3\u008c\u00e2\u0080\u009aj reflects only employer-specific differences in hourly pay (and not hours worked). This (strong) assumption allows us to obtain the share of long run wage losses explained by forfeited firm-specific pay premiums from the quotient of the share of earnings losses explained by firm premiums and the share of losses due to lower wages (last column of Table B.8). We estimate firm-pay premiums explain between 29% and 38% of displaced workers\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 wage losses after four years.",
        "Lachowska et al. (2018) conclude firm premiums only account for 17% of long-run wage scarring in their sample. Interestingly, the authors estimate that while displaced workers clock roughly 5% fewer hours compared to their pre-displacement schedules, they find re-employment at firms with policies compelling employees to work more hours relative to their layoff employer (see Table A.1 of Lachowska et al. (2018)). However, the assumption in Table B.8 is that there are no work-hour policy differences between employers. In other words, firm fixed effects from an AKM regression on the log of hours (which cannot be run with our limited Ohio data) would explain none of the difference in hours worked between employees. Thus, if the results of Lachowska et al. (2018) for hours worked holds in Ohio, the reported estimates in column 5 of Table B.8 are understated."
