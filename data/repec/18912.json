A Proofs A.1 Proof of Lemma 1 The first derivative of \u00c3\u008e\u00e2\u0080\u009c(g) is: \u00c3\u008e\u00e2\u0080\u009c [g] = E De\u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b1gD E [e\u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b1gD] , which is positive since D is positive. The second derivative is: \u00c3\u008e\u00e2\u0080\u009c [g] = \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b1 E D2e\u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b1gD E e\u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b1gD \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u0086\u00e2\u0080\u0099 E De\u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b1gD 2 E [e\u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b1gD]2 . The numerator is positive since, by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have E De\u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b1gD 2 = E De\u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b1g/2D e\u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b1g/2 &lt; E D2 e\u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b1gD E e\u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b1gD . The denominator is positive as well. We thus obtain that \u00c3\u008e\u00e2\u0080\u009c (g) > 0 as claimed."
