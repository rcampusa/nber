To see this, suppose that the probability of revocation (\u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b8) is fixed. If the regulator can choose how rights will be reallocated after expropriation, then her objective function would be maximized by giving rights back to current owners if \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b3 &lt; 1. If all owners, current and future, have the same influence over the regulator (i.e. \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b3 = 1), then the regulator would be indifferent between giving the resource rights back to its current owners or reallocating among some new set of users. Though both of these effects would (under reasonable conditions) cause the regulator to increase extraction rates, so this observation seems to further strengthen our regulatory capture finding.",

A Predicting Catch Shares and Timing of Adoption There could be concern about endogenous treatment, as individual fisheries could influence whether or not Catch Shares are implemented. In this appendix we show specifications that use our observed data to predict 1) whether a fishery eventually adopts Catch Shares, and 2) the timing of adoption. We find that these are unlikely to pose an endogenous treatment concern in the fishery setting.",
        "The last two columns show OLS estimates of the timing of Catch Share adoption. Conditional on eventually adopting Catch Shares, the dependent variable is the number of years (from 1980) until the fishery adopts Catch Shares. While it is clear empirically that an individual fishery does not transition to Catch Shares only when its biomass is critically low (half of the fisheries transition to Catch Shares when relative biomass is high), these results suggest that the observable characteristics in a pre-treatment year do a poor job of predicting the adoption of Catch Shares."
