This table presents summary statistics for the premia in FRN prices measured relative to Treasury bills and Treasury notes. The premia are computed as the difference between the yield on the replicating portfolios using matched-maturity Treasury bills or notes and the yield on the swapped FRN. Yield differences are measured in basis points. A positive yield difference implies that the yield on the replicating portfolio is higher than the yield on the swapped FRN. Std Dev denotes the standard deviation. N denotes the number of observations. The sample period is daily from January 31, 2014 to March 29, 2018.",
        "On February 3, 2014, the spread on a Treasury bill basis swap to swap quarterly floating Treasury bill cash flows into three-month Libor cash flows is FB = 25.970 basis points. Since Treasury bill basis swaps pay cash flows calculated from the secondary market 13-week T-bill rate and Treasury FRN pay cash flows calculated from the auction high yield of the most recently issued 13-week T-bill, we adjust the market swap rate by the average difference between the secondary market and auction high yields during the period from 2009 to January 2014 of 0.226 basis points. We note, however, that this adjustment is very robust to the choice of estimation window. Thus, the spread on the Treasury bill basis swap is 26.196 basis points.",
        "On February 3, 2014, the fixed rate on a two-year Libor interest rate with quarterly cash flows that matches the maturity of the FRN is FL = 43.260 basis points. By entering into both swaps, we swap the quarterly floating rate cash flows from the Treasury FRN into fixed cash flows at a fixed rate of F = 17.064 basis points. As a result, the investor receives a quarterly net cash flow of S + F = 17.064 + 4.563 = 21.63 cents per $100 notional. Since Treasury FRNs pay quarterly cash flows and Treasury Notes have semiannual cash flows, we reannuitize the quarterly coupon cash flows to semiannual coupon cash flows. The equivalent semiannual coupon rate is 21.793 basis points. Since, the swapped floating rate note is equivalent to a semiannual fixed rate bond, we can calculate its yield to maturity of 21.591 basis points using standard methods.",
        "On February 3, 2014, the matched-maturity two-year 0.375 percent Treasury note (Cusip 912828B41) has a price of 100.15625 with accrued interest of 0.0031077. It has a yield to maturity of 29.626 basis points. The yield difference between the swapped FRN and the matched-maturity Treasury note is 8.035 basis points which implies that the FRN trades at a premium relative to the Treasury note.",
        "Our data on floating and fixed rate corporate debt consist of 38 matchedmaturity pairs of two-year floating/fixed rate corporate notes during the 2014 to 2018 period from Amgen, Apple, Berkshire Hathaway, Caterpillar, Chevron, CVS Health, Daimler, Discovery, Ford Motor, Gilead Sciences, Honeywell, HP, Honda Motor, IBM, Met Life, PepsiCo, Shire, Toyota, Walmart, and Wells Fargo. We identified these corporate notes in the Bloomberg system by searching for floating rate corporate debt that was issued with two years to maturity during our sample between 2014 and 2018 and for which there was a fixed rate note with the same maturity. This criterion helps us to identify corporate debt that is similar in terms of time to maturity and issuance dates to our set of Treasury FRNs.",
        "Table A2 Summary Statistics for Treasury Bill Basis Swaps. This table presents summary statistics for Treasury bill basis swaps. Treasury bill basis swaps exchange the floating 13-week Treasury bill market rate plus a spread F for three-month Libor on a quarterly basis over the life of the contract. The spread F is annualized and measured in basis points. The column titled Months to Maturity lists the tenors of the basis swap contracts in months. The columns titled Mean, Median, Min and Max show the average, median, smallest, and largest spreads F over the sample period. The column titled Std Dev shows the sample standard deviation of F. N denotes the number of observations. The sample period is daily from January 2014 to March 2018."
