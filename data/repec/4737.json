        "We have also run the regression with a specification similar to that in Black(1989). The result is as follows (standard errors are in parentheses): psprd, = 0.0276 + 7.50 is4/volume, + 3.277isd,+ 0.000I7voIume, (0.0108) (22.69) (1.979) (0.00015) adj.R2=0.034 DW=2.35 This result is close to those in the text. In particular, the volume variable enters with a positive sign. Qualitatively similar results are obtained when one-period lagged value of the volume variable is used or a subsample excluding observations from overlapping contracts is used."
