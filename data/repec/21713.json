        "The first systematic recognition and treatment in the United States appears to have been Wayland\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s (1837) political economy text.",

        "Data on the average workweek are from Vandenbroucke (2009) for 1830-1890, from the Historical Statistics of the United States for 1900-1970, and from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for 1980-2012. See Gordon (forthcoming), Ch. 8, for a detailed discussion of the changes over time in the United States. Data on occupations are from the Historical Statistics of the United States.",
        "See, for example, Putnam (2000), Ch. 5. Data on median family income are from the Bureau of the Census.",
        "Some part of the difference between the growth of output per capita and of median family income reflects the fact that family size has shrunk over this period, and therefore does not properly bear on the argument here. But the difference is not great in this context. Between 1947 and 2012 the average number of persons per family in the United States fell from 3.67 to 3.13 (data are from the Current Population Survey). With adjustment for family size, the growth of real median family income over this period would produce a multiple of 4.6 over a hundred years \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c more than for the raw data, but still well below the trajectory of real output per capita.",
        "In 1973 the average number of persons per family was 3.48. With adjustment for the smaller size of families, the realized growth between 1973 and 2012 would produce a multiple of 1.5 over one hundred years \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c somewhat larger than without the family size adjustment, but still far from even doubling.",
        "In 1973 female participation in the labor force was 44.7 percent; by 2012 it was 57.7 percent.",
        "(The peak, in 1999, was 60.0 percent.) Much of this increase, however, was offset by declining male labor force participation: from 78.8 percent in 1973 to 70.2 percent in 2012. As Figure 2 shows, there was also some modest further decline in average hours worked per week. But the main reason for the slower rise of real family incomes was the decline in real hourly wages.",
        "Data on real hourly wages are from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, adjusted (slightly) to correct for a series break at 1966.",
        "See Elsby et al. (2013) on the United States and Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014) on the decline of the labor share as a global phenomenon. A large literature has developed suggesting explanations for this development.",
        "In the United States the number of people participating in the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093food stamps\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d) was roughly stable at 20-25 million until the 2007-9 financial crisis, but since then it has nearly doubled. By contrast, publicly provided housing has shrunk relative to the growing population. Medicaid (the main medical care program for the indigent) has increased enormously in cost, but it is not obvious that recipients feel better off because their medical care costs more.",
        "Lebergott (1993), for example, has made this argument.",
        "The 1902 Edition of the Sears, Roebuck Catalogue (New York: Gramercy Books, 1993).",
        "The modern literature on the role of habit formation in consumption preferences is large. For two early contributions, see Constantinides (1990) and Campbell and Cochrane (1999). Data on telephone penetration are from the Historical Statistics of the United States.",
        "Frey and Osborne (2013), for example, emphasize this aspect of the shift to service-sector employment.",
        "See especially Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2014). Tax payments also come from citizens\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 incomes, of course, and so apart from distributional consequences there would be little point, in the context of this discussion, of taxing the median earner\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s income in order to fund public-sector demand that creates employment for the median worker. But the tax revenues would largely come from those citizens who already have highincome jobs, while the jobs created \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c in rebuilding the nation\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s infrastructure, for example \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c would presumably be taken by those who don\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2t."
