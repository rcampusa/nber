I will focus mostly on investment in capital equipment, but the same issues also arise in labor markets, as Dornbusch (1987) has pointed out.

Bernanke (1983) and Cukierman (1980) have developed related models in which firms have an incentive to postpone irreversible investments so that they can wait for new information to arrive. However, in their models, this information makes the future value of an investment less uncertain; we will focus on situations in which information arrives over time, but the future is always uncertain. 5. In this example, the futures price would equal the expected future price because we assumed that the risk is fully diversifiable. (If the price of widgets were positively correlated with the market portfolio, the futures price would be less than the expected future spot price.)"
