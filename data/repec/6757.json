        "English as a Second Language classes. However, the Census form specifically asks respondents whether they are enrolled in regular school, not casual courses. For instance, in the 1980 Census respondents were first asked What is the highest grade (or year) of regular school the person has ever attended?. Enrollment is inferred by an answer of Now attending this grade to the subsequent question, which reads: Did this person finish the highest grade (or year) attended?."
