        "The main debate is whether U.S. CDS premiums reflect credit risk. Chernov, Schmid, and Schneider (2019) attribute most of the U.S. CDS premium to the risk of fiscal default. They develop a model with a Bansal and Yaron (2004) pricing kernel, an intertemporal government budget constraint, and a decline in government revenues when taxes are too high, also known as the Laffer curve. A sequence of bad shocks to the expected consumption growth leads to an increase in debt, and the latter can be sustained by increasing taxes, which has its limit due to the Laffer effect. Reaching this limit leads to a credit event.",
        "In contrast, Lando and Klingler (2018) attribute about 50% of the CDS premium of safe-haven countries to regulatory frictions, as the uncollateralized risk exposures toward sovereign counterparties demand capital charges, which can be offset by purchasing CDS protection on these counterparties. Through this channel, demand for regulatory capital relief may artificially inflate CDS premiums. An important observation is that the argument of regulatory frictions in CDS premiums critically depends on the presence of default risk, without which there is no need for regulatory capital relief in the first place. CDS premiums can reflect compensation for risks that are unrelated to default risk. For example, CDS contracts may command a liquidity premium because they are less actively traded than US Treasuries.",
        "Augustin (2014), Chernov, Schmid, and Schneider (2019), and Augustin, Sokolovski, Subrahmanyam, and Tomio (2018) review a number of measures used to gauge the liquidity of the U.S. CDS market. For example, Augustin, Sokolovski, Subrahmanyam, and Tomio (2018) report that the average gross (net) notional amount of U.S. CDS contracts outstanding is about $18.72 billion ($3.24 billion), which places it among the 20 most active sovereign CDS contracts. Chernov, Schmid, and Schneider (2019) compare the magnitude of the U.S. CDS market size to that of the most liquid Italian contract. The average ratio of weekly net notional amounts outstanding between U.S. and Italian CDS is 18%, and ranges between 6.5% in 2008 to 33% in late 2011.",
        "Similarly, there is a risk of uncertain recovery that is determined by a bond auction with a cheapest-to-deliver option (Chernov, Gorbenko, and Makarov, 2013).",
        "Counterparty risk is an additional friction that could distort the U.S. CDS premium downwards as a measure of U.S. default risk. Given that swap contracts are fully collateralized, there is little reason to believe that this should be quantitatively important. Indeed, Arora, Gandhi, and Longstaff (2012), who study the impact of counterparty risk on corporate CDS valuation, conclude that the credit risk of the counterparty would need to increase by six percentage points to decrease the CDS premium by one basis point. Similar conclusions of vanishingly small effects from counterparty risk are derived by Du, Gordy, Gadgil, and Vega (2016).",
        "From an empirical perspective, the U.S. has defaulted before, both on external and domestic debt (Zivney and Marcus, 1989; English, 1996; Reinhart and Rogoff, 2008). Such past experiences are relevant to the increasing debt levels of the U.S. government. According to the U.S. Treasury, the total federal public debt almost quadrupled over the last 20 years, ballooning from $5.526 trillion in the third quarter of 1998 to $21.516 trillion in the third quarter of 2018.1 This recent figure corresponds to about 104% of the gross domestic product (GDP). In their 2019 long-term budget outlook, the Congressional budget office foresees large budget deficits in the years to come, with a central estimate of federal debt to GDP of 144% by 2049.",
        "This is a magnitude consistent with the default trigger computations in Chernov, Schmid, and Schneider (2019). Since 2002, the U.S. has consistently reported a deficit, with the most recent estimates for 2018 being around negative 3.8 percent."
