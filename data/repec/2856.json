Savings and Investment Gross saving is from line  of table 5.1 of the The National Income and Product Accounts of the United States. 1S29-1 982 (Njf) while gross private domestic investment is line 16 of the same table. For the years 1983 to 1987 (preliminary), savings and investment are found in table 8-28 of the 1988 edition of the Economic Report of the President Both series are divided by GNP, line 1 of table 1.1 in the NIPA and table B-i of the Economic Report of the President All three series are in nominal terms.",

        "C. Comparison to 1985 Data 1. Definition of National Savings and Investment In the earlier study I erroneously included consumption of durable goods and public land sales in national savings and investment. This is tine in theory, but the 1929-87 data do not include either of these items. Thus, 1The University of California Project on The History of aving Working Paper Series, Number 1, Institute of Business and Economic Research, University of California, Berkeley. savings and investment as a percent of GNP were much higher during the early decades, as compared to the post depression levels. Using corrected data, it is still true that post-war levels of savings and investment are lower than pre-depression.",
        "2. The Dependency Ratio The current definition of the demographic instrument for private saving is the dependency ratio (see A.2). In 1985 the ratio used was those over 65 divided by those over 20. Since demographers are familiar with the new measure, and since it is more clearly consumers in the numerator and savers in the denominator (with life-cycle consumption theory), the new measure should be superior. In practice, the dependency ratio varies a good deal over the long sample, while the earlier measure is little more than a trend line."
