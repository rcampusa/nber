        "Government bond yields: The yields on benchmark 10-year government bonds of BRIC countries - i.e. local currency debts- reveal notable fluctuations in the yields of Brazil and Russia. China\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s yields were mostly below 4 percent while the yields of Russia above 8 percent and Brazil exceeded 10 percent during the sample period. Unlike CDS prices, there was no discernible co-movement among the government bond yields of the BRIC countries. For instance, the sharp rise of Russia&apos;s government yields in 2009 and 2014 did not associate with any significant increase in the government yields of Brazil, India and China. Similarly, a large increase in Brazil&apos;s government yield in 2016 was not associated with any notable change in the yields of the other BRIC countries.",
        "Policy rates: We use the following as the policy rate targets of the BRIC countries: Brazil - Selic target rate, Russia - minimum rate on the 7-day repo, India - repo rate (EP), and China - major loan rate on capital construction 1 year and below. There is a convergence of policy rates toward 4 to 6 percent among the BRIC countries. Brazil&apos;s policy rates closed the upward gap of 10 percent with other BRIC countries in the early 2000s and became comparable to the rates of Russia and India.",
        "External debts: We use the proportion of outstanding external short-term debts of BRIC countries held by non-residents, based on BIS data. The external debt of Brazil, Russia, and India grew steadily, while China\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s external short-term debts increased significantly during the 2010s. For the past two decades, more than 90 percent of BRIC external debts were in foreign currencies. The interest payments on external debt as a percentage of GNI (weighted average of local and foreign currency debts; World Bank IDS) suggested that the interest payments trended downward for India and China. the interest payments of Brazil and Russia peaked in the early 2000s but declined significantly since.",
        "Real exchange rates: The patterns of the real CPI broad effective exchange rate (indexing 2010 = 100, series from JP Morgan) suggest that Brazil and Russia, the two commodity exporters in the BRIC, were exposed to terms of trade fluctuation and deterioration. Global industrial cycles: The ratio of copper prices to gold prices, based on the S&P GSCI total return series, is widely viewed as a barometer of global industrial activity. The ratio does not point to a sustained global industrial recovery since GFC. Global interest rates: The movements of the benchmark 10-year government bond price indices of the US, UK, Germany and Japan indicate that the pace of decline in global interest rates has slowed down. The deceleration is especially evident in US interest rates during the past five years."
