Differentiating with respect to Pin gives: ____ k Oyf~ ~ Yin+~Pjt~Vik~ P~n it Pjn I Pin When y,~, and are chosen so as to maximize profits subject to the production constraint, we have first-order conditions: Pit = - X and Vik = X -~-, Substituting",

See, for example, Stiglitz [19771. We assume in the discussion that the desired equilibrium has, in fact, been reached.",
