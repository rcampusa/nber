We assumed that birth year was equal to calendar year minus age in order to estimate eligibility by birth year x age x state. These estimates were then added across ages 1-18 in order to create a measure of cumulative childhood eligibility for each birth year x state. To construct a simulated eligibility measure, we used a national sample of 1,000 children of each age for each year and estimated eligibility for this sample using state-specific eligibility rules during that year.",

This measure is constructed using a sample of adults of ages 19-28 from each year of the 1999-2016 Annual Social and Economic Supplements (ASEC) of the Current Population Survey (CPS). As with our measures of childhood eligibility, we instrument for actual cumulative adult eligibility with a simulated adult eligibility measure. This measure is constructed using a national sample of 1,000 adults per year of age and survey year.",
        "In 2000, most states were using this minimum earnings disregard in eligibility determinations (Broaddus et al. 2001). Therefore, we chose to apply this rule for all states for the years 1998-2013. For 2014-2015, following the implementation of the Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansions, a standard disregard of five percentage points of the federal poverty level is built into the eligibility thresholds.",
