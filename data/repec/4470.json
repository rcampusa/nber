        "The Survey of Consumer Finances, 1983 The 1983 SCF contains data on 4,303 households. The income variable we used was labor income of the head of household. The wealth variable was total household net worth at the end of 1982. The occupation and education dummy variables were constructed from the occupation and education codes contained in the survey in order to be consistent with the definitions of occupational and education groups used in the Psm.",
        "The income variable used was pre-tax noncapital household income, constructed by subtracting capital income from total household income. Capital income in the years 1981-1987 in the P&ID consists of the sum of interest, dividends, and rent for all members of the household plus the asset portion of business, farming, and gardening income. The income data were deflated using the PCE deflator with a base year of 1982. Our measure of net worth was the sum of all assets minus the sum of all debt reported in the 1984 wealth survey.",

        "The test of overidentifying assumptions reported in Table 5 is based on Hansen&apos;s (1982) proof that the statistic \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00aa&apos;Z(Z&apos;\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00aa \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00aa&apos;Z&apos;Z&apos;\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00aa should be distributed x2 with degrees of freedom equal to the number of overidentifying restrictions. Although this statistic cannot be directly computed in the second sample because X2 is not observed (and so \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00aa is not observed), it should be asymptotically valid to substitute for \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00aa in the statistic because plim (Z&apos;b / n) = 0. This is the test whose p-value we report for the SCF and pooled regressions.",
        "The Summers-Heston Data Set Saving was constructed as follows: say = 1 - (c*pcpcus + g$&apos;pg*pgus)/(p*1O) Where the variables are c = Real Consumption (% of RGDP, 1985 international prices) g = Real Public Consumption (% of RGDP, 1985 international prices) pc = price level of consumption (100* PPP of Consumption/Exchange Rate) pg = price level of public consumption (100* PPP of government /Exchange Rate) p = Price level of GDP (100*PPP of GDP/Exchange Rate) pcus = price level of consumption in the US pgus = price level of government in the US The first five variables listed (c, g, pc, pg, and p) are taken directly from the published data. The other two variables, which are part of the data underlying the published tables, were supplied to us by Dan Nuxoll of the International Comparison Project.

        "Our sample was restricted to households for whom the following conditions held. The household head was age 30-39 and was married. Valid data were reported for the occupation and education of the head, and the occupation was neither selfemployment nor farming. The head reported positive wage and The exact mapping is available upon request. 79, salary income in 1982, and positive wealth holdings at the end of 1982."
