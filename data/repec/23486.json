GEMS is administered by the National Authority for Measurement and Evaluation in Education. GEMS scores are used to assess school progress. Individual GEMS scores are not released to students or schools administrators.18 GEMS tests are usually given some time between mid-March and mid-June (with the exception of the 2004-2006 school years, when the tests were given in October-November). The GEMS test-takers are drawn from a representative 1-in-2 sample of all elementary and middle schools in Israel, so that each school participates in GEMS once every two years. GEMS tests fifth-graders (primary school) and eighth-graders (middle school) in math, science, native language skills, and English. In principle, all students except those in special education classes are tested; in practice, the proportion of students tested is above 90 percent.",
        "We focus on math and language tests given in Jewish elementary schools, as in Angrist and Lavy (1999). GEMS scores are reported on a 1-to-100 scale that we standardized by year and subject. Between 2002 and 2006, participating schools were tested in four subjects.",
        "Since 2007, only two subjects at a time are tested, either math and language or science and English. Our ten year sample includes the math and language scores of 243,213 fifth graders."
