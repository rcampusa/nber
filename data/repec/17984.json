        "As noted in chapter 4, the United States bought foreign exchange to build a portfolio of foreign-exchange reserves in the late 1970s and early 1980s. We calculated the trade-weighted appreciation using J.P. Morgan\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s real, broad, effective exchange-rate index. China\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s currency is the renminbi, but its currency unit is the yuan, whose symbol is . The Peoples Bank also raised reserve requirements and imposed direct controls on bank lending to control inflation.",
        "A very good introduction to exchange-market operations in developing and emerging market economies is: Canales-Kriljenko (2003, 2004) and Canales-Kriljenko et al. (2003). This section drew heavily on these articles. See also the papers in Bank for International Settlements (2005). These sources also provide many useful references.",
        "On this aspect of the swap lines, see especially Goldberg, et al. (2010). An Overnight Index Swap (OIS) is an interest-rate swap where the period floating rate in the swap is equal to a geometric average of the federal funds rate. The OIS rate refers to the floating rate portion of the swap. Hence the OIS rate is related to the average federal funds rate over the period of the obligation.",

        "Following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks, the System also instituted similar swap lines with the European Central Bank ($50 billion) and the Bank of England ($30 billion). At that time, the System expanded its existing swap with the Bank of Canada to $10 billion. The lines expired after 30 days. The European Central Bank drew $23.4 billion on its line and repaid the amount on 17 September 2001. The Bank of Canada and the Bank of England did not draw on the lines. See Kos (2001, p. 761).",
