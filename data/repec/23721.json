In a sub-sample of half of the households, all men age 15-59 who were either permanent residents of the households in the 2008 sample or visitors present in the households on the night before the survey were eligible to be interviewed (NPC, 2009).

The DHS 2003 includes women born since 1954 and the DHS 2008 those born since 1958. We choose the 1974 birth cohort as the upper bound in our sample in order to reduce possible confounding effects.
