        "The Market and the Risk-Free Rate The equity return we use is the Market factor provided on Ken French\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s website (originally from CRSP). We also use, for most of our sample, the 1-month t-bill rate provided on Ken French\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s website (and due to Ibbotson and Associates, Inc.). These are the same data sources used by HKM. However, as discussed on Ken French\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s website, the Market return was changed in October 2012 and as a result there are some differences between our series and the one originally used by HKM.",
        "We also adjust the risk-free rate in the post-crisis period (as defined in our main text, July 2010 onwards) to use one-month OIS swap rates instead of 1-month t-bill rates. We make this adjustment to be consistent with the risk-free rates we used to compute the cross-currency basis and forward arbitrage returns. The adjustment has a minimal impact on our results. The HKM Factors In our equity-return only specification (Table 5), we use as an equity return the intermediary value-weighted investment return of HKM, obtained from Asaf Manela\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s website. When we use the original HKM specification, perhaps augmented with our basis shock (Table 3 and Appendix Table A8), we use our market return described above and the intermediary capital risk factor of HKM, obtained from Asaf Manela\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s website.",

This is exactly the same set of test assets used by HKM, who make their full dataset (containing data through 2012) available. The series begins in July 1926.",
        "Note that HKM use only the data from 1970 onwards.",
        "There appear to be a variety of small differences between the returns we obtained from Ken French\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s website in 2018 and the returns HKM obtained in 2012. Many of these differences are small enough that they can be attributed to rounding, but some are not. Ken French\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s website does mention a variety of changes in CRSP between 2012 and the present, but none seem directly applicable to the 25 size-and-value portfolios. US Bonds (US) Our U.S. bond portfolios include both government and corporate bonds. The government bonds are the five CRSP Fama Maturity Portfolios defined in twelve-month intervals.",
        "The corporate bonds are five Bloomberg corporate bond indices, which correspond to US corporate bonds with ratings of AAA, AA, A, B, and high yield.28 To include the returns for a particular month, we require that the returns for all five government bond maturity buckets and all five corporate bond indices be available. As a result, our data starts in March 1999. Our five government portfolios are groupings of the Fama bond portfolios studied by HKM; our corporate bond indices are different from the ones studied by HKM, and were chosen for convenience. We intend to construct and extend the HKM sample in the future. 28 The tickers are LU3ATRUU Index, LU2ATRUU Index, LU1ATRUU Index, LUBATRUU Index, and LF98TRUU Index.",
        "Sovereign Bonds (Sov) Our sovereign bond portfolio construction follows the procedure of Borri and Verdelhan (2015). Those authors consider all countries in the JP Morgan EMBI index, and sort bonds into six portfolios. They first divide countries into two groups, depending on whether their bonds have a low or high beta to US equity market returns, and then within each of these groups split bonds into three sub-groups based on their S&P rating.",
        "HKM use exactly the data of Borri and Verdelhan (2015), as those two papers are roughly contemporaneous.",
        "We implement this procedure with updated data. However, three countries have been dropped from the EMBI index, and do not have returns available for the post-crisis period. These countries are omitted from our entire analysis, and as a result there is an imperfect (80%) correlation between our portfolio returns and the original Borri and Verdelhan (2015) returns.",
        "Foreign Exchange Portfolios (FX) We use the 11 forward-premium-sorted portfolios of Lustig et al. (2011). These portfolios consist of between 9 and 34 currencies. Six these portfolios contain all currencies, sorted by forward premia. Five contain only developed-country currencies, sorted by forward premia. In contrast, HKM use six portfolios sorted by forward premia from Menkhoff et al.",
        "(2012) and six portfolios sorted by interest rate differential from Lettau et al. (2014).29 Because covered interest parity holds for most of the sample, these two groups of portfolios should be essentially identical. However, the two papers differ on data sources and samples (Menkhoff et al. (2012) have up to 48 currencies from 1983 to 2009, Lettau et al. (2014) have up to 53 from 1974 to 2010), and consequently the two sets of portfolios to do not exactly span each other. OIS and IBOR Forward Arbitrage Returns (FwdArb) We use OIS and IBOR forward arbitrage returns in five currencies (NZD, CAD, GBP, EUR, CHF) as test assets. Note that this list excludes AUD and JPY, which we used to construct our basis factor. Consequently, our factor is not spanned by the portfolio of test assets. Our OIS returns include both 1m forward 1-month tenor and 1m forward 3-month tenor returns, whereas the IBOR returns are restricted to 3-month tenors due a lack of available data.",
        "The Post-Crisis period of July 2010 to August 2018 provides just 32 quarter ends and 8 year ends. As such, the insignificant coefficients we see may be due to imprecise estimation.

Let \u00c3\u0083\u00c5\u00bd\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00bb = [\u00c3\u0083\u00c5\u00bd\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00bbrw , \u00c3\u0083\u00c5\u00bd\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00bb|x|] be the price of risk on the two factors, the wealth portfolio return and the magnitude of the cross-currency basis, respectively, and \u00c3\u0083\u00c5\u00bd\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a3 be the variance-covariance matrix between these two factors, then we could estimate the SDF parameters by  \u00c3\u0083\u00c5\u00bd\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b3 \u00c3\u0083\u00c5\u00bd\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00be  = \u00c3\u0083\u00c5\u00bd\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a3\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00cb\u0086\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u00991  \u00c3\u0083\u00c5\u00bd\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00bbrw \u00c3\u0083\u00c5\u00bd\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00bb|x|  . \u00c3\u0083\u00c5\u00bd\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00bb is proportional to the single regression coefficient of the true SDF on the two factors.",
        "It therefore can be estimated from the realized market risk premium on the two factor\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s factor-mimicking portfolios. If we see the He et al. (2017) value-weighted intermediary return on equity as the factor-mimicking portfolio for intermediary wealth returns, and we use the returns on the forward CIP trading strategy as a direct measure of the risk premium on the cross-currency basis, then we can estimate \u00c3\u0083\u00c5\u00bd\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00bb and, by extension, the SDF parameters \u00c3\u0083\u00c5\u00bd\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b3 and \u00c3\u0083\u00c5\u00bd\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00be.",
        "We estimate the price of risk on intermediary equity return from monthly excess returns from January 1970 to August 2018, the longest panel of returns that we have. The average monthly excess return is about 0.61%, which implies an annual excess return of about 7.3%. We estimate the price of risk on the forward CIP trading strategy from the Post-Crisis sample. Given the short sample, we use daily observations of the monthly returns on the 1M-forward 3M Classic Carry CIP trading strategy. The average monthly return is 4.76 basis points, which corresponds to an annual profit of 14.3 basis points on the notional. Both of these estimates are statistically significant.",
        "To calculate the SDF parameters, we also need the variance-covariance between the two factors. We estimate \u00c3\u0083\u00c5\u00bd\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a3 using monthly returns on the intermediary equity and the 1M-forward 3M Classic Carry CIP trading strategy in the Post-Crisis period (July 2010 to August 2018). Together with estimates of \u00c3\u0083\u00c5\u00bd\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00bb, we find an estimate of \u00c3\u0083\u00c5\u00bd\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b3 of 0.66 and an estimate of \u00c3\u0083\u00c5\u00bd\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00be of 305. While the estimate of a positive \u00c3\u0083\u00c5\u00bd\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00be is statistically significant, the estimate of \u00c3\u0083\u00c5\u00bd\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b3 is imprecise, and we cannot reject that the true \u00c3\u0083\u00c5\u00bd\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b3 is greater than 1. We summarize the results below.
