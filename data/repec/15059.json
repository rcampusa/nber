        "The only notable exception comes with self-employment income: Since the question concerning income from self-employment and free-lance work comes in a list of questions regarding labor earnings from different sources, and since the Cross-National Equivalence Files (CNEF) count this variable in its entirety as labor earnings, we choose to follow CNEF and add this income in its entirety to labor earnings. Thus, there is no capital income from businesses in our definition. While earnings, private inter-vivo transfers and public transfers are directly reported in GSOEP, tax payments are not reported and are simulated 700n1y participation rates rely on a variable that refers to the current year. 71Asset income information is available for the first time for 1984.",

        "B Details of Data Construction: EVS B.1 Sample Setup and Variable Definition B.1.1 Variable Definitions All income and consumption variables are calculated in annual terms of the same year. Both variables are determined by means of a household diary. The time-frame over which the diary is kept has changed over the years. Specifically, the diary used to be an annual diary until 1993 and has been switched to a quarterly one since the 1998 cross-section.82 The conversion into annual figures is done by simple projections. The switch from annual to 80Most of these are from the immigrant sample.",
        "Hours and participation Annual hours are provided in the CNEF based on the answers of hours in a usual week spent in full-time employment and part-time employment, and the indicated number of months the individual worked full-time or part-time. Thus, vacation, sick-times, holidays etc. are not accounted for. This should certainly lead to an upward bias in the mean 74For more details, see Schwarze (1995).",

        "in the CNEF data. The simulation program is fairly comprehensive, updated annually to reflect changes in the tax code, and comprises taxes and social security contributions.74 Yet, it is likely that the simulation overstates actual tax payments, since it only takes account of standard deductions (Becker et. al., 2002)."
