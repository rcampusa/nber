This lack of information about an individual\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s birth location is the case for the Indonesian Labor Force Survey (Sakernas), the Indonesian Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), and many other rounds of the Susenas data, making them unavailable to use to analyze the impacts of the school construction program. However, the Susenas 2016 is one exception to this, as there is information on every individual\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s district of birth.",
        "Second, it is important that the data include a sufficiently large sample of individuals from these specific birth cohorts (1957-1962 and 1968-1972). The Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS) does contain information on each individual\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s region of residence at birth, thus satisfying the first criteria we outline above.

The IFLS is a longitudinal survey, and the first round was collected in 1993/1994.",

        "Teachers\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 salary growth We first assume there is no real salary growth over the years and use Duflo (2001)\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s reported teacher\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s salary in 1973. Subsequently, we allow for linear growth using teacher\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s salary observations in 1970 by Daroesman (1972), 1973 by Duflo (2001), Intercensal Surveys 1976 and 1995, and Labor Force Surveys 2000, 2005 and 2010.3 Teachers are paid for the lifetime of the schools Lifetime curvature Individuals\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 tax payments and living standards generally follow an inverted-U shape, where they peak at around age 40-50. In our Susenas data, we observe individuals at their peak. To model the lifetime curvature of tax payments and living standards, we assume the same average effect on taxes and living standards across ages but different means at different ages. A 20-year old male, for instance, only spends $2,373 annually, compared to the mean in of our observed sample, $3,531, as implied in Table 3.",

These imply a class size of 20 students across 6 grades of primary education and 1 teacher per grade. The latter is reasonable given that schools often run two sessions per day: morning and afternoon classes. Individuals start paying taxes after age 18 We first assume that individuals start paying taxes after finishing Upper Secondary education at age 18. We subsequently relax this assumption to age 22, after individuals finish Tertiary education.",
        "We drop Duflo (2001)\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s reported salary in 1995 because it implies a 9 percent real growth per year and it is much higher than the linear fit would have predicted. It is also higher than observations in 2000, 2005, and 2010. 24 World Development Indicators suggest an average of 56.6 years of life expectancy at birth for individuals born between 1968 and 1980. Conditional on making it to primary school age, the life expectancy is likely higher. We assume a life expectancy of 60 years throughout and then relax this assumption in the final column. Share of men and women in affected cohorts We construct a weighted average of the treatment effects on men and women. The share of women in the affected cohort is 0.498. For simplicity, we assume an equal share of men and women."
