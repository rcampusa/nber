        "Firm-level data from the combined Prodcom-Trade data are additionally merged with the Business Registry data and FDI survey data, using the VAT number as the firm identifier. The final data set contains data on all firms that produced at least one product in the Prodcom survey (5465 in 2005). Of these 5465 firms, 3631 are exporters. Carry-Along Trade",
        "In the Prodcom declaration, which has to be filed on a monthly basis, firms are required to record their production activities at an 8-digit level. Products are Prodcom products, i.e. they are part of the European Prodcom List. Eurostat has developed the Prodcom List with two principal goals in mind: (i) measure production in the EU member states on a comparable basis and (ii) enable a comparison between production and foreign trade statistics (Eurostat, 2006). In view of the second aim, the Prodcom List has a close relationship with the Combined Nomenclature classification, which is used to record foreign trade statistics. In addition, the Prodcom classification is closely linked to the European NACE and CPA classifications, i.e. the first six digits of the Prodcom codes are CPA codes and the first four digits are NACE codes.",

The data contain firms\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 production activities at the firm-product level. All firms employing at least 10 people and with primary manufacturing activity are required to report to Prodcom. Firms with primary acitivity outside the manufacturing sector are only required to report if they employed at least 20 people. Firms below the employment cutoff are only required to report if their turnover exceeds a minimum threshold. Whether or not firms have to file a Carry-Along Trade Prodcom declaration is based on their social security records of the previous year. The Prodcom survey is obligatory and its underlying regulation is EU-based. All EU member states (and some EFTA countries and future accession countries) are bound by the Prodcom regulation.",
