        "Egypt: Bent Hansen and Girgis A. Marzouk, Development and Economic Policy in the UAR (Egypt) (Amsterdam: North-Holland, 1965) estimate GDP growth 1928-1939 (1954 prices, Chart 1.1, p. 3) at 1.60% per annum. However, Charles P. Issawi, Egypt in Revolution: An Economic Analysis (London: Oxford University Press, 1963, Table 7, p. 87) shows a decline in the manufacturing (including handicrafts) employment share 1927-1937 from 8.1 to 6.3%. Since there is no qualitative evidence of relatively fast growth in manufacturing labor productivity 1927/8-1937/9, manufacturing output is unlikely to have grown much faster than GDP. Thus, we assume manufacturing output growth 1920-1940 to have been about 1.60% per annum. Issawi (1963, Table 7, p. 87) reports that manufacturing (including handicrafts) employment fell slightly 1927-1937 at -0.10% per annum. Thus, we assume manufacturing labor force growth 1920-1940 to have been about 1.70% per annum.",
