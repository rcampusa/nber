        "Labor cost share: Labor cost shares were constructed using information from the 1907 Census of Production and from Bowley (1937). For each industry, the Census of Production provides the gross and net output value as well as employment by gender. To calculate total labor cost share in each industry I use wage data from Bowley (1937), which reports the average wage for different industry groups in 1906, separated into male and female wages.",

An air frost day is defined as a day in which the air temperature drops below the freezing point of water at a height of one meter above ground.",

Proximity to Carboniferous geological strata: The data on the location of the carboniferous geological strata comes from the British Geological Survey. The proximity of each city to the carboniferous strata was constructed using GIS. In the analysis presented in this appendix, I use the share of bedrock within 50km of the city that is made up of carboniferous strata. I have also explored alternative windows, such as 10km and 100km.",

        "Industry demographic similarity: The demographic similarity of the workforces of any pair of industries is based on data from the Census of Population from 1851. These data divide industry employment into male and female workers and those over or under 20. The demographic similarity measure for a pair of industries is simply the correlation between the two industries in the share of the workforce that is in each of these four bins.",

The shift to electricity had the potential to substantially affect industry coal use, whereas in the 1851-1911 period coal was the dominant energy source for industries and there were few alternatives.",
        "Figure 9 describes the results for the set of available counties. In this graph, the y-axis describes county-level coal use constructed from the 1871 Coal Commission report while the x-axis gives the county coal use estimated using the methodology introduced in this paper. In general, the points lie close to the 45 degree line, suggesting that my methodology does a reasonable job of matching the estimates obtained using the data from the Coal Commission report.",

        "a city is a major seaport. This does not substantially alter the results. I have also calculated results in which I include variables for the tonnage of shipping through the port in 1865 or the number of vessels and these deliver similar results. Finally, Column 6 presents results with London excluded from the data. In general, the signs on the city controls are as expected. For example, the positive effect of access to coal reserves is consistent with work by Fernihough & O\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0084\u00a2Rourke (2014). However, the inclusion of these variables does not change the baseline results.",
        "It may seems surprising that industries do not appear to benefit from employment growth among their buyer and supplier industries. This is likely due to the fact that growth in local buyers or suppliers comes with two offsetting forces. While it means more local customers or suppliers, it also means greater congestion in the city. This may explain why previous studies, such as Lee (2015), do not find strong evidence of static agglomeration forces during this period. It is important to recognize that these static agglomeration forces differ from the dynamic agglomeration forces studied by Hanlon & Miscio (2014). I have also calculated additional results in which I include controls for the dynamic agglomeration forces documented in that study. The main results are also robust to the inclusion of these controls.",
        "Table 20 looks at the impact of including these violence controls in regressions taken over two-decade differences. Columns 1-3 look at all industries while Columns 4-6 focus on manufacturing industries only. Because the violence data are only available through 1900, the study period here is shorter than that used in the main regression results. Thus, for comparability, Columns 1 and 4 include results estimated without including controls for violence. In Columns 2 and 5 I include controls for the level of violence in the first decade of each period. More violent locations tend to experience slower growth in city-industry employment. In Columns 3 and 6, I instead control for the change in deaths due to violence across each period. Here I observe a positive relationship between the change in violence and city-industry growth. This likely reflects the fact that the violence measure includes industrial accidents, which will be increasing in growing cities.",
