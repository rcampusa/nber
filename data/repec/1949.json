FOOTNOTES",
        "The possibility that hours legislation was passed in states in which hours had already declined, and therefore in which there was less opposition, is reduced by the estimation in Landes (1980, p. 481) of an hours equation for 1909. States which passed hours legislation after 1909 did not have lower average scheduled hours in 1909. It is conceivable, however, that actual hours of work for men greatly exceeded scheduled hours because of overtime, but there is no indication that overtime work was negatively related to the existence of hours restrictions.",
        "On child labor laws in Britain see Marvel (1977). Note that Landes and Sol mon (1972) interpret the passage of compulsory schooling legislation as coming after most children were in school for the legislated amount of time. Neither E. Landes nor I have been able to find convincing empirical evidence to support the hypothesis for the case of hours (see footnote 7)."
