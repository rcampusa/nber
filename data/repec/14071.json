        "Lags of Ast and Az~ are included in the error correction equation to account for potential autocorrelation. The bootstrap procedure uses the Akaikes information criterion (AIC) method 54The main difference between our bootstrap and Mark and Suls (2001) bootstrap is that we use country specific OLS - regressions rather than seemingly unrelated regressions (SURs). in order to choose between the appropriate number of lags of Ast and Az~ ( d and 1 can differ).",
        "Indeed, Berkowitz and Kilian (1996) suggest that block bootstrapping is not the optimal way to bootstrap time series data given the state of development of the block bootstrap literature.",
        "51Clark and West themselves suggest that researchers should interpret the CW as a minimum MSFE test statistic (2007, pp. 297). Clark and McCracken (2001, 2005) do not make such a claim regarding the ENC-NEW.",
        "Our proof is based on the rolling window specification (R/P -* 0 and R is fixed) which generalizes well the main point made by Clark and West (2006, 2007), namely, the presence of small-sample bias. The proof for the recursive case is similar.52 While the proof assumes that the benchmark model is the driftless random walk, it can be generalized to any nested-model specification.",
        "49Similarly to the CW, the ENC-NEW has been one of the most widely used out-of-sample test statistics in the exchange rate forecasting literature. Some of the studies that test out-of-sample forecastability using the ENCNEW are Franses and Legerstee (2007), Rossi (2006), Zagaglia (2006), Boucher (2006), Giacomim and Rossi (2006), Rangvid, Rapach, Wohar (2005).",
        "The Clark - West Test (CW) To compensate for the fact that the asymptotic DMW test statistic is undersized under the null hypothesis when comparing nested models and to avoid the use of a bootstrap, Clark and West (2006, 2007) propose a new asymptotic test for nested models, the CW, that builds on the asymptotic DMW test. The CW test statistic takes into account the fact that the two models compared are nested by assuming that, under the null hypothesis, the exchange rate follows a random walk.",
        "West, K. (1996), Asymptotic Inference About Predictive Ability, Econometrica 64, 10671084. APPENDIX: A. Minimum MSFE Out-of-Sample Test Statistics The Theils U Test (TU) The TU test statistic is a minimum MSFE test defined as the square root of the MSFE of the structural model over the square root of the MSFE of the random walk model. Therefore, a TU < 1 implies that the structural model outperforms the random walk model. TU is often preferred for its simplicity and intuitive interpretation and its statistical significance is tested via a bootstrap.",
