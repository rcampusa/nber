        "This table reports OLS estimation, using Asia and Latin America sub-samples. The dependent variable is Tax/GDP (%). The sample period is 1993-2012. We use average 5-year panel observations: 1993-1997 (t=0); 1998-2002 (t=1); 2003-2007 (t=2); 2008-2012 (t=3). The Initial capita GDP is of the 1993-1997 period (t=0). Higher Government effectiveness indicates stronger performance. The regression is estimated on 5-year average observations, t=1, 2, 3 (panel data of 3 periods per country), using the ordinary least squares estimator. Standard errors are in parentheses (***, **, * signifies 1, 5, 10 level). Source: Authors\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 calculation.
