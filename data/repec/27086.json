        "1 Materials and Methods: Data description and estimation equation Air quality monitor data We use monitor-specific hourly data from air quality monitor stations across China. With the increasing concern of air pollution, the Chinese government built the National Urban Air Quality Real-time Publishing Platform and mandated detailed quality assurance and quality control programs at each monitoring station. The Platform is required to report six primary pollutants and air quality index since 2013. By the end of our study period, the reporting system covers 367 prefecture-level cities and 1642 monitors across China.",
        "We use CEMS data in eleven provinces where data are consistently reported in 2019 and 2020: Anhui, Heilongjiang, Henan, Hubei, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Liaoning, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Shandong and Zhejiang. Four of them are Hubei\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s neighboring provinces.",
        "We require firms with non-missing data at least 10 days over day-21 to -1 and 14 days over day 0 to 28 in both 2019 and 2020. We average hourly emissions to firm-pollutant-day level data and add firm fixed effects in the regression.",
        "5 Results using CEMS data Using firm-level, hourly emission data from the CEMS, we do similar differencein -difference estimations in Hubei and non-Hubei provinces in Table S6. First of all, we examine the change in the number of firms reporting emission data before and after the New Year day. In all Chinese firms in the CEMS, the number of firms that report emission data went down more after the New Year day in 2020 than that in 2019. Hubei has more firms that do not report data after the New Year day, compared to that in other provinces. This pattern is consistent with more firms shut down in Hubei given the strictest lockdown policy. Therefore, our analyses on the changes in emissions are limited to firms that consistently report data before and after the New Year day."
