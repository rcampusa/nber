        "In line with Aguiar and Gopinath (2007a), we assume that permanent technology shocks act through an exogenous and mean reverting stationary process: t = gt t 1 (B.6) log (gt=) = g log (gt 1=) + g t where jgj &lt; 1; g t is an i:i:d: process with mean zero and standard deviation g; and it models shocks to labor productivity which are incorporated into t through gt; resulting in trend growth improvements.  represents long-run labor productivity growth. The representative rm has the primary objective to maximize the total discounted sum of all future prots, t; subject to a working capital constraint: max fat;ht;ktg1 t+0 E0 1 X t=0 t t = E0 1 X t=0 t  atF (Kt; tht) wtht  1 +  Rt 1 1  utKt",
        "Rt (B.12) B.2.2. Functional forms Households preferences are modeled according to Greenwood et al. (1988) (GHH) preferences12 since many papers show that they improve the performances of international RBC models in replicating business cycle stylized facts: U (Ct; ht; t 1) = (Ct  t 1h! t )1  1  ; ! &gt; 1;  &gt; 0 (B.13) Capital adjustment cost is modeled as a quadratic function of the current and past capital stock level and it captures the fact that faster adjustments in the capital stock are more expensive:  (Kt+1; Kt) =  2",
        "The long run productivity growth; ; is dened as average real GDP growth rate over the period 2000-200914 . The steady state level of gross foreign interest rate, r ; is computed as the quarterly average of the Euro Zone real interest rate over 2000-2009 period. d; the long run external debt to GDP ratio, is proxied as the 1997-2007 average of the net foreign asset to GDP ratio. The steady state share of labor, h; is dened as the ten years average employment to total population ratio. 14 This type of association between parameter and statistical denition is used by Aguiar and Gopinath (2007a) in the case of Argentina and than it was taken over by other papers, e.g. Aguiar and Gopinath (2007b), Chang and Fernandez (2009).",
        "We checked if this convergence is present in the case of all the ve countries by estimating the Chang and Fernandez (2009) version of the model with both 100000 and half a million draws. The estimation results and the convergence statistics conrmed that 100000 draws are enough to achieve convergence. 20 These second order moments are the variance of the distribution, skewness and condence interval and every draw per chain.",
        "For example, Chang and Fernandez (2009) calibrate instead of estimating it and they obtain a point estimate of  equal to 14.72 in the case of Argentina. This result is similar to those we report in Table C.3 suggesting two digit numbers for  across all the countries when is calibrated. However, when is estimated its point estimates vary in [0.02, 0.23] interval depending on country, model and prior specication. These are somewhat lower estimates than the equal to 2:8 reported by Garcia-Cicco et al. (2010). This indicates that the data shifts the posterior mode of the conditional distribution upper, to the right in the distribution of the parameter, suggesting that the external debt elasticity of country spread or interest rate in the case of CEECs might be higher than 0.001, i.e. country spread or interest rate is more sensitive to changes in the external debt position in CEECs than in developed ones, like Canada.",
        "Regarding the estimates of  reported in Table C.3, one can observe that  takes values between 3.4 and 8.2 when is estimated. These results are not at odds neither with the previous evidences in RBC literature nor with the existing empirical evidences obtained from research on investment behavior. For example Cummins et al. (2006) estimate  by using cross section data of rms from the US and conclude that the estimated  is about 7.2 in the US. Thus, the estimates of  obtained both in the case of the uniform interest rate model and the persistent spread model are quite plausible. To motivate lower estimates of ; one can use the gures reported by Aguiar and Gopinath (2007a) who obtain estimates for  between 2.82 and 3.79 by using moment matching, or those recently documented by Garcia-Cicco et al. (2010) (i.e. they estimate  at 4.6 in the case of Argentina by using Bayesian techniques).",

The source of the interest rate is the Online Historical Financial Statistics published by The Deutsche Bundesbank and it is dened as Frankfurt banks / Overnight money / Monthly average: SU0101, from which the quarterly series is constructed by taking the corresponding monthly rate at the end of each quarter. The annualized quarter-to-quarter ination rate is computed based on the quarterly consumer price index (13464ZF)(2000=100) from International Financial Statistics of IMF according to the following formula: inf = 400  ln",

Real GDP growth rate (quarterly frequency): measured as the percentage change of the gross domestic product at constant prices relative to the previous period from the GDP and main components-volumes (namq_gdp_k) table published by Eurostat 8. Net Foreign Asset (NFA) position (annual frequency): in millions of US dollars is from the updated and extended version of dataset constructed by Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2007) in the \"External Wealth of Nations\" Dataset, 1970-2007 9.
