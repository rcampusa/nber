        "3 An incomplete list of notable studies would include those mentioned above plus Hess, Small, and Brayton (1993), Clark (1994), Croushore and Stark (1995), Dueker (1993), Dueker and Fischer (1996), Estrella and Mishkin (1996), Judd and Motley (1991, 1992), Haldane and Salmon (1995), and King (1996). 4 There is a sizable and growing literature on inflation targeting that will be mentioned below.",
        "5 Taylor, like Judd and Motley (1992), envisions the genuine possibility that central bank policy committees would enrich their considerations by referring to the instrument settings suggested by a numerical rule, taking them as a starting point for their policy deliverations.",
        "6 A particularly striking example of the importance of this assumption is provided by Svensson (1996b), which argues that in the workhorse model, extended to include persistence of output or unemployment in the surprise Phillips relationship, price level targeting will lead to less inflation variability (as well as less price level variability) than will inflation targeting. This dramatic result depends, however, upon the presence of discretionary behavior on the part of the monetary authority. It does not obtain if the central bank is behaving in a rule-like fashion. Svensson (1996b) recognizes this point but strongly emphasizes the discretionary case.",
        "7 This exposition does not explicitly refer to the reputational models pioneered by Barro and Gordon (1983b), the reason being that the author finds these models implausible. Of course the argument here advanced relies upon reputational effects, but does not utilize the type of equilibria featured in the reputation literature.",
        "8 Empirically it is\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dunlike the usual position\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dconsistent with the \"free lunch\" finding that increased CB independence provides improved inflation performance without increased output employment variability. On this finding, see Fischer (1995) or Debelle and Fischer (1995, p. 201). It should be noted, incidentally, that my hypothesis is quite different from that of Mervyn King ((1996), who suggests that CBs do not aim for output in excess of the natural rate value. 9 In the workhorse model, policy settings of both the committed and discretionary type may be expressed as resulting from policy feedback equation of the form 7c, = ao + aiE,.i7tt + a2Ui, with different coefficient values. Here E,_i7t, represents prevailing expectations and ut is a current macroeconomic shock."
