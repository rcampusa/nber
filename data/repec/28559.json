While oil price volatility increases episodically during economic downturns (e.g., during the global financial crisis (GFC), i.e., the 2007 to 2009 period), the European sovereign debt crisis (2011-2012), and the oil & gas crisis in 2015-2016), volatility has increased by more than 6 times (to over 100% on an annualized basis) around March 9th , 2020 and energy stocks crashed.",

Reversal of Credit Line Drawdowns To investigate the effect of credit risk on corporate cash holdings during the COVID-19 pandemic, we construct a sample of all publicly listed U.S. firms, for which financial variables are available at the end of 2019 in Capital IQ. We drop financial firms and utilities and firms with total assets below US$100 million at the end of 2019. Our final sample comprises 1,971 U.S. nonfinancial firms.

Specifically, we inspect the following: drawn credit lines (Drawn CL/Assets), credit line usage (Drawn CL/(Drawn CL + Undrawn CL)), bond debt (Bonds /Assets), term loans (Term loans/Assets), total debt (Total Debt / Assets), and preference for cash (Cash / (Cash + Undrawn CL)).",

        "A. Berger and Bouwman (2009) liquidity creation measure To replicate the Berger-Bouwman (2009) measure on liquidity creation using FR Y-9C data, we apply the data mapping available in Berger et al. (2020).24 Individual on- and off-balance sheet items are aggregated and weighted in line with the classification provided by Berger & Bouwman (2009). Finally, the weighted positions are combined to the aggregate liquidity creation measure for each bank holding company. Note that we only replicate Berger & Bouwman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009ccatfat\u00e2\u0080\u009d measure, which is constructed by classifying balance sheet items by category (see Berger & Bouwman, 2009) and includes on- as well as off-balance sheet positions.",
        "B. Bai et al. (2018) liquidity risk measure (LMI) To construct the Bai et al. (2018) liquidity mismatch index (LMI), we use information provided in the paper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Online Appendix together with the FR Y-9C call report template for 2019Q4 to map all balance sheet items, except deposits, to the variables in our dataset. The deposit data is constructed in line with the approach outlined in Bai et al. (2018), using FFIEC 031 call report data for commercial banks aggregated for the respective parent bank holding company.25 24 Berger, A.N., C.H.S. Bouwman, B. Imbierowicz and C. Rauch (2020), How are banks special? \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Let me count the ways. 25 We thank Jennie Bai for detailed guidance how to construct their measure. 76 Commercial banks and bank holding companies are matched with the help of the FSSD\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relationship table. We consider a bank holding company to be a commercial bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s parent, if their relationship exists at least until 31 December 2019.",
        "In the next step, we calculate the asset and liability weights per category as indicated in Bai et al. (2018) using the parameters and estimates provided by the authors. Accordingly, haircut values as well as the magnitude of the Frist Principal Component used in constructing our measure are averages taken from Bai et al. (2018). As described in the main text of the paper, we use two different proxies for the liquidity premium \u00ce\u00bct, which is defined as the OIS -3m Treasury Bill spread. We create two LMIs, one using liquidity conditions as of Q4 2019 (LMI \u00e2\u0080\u0093 2019) and one using the worst liquidity condition in March 2020 (LMI \u00e2\u0080\u0093 2020). We weigh the aggregate positions with the respective asset/liability weight to calculate the liquidity risk measure per bank holding company.",

We first show that idiosyncratic drawdown risk (measured using a firm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s realized equity volatility over the past 12 months) and systematic drawdown risk (measured using a firm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stock beta) are priced in both commitment fee (AISU) and spread (AISD). This is consistent with, for example, Acharya et al. (2013) and Berg et al. (2015)."
