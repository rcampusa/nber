        "See, for example, Yaari (1965), Hakansson (1969), Fischer (1973)-, Richard (1975), Barro and Friedman (1977), Levhari and Mirman (1977) and Kotlikoff and Spivak (1981). Kotlikoff and Spivak (1981) analyze the role of the family in providing annuities but stop short of a general equilibrium model in which the distribution of bequests is determined endogenously.",
        "If there are annuities and if consumers derive some utility from leaving bequests, then in general there will be intra-cohort variation in bequests received and left by members of the same cohort with identical ex ante mortality probabilities. (See Abel (1985b).) Only if the rate of return on annuities is actuarially fair will there be no intra-cohort variation in bequests by consumers who can live either one period or two periods."
