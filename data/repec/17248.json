        "C Tests of Model Fit This appendix discusses the formal test of model fit we use to compare our predicted unemployment duration and accepted wage distributions to the data. For continuous data, Cameron and Trivedi (2005, pp. 261-2) propose a variation of the Lagrange Multiplier (LM) test using the sample moments and scores from the estimated model.29 Let ^mi = m(xi, ^) be the sample moment(s) for observation i evaluated at the estimated parameters ^. For instance, for exponential wage offers we would have ^mi = wi - (^ + w ). Let ^si = s(xi, ^) =  ln Li ^ be the score vector for observation i evaluated at ^. Under the null hypothesis that the model is correctly specified, E(m) = E(s) = 0. Cameron and Trivedi propose the following auxiliary regressions: 1 = ^mi + ^si + ui 1 = ^mi + ui where 1 is a vector of ones and the second auxiliary regression is valid in the case where m = 0, as it is in our case. The corresponding test statistic is then: M = NR2 u",
        "where R2 u is the uncentered R2 from the auxiliary regression. Under the null, M is distributed (h), where h is the dimension of m (i.e., h is the number of moments).30 29Although many researchers use the Pearson 2 test to evaluate the fit of structural models, Cameron and Trivedi (2005, pp. 266) note that the test is invalid if the data are not generated from a multinomial distribution. Since our outcomes of interest (duration and wages) are continuous, we use the LM test described above. 30Another test of model fit that could be applied in our context is the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, which is a nonparametric test for the equality of two distributions. However, when the parameters of one distribution are estimated using data from the other, the test statistic may not be asymptotically distributed according to the Kolmogorov distribution, invalidating the test."
