        "Demographics. We collected demographic information by locating referees\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 CVs online. We downloaded these CVs during Fall 2010, with an update for new referees in November 2011. We use these CVs to define indicators for gender, tenure status, working in the U.S., and working in an academic position. Tenure status is defined as being a full professor at a university or mentioning tenure on the CV for any other position. Working in the U.S. is based on the employer\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s address and an academic position is defined as having an affiliation with a university. We code these variables as missing for referees for whom we were unable to locate CVs online or whose CVs did not contain the relevant information. We located CVs for 92.9% of the 1,606 referee reports in our primary (February 15, 2010 to May 9, 2011) sample.",
        "Appendix Figure 2 replicates Figure 2 from the text using the full experimental period from February 15, 2010 to October 26, 2011. This figure includes the period after May 9, when the cash reward was stopped, for the four week, six week, and social incentive groups. For the cash group, we continue to use data only up to May 9. Appendix Figure 3 plots a subset of the survival curves reported in Figure 4 in the main text on a single figure to show that tenured referees have longer turnaround times than untenured referees in the control group, but behave like untenured referees when facing social pressure. Appendix Figure 4 shows survival curves for review times at other Elsevier journals by the treatment group to which referees were assigned at the Journal of Public Economics.",
        "Appendix Table 1 presents the summary statistics for referee invitations sent between February 15, 2010 and May 9, 2011, the time period when the cash reward was offered. Panel A of Appendix Table 2 presents randomization tests for the set of referees invited during the primary experimental period. Panel B replicates Panel A in the subsample of referees who accept the invitations to test for selection effects. Appendix Table 3 presents estimates of treatment effects on median review times. Appendix Table 4 presents Cox hazard model estimates of the effects of the treatments on review times. Appendix Table 5 reports estimates of the effects of the treatments at the Journal of Public Economics on acceptance rates and review times at other Elsevier journals during the experimental period."
