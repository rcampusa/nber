        "19Alesina (1985a,b), in the context of a Barro-Gordon (1983)/Kydland-Prescott (1977) model, has shown how cooperation between two political parties can serve to dampen post-election volatility in prices and employment. Wage setters arent sure which party is going to win, and hence cannot predict prices. The two parties may implicitly cooperate and always choose the same post-election monetary policy despite their different preferences v~s-a-vis inflation and unemployment. The winner of the election will follow the cooperative strategy if the long-term gain in reduced volatility outweighs the short-run costs. The uthirdit channel we refer to in the text is simflar to Alesinats, except that our analysis pertains to pre-election volatility.",
        "See also Roberts (1985). Our model is not plagued by the existence problems familiar from the information theory literature discussed in Riley (1979), because voters face a single large agent. the finite horizon case, (12) is the only possible form for rational expectations. Expectations conditioned on past behavior unravel backwards. Other equilibria are possible in the infinite horizon case, however; see section IV below.",
        "17See, for example, Frey and Schneider (1978). There are several other empirical studies which also attempt to relate presidential popularity to the severity of the political business cycle. Golden and Poterba (1980) find no evidence of a relationship. 18That the thfinite horizon case may yield outcomes with higher social welfare is well-known. In the macroeconomics literature, see Barro and Gordon (1983), or Canzoneri (1985), for example. The election game may end with some positive probability each period~ this effectively raises the incumbents discount rate.",
        "4McCallum (1978), and Golden and Poterba (1980), find little evidence of a political business cycle in employment. The evidence of a political business cycle in variables such as transfers and money supply growth is stronger (see Tufte (1978), or the Hibbs and Fassbender volume (1981).) 5See Barro (1979).",
