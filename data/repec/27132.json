        "App. 8.2 CPS Response Rates During the Epidemic It is possible that survey response rates may have have varied across the first four months of 2020, and especially in March and April 2020, given the widespread disruption associated with the epidemic.",
        "Figure H.4 shows which of the 8 CPS rotation groups responded the least in March and April 2020, when the COVID-19 and its social distancing policies came about. For comparison purposes, we also report the average nonresponse rates for the previous period, comprised of January and February 2020. The bar chart reports the non-response rates by each rotation group on the three months and facilitates the identification of changes in non-response rates between the pre- and post- COVID-19 outbreak. In order to control for drops in response rates across rotation groups that regularly happen regardless of the epidemic, we include non-response rates by rotation group in January 2020. Changes in non-response rates between January and February of 2020 can be considered as patterns that happen regularly over the rotation groups, and so, in case we observe similar trends between February and March, such trends cannot be attributed to the epidemic.",
        "Understanding the reasons behind the CPS response rate drop is crucial in order to draw conclusions on the data quality. In fact, should the non-response be driven by non-random factors that are correlated to the changes in employment outcomes in March 2020, we could interpret our findings as conservative or as upper bounds of the true effects, depending on the direction of the sample bias. In order to collect preliminary evidence on that, we use demographic information from responApp.",
