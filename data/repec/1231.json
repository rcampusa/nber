        "FOOTNOTES There are frequent reports in the popular press of this use. For example, one official of the Department of Agriculture (which administers the program on the Federal level) stated (Time, August 23, 1982), The [Food Stamp] coupons are a second currency. Anything you can buy with money, from electronics to houses to sex, you can buy with Food Stamps. The article continues with reports that Federal agents have used coupons to buy boats, cars, a gun with a silencer, marijuana and even a $35,000 house.",

        "Equation (6) was also estimated with lagged consumption included as an additional independent variable. This modification did not qualitatively change the results reported in the text. Similarly, allowing 0=1 lowered ~, but the point estimates still exceeded one. Blinder-Solow (1974, p. 4) state, [A] transaction is pure fiscal policy if it is financed entirely with taxes, so that the public debt does not change, or if the debt-financed part of the expenditure does not alter the proportions of outstanding government obligations (including high-powered money). By these criteria Food Stamps clearly are a mixed policy."
