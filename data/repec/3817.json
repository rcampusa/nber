In the first we construct several wage series for white-collar workers to explore skill differentials before and during the Great Depression. In the second we explore how the wage distribution changed during the 1940&apos;s - from the pre-war, to the wartime, to the post-war periods.",
        "But during the 1930&apos;s, skill ratios increased and then decreased. Looking first at the monthly (railroad) and weekly (NYS) series, the premium to skill rose substantially - by 26 to 31 percent. Using the railroad data, K is clear that much of the rise was due to the collapse in the hours of the unskilled compared with the skilled. But even on an hourly basis, the skill differential decreased by about 8 percent. Another finding of interest is that the skill premium before 1929 did not decrease, but, rather, Increased slightly In all series. Finally, the compression In wages that we find using aggregate census data between 1939 and 1949 is quite evident here as well. After returning to about the value it achieved in the late 1920&apos;s, the ratio began a steady decline after 1940. Further, it continued to decline after war was declared, after the National War Labor Board gained power to stabilize wages, and after victory was declared and the command economy was dismantled.",
