        ". (A19) This last equation can also be expressed as S\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u008f\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u009e E\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u008f\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u009e [max (0, 1 \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00cb\u0086\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0099 W)] , (A20) where W is a martingale and is independent of S\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u008f\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u009e . It is readily seen that the variance of W is a decreasing function of \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u008f\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u009e because of the independence of Brownian increments. From Theorem 8 of Merton (1973), this implies that the value of the exchange option at time \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u008f\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u009e is a decreasing function of \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u008f\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u009e. Following a similar line of reasoning as above, this implies that the time-zero value of the exchange option is maximized by setting \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u008f\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u009e = 0."
