        "As of the end of fiscal year 2012, the number of common shares sold short represented a significantly unusual high short position based on our historical trend, where our short interests in our common shares were less than 5% at the end of fiscal year 2011 compared to approximately 35% at the end of fiscal year 2012. It is also possible that the New York Stock Exchange short interest reporting system does not fully capture the total short interest and that it could be larger. Short sellers expect to make a profit if our common shares decline in value, and their actions and their public statements may cause further volatility in our share price. While a number of traders have publicly announced that they have taken long positions contrary to the hedge fund shorting our shares, the existence of such a significant short interest position and the related publicity may lead to continued volatility.",
