        "three LRUS workers were thus deflated to 1960 values and inflated to 1980 values using the CPI. This holds constant real earnings by age in the three decades so as to better be able to compare resultant benefit patterns through time.",
        "In order to assess whether the benefit figures generated were specific to LRHS earners, we also devised two additional earnings streams. A low earnings worker was devised by attributing to him for each year of work the statutory minimum wage (times 2000 hours of work per year), and a high wage worker was one who always earned a salary placing him at the taxable earnings ceiling for the purposes of Social Security taxation. The text refers to averages across all six earnings profiles, since these results proved sufficiently similar to the underlying individual patterns so as not to warrant separate mention."
