Out of approximately 14.8 million pharmacy claims between 2006 and 2012, only 66.8 percent join to the current directory. Therefore, we construct a historical NDC directory using a data mining framework that downloads and collates all available Internet Archive snapshots of the FDA\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s NDC website since 2000.2 This historical directory also includes full ingredient lists for each NDC, standardized to milligrams.
