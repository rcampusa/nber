        "One relatively common data anomaly appears to be that insurers file annual numbers in a single end-of-year filing rather than in quarterly reports throughout the year.25 In the case of this data anomaly, I allocate the values reported in the fourth quarter across the entire year, in proportion to an estimated seasonally-adjusted trend for the given firm from the first quarter of 2008 through the third quarter of 2013. (I do not include later data, which could be influenced by health reform).",
        "I apply this treatment only to the larger firms that are capable of having a substantial impact on the state-level analysis. Nevertheless, it should be clear that this method of imputation is a clear improvement over using the raw data. Fortunately, this data anomaly does not seem to be a major concern for the 2014 data. Throughout the period from Q1 2008 through Q4 2013, the prevalence and severity of this data anomaly decrease substantially. In 2008\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u009c2010, this type of data error affected firms accounting for nearly 6% of enrollment in terms of member months. By 2013, however, the comparable figure drops to 0.2% of coverage. In addition, firms that appear in the data during 2013 but not in 2014 (some of which may be legitimate examples of firm exit) account for less than 1% of enrollment in terms of member months, suggesting that reporting is only rarely an issue with respect to our 2014 data.",
        "Finally, for each remaining firm, I identify and address remaining data anomalies using regression techniques at the firm level. For each firm, for each of the three variables of interest, I first run a seasonally-adjusted trend regression from the first quarter of 2008 through the third quarter There are several cases for which a firm reports numbers for enrollment, premiums, and costs that are negligible relative to other numbers in their active periods. In order to properly perform firm-level imputation, I exclude these insurer-quarter observations from the non-defunct period and flag them for later imputation. Specifically, I flag such observations as those for which the enrollment, premiums, or costs are less than one-tenth the median value. When this particular error occurs, the data reported by the firm in Q4 are roughly four times as large as the data reported by the firm in quarters of other, non-anomalous years."
