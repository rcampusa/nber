The finer age groups were weighted for percentage of total hours worked. Note that the relative wages reflect not only pure age and sex differences in human capital hut also the relative amounts of education, all taken as approximately constant. Changes in the average level of education are accounted for in equation (5) below.",
        "7See Chiswick (1978, 1979) and Blau (1980). Previously Friedman (1974) had noted that the rapid immigration of the early twentieth century reduced measured growth in real per capita income or, as here, labor productivity.",
        "10The 1909 data came from U.S. Immigration CommIssion (1911, Table 56, pp. 1521 and 1528). The cells were assigned their mean values (0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 7.5, 12.5, and 17.5) except for the open cell (20 years and over) for which Blau's value of 30 years was used. The 1970 data were from U.S. Bureau of the Census (1973, Table 18, p. 466) using cell values of 2.65, 7.8, 12.8, 17.8, 22.8, 30.3, 40.3, and 53.1 years for the open (before 1925) cell. The last value was estimated by taking weighted averages of young immigrants arriving 1904 through 1924 who would be 65 or under in 1970.",
        "This value was taken from Chiswick (1978, P. 908) and appears reasonable in terms of such recent cross\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dsection results as reported by Smith and Welch (1977). Yet lower rates of return to education would lower productivity growth in the early period relative to the two later periods, but would not have much effect on the main conclusion of this section: the absence of a secular decline in productivity growth.",
        "12Mean years of education were not available, but if the difference is constant the substitution of the median will not affect the growth rates estimated below. Folger and Nam (1964) retroject the 1940 census data back to obtain median estimates for 1930, 1920, 1910. These values of 8.6, 8.4, 8.2, and 8.1 were extrapolated to 8.0 in 1900. Sources for more recent years are given in the data appendix. Log\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dlinear interpolation was used to fill in missing values. '3The growth\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009drate effect of education is separable from those of age, sex, and immigration, but the latter effects are not separable from each other. Because the age\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dsex adjustment is more important for the last two periods, the effect of the age\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dsex correction is reported if no adjustment is made for immigrants and then the additional (marginal) adjustment when APE is computed according to equations (1), (2), and (3).",
        "-6Textbook expositions of these results may be found in Solow (1970, pp.",
        "17\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d38) and Darby (1979, pp. 105\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d115, 139\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d140,. 440\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d441). 171f one makes no allowance for measurement error, one could say that productivity growth was a bit low in 1929\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d1965 relative to 1900\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d1929 and 1965\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d 1978, but surely this is going too far. 18As is well known, technical progress or total factor productivity growth is a euphemism for the increase in output which we cannot explain by the increase in measured inputs. Presumably, the constancy of its average growth rate over substantial periods reflects the law of large numbers and numerous independent contributing factors.",

The difference (\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d0.006) is statistically insignificant but could reflect a very small oil\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dprice effect on productivity. 26This was the most convenient measure of private productivity available quarterly.

        "32Charles Cox (1980) uses October 1973 (i.e., 1973 IV instead of 1973 II) as the beginning of the decontrol period since that was the beginning of sector\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dby\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dsector decontrol. I believe that the Phase III removal of requirements for prior approval of price increases was a major relaxation since \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d as explained below \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d the remaining profit margin ceiling was consistent with any rate of inflation. Some macroeconomic evidence supporting 1973 II instead of 1973 IV as the start of decontrol is offered below, but the issue is not crucial. The same evidence is consistent with Cox's view that the controls had no effect on price levels past 1974 II (as compared to my 1974 III) nor on growth rates past 1974 III.",
        "33Economists have traditionally argued that missed quality improvements might imply a 2 percent measured inflation even if the true price level was constant. See, for example, Ackley (1961, p. 87), Price Statistics Review Committee (1961, pp. 35\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d39), and Griliches (1961).",
