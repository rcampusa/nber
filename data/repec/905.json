        "Barro, Robert J., \"Are Government Bonds Net Wealth?\" Journal of Political Economy 82 (Nov./Dec. 1974), 1095-1117. ----- \"Reply to Buchanan and Feldstein,\" Journal of Political Economy 84 (April 1976), 343-349. __> \"The Public Debt,\" Chapter 6 of Macroeconomic Analysis, September",
        "Many of there are included in Gordon (1974) and Stein (1976). The models typically assume that consumption or private expenditure depends directly upon private wealth, with government debt included as a component of the latter. See, for example, Brunner and Meltzer (1976, p. 72). In these models, then, a bond-financed tax reduction directly increases aggregate demand.",
        "This statement presumes that intergenerational transfers are operative. A discussion of circumstances under which Barro's result is inapplicable is provided by Drazen(1978)",
        "My own arguments appear in McCallum (1980).",
        "Barro (1974) (1981) argues that neglect of these complicating features does not serve to distort the results in a predictable direction.",
        "Irrelevance of continued bond growth is assumed, without any utility-maximizing justification, in McCallum (1978).",
        "The Sidrauski model is, of course, one in which bonds and money can easily co-exist because real money balances appear as an argument of the household's within-period utility funct ion. The rationale for this appearance--which has been severely criticized by Bryant and Wallace (1980) and others\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dis that transaction costs are reduced by money balances, so that more preferred bundles of consumption and leisure can be obtained. For a rather lengthy discussion of related issues, see McCallum (1982).",
        "The limiting procedure is a modification of one described by Sargent (1979, pp. 333-335).",
        "It is true, as Gray and Salant (1981) have recently emphasized, that there are some problems for which transversality conditions such as (10b) are not necessary for optimality. That the proposed path cannot be an equilibrium in the case at hand can nevertheless be verified by observing that the representative household could, in any period, reduce its bond holdings to zero and obtain extra consumption in that period without reducing consumption in any other period (and without altering any value of m^).",
        "These include Barro (1981), Siegel (1979), and Tobin (1980), among others."
