APPENDIX 1. The British Local Government 1.A. Structure The structure of local governments in England has experienced several changes over time.",
        "In the 1990s, the Central Government's view was that the two-tier model of service provision was inefficient, and that County Councils were too distant from the needs of the population they served. Therefore a Local Government Act in 1992 in England and special laws enacted in 1994 for Scotland and Wales abolished County councils and transferred their functions to district councils, with some of the smaller districts being merged. The newly created single-tier councils were called Unitary Authorities, and had responsibility for all areas of local government.",
        "Councilors represent geographical areas within a Local Authority (Wards) and serve for four years before going up for reelection. In England, London Boroughs elect all their councilors at once, every four years. Metropolitan Authorities elect one third of their councilors in each of the three years out of four which are not county election years. In England until 2009, 18 out of the 46 Unitary Authorities and 88 of the other 239 non-Metropolitan districts elected their local councils \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093by thirds\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d. 1.B. Local Planning Responsibilities and the Role of the Center41 The planning system is articulated at the national level through the implementation of central government planning policies; at the regional or local level through development plans; and the site specific level though the determination of planning applications (development control).",
        "If permission is refused, or if the local planning authority does not determine an application within a specific time, the applicant has the right to appeal the Secretary of State and the Planning Inspectorate will handle the appeal. In 2004/2005 about 3% of all planning applications were appealed. A small number of planning applications will also be called-in each year and decided by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government. In 2005/2006 about 50 call-ins decisions were issued.42"
