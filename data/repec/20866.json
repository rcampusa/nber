The prohibition is enforced in different forms, such as incarcerating sex workers, charging individuals engaging in prostitution with a felony, or implementing prostitution diversion programs. Prostitution, however, is present in most parts of the country, in various forms. In the last 15 years, the American prostitution market has shifted from a primarily outdoor (street-based) to an indoor market (massage parlors, escort agencies, and much of the online activity) (1). The prostitution trade is estimated to gross over $14 billion a year in the US (2). A 2004 poll reports that 30% of single men over the age of 30 have paid for sex in the US (3).",
