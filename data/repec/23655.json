        "For our analysis of after-tax income, Federal income tax liabilities and credits and FICA taxes are calculated for all years using TAXSIM (Feenberg and Coutts 1993). State taxes and credits are also calculated using TAXSIM for the years 1977-2014. Prior to 1977 we calculate state taxes using IncTaxCalc (Bakija, 2008). We confirm that in 1977 net state tax liabilities generated using IncTaxCalc match very closely those generated using TAXSIM.15 All expenditure and consumption data come from the Interview component of the Consumer Expenditure (CE) Survey. The CE provides annual or annualized data for 13,728 families in 1960-1961 and 19,975 families in 1972-1973. From 1980-2011 the survey is a rotating panel that includes about 5,000 families each quarter until 1998 and about 7,500 families thereafter.",
        "Each family, or what the CE refers to as the consumer unit, reports spending on a large number of expenditure categories for up to four consecutive quarters. We use data from the 1960-1961 and 1972-1973 surveys and all quarterly waves from the first quarter of 1980 through the third quarter of 1981 and from 1984 through 2014 (some of the fourth quarter of 2014 data comes from surveys conducted in the first quarter of 2015). The 1960-1961 surveys provide data on annual expenditures collected in a single interview, while the 19721973 surveys provide data on annualized expenditures collected from quarterly interviews.",
        "Expenditures: This summary measure includes all expenditures reported in the CE Interview Survey except miscellaneous expenditures and cash contributions because some of these expenditures are not collected in all interviews. Since 1980 a subset of miscellaneous expenditures has been collected only in the fifth interview, and cash contributions are only collected in the fifth interview for surveys conducted from the first quarter of 1980 through the first quarter of 2001.",
        "Total Consumption: Consumption includes all spending in our measure of total expenditures less spending on out of pocket health care expenses, education, and payments to retirement accounts, pension plans, and social security. In addition, housing and vehicle expenditures are converted to service flows. For homeowners we subtract spending on mortgage interest, property taxes, maintenance, repairs, insurance, and other expenses, and add the reported rental equivalent of the home. For years when the rental equivalent is not reported (1960-1961 and 1980-1981 surveys), we impute a value as explained below. For those in public or subsidized housing, we impute a rental value using the procedure outlined below. For vehicle owners we subtract spending on recent purchases of new and used vehicles as well vehicle finance charges. We then added the service flow value of all vehicles owned by the family, as described below.",
        "This approach will understate total automobile flows for some families because the number of automobiles is topcoded at 2. This approach will overstate vehicle flows for families that dispose of an automobile during the survey year if this automobile is included in the total count of automobiles owned. This approach will also overstate vehicle flows for families that have owned their vehicles for an extended time, because we are predicting the value based on recent automobile purchases. Note that unlike our approach for 1980-2014, we calculate service flows only for automobiles, not for other vehicles such as trucks, motorcycles, campers, etc., because we do not have reliable information on the total number of each of these types of vehicles owned.",
        "Assuming that desired health expenditures by those with few resources can be characterized by Cobb-Douglas preferences with a coefficient of 0.33 on health and 0.67 on other goods, only health expenditures up to one-third of total expenditures are included. This compromise values health coverage at cost for those with substantial resources as they likely spend less than one-third of consumption on health, but at much less than cost for those with few other resources. Because information on health insurance coverage is not available in 1960-1961, 1972-1973 and from 1984 to 1987, we do not report consumption measures that include health insurance for these years.",
        "We follow a similar procedure to impute rental equivalent for the 1960-61 sample, except we estimate the coefficients in Equation A.1 using the 1972-73 CE Survey. Also, the 1960s surveys provide information on the range within which the value of the home falls, rather than a continuous value. So when estimating Equation A.1 using the 1972-73 surveys, we map the reported value of the home into the same ranges (in real terms) as are available in the 1960-61 surveys, and then include indicator variables for these home value ranges in place of the reported home value (hval).",
        "Also, we do not observe whether a consumer unit resides in public or subsidized housing prior to 1982, so a rental equivalent value for those in such housing is not included in consumption prior to 1982. Estimates of the rental equivalent for those in public or subsidized housing in the mid-1980s are small relative to total consumption, suggesting that this exclusion is not likely to significantly bias our estimates for changes in inequality. Finally, the availability of information on vehicles also changes during our sample period as we noted above. C. Measures of Income in the CPS CPS respondents report annual measures of money income for the previous calendar year.",
        "After-Tax Money Income: adds to money income the value of tax credits such as the EITC, and subtracts state and federal income taxes and payroll taxes. Federal income tax liabilities and credits and FICA taxes are calculated for all years using TAXSIM (Feenberg and Coutts 1993). State taxes and credits are also calculated using TAXSIM for the years 1977-2005.",
        "Housing Subsidies: The Census imputes a value of housing subsidies for households that report living in public housing or receiving a public rent subsidy. The value of the subsidy is calculated as follows. Using data from the 1985 American Housing Survey (AHS), reported rent for unsubsidized two-bedroom housing units is regressed on housing characteristics.",
        "Employer Contributions to Health Insurance: The Census imputes a value of health insurance for persons who were covered by an employer health insurance plan. Using data from the 1977 National Medical Care Expenditures Survey, the value of the employer contribution was imputed as a function of observable characteristics including earnings, fulltime /part-time, industry, occupation, sector, public/private, residence, and personal characteristics of the worker such as age, race, marital status, and education, and information on whether the employer paid all, part, or none of the cost of health insurance as reported in the supplement.",
        "Table 3: Total Consumption Elasticities of Well-Measured Consumption Model Sample Restriction Year and Sample Size Independent Variable None 1980, N= 19,073 Log Total Consumption 0.928 1.169 (0.001) (0.001) 1988, N= 20,294 Log Total Consumption 0.810 0.967 (0.005) (0.008) 1980, N= 14,531 Log Total Consumption 0.944 1.167 (0.001) (0.002) 1988, N= 15,596 Log Total Consumption 0.829 0.997 (0.009) (0.013) Dependent Variable Notes: All data are from the Consumer Expenditure Interview Survey. Wellmeasured consumption includes spending on food at home, rent (for renters), rental equivalent (for homeowners or those in government or subsidized housing), utilities, service flows from owned vehicles, and spending on gasoline and motor oil. Income and consumption are adjusted for differences in family size using the NAS recommended equivalence scale."
