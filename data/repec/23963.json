See, for example, Huggett et al., 2010; Keane and Wolpin, 1997; and Storesletten et al., 2004. Hall and Jones (2007) use a model with representative cohorts in which spending on health care can extend lifespans. They show that the rising share of health spending is the optimal allocation along the income growth trend. For example, individuals may have strong incentives to improve their health but if this technology is ineffective, their demand for medical care will be low.",
