Although the papers cited here estimate reduced forms of models using adjustments costs that are quadratic in net employment change, there exist papers examining other forms of adjustment cost, notably costs that depend on gross employment changes, and papers that perform structural estimation. See, for example, Hamermesh (1993b), Hamermesh and Pfann (1992), Pfann and Palm (1993).",
