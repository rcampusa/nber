        "We begin with the universe of individuals in the Death Master (also known as the Data Master1) file produced by the Social Security Administration and housed alongside tax records. This file includes information on year of birth and gender for all persons in the United States with a Social Security Number or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN).38 To construct our sample of children, we begin from the set of individuals born in the 1980-1991 cohorts. We measure parent and child income, college attendance, and all other variables using data from the IRS Databank, a balanced panel covering all individuals in the Death Master file who were not deceased as of 1996.",
        "For each child, we define the parent(s) as the person(s) who claim the child as a dependent on a 1040 tax form in the year the child turns 17. Note that the parent(s) of the child are not necessarily biological parents, as it is possible for custodians (regardless of family status) to claim a child if the child resides with them.39 If parents are married but filing separately, we assign the child both parents. We identify children\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s parents at age 17 because our goal is to measure the economic resources of the child\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s family around the time he or she attends college. We do not match children to parents at later ages (e.g., 18 or 19) because many children leave home after age 17 (at differential rates across income groups), creating scope for selection bias.",
        "Details on Income Definitions. As discussed in Section II, in our baseline analysis, we measure children\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s earnings as the sum of individual wage income and net self-employment income (if positive) for year 2014. Here we provide further details regarding those definitions, which are more complex than our parent income definitions because we must apportion total income reported on the tax return across individuals to measure income at the individual level.",
        "Fourth, we describe how we identify and remove a small set of colleges who have incomplete 1098-T data. Finally, we summarize annual enrollment counts for our college attendance definitions.",
        "Data Sources. We combine two data sources to measure student-level college attendance: Form 1098-T records and National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) Pell grant recipient records.43 Note that neither data source relies on the student or the student\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s family to file a tax return, and neither data source contains information on course of study or degree attainment.",
        "Form 1098-T is an information return that is submitted by colleges to the U.S. Treasury Department.",
        "Hence, our decision to split such wage income equally across spouses. 43 The full NSLDS data include data on recipients of Pell grants and federally subsidized loans. We use only the Pell grant data in our main attendance measures because almost all non-Pell students in the NSLDS data already appear in the 1098-T data, and using the non-Pell NSLDS records would likely generate more erroneous assignments due to timing inconsistencies across the two types of data (see below) than it would correct missing data.",
        "payments or scholarships received for the student during the calendar year. Title IV institutions include all colleges and universities as well as many vocational colleges and other postsecondary institutions, all of which we refer to as \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093colleges.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d Colleges are indexed in the 1098-T data by the college\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s Employer Identification Number (EIN) and its ZIP code. We use 1098-T data for students during calendar years 1999-2013.",
        "We use the NSLDS Pell data to impute missing 1098-T data and thereby construct comprehensive student-college-year attendance records 1999-2013.45 Doing so requires homogeneous college and time-period definitions across the two data sources, but the two data sources differ in these definitions. The next two subsections detail our methods for homogenizing those definitions and constructing comprehensive student-college-year attendance records.",
        "(positive values below 1002). 2.7% of NSLDS Pell records and 1.1% of 1098-T records from 19992013 are assigned Super OPEID-1.48 Imputing Calendar Year Attendance Records for Pell Recipients. The vast majority of studentcollege -year attendance observations appear in the 1098-T data, which measure attendance by calendar year. Therefore, after using our Super OPEID crosswalk to assign a consistent college definition to every NSLDS Pell record and ever 1098-T record, we use information from the NSLDS on dates of attendance to impute missing 1098-T data, thereby yielding comprehensive attendance records by calendar year from 1999-2013.",
        "We map the NSLDS data to calendar years as follows. For every NSLDS Pell student at a Super OPEID x and a Pell award enrollment start date lying in calendar year t, we impute a 1098-T for the student at Super OPEID x in calendar year t. Then, for every NSLDS Pell student at a Super OPEID x and a Pell enrollment start date in the second half of calendar year t and with a Pell grant amount equal to more than 50% the student\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s maximum eligible Pell amount in the award year, we additionally impute a 1098-T for the student at Super OPEID x in calendar year t + 1. Finally, we remove duplicate records. The remainder of this subsection explains the logic underlying this imputation strategy further. The NSLDS Pell data contain the start date of the enrollment period covered by the Pell grant.",
        "If the college had submitted 1098-Ts on behalf of a given Pell student whose enrollment period began in calendar year t, the college would likely have submitted a 1098-T for the student in calendar year t (had it been required to do so). Thus, for every NSLDS Pell student with Super OPEID x and an enrollment start date in calendar year t, we impute a 1098-T for the student with Super OPEID x and calendar year t.",
        "There are no public measures of calendar-year Pell attendance that can be used to directly validate the imputation procedure described above. However, indirect validation methods suggest a high degree of fidelity. The share of our students on a Pell grant in the average calendar year is very highly correlated with, and similar in levels to, approximations to annual Pell student shares based on publicly available data. Moreover, at colleges with substantial numbers of students on Pell grants, the imputation algorithm adds almost no net students to 1098-T attendance records\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dconsistent with these colleges issuing 1098-T forms for all students regardless of their tuition billing status and with our algorithm only imputing 1098-Ts in calendar years that the student was in fact enrolled. 48 The rate of 1098-T assignment to Super OPEID-1 is 11.2% in 1999 and is between 0.04% and 2.2% from 20002013.",
        "The 1999 1098-T data lack the ZIP code of the college, so in that year only, we assign Super OPEID using the subset of EINs from the Super OPEID crosswalk that map to a single Super OPEID regardless of ZIP code.",
        "Removing College-Years with Incomplete 1098-T Data. A small number of college-year observations have incomplete 1098-T data, either because of errors in administrative records or because of changes in EIN\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s and reporting procedures.49 We discard these defective college-years by flagging them using two methods based on counts of total students. The counts described below are constructed using the total counts of forms 1098-T and Pell grants for all children born in 1980-1991, regardless of a successful link to parents and regardless of whether the student attends several institutions.",
        "Enrollment Counts for Attendance Measures. The steps described above yield a student-collegeyear level dataset that provides a complete record of college attendance in the U.S. during calendar years 1999-2013 for children born between 1980-1991. This dataset contains 207.6 million observations.",
        "Using this dataset, we construct the three measures of college attendance\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dthe most-attended college (our primary measure), age-20 college, and first-attended college\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dfollowing the definitions given in Section II.B. In what follows, we document the impact of the restrictions imposed in each 49 Most of these cases are college-year cells with zero 1098-Ts in the database. For example, in the years when the 1098-T first began to be collected (1999-2002), a number of small universities do not have any records at all in the database. In addition, some universities switch from reporting data separately for each campus to using a single EIN-ZIP for all their campuses, which creates inconsistencies in their data across years. 50 For example, we measure college attendance using data from 1999 to 2002 for children born in the 1980 cohort.",
        "We measure college attendance starting with the year the student turns 19 because the 1098-T data are only available starting in 1999, making 19 the first observed age for the 1980 birth cohort. Omitting the year in which children turn 18 is not consequential because very few children attend college only in the calendar year in which they turn 18; for instance, only 1.6% of the children in the 1982 birth cohort attended college in the year they turn 18 but not between the ages of 19-22.",
        "definition on sample sizes and report the share of observations obtained from the 1098-T vs. NSLDS datasets.",
        "To construct the most-attended definition, we first restrict the full dataset to attendance between ages 19-22, which leaves 114.6 million records. Condensing the student-college-year data to the student level using the most-attended definition (see Section II.B) leaves 33.1 million student-level records. Eliminating students we cannot match to parents or whose parents had negative income leaves 31.0 million records. Finally, restricting to birth cohorts 1980-1982 (as we do in our main analysis) leaves 6.7 million records; including non-college-goers in this sample yields a sample size of 10.8 million children.",
        "As described in Section II.D of Chetty et al. (2017), we impute income statistics and attendance for colleges with missing data for the 1980-82 cohorts using data from the 1983 and 1984 cohorts.",
        "9.2% of our annual attendance records for students aged 19-22 were not in the 1098-T data and appeared only in the NSLDS Pell data. Using our most-attended college attendance measure, 4.1% of the students in our analysis sample were not in the 1098-T data and originally appeared only in the NSLDS Pell data. The NSLDS Pell data has a smaller impact at the student level than the student-year level because many students attend a given college for multiple years and receive a 1098-T form in at least one of those years.",
        "with weakly positive income, we have 11.0 million records for 10.8 million children. Finally, we impute income statistics and attendance for colleges with missing data for the 1980-82 cohorts as described above, leaving us with a 11.3 million person sample underlying our age-20 analysis.",
        "We show that income distributions in the ACS are very similar to those in the tax data if we use the same household unit and income definitions. We focus on the annual family income of children aged 15 in 2000 (Panel A of Appendix Table II) and children aged 15 in 2006 (Panel B). We begin by describing how we define income and family units in the two datasets.",
        "Tax Data. The unit of observation for family income is the tax unit. As described in Appendix A, the tax unit, i.e. the child\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s parents, are defined as the person(s) who claim the child as a 53 The IPEDS counts are 3% larger than our counts on average, which likely reflects international students not included in our sample. 54 Our methodology could be further tested and refined by linking external data on college attendance\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dfor instance, from the National Student Clearinghouse\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dto the tax records, as in Hoxby (2015).",
        "D. Stability of Children\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s Earnings Ranks In our analysis sample comprising the 1980-1982 birth cohorts, we measure earnings at ages 32-34. Measuring children\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s earnings ranks when they are too young can potentially yield misleading estimates of lifetime earnings ranks because children with high lifetime earnings have steeper earnings profiles (e.g., Haider and Solon 2006; Solon 1999). This issue may be especially acute for analyses of earnings outcomes at elite colleges, where many students go on to pursue advanced degrees. In this appendix, we show that ages 32-34 are sufficiently late in a child\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s life to obtain a reliable measure of children\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s ranks at all colleges. Of course, individuals\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 earnings levels continue to rise sharply during their thirties, but a rank-preserving fanning out of the earnings distribution does not affect the rank-based analysis of Section IV.",

The mean SAT and ACT scores for children in our sample for whom we observe a score is 989 and 21.8, which are each roughly comparable to the mean scores of 1026 (reported by the College Board) and 20.9 (reported by ACT) for the high school graduating class of 2004.",
        "G. Replication of Dale and Krueger (2014) In this appendix, we show that our data yield estimates of the return to attending a highly selective college that are similar to those estimated by Dale and Krueger (2014), and in particular exhibit higher rates of return to attending more selective colleges for students from lower-income families.",
        "We replicate the key specifications estimated by Dale and Krueger in Appendix Table X. We focus on a set of 31 highly selective colleges in the College and Beyond sample and estimate a set of specifications that parallel those in Columns 3 and 4 in Table 2 of Dale and Krueger (2014).58 The dependent variable is log earnings, excluding observations with earnings below $13,822 in 2007 dollars ($15,800 in 2015 dollars), as in Dale and Krueger\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s analysis. The key independent variable is the mean SAT score (divided by 100) of the college in 2001, a proxy for the college\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s selectivity.",
        "H. Relationship between ACT/SAT Scores and Earnings We follow Dale and Krueger (2002), Hoxby and Avery (2013), and many others in using standardized test scores as a proxy for academic credentials. Test scores are widely used as proxies for academic qualifications because they are widely available and because previous work has shown that they are predictive of later outcomes (e.g., Sackett et al. 2012, Kurlaender and Cohen 2019), although the extent to which that predictive power comes simply from correlations with demographics such as parental income and race is debated (Rothstein 2004). In this appendix, we re-evaluate the relationship between SAT scores and earnings using our longitudinal data. We use our baseline 58 The original College and Beyond sample includes 34 colleges; we do not have data for Morehouse, Tulane, and Williams.",

The series in solid circles plots the fraction who attend college based on the union of the NSLDS and 1098-T data, the measure of attendance we use in our empirical analysis. This figure is constructed directly from the individual-level microdata."
