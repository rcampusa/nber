        "Similarly, for servers, a unit of observation is defined as a manufacturer and family/model-type. We also distinguish by operating system, since (unlike PCs) many servers run nonWindows operating systems. These server operating systems are divided into six non-Windows categories: Netware, Unix, Linux, VMS, OS390/400 and a residual. For servers, key characteristics are also RAM, the number of rack slots41, whether the server was rack optimized (racks were an innovation that enhanced server flexibility), motherboard type (e.g. Symmetric Parallel Processing - SMP), and chip type (CISC, RISC or IA32). For more discussion of the datasets and characteristics see International Data Corporation (1998, 1999a,b) and Van Reenen (2004, 2006).",
        "42For PC operating systems we also experimented with using the quality adjusted price index of Abel et al (2007).",
        "43This was found to be the most important characteristic in the analysis of server demand in Van Reenen (2004). We experimented with other measures of server quality such as speed, but these did not give any significant extra explanatory power in the regressions."
