        "Hummels and Skiba (2004) find evidence supporting the Alchian-Allen conjecture that export quality increases with trade costs. This potentially raises concerns that trade costs may be correlated with variety quality. However, the exclusion restriction remains valid as long as transport costs a\u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00ac\u00e2\u0082\u00acect average quality and not the time-specific deviation, \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00becht. Since the nest share term is also endogenous, we use the number of varieties within HS product to instrument this term (Berry et al., 1995)"
