        "Then, replace for sk j from (46) to obtain pk j = p0 k j. (52) Therefore, the price at which a \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6rm that exports to k markets sells domestically is pk 0 = p0 k, and the price at which a non-exporter sells domestically is p0 0 = p0. This structure has the immediate implications that \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6rms set higher prices in larger markets, and that \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6rms who export to more destinations set higher prices in every market. Both features are consistent with evidence from Manova (2012).",
        "Similarly, the value to \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6rm j when it hires a worker from \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6rm i, Ji;j, is given by ( + + ePk:vi vk ) Ji;j = rj !i;j + e Z k:vi vk vj Jk;jdPk + dJi;j: (56) In this expression, rj is revenue per worker generated in \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6rm j. This revenue per worker is allowed to change over time. In the model, the \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6rm controls the process of rj. Since rj is allowed to change, both (55) and (56) include the dynamic terms dWi;j and dJi;j. These terms are absent in Postel-Vinay and Robin (2002) where \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6rm\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 s productivity is \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6xed."
