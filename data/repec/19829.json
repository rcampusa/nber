        "4.3.2 Imposing Random Matching While Holding Fixed Married Female LaborForce Participation The impact of random matching on inequality can be interacted with changes in the laborforce participation decisions of married females. The procedure for imposing random matching in 1960 is outlined in the previous section. Suppose that in addition to imposing random matching in 1960, married female labor-force particpation is \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6xed at its 2005 level. How can this be implemented?

        "4.4 Standardizing Contingency Tables Mosteller (1968) suggests that when comparing two contingency tables they should \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6rst be standardized so that they both have the same marginal distributions associated with the rows and columns. Take a 5 5 table. It can be standardized so that each element of the two marginal distributions is 1=5. This can be done by employing the Sinkhorn-Knopp (1967) algorithm, which iteratively scales each row and column. Standardization preserves the core pattern of association in a contingency table. For example, Tan, Kumar and Srivastava (2004) note that such standardization does not aect the odds ratios in a contingency table, a typical measure used to gauge the pattern of association between variables.",
        "4.4.2 The Standardized Tables The two resulting standardized tables for 1960 and 2005 are shown in Table A1. The diagonal elements in the 2005 table are larger than in the 1960 one. Assortative mating has increased.",
        "There is no need to standardize the tables so that each element of the marginal distributions is 1=5. One can standardize the 1960 table so that its marginal distributions coincide with those in the data for 2005, or vice versa. This way the standardized table for 1960 (2005) can be compared with the one from the data for 2005 (1960). Both tables will have the same 2005 (1960) marginal distributions. This results are shown in Table A2. By comparing the standardized table for 1960 with the one in the data for 2005 (see Table 1 in the text) it can be seen that assortative mating has increased. Once again, the diagonal elements are larger in the table for 2005. Likewise, a comparison of the standardized table for 2005 with the one in the data for 1960 shows an increase in assortative mating (again, see Table 1 in the text).",

        "4.5 A Brief Literature Review The increase in assortative mating in the U.S. has also been examined by Hou and Myles (2008), Lam (1997), Qian and Preston (1993), and Schwartz and Mare (2005) to name a few papers. Siow (2013) documents an increase in educational homogamy, but not a general increase in positive assortative matching. Lam (1997) and Schwartz (2010) discuss the relationship between assortative mating and income inequality. Cancian and Reed (1998, 1999) also focus on the role that married female-labor force participation plays in the relationship between assortative mating and income inequality.",
