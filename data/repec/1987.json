Johnson (1977, pp. 471-476) have an excellent discussion of the thrust of pre-Keynesian monetary theory and its emphasis on the dynamics of the transition period. 6 Clark Warburton (1951) details the apparent ignorance of an astonishingly large number of prominent economists of the period to the factual evidence on money supply changes in the 1920s and 1930s. (See, especially, his note 10). This characterization is taken from a lecture by Milton Friedman. g",
