They are published in Manufacturers' Shipments, Inventories and Orders. Our sample begins in 1967 because that is the earliest date at which consistent, seasonally unadjusted data on production and shipments are available by 2-digit industry.",
        "As stated in the text the price series are the wholesale price indices compiled by BLS using a different commodity classification system than the SIC. Table A2 lists the particular series we use to proxy for the prices of 2-digit industry output. BLS has recently produced price series based on the SIC codes; unfortunately, at the 2-digit level these series go back only to January, 1984.",
