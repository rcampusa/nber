        "Our matched sample may not be fully representative of the immigrant and native born populations from which they are drawn. In particular, men with uncommon names are more likely to be successfully linked between Censuses, and the commonness of one\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s name could potentially be correlated with socio-economic status. We assess this possibility by comparing men in the cross-sectional and panel samples in 1920. By definition, men in both the panel and repeated cross sections must have survived and remained in the US until 1920. Thus, by 1920, up to sampling error, differences between the panel and the repeated cross sections must be due to an imperfect matching procedure.",
        "(4) After matching each sample in 1900 separately to 1910 and 1920, we create our final dataset by restricting to men who were located both in 1910 and 1920.",
        "The Ancestry.com search engine aims to maximize potential \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00cb\u009chits\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 under the assumption that individual users can identify their relatives from a longer list by hand. To this end, it uses many approaches to convert names into their phonetic equivalents and applies a very lax matching rule. For small sending countries, we instead match the complete 1900 population to the complete 1910 and 1920 populations obtained from Ancestry.com.",
        "We include men from all European sending countries with at least 10,000 migrants living in the US in 1900, with the exception of Czechoslovakia, Hungary, the Netherlands Poland and Romania. Altogether, our sample represents 91 percent of European immigrants living in the US in 1900. Poland and Czechoslovakia were removed entirely from the 1910 Census as options for the birth place variable and then restored in 1920 after both countries gained their independence in 1918. Although Hungary and Romania remained birthplace options in all years, their borders changed substantially between 1910 and 1920. Migrants from the Netherlands reported varied (often provinciallevel) birthplaces on the Census, making it difficult to find these individuals in Ancestry.com and follow them over time.",
