        "Appendix Table A5 returns to the income transmission concept for \u00c3\u00a2\u00c5\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u009cc, but explores two alternative measures. One, labeled \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093later,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d is the measure computed by CHKS for the younger, 1983-5 birth cohorts, with adult incomes measured at younger ages. The second, \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093causal\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d measure is constructed by Chetty and Hendren (forthcoming) based on families that move from one CZ to another. Three dependent variables are considered: Children\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s adult family income (in percentiles, 0-100), children\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s 12th grade math scores (also in percentiles), and the child\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s years of completed education as of age 26 (multiplied by 100). Results iv are generally similar across mobility measures; if anything, the alternative measures yield weaker relationships with ELS transmission from parental income to children\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s achievement and attainment.",
        "Appendix Table A5. Alternative income transmission measures Notes: Columns 1, 4, and 7 correspond, respectively, to Table 8, column 1; Table 4, column 5; and Table 6, column 4. Columns 2, 5, and 8 use an alternative income transmission measure computed from the 1983-5 birth cohorts. Columns 3,6, and 9 use Chetty and Hendren's (forthcoming) \"causal\" measure based on children who move across CZs."
