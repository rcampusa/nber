In districts with over 10% of employment in cotton textiles in 1861, the average female labor force participation rate for women over 20 was 55% and women made up 38% of the labor force.",

        "The recession also generated an unprecedented institutional response aimed at relieving the suffering in cotton districts. Contemporary reports largely credit public relief efforts for the fact that no widespread famine occurred during the recession.71 Relief funds came in two main forms. First, funds were provided at the local level through the Poor Law Boards, the primary system for poor relief in Britain during this period.72 However, because Poor Law funds were associated with pauperism, provided funds for only the barest level of subsistence, and required \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00c5\u0093labour tests\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u009d such as rockbreaking, which cotton workers found demeaning, there is evidence that workers tried to avoid drawing on this stigmatized source of support (Kiesling, 1996; Boyer, 1997).",

These funds could take the form of cash, vouchers, and in-kind assistance, and came from 71 For example, the Registrar General\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s report of 1864 states that (p. xv), \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00c5\u0093that famine did not bear the fruit which in the history of nations it has too often borne, the spectacle of thousands struck by fever and death,\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u009dis mainly due to that legal provision for the poor which Christian civilization has established, and to the spontaneous munificence of a people amongst whom the seeds of charity have been liberally scattered.\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u009d 72 These funds were provided by taxes levied on local property owners.

Since the location of industries is highly persistent over time, we use use data from 1851 rather than from 1861 to avoid the possibility that our measure may be influenced by events occurring in cotton districts at the time of enumeration.",

        "The location-of-birth data are only available at the county level, so in Figure 13, which is reproduced from Hanlon (2017), we compare the largest cotton textile county, Lancashire, with the neighboring wool textile county of Yorkshire. The figure indicates that the number of Yorkshire residents who were born in Lancashire increased substantially from 1861-1871, while the number of Lancashire residents born in Yorkshire stagnated. This suggests an out-migration of Lancashire residents during the U.S. Civil War, as well as reduced in-migration to Lancashire.",

        "Next, we consider some results that help us think about how migration patterns varied across age groups. Figure 14 describes the share of the population in each age category up to 79 in the cotton districts. The most prominent feature in this graph is that there was a substantial excess of young workers in the 20-24 age group in cotton districts in 1861, which had largely disappeared by 1871. This suggests that the migration response to the shock was strongest among young adults.",

Cotton districts are identified as those with over 10 percent of workers employed in cotton textile production in the 1851 Census, as in the main analysis.",
        "An alternative view of the same pattern is provided in Figure 15, which compares the share of population by age group in cotton districts, nearby districts, and all other districts. This is done for 1861 in the top panel and for 1871 in the bottom panel. In 1861, cotton districts had a much larger share of young workers, particularly in the 15-19 and 20-24 age groups, than the other districts. By 1871, most of that difference had disappeared. It is also worth noting that in 1871, the nearby districts had substantially more population in the 25-29 and 30-34 age groups than the \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00c5\u0093allother \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u009d districts. This pattern is consistent with the migration of workers who were in the 15-19 and 20-24 age group and living in cotton districts in 1861, into nearby districts where, by 1871, they appear in the 25-29 and 30-34 age groups.",

        "Table 15 describes mortality rates by age group. We focus on mortality rates in 1970 in order to take advantage of the census population figures in that year and we use only data from the counties used in the main analysis to construct these figures. The main take-away from Table 15 is that mortality rates among those in their 20s and 30s were much lower than for older age groups. This is an important fact because, as discussed in the next appendix section, this group was the most likely to migrate in response to the coal boom.",

The additional states we include here are Maryland, Tennessee, and Virginia. Dark colors indicate counties that experienced an increase in in-migration in the coal boom decade, 1970-1980, relative to the decade before.",
        "Figure 19: Difference in net migration with additional states Figure 20 presents maps showing net migration based on the error of closure in the decade before the coal boom, the decade covering most of the boom, and the decade after the boom. Light colors indicate counties experiencing net out-migration. We can see that the coal counties experienced a clear pattern of out-migration during the decades before and after the boom, but that this pattern of out-migration completely disappeared during the 1970-1980 period.",

        "Regressions are weighted by interpolated county population. et al. (2005) in treating 1970-1977 as the main coal boom period, a look at the price data shown in Figure 6 suggests that one could alternatively think of the boom as lasting well into the 1980s. In Table 20 we look at results using two alternative definitions of the boom period, one stretching to 1982, when prices begin to fall, and the second lasting until 1988, when coal prices had returned near to their pre-boom level. In general, we can see that these extended periods deliver results that are similar to those obtained in the main text. In particular, we continue to find that results are highly sensitive to assumptions about population. The main differences in these results is that, when the period is extended to 1988, our preferred specification in Column 6b provides some evidence that mortality increased in the coal counties.",

        "For children, we can see that the number of deaths are falling in both locations although there is an increase in deaths around 1971 that is more pronounced in the coal counties. One likely explanation for this is that births in the coal counties increased in the early 1970s relative to the nearby counties. For young adults mortality is quite flat and similar across the two groups of counties, though there is some evidence of higher mortality in the coal counties towards the end of the boom and in the following years.",
        "Among working age adults over 24, the number of deaths was smoothly decreasing in both sets of counties across the study period, though this decline was somewhat more rapid in the coal counties. Among older adults, both locations experienced a Figure 22: Mortality by age categories in the coal and control counties Children 0-14 Young adults 15-24 Prime age adults 25-54 Older adults over 55 brief increase in mortality from 1972-1974. This timing corresponds to the recession of 1973-75 caused by the oil embargo and provides further suggestive evidence that mortality may increase, rather than decrease, during recessions, particularly for the elderly. The number of deaths also increased in both locations starting in the 1980s.",
        "Overall, there does not appear to be any clear changes in relative mortality between the treatment and control counties during the coal boom period.78 78 As mentioned earlier in the appendix, it is not possible to run reliable econometric analysis with age-specific data on the coal boom, since age-disaggregated mortality data are only available beginning in 1968, leaving us with a very short pre-boom period."
