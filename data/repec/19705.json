        "Note that since the posterior variance is deterministic (A 1 t+1 = A 1 t + 1), we can replace the state variable At with time, t. Thus, the parameter uncertainty model is nonstationary. Building on Johnson (2007), who consider the simpler case of power utility, we develop a solution methodology for the case of parameter uncertainty and Epstein-Zin preferences where we solve the model using a backwards recursion from the known-parameters (t = 1) boundary economies.25 In particular, the log wealth-consumption ratio, pc, is found for each t on a grid for t 2 ; using the recursion: epc( t;t) = E h e ct+1+( 1) ln(exp(pc( t+1;t+1))+1)j t; t; A0; ; i ; (70) where the evolution equations of the state variables are t+1 = t + At p 1+At ~",
        "In sum, with an EIS greater than one, the model delivers excess return volatility and a higher risk premium than in the case when EIS = 1, as analyzed earlier. Further, the real term structure is, except for in cases with very high parameter uncertainty, essentially \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a1 at. Again, this is in sharp contrast to the objective long-run risks assumed in Bansal and Yaron (2004), which implies a strongly downward-sloping yield curve. A low EIS generates a counter-factual negative risk premium and also tends to deliver return volatility that\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 s lower than dividend volatility, which is strongly counter-factual (see, e.g., Shiller (1980), Campbell and Shiller (1987)).",
