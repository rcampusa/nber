        "FOOTNOTES 1. Of course, Friedman and Schwartz (1963b) were not the first to perceive a link between monetary contraction and the Great Depression: Currie (1934) made the same case, essentially in real time. Nor did Friedman and Schwartz\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s (1963a) theory of money and business cycles develop in a total vacuum: Indeed, their paper begins by acknowledging an intellectual debt to Irving Fisher\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s (1923) earlier analysis, describing business cycles as \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093a dance of the dollar.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d See Bordo and Rockoff (2013) for a comprehensive discussion of Fisher\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s influence on Friedman\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s monetary economics.",
        "2. It should be noted that early attempts to re-introduce nominal variables and monetary nonneutralities into the real business cycle framework, including those by Cho and Cooley (1995), Cooley and Hansen (1995), and King and Watson (1996), did describe monetary policy through its effects on money growth; these specifications, however, were largely supplanted by others that depict the central bank as managing a short-term interest rate according to some variant of the Taylor (1993) rule. Nelson (2008) represents a more recent effort to re-establish the role of money in determining the steady-state rate of inflation in the New Keynesian model, while Benati (2009) and Sargent and Surico (2011) characterize empirically the long-run relations between money growth and inflation in the U.S., U.K., and several other countries and clarify the circumstances under which the quantity-theoretic link emphasized by Nelson ought to become evident in the data.",
        "3. Laidler (2015) presents an overview of \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093three revolutions\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d in macroeconomic thought, which are relevant to the theme of this paper.",
        "4. In a previous version of this paper, available as Belongia and Ireland (2013), we also display results using alternative measures of Divisia money constructed by Anderson and Jones (2011).",
        "As explained by Barnett et al. (2013), the Anderson-Jones Divisia measures differ from theirs in the choice of the benchmark return that is compared to each monetary asset\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s own rate of return in computing the user, or opportunity, cost of holding that liquid asset instead of the illiquid alternative. Barnett et al. argue that the choice of the benchmark rate matters little in the construction of the quantity aggregate. Choice of the benchmark rate is important, however, if one wants to consider more specifically the fluctuations in the user cost \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c or price dual \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c to the Divisia quantity aggregate as, for example, Belongia and Ireland (2006) do. Consistent with this argument, our earlier results using the Anderson-Jones quantity data are very similar to those that we obtain with Barnett\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s series here.",
        "5. Estrella and Mishkin (1997) is but one of many previous studies to have dismissed a role for money in either monetary policymaking or forecasting after finding only weak statistical links between income or inflation and simple-sum measures of the U.S. money supply. It is worth noting that Hendrickson\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s (2014) replication study overturns the results in Estrella and Mishkin after replacing simple-sum with Divisia measures of money.",
        "6. The \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093Barnett Critique\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d is the conjecture that the failure to find significant relations between the quantity of money and aggregates fluctuations may be due more to errors in the measurement of money than instability in the underlying relationships themselves. This terminology was coined by Chrystal and MacDonald (1994).",
        "7. Another illustration can be found in the upper panel of Figure 1, which shows slower growth for Divisia M1 during the early 1980s. This divergence from the growth rate of simple-sum M1 can explain why Friedman\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s (1983, 1985) warnings of renewed inflation were in error. The bottom panel of Figure 1 shows that the growth rate of Divisia M2 was slower than its simplesum counterpart in advance of the recessions that occurred in the early 1980s, 1991-1992, and, most recently, 2007-2009.",
        "8. In the previous version of this paper, Belongia and Ireland (2013), we use the HodrickPrescott (1997) filter, instead, to isolate the cyclical component of each series. Consistent with Baxter and King\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s (1999) own findings, we find that their band-pass filter and the HodrickPrescott filter produce very similar results.",
        "9. As noted above, we follow Baxter and King (1999) by approximating the ideal band pass filter for business cycle frequencies with a two-sided, weighted average of twelve quarterly leads and lags. Thus, the series used to compute the correlations between business cycle components in this table run from 1970:1 through 2010:4, although these filtered series are constructed with data that span the entire period from 1967:1 through 2013:4."
