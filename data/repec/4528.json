        "The same study found that only 4.7% of retailers used the subminimum, very close to Katz and Krueger's (1992) estimate. Results from the Department of Labor study were reported in BNA (1993).",

        "The same series are shown in Card (1992a), Figure 2.",
        "We should point out that in a subsequent paper Neumark and Wascher (1993) estimate the same model using the same data, but treat their \"enrollment rate\" variable as endogenous. This does not solve their problem because the employment equation is mis-specified if it includes the improperly measured enrollment rate."
