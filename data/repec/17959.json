        "Wright, J. (2010). Why do merchants accept payment cards? Review of Network Economics, 9, Article 1. A Appendix: An illustrative model of sports card conventions Competition among sports card conventions can be summarized as the number of competitors that a convention faces in the same time frame within a specific distance. However solving a theoretical model that allows for variation in both the number of platforms and distance between platforms is a challenge. Like the existing theoretical literature on two-sided markets, we restrict our model to have two platforms and and we use the distance between platforms to proxy for the level competition. In Section 4 , we explain how we interpret predictions from this model in the context of sports card conventions. See footnote 12 as well.",
