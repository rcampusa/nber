Returns are the cumulative return on the stock minus an industry-size matched portfolio. We match on 4 digit SIC and quintiles of market cap from six months prior to the event. Trades are from Senators 2012-2019. Buy and hold abnormal returns are the returns on the stock cumulated minus returns on the CRSP index cumulated. We equal weight trades as of day 0 and do not rebalance. Missing returns for a stock are replaced with the industry-size matched return.",

Returns are from the day of the trade. Abnormal returns are calculated 5 different ways. In the first three rows we calculate the stocks buy and hold return relative to 1) the CRSP Value weighted index, 2) an industry-size benchmark using 4 digit SIC and quintiles of lagged 6 month market cap, 3) the DGTW benchmark using quintiles of momentum*size*book-market. In the final two rows we cumulate abnormal daily returns using the Fama French and Carhart models. We use the WRDS event tool to calculate factor loadings using preevent window data.",
