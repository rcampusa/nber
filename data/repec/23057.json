        "We measure discounting biases with respect to money using the Convex Time Budgets (CTB) method created by Andreoni and Sprenger (2012a). In our version, fielded in ALP module 315 (the first of our two surveys), subjects make 24 decisions, allocating 100 hypothetical tokens each between (weakly) smaller-sooner and larger-later amounts. See Data Appendix Figure 1 for an example. The 24 decisions are spread across 4 different screens with 6 decisions each. Each screen varies start date (today or 5 weeks from today) x delay length (5 weeks or 9 weeks); each decision within a screen offers a different yield on saving. Among the 1,515 individuals who take our first survey, 1,502 subjects make at least one CTB choice, and the 1,422 who complete at least the first and last decisions on each of the 4 screens comprise our CTB sample.",

        "B. Present- or Future-Biased Discounting (Food) In light of evidence that discounting can differ within-subject across domains (e.g., Augenblick, Niederle, and Sprenger 2015), we also obtain a coarse measure of discounting biases for consumption per se, by asking two questions that follow Read and van Leeuwen (1998) : \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093Now imagine that you are given the choice of receiving one of two snacks for free, [right now/five weeks from now].

        "C. Inconsistency with General Axiom of Revealed Preference (and dominance avoidance) Our third and fourth behavioral factors follow Choi et al. (2014), which measures choice inconsistency with standard economic rationality. Choice inconsistency could indicate a tendency to make poor (costly) decisions in field contexts; indeed, Choi et al. (2014) find that more choice inconsistency is conditionally correlated with less wealth in a representative sample of Dutch households.",
        "We use the same task and user interface as in Choi et al. (2014) but abbreviate it from 25 decisions to 11.9 Each decision confronts respondents with a linear budget constraint under risk: subjects choose a point on the line, and then the computer randomly chooses whether to pay the point value of the x-axis or the y-axis. 1,270 of the 1,427 individuals taking our second survey make all 11 decisions, and comprise our sample for measuring choice inconsistency.10 See Data Appendix Figure 2 for an example. Following Choi et al., we average across these 11 decisions, within-consumer, to benchmark choices against two different standards of rationality. One benchmark is a complete and transitive preference ordering adhering to the General Axiom of Revealed Preference (GARP), 9",
        "D. Risk attitude re: certainty Behavioral researchers have long noted a seemingly disproportionate preference for certainty (PFC) among some consumers and posited various theories to explain it: Cumulative Prospect Theory (Daniel Kahneman and Tversky 1979; Amos Tversky and Kahneman 1992), Disappointment Aversion (Bell 1985; Loomes and Sugden 1986; Gul 1991), and u-v preferences (Neilson 1992; Schmidt 1998; Diecidue, Schmidt, and Wakker 2004). PFC may help to explain seemingly extreme risk averse behavior, which could in turn lead to lower wealth in the crosssection.",
        "E. Loss aversion/small-stakes risk aversion Loss aversion refers to placing higher weight on losses than gains, in utility terms. It is one of the most influential concepts in the behavioral social sciences, with seminal papers\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009de.g., Tversky and Kahneman (Amos Tversky and Kahneman 1992) and Benartzi and Thaler (1995)\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d producing thousands of citations. Loss aversion has been implicated in various portfolio choices (Barberis 2013) and consumption dynamics (K\u00c3\u0085\u00e2\u0080\u0098szegi and Rabin 2009) that can lead to lower wealth.",
        "We measure loss aversion using the two choices developed by Fehr and Goette (2007) in their study of the labor supply of bike messengers (see Abeler et al. (2011) for a similar elicitation method). Choice 1 is between a lottery with a 50% chance of winning $80 and a 50% chance of losing $50, and zero dollars. Choice two is between playing the lottery in Choice 1 six times, and zero dollars. As Fehr and Goette (FG) show, if subjects have reference-dependent preferences, then subjects who reject lottery 1 have a higher level of loss aversion than subjects who accept lottery 1, and subjects who reject both lotteries have a higher level of loss aversion than subjects who reject only lottery 1. In addition, if subjects' loss aversion is consistent across the two lotteries, then any individual who rejects lottery 2 should also reject lottery 1 because a rejection of lottery 2 implies a higher level of loss aversion than a rejection of only lottery 1.",
        "Other researchers have noted that, even in the absence of loss aversion, choosing Option B is compatible with small-stakes risk aversion.16 We acknowledge this but use \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093loss aversion\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d instead of \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093loss aversion and/or small-stakes risk aversion\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d as shorthand. Small-stakes risk aversion is also often classified as behavioral because it is incompatible with expected utility theory (Rabin 2000).",
        "Response rates suggest a high level of comfort with these questions; only two of our 1,515 subjects skip, and only two more who answer the first question do not answer the second. 37% of our 1,511 respondents reject both lotteries, consistent with relatively extreme loss aversion, compared to 45% of FG\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s 42 subjects. Another 36% of our subjects accept both lotteries, 16 A related point is that there is no known \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093model-free\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d method of eliciting loss aversion (Dean and Ortoleva 2016).",

Although one wonders whether these 14% misunderstood the questions, we find only a bit of evidence in support of that interpretation: those playing the single but not compound lottery have slightly lower cognitive skills than other loss averters, conditional on our rich set of covariates, but actually have higher cognitive skills than the most-classical group. And playing the single but not the compound lottery is uncorrelated with our measure of ambiguity aversion, pushing against the interpretation that the compound lottery is sufficiently complicated as to appear effectively ambiguous (Dean and Ortoleva 2016).",
        "All told 64% of our subjects indicate some loss aversion, defined as rejecting one or both of the small-stakes lotteries, as do 67% in FG.

        "questions were also fielded in an ALP module from early 2013 used by Hwang (2016); 70% of that sample exhibits some loss aversion.

We also order sets of deviations to indicate greater degrees of loss aversion, based on whether the individual respondent rejects the compound but not the single lottery, rejects the single but not the compound lottery, or rejects both.",
        "F. Narrow Bracketing and Dominated Choice Narrow bracketing refers to the tendency to make decisions in (relative) isolation, without full consideration of other choices and constraints.

        "We measure narrow bracketing and dominated choice (NBDC) using two of the tasks in Rabin and Weizacker (2009). Each task instructs the subject to make two decisions. Each decision presents the subject with a choice between a certain payoff and a gamble. Each decision pair appears on the same screen, with an instruction to consider the two decisions jointly. RW administer their tasks with students and, like us, in a nationally representative online panel (Knowledge Networks in their case). Like us, payoffs are hypothetical for their online panel.",
