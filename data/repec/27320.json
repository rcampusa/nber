The measure comes from Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Report, which reports aggregated location data from users who have opted-in to Location History for their Google Account. Google calculates the change in visits and length of stay at different places compared to a baseline. Changes for each day are compared to a baseline value for that day of the week: Google uses as a baseline the median value for the corresponding day of the week during the 5-week period Jan 3\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c Feb 6, 2020.
