The Telework measure is obtained from Dingel and Neiman (2020). They classify the feasibility of working at home for all occupations and merge this classification with occupational employment counts for the United States in the left column we examine the fundamental relation while in the right column we examine the differential effect based on high Trump VS counties. Each of the figures control for the log number of confirmed cases, population density, income per capita, population, the day of the week, and the number of days since the first case in the DMA or county.
