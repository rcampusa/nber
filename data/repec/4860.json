        "Endnotes 1. The Currency School in England in the early nineteenth century made the case for the Bank of England's fiduciary note issue to vary automatically with the level of the Bank's gold reserve (the currency principle). Following such a rule was viewed as preferable (for providing price-level stability) to allowing the note issue to be altered at the discretion of the well-meaning and possibly well-informed directors of the Bank (the position taken by the opposing Banking School). For a discussion of the Currency Banking School debate, see Vinci (1937), Fetter (1965), and Schwartz (1987).",
        "2. Viewed, however, as a rule in the traditional sense \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d as an automatic mechanism to ensure price stability \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d bimetailism may have had greater scope for automaticity than the gold standard because of the additional cushion of a switch from one metal to the other. See Friedman (1990).",
        "3. This description is consistent with a result from a model of Lucas and Stokey (1983), in which financing of wars is a contingency rule that is optimal. In their example, where the occurrence and duration of the war are uncertain, the optimal plan for the debt is not to service it during the war. Under this policy, people realize when they purchase the debt it that effectively it will be defaulted on in the event the war continues.",
        "4. A case study comparing British and French finances during the Napoleonic Wars shows that Britain was able to finance its wartime expenditures by a combination of taxes, debt, and paper money issue\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dto smooth revenue; whereas Fiance had to rely primarily on taxation. France had to rely on a less efficient mix of finance than Britain because she had used up her credibility by defaulting on outstanding debt at the end of the American Revolutionary War and by hyperinflating during the Revolution. Napoleon ultimately returned France to the bimetallic standard in 1803 as part of a policy to restore fiscal probity, but because of the previous loss of reputation France was unable to take advantage of the contingent aspect of the bimetallic standard rule. See Bordo and White (1993).",
        "5. The behavior of asset prices (exchange rates and interest rates) during suspension periods suggests that market agents viewed the commitment to gold as credible. For the U.S. see Roll (1972) and Calomiris (1988), who present evidence of expected appreciation of the greenback during the American Civil War based on a negative interest differential between bonds that were paid in greenbacks and those paid in gold.",
        "Also, see Smith and Smith (1993) who demonstrate that movements in the premium on gold from the Resumption Act of 1875 until resumption was established in 1878 were driven by a credible beliefthat resumption would occur. For the case of Britain's return to gold in 1925, see Smith and Smith (1990), Miller and Sutherland (1992) and (1994). An application of the stochastic process switching literature suggests that the increasing likelihood that resumption would occur at the original parity graduallyaltered the path of the dollar-pound exchange rate towards the new ceiling, several months in advance.",
        "6. For suggestive evidence see Bordo and Kydland (1992).",
        "7. Also see Officer (1993). His calculations of speculative bands (bands within which uncovered interest arbitrage prevails consistent with gold point arbitrage efficiency) for the interwar dollar sterling exchange rate show serious violations only in 1931 \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2 at the very end of the gold exchange standard.",
        "8. A case study of Canada during the Great Depression provides evidence for the importance of the credible commitment mechanism of adherence to gold. Canada suspended the gold standard in 1929 but did not allow the Canadian dollar to depreciate nor the price level to rise for two years. Canada did not take advantage of the suspension to emerge from the depression because of concern for its credibility with foreign lenders. See Bordo and Redish (1990).",
        "9. Eschweiler and Bordo (1993) provide evidence for this interpretation for Germany over the period 1883 - 1913 based on an estimation of the Reichsbank's reaction function. They find that the central bank's pursuit of an interest rate smoothing policy (an obvious violation of 'the rules of the game') was subordinate to its commitment to keep the exchange rate within the gold points. 10. The U.S. could change the dollar price of gold if a majority of members (and every member with 10% or more of the total quotas) agreed.",
