A Appendix See the replication code for exact details on data construction and estimation. A.1 Data Construction Procedures We construct the datasets used in our analysis as follows.",
        "1. We begin by matching SafeGraph POIs to the counties in which they are located. We use latitude and longitude from SafeGraph\u00e2\u0080\u0099s August 2020 Core POI dataset, along with the 2010 TIGER county shapefile.24 We successfully assign 99.9 percent of the POIs to a county.",
        "2. We then merge the POI-county mapping from (1) onto SafeGraph\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Patterns data using the safegraph-place-id variable. We sum visits by county for a given day, aggregating across POIs. Our SafeGraph series ranges from January 1, 2020 to August 30, 2020.",
        "3. We then merge onto the output from (2) a dataset of county-level demographic information constructed as follows. We use the Open Census data from SafeGraph, aggregating up the data given at the census block group level to the county level. We combine this with data on county 2016 Presidential votes shares (MIT Election Data and Science Lab 2018). We define the Republican vote share to be the share of votes received by the Republican candidate over the sum of votes across all candidates. We exclude counties without valid vote data, which drops Alaska and two additional counties (FIPS: 15005, 51515). We also merge on the urban population share from the 2010 Census.25 We also use average seasonal temperatures by geography from Wu et al. (2020), which is ultimately sourced from gridMET. Averages for a given county and season are taken across the years 2010-2016.",
        "4. We then merge onto the output from (3) the number of incoming international flights for each US county from December 2019 to February 2020 made available by the OpenSky Network (Scha\u00cc\u0088fer et al. 2014; Olive 2019).",
        "5. We then merge data on Covid-19 health outcomes onto the output from (4). We source confirmed Covid-19 cases and deaths by county and day from The New York Times. We assume zero cases and deaths for the observations not observed in The New York Times data. We drop the four counties which overlap with Kansas City (MO), because The New York Times lists these as geographic exceptions where it either does not assign cases to these counties or excludes cases occurring within the city.

Given that none of the sources have entirely overlapping policy data, we define both our stay-at-home and business closure policies by sequentially assigning enforcement dates when data is available in the order: NYT, Keystone, Stanford/Virginia crowdsource, and Hikma Health. Once a state enacts a policy, the counties inherit the policy of the state. We then merge on a dataset of reopening dates at the state level collected by the NYT (Mervosh et al. 2020b) and curated by Rearc.",
        "7. We then merge on debit card transactions and spending totals from Facteus onto the output from (6). Prior to this merge, Facteus data is aggregated from the zip code to the county level using a 5-digit zip code to county crosswalk downloaded from HUD (https://www.huduser.gov/portal/dataset on April 12, 2020. Facteus data ranges from Jan 1, 2020 to August 27, 2020, with missing data on August 7, 2020.",
        "8. We then merge on employment data from Homebase onto the output from (7). Homebase data is aggregated to the county-day level prior to this merge. This step completes the construction of the dataset used in our county-level analysis. Homebase data ranges from Jan 1, 2020 to August 31, 2020.",
        "9. For analysis at the level of a CSA, order date, and day, we then aggregate the output from (8) to this level. We use a county to CSA crosswalk downloaded on May 29, 2020 from the NBER (http://data.nber.org/cbsa-csa-fips-county-crosswalk/cbsa2fipsxw.csv), which uses delineation files originally sourced from the Census. We sum countable variables such as POI visits or Covid-19 cases. For other variables, we take a population-weighted average across counties in a CSA-day with the same social distancing policy start date. In our CSA-level analysis, we exclude counties not assigned to a CSA.",
