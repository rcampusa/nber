Column (3) refers to the baseline identification sub-sample, which is defined as those commercial banks in our merged BHC-Commercial Bank Sample that over the sample period announce and either complete (\"treatment\" group) or withdraw (\"control\" group) a switch from being held by a privatelyheld BHC to a publicly-traded BHC. The announced switches are due to two reasons, an IPO or an acquisition of a privately-held target by a publicly-traded BHC, which leads to a sample of 31,569 commercial bankquarter observations involving 934 unique BHCs and 1,521 unique commercial banks between 1990 and 2012.

        "Panel A: The Value of Aggregate Total Assets of Public and Private U.S. Commercial Banks Figure 1 (Continued): The Growth of Public Banking This figure describes the evolution of aggregate total assets in the U.S. commercial banking sector from 1990 to 2014. Aggregate total assets of commercial banks are measured as the sum of consolidated assets reported by each commercial bank in its Call Report filing for the universe of U.S. filers. Note that this definition does not include nonbank assets of bank holding companies (BHCs), which would equal to the difference between total assets as reported by BHCs in their Y-9C and those of commercial bank assets as defined in the figure. For each commercial bank, we estimate the ownership status of its (top-holder) BHC based on a NIC indicator for whether the BHC\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s securities are traded and are subject to registration, or it is required to report to the SEC."
