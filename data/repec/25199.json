        "We calculate the service flow from automobiles as the product of predicted automobile spending, the number of owned automobiles and a depreciation rate. This approach will understate total automobile flows for some families because the number of automobiles is topcoded at 2. This approach will overstate vehicle flows for families that dispose of an automobile during the survey year if this automobile is included in the total count of automobiles owned. This approach will also overstate vehicle flows for families that have owned their vehicles for an extended time, because we are predicting the value based on recent automobile purchases. Note that unlike our approach for 1985 and 20032016, we calculate service flows only for automobiles, not for other vehicles such as trucks, motorcycles, campers, etc., because we do not have reliable information on the total number of each of these types of vehicles owned.",
        "This change resulted in a noticeable increase in reported food away spending. We estimate the effect of the question change by regressing food away spending on a new question indicator, controlling for interview month and reference month (respondents report spending for the previous three months) for survey years 2005 through 2007.",
        "Based on these estimates we adjust spending on food away down by 55 percent for the most recent years. This adjustment does not affect our well-measured consumption measure because this measure excludes food away. Reported food away spending is a small fraction of total spending, accounting for about 5 percent of total spending for all consumer units in 2015.27 The values for certain spending components are top coded in the public use files, and the threshold values for the top code changes over time. For example, the top code threshold for the monthly rental equivalent value of an owned home increased from $1,000 in 1988 to $1,500 in 1989. Over longer periods the real values of the top code thresholds have typically risen. For example, the value of the rental equivalent threshold in 2014 ($3,200) is 17% greater in real terms than the value of this threshold in 1980 ($1,000).",
        "Rather, we observe whether the adult works and whether he or she works full-time or part-time. From this information, we impute a continuous measure of usual hours worked for adults that work. Using data from the 1980 CE, we regress usual hours https://www.bls.gov/cex/tables.htm#avgexp. worked per week on an indicator for whether the person works full-time and controls for age and education for a sample of adults who work. We then use the estimates from this regression to predict usual hours worked for adult workers in the 1972-1973 survey using their reported information on full-time status, age, and education.",
        "Education and marital status are also missing for adults who are neither the head of the family nor the spouse of the head in the 1972-1973 CE (about 15 percent of adults for these years). For these adults with missing education and marital status we assign the mean value of these variables from the 1980 CE. Specifically, we calculate mean education and marital status for individuals that are neither a head or spouse in the 1980 CE by relationship to the head and by education of the head. We then assign the appropriate mean to adults in the 1972-1973 CE who have missing values for these variables.",
        "B. A Bias-Corrected CPI Bias in the most frequently used price index, the CPI-U, is well-documented (Boskin et al. 1996; Berndt 2006; Gordon 2006; Johnson, Reed, and Stewart 2006). This bias can be very substantial for changes over long time periods. The BLS has implemented several methodological improvements in calculating the CPI-U over the past 25 years. Although the BLS does not update the CPI-U retroactively, it does provide a consistent research series (CPI-U-RS) that incorporates many of the changes.28 However, a consensus view among economists is that the CPI-U-RS does not make sufficient adjustment for the biases in the CPI-U. Between 1972 and 2005 the CPI-U grew on average between 0.4 and 0.5 percentage points per year faster than the CPI-U-RS, with essentially all of this difference occurring before 1998. A reasonable estimate of the bias in the CPI-U over this period is much larger\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009cabout 1.3 percentage points per year between 1978 and 1995.",
        "Given that the CPI-U-RS does not fully correct for bias in reported price changes, the results for consumption we report are indexed using an adjusted CPI-U-RS that subtracts 0.8 percentage points from the growth in the CPI-U-RS index each year. We base this adjustment on Berndt (2006) and Gordon (2006) who argue that even with recent alterations to the CPI-U methodology that make it and the CPI-U-RS essentially the same for recent years, a bias of 0.8 percentage points per year remains. Because the CPI-U-RS provides a consistent series only back until 1978, we subtract the full 1.1 percentage points from changes in CPI-U inflation for earlier years. See Meyer and Sullivan (2012) for more details.",
        "The CPI-U-RS does not incorporate all of the methodological improvements to the CPI-U. See Stewart and Reed (1999) for more details."
