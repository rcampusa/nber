        "Edison (1993), Alkeminders (1995), Baillie, Humpage and Osterberg (2000), and Sarno and Taylor (2001) provide excellent surveys of intervention. Nealy (2005) also touches on some econometric issues. The portfolio balance mechanism also assumes that no restrictions exist on cross-border financial flows and that Ricardian equivalence does not hold. Most models assume that relative changes in the stock of securities leave interest rates unaffected because monetary policy determines interest rates. This need not be the case. The United States conducts most U.S. interventions, by far, in the New York market, but has on occasion placed orders through correspondents in both the European and Far Eastern markets. We cannot isolate these transactions.",
        "The United States did not abruptly end its intervention on 19 March 1997. U.S. interventions began to taper off in the early 1990s. After August 1995, the United States intervened against Japanese yen on 17 June 1998, against euros on 22 September 2000, and again against Japanese yen on 18 March 2011. These last three interventions are the only instances of U.S. intervention during the floating exchange rate era not included in our analysis. Our exchange-rate data determined our sample, which ends on 19 March 1997.",
