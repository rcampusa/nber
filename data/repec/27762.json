        "In addition to the two factors above, there was a merger of two of the plans in our sample. The merger, which took place in the final year of our study (2012), led to all enrollees in the acquired plan being transferred to the acquiring plan. Since this was not a voluntary plan switch, for the set of auto-assignees that were in the acquired plan, we recoded their plan of assignment to be the acquirer beginning the month of the acquisition. B Data B.1 Administrative data and outcomes All managed care plans are required to submit standardized encounter data for the services they provide and the NYSDOH has linked this data to the claims they pay directly through the FFS program.",
        "Low value care. We use 5 claims-based measures from Charlesworth et al. (2016) to measure low value care. These measures are recommendations from CMS or the Choosing Wisely initiative, which aims to avoid unnecessary medical tests, treatments, and procedures. We selected these 5 measures as they had both a large number of qualifying diagnoses for the denominator and a high overall prevalence of low value care conditional on that diagnosis.",
        "We do not find strong evidence of a relationship between our plan-level spending and satisfaction estimates and provider network breadth. This can be reconciled with evidence from Gruber and McKnight (2016) and Wallace (2019) that broader provider networks increase spending and satisfaction by noting that the complex set of tools that modern health insurers rely on to constrain spending may counteract the effects of broader networks. For example, one of the Medicaid managed care plans in our sample is vertically-integrated with the public, safety net hospitals in New York City.",
        "That plan operates a very narrow hospital network but, when enrollees are randomly-assigned to it, we observe high levels of spending. Hence, it is likely that it combines a narrow hospital network with a relatively lenient set of utilization management tools. Indeed, this multi-dimensional nature of the contract is the primary motivation for the strategy used by Wallace (2019) to separately identify the effect of networks from other dimensions of MMC plans."
