        "19 Parkin, Michael, and Zis, George, Inflation in the World Econoi~y, Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1976. (1976a) ______________________________ Inflation in Open Economies, Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1976. (1976b) Swoboda, Alexander K., Monetary Policy under Fixed Exchange Rates: Effectiveness, the Speed of Adjustment, and Proper Use, in J. A. Frenkel and H. G. Johnson, eds., The Monetary Approach to the Balance of Payments, Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1976.",
        "2Darby and Stockman (1980).",
        "4As is appropriate for a reserve country, the balance of payments was found to have no influence on the U.S. money supply. See Darby (1980a,",
        "5The equations are solved for exports, relative price of imports, exchange rate, net capital outflows, and the balance of payments.",
        "6Variables such as real income, prices, and money are measured in logarithms. The interest rates and unemployment rates are decimal frac- tions. Exports, imports, net capital outflows, and the balance of payments are all scaled by dividing by nominal income. Shocks are deviations of actual values from optimal ARIMA predictions of the variables.",
        "13For example, the strongest simulated effects were for the Netherlands. The peak effects on real income were \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b1 1 basis point; on the money supply, price level and interest rate \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b1 0.2 basis points; on the exchange rate \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b1 0.3 basis point; on the balance of payments \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b1 0.1 basis point; and -- the big one -- on exports \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b1 8 basis points.",
        "14The negative coefficients on money shocks were not jointly signifi- cant in the Mark III model, but were retained in the reestimation of the Mark IV model so that this channel was not foreclosed. `5To be precise, the implied increase in U.K. real government spending compared to the base run for the first nine quarters is 100, 56, 44, 63, 59,",
