        "The first takeaway from Row (1) is that the control function approach is effective even with reasonably-sized schools of 1000 students each (most of the schools in the North Carolina sample enroll between 250 and 2000 students) and a moderate number of available schools: 97 percent of the variance in the school-level contribution of unobserved student characteristics can be predicted by a linear combination of school-average observable characteristics (Column 8).43 The second insight revealed by Row (1) is that the performance of the control function may suffer when estimation is based on small subsamples of students at each school. We see that the R-squared falls from .972 to only .368 when school averages are merely approximated based on samples of 10 students (Column 8). Increasing the sample size to 20 students per school (Column 9) raises the R-squared to .501, while increasing it further to 40 students per school raises the Rsquared to .640.",
        "A6 Decomposing the Variance in Educational Attainment and Wages In this section we discuss an analysis of variance based on equation that can be used to place a lower bound on the importance of factors that are common to students from the same school.48 As and Solon (2003), Haider (2001), and Meghir and Pistaferri (2004).",

Let \u00c3\u0083\u00c5\u00bd\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a8 be the corresponding vector of wage coefficients.
