        "I iterated the GMM procedure, by forming a W* using second-stage estimates, finding third-stage estimates and so forth. Ferson and Forester (1991) find that this procedure gives better small sample performance. It also produced results that were more stable across small variations in the model set-up. g In the more general case of returns rather than excess returns, one must modify the moment condition to include expected prices rather than 1 on the left hand side: 1 = E(mR | I) implies E(l\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00aez) = E(m(R\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00aez))."
