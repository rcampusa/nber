        "1. There is, however, debate about how much reductions in class size improve opportunities--particularly once class size is under 25 students.",
        "2. National Center for Education Statistics, 1997. There are differences between the student-teacher ratio and class size, but the differences are less of a concern for elementary schools than for secondary schools. In any case, the differences are not relevant to the empirical work in this paper, because I use teachers who have regular classroom instruction as their major duty.",
        "3. The literature on racial and gender composition of classrooms, both popular and academic, is too voluminous to survey. In just the past two years, hundreds of articles have been published by education journals and newspapers on the effects of altering classroom racial and gender composition. Many school districts have experimented with single-sex classes in math and science, and a few large city districts (Philadelphia, Baltimore, and New York) have created single-sex schools. Detroit, Milwaukee, and Minneapolis have created all-black school.",

        "6. However, it is generally not transitory from the point of view of a cohort of students.",
        "8. I also estimate such an equation for each district. Below, I discuss the advantages and disadvantages of estimating the relationship between class size and enrollment at, alternatively, the school and district level.",
        "9. A high-order polynomial is possible because each district has multiple grades, schools, and years. Even the smallest districts contain 138 observations with which to estimate equation (6), and typical districts contain between 414 and 690 observations. Alternatively, I could use other specifications, such as splines, to pick up the nonlinearities."
