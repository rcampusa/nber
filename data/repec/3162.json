        "Footnotes ^The principal Items are McCallum (1987, 1988a, 1989). 2 A target scheme that weights real fluctuations more heavily than price level movements has been discussed by Hall (1984) while a price level target has been advocated by Barro (1985), Clark (1988), and Haraf (1986). A partial Investigation of the feasibility of the latter Is reported In McCallum (1989).",
        "Indeed, this question was emphasized In the discussion following the original conference presentation of McCallum (1988a), most explicitly In comments by Robert J. Hodrlck and Robert E. Lucas, Jr.",
        "The simulation period begins with 1923.1, rather than 1922.1, because Initial conditions with the latter would suggest a gradual Introduction of the rule, as discussed In McCallum (1988a, pp.195-8). The slightly longer period Is used for estimation to provide more observations.",
        "^The quarterly values were developed by Robert J. Gordon by Interpolations of the Chow-Lin (1971) type with Industrial production as reported by Persons (1931) used as the Interpolating variable. Since the latter figures are seasonally adjusted (Persons, 1931, p.131), so too are Gordon's GNP figures. They are presented In Balke and Gordon (1986). Quite recently, Romer (1988) has constructed a revised series of annual GNP estimates for 1909-1928 that could be used to develop new quarterly values for the early part of our sample. But since the main dlscrepanles (in relation to the Commerce Department values) occur for years prior to 1922, that exercise has not been conducted.",
        "'it might be argued that the Fed could not accurately control the base with the institutions of the 1930s. That issue is beside the point; the controllability of the base under today's conditions is what is relevant to issue of the desirability of the proposed policy rule. In the present paper the subject is whether that rule would have been effective, if it had been in force during the 1920s and 1930s. Such a regime is, of course, an alternative to the Gold Standard.",
        "^In terms of posited relationships and basic structure, this model Is rather similar to a five equation system employed by Anderson and Butklewlcz (1980). Speciflcatlonal details are different, however, and the present model determines the currency-to-deposit ratio Implicitly rather than explicitly. One qualitative difference Is that the present model does not rely upon any measure (treated as exogenous) of \"autonomous\" expenditures.",
        "^Thls Is not to be Interpreted as a claim that no bank failures would have occurred during 1933.2 - 1941.4 under our rule, but only as a way of eliminating the effect of sod from equation (5).",
        "*^The simulated volume of suspensions over deposits averages 0.0096 over 1930.1 - 1932.4 as compared with the actual historical figure of 0.0151. 18 The difference was due primarily to a Jump in federal defense expenditures from S2.3 to $13.8 billion.",
        "Exclusion of the residual for 1933.1 seems warranted, given the uniqueness of the Banking Holiday episode."
