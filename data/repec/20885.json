We also find evidence that the order of activities and surveys, which we randomly assigned, affects explicit ethnicbias measured using the survey questions, but does not affect implicit ethnic-bias measured using the IAT. The estimated coefficient of interest, \u00c3\u00b0\u00c2\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u00ba\u00c2\u00bd, in equation (1), is sensitive to the order of activities when survey measures are used but not when the IAT D-score is used.",
