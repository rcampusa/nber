There were a total of 300 drugs that were ever excluded from 2012-2017 by at least one of the three PBMs. Of these 300 excluded drugs, we were able to match 260 of them to the First Data Bank data, from which we obtained the ATC4 data. We manually matched each ATC4 to a disease category; this disease taxonomy was adapted from the disease categories provided by the PBMs in their exclusion lists.",

In Panel A, we group ATC4 drug classes by terciles of the number of existing drugs in the class (in 2011); data on existing drugs is from First Data Bank. In Panel B, we group ATC4 drug classes by the number of prescriptions written in the class (in 2011); data on prescriptions is from the 2011 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey.

        "Identifying variation comes from the debut of multiple drugs within an ATC4 drug class, some of which are immediately excluded and others are not. Immediate exclusion is defined as exclusion in the calendar year immediately following market entry. The sample is restricted to drugs that enter the market in 2007 or later, and so are ten years old or younger for the duration of the sample. In columns 2 and 4, the sample is further restricted to only ATC4 categories that have at least one immediately excluded drug. See notes to Appendix Table A.2 for more details on the data. Standard errors are clustered at the drug level.",
        "Indirect method: matching via ICD9 codes. An alternative way to link the drug candidates to ATC4 classes is through the drugs\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 areas of therapeutic use (ICD9) provided by Cortellis. Using the drug to ICD9 crosswalk from Cortellis, we linked to a crosswalk of ICD9 to ATC4 codes created by Filzmoser et al. (2009), in which the authors assigned a probabilistic match score of ICD9-ATC4 pairs.23 Since this results in a drug being matched (indirectly via ICD9) to many ATC4s, we assigned the likelihood of an ATC4 matching to a drug based on the probabilistic match scores from Filzmoser et al. (2009), such that the assigned weights sum to 1 for each drug.",
        "For our main analyses, we matched the drug candidates to ATC4 codes using the direct method via EphMRA codes and used the indirect method via ICD9 codes for drugs with missing EphMRA codes. As shown in Appendix Table A.7, our results are similar regardless of the linking method used. 23 Filzmoser et al. (2009) merged a dataset of prescriptions (with ATC4 codes) and a dataset of hospital admissions (with ICD9 codes) at the patient-level. Since the ATC4 code of a patient\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s drug matches to many diagnosis codes of the patient, the authors use a frequency-based measure to calculate a probabilistic match score of an ICD9-ATC4 pair. They conduct this match specific to gender/age group of the patients. For our analysis, we take the average match probability across the gender/age groups for a given ICD9-ATC4 pair."
