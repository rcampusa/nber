        "2. Nationally, median total time-to-degree (the length of time between an individual's receipt of a bachelor's degree and his or her receipt of a doctoral degree) has risen by even more than median registered time-to-degree in most fields (Ehrenberg 1991, Table 7.4). Among the factors response for this increase is that individuals are increasingly delaying entry to graduate school (Ehrenberg 1991, Table 7.5).",
        "3. The law school data come from Barron's (1986) and the medical school data from American Medical Association (1988). The MBA data are \"guestimates\" provided by James Schmotter, Associate Dean at Cornell's Johnson School of Management.",
        "6. All four of these graduate programs at University X were ranked in the top 20 nationwide, in terms of the quality of their faculty, in the last national ranking of graduate program quality (Lyle Jones, Gardner Lindzey and Peter Coggeshall 1982). 7. A simple numerical example illustrates this point. Suppose that all entering students receive degrees, that (unrealistically) half of each year's entering doctoral cohort complete in one year, and the other half complete in two years. Average time to degree by.year of entering cohort is thus constant at 1.5 years. Suppose that, in years 0 and 1 (and all previous years), entering cohort size is 100. The table below shows that reported time to degree by year of completion will increase from 1.5 to 1.526 years if starting in year 3, entering cohort size decreases by 10 percent per year.",
        "Entering No. Who Will No. Who Will Average Time to Year Cohort Size Complete in t + 1 Complete In t + 2  Degree of Completers In the Year 0 100 50 50 1, .5 ([50 x 1] + [50 x 2]) 1 100 50 50 1, ,5 ([50 x 1] + [50 x 2]) 2 90 45 45 1, .5 ([50 x 1] + [50 x 2]) 3 81 40.5 40.5 1, .526 ([45 x 1] + [50 x 2]) 4 72.9 36.45 36.45 1, .526 ([40.5 x 1] + [45 x 2]) 30 8. The analyses end with the entering class of 1978 to avoid truncation problems. The data were collected at University X in 1988-89, hence only individuals who had received their degrees in 10 years or less would be included as completers from the class of 1978. As noted below, over 99 percent of degree recipients in each field received their degrees in 10 years or less."
