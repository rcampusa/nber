Appendix Section A.1 describes details on the additional truncation models. Section A.2 presents the Lemke-style analysis, which is compared to the results found in Section 6. A.1. Additional Truncation Models In the main body of this paper, we presented results using the simple model of truncation correction with a 20-year maximum TTD. Here, we describe two additional truncation correction models, the \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093linear\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d model and the \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093quadratic\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d model. Selected results of all three models, with a TTD of both 20 and 25 years are presented in Tables A1 and A2.",
        "Linear Truncation Model The linear model allows for the number of PhDs being produced to follow a linear trend based on how many years the BA-year is from 1980. This is in contrast to the simple model, which does not directly take into account the year of BA, only the maximum number of years possibly observed in the data.",
        "As in the simple model, we first restrict the data to the BA years for which we observe the maximum TTD in the data. For a 20 year maximum TTD, which we will assume throughout this description for expositional purposes, this is BA years 1980-1991. However, instead of aggregating to the TTD-level, we aggregate to the BA year-TTD level. For each BA year, this produces the total number of PhDs earned (across all institutions) after 4, 5,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6, 20 years. Again for each BA year, we compute the cumulative probabilities of completing PhDs by each TTD.",

        "We obtain the coefficients and apply them to the years for which we do not observe the maximum TTD in the data. We do this in an analogous way to the simple model. Specifically, we multiple the number of degrees produced after the max number of possibly observed years by the inverse of the sum of the intercept term and the coefficient on the year term multiplied by the number of years since 1980. Quadratic Truncation Model The quadratic model is nearly identical to the linear model with the exception that we add a squared time_1980 term to the regression equation.",
        "Instead of a 6-year TTD, we use a 10-year TTD. Using our SED data, for each BA institution, we aggregate the number of PhDs received by PhD year, tossing out information on when the BA was received. Institution-PhD years with no PhDs are coded as 0. We also restrict our sample to PhD received in 1990-2011, allowing 10 years from the beginning of our BA data.32 We then compute a PhD production rate, which is the number of PhDs by PhD year for each BA institution divided by the number of humanities BAs from 10 years before the PhD year. We use the explanatory variables associated with the BA year."
