        "This simulation estimator will only be accurate if a large number of \u00c3\u0083\u00c5\u00bds draws are in the range where \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u008f(\u00c3\u0083\u00c5\u00bds|Xa, \u00c3\u0083\u00c5\u00bd) is relatively high, and, as is well known, simulated maximum likelihood estimators are only consistent when the number of simulations grows fast enough relative to the sample size. We therefore proceed in two stages. First, we estimate \u00c3\u0083\u00c5\u00bd using S = 2, 500 draws, where g() is a multivariate uniform distribution over a large range of parameters which includes all of the parameter values that are plausible. Second, we use these estimates \u00c3\u0083\u00c5\u00bd to repeat the estimation using a new importance sampling density g(\u00c3\u0083\u00c5\u00bd|Xa) = \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u008f(\u00c3\u0083\u00c5\u00bds|Xa, \u00c3\u0083\u00c5\u00bd) with S = 500 per auction. Roberts and Sweeting (2011) provide Monte Carlo evidence that the estimation procedure works well even for smaller values of S.",
        "To apply the estimator, we also need to de\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00afne the likelihood function La(ya|\u00c3\u0083\u00c5\u00bd) based on the data we observe about the auction\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2s outcome, which includes the number of potential entrants of each type, the winning bidder and the highest bids announced during the open outcry auction by the set of \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00afrms that indicated that they were willing to meet the reserve price. Two problems arise when interpreting these data. First, a bidder\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2s highest announced bid in an open outcry auction may be below its value, and it is not obvious which mechanism leads to the bids that are announced (Haile and Tamer (2003)). Second, if a \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00afrm does not know its value when taking the entry decision, it may learn (after paying the entry cost) that its value is less than the reserve price and so not submit a bid."
