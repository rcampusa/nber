        "Gibbons and Katz [1989], Krueger and Summers [1988] and Murphy and Topel [1987a and 1987b] recognize these problems, and attempt to attenuate their impact in a variety of ways.",

        "The NLS Young Men&apos;s Cohort had about 35 percent attrition by 1980 (Center for Human Resource Research, 1990),",
        "We computed the industry and occupation effects from the full sample, whereas Murphy and Topel [1987b] use only the non-movers. In our case, the number of non-movers would be very small (233), and would likely be a highly select sample, since the interval between observations is so long.",
        "Our first-difference results may differ from those of Murphy and Topel not only because of the way they construct the wage, but also because of the longer period of time over which changes are recorded in our data (on average more than ten years, compared to one year in the Murphy and Topel papers), suggesting that a higher proportion of reported changers are true changers. In our sample 71 percent of the respondents change industry, compared to four percent in their sample. As a result, measurement-error bias is likely to be more severe in their sample [Freeman, 1984]. Recognizing this, Murphy and Topel use an instrumental variables approach."
