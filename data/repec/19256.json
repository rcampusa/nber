        "For example, the success rate of non-violation claims appears to have been higher in the GATT era than it has been since the creation of the WTO; and many legal scholars (e.g., Jackson, 2007) argue that GATT violation claims were treated as liability rules at least in the early GATT era but transitioned largely to a system of property rules by the WTO era. Our \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6nding here that NV success would be higher when the violation claim is also modeled as a liability rule than when it is modeled as a property rule could thus contribute to a possible explanation for this evolution in the success of non-violation claims in the GATT/WTO.",
