        "The \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d3 percent real bill rate in June 1980 was 2 percent below any other observed bill rate in the entire period, and the \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d6.3 percent after\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dtax real rate was also 2 percent below any other. The record declines to unprecedented lows and the even sharper immediate reversals cry out for an extraordinary explanation. Fortunately, one is available. In March 1980, the Federal Reserve implemented a credit controls program that included a noninterest bearing reserve requirement of 15 percent on increases in credit. Apparently as a result, consumer installment credit outstanding contracted at an annual rate of 10 percent in the April\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dMay period, the first decline since May 1975 and the largest reduction since World War II.",

Since then the U.S. economy has experienced a trough in July 1980, a peak in July 1981 and a trough in November 1982. 2. See Hendershott and Huang (198 for a wide variety of estimates. 3. While a number of proxies for unexpected capital gains on equities (or changes in its required rate of return) were tested in the equities equation, none significantly diluted the estimated impact of the turning\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d point variables.",
