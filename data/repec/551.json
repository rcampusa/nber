        "The introduction of these additional explanatory elements is not pure hindsight; all but the dollar depreciation, food\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009denergy effects, and the minimum wage were present in earlier papers, e.g., Gordon (1971) (1972).",
        "A sequel to this paper, to be presented in November 1980 to the Brook\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d ings Conference on Labor Market Tightness and Inflation, will explore the sensitivity of the results to alternative specifications of the demand side, e.g., the effects of unemployment variables compared with those of the output ratiO.",
        "The source of the natural real GNP series is Perloff and Wachter (.1979).",
        "Most published wage equations enter prices only in lagged form, but many published price equations (including Gordon 1971, 1975, and 1977) include the current wage rate.",
        "Inflation equations back to 1892 are presented for annual data in Gordon (l980a) and for quarterly data in Gordon (1980b). The choice of 1954:Q2 rather than l954:Ql has been made in papers extending back to Gordon (1971) and reflects an inexplicable jump in the price level in l954:Ql that has a substantial impact on several coefficients.",
        "An exception is the ingenious controls impact variable constructed by Blinder and Newton (1978) and Blinder (1979). This variable is discussed and tested below.",
        "Pencavel (1980) obtains substantially different conclusions regarding the efficacy of past incomes policies when he first constrains four programs to have the same effect and then allows each to have a different effect.",
        "This ambiguity is evident in the work of Perry, who in a recent paper (1980) chose l964:Ql\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d1965:Q4 as the dates for his guideline dummy, but in early papers had extended the dummy between 1963 and mid\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d1966.",
        "The closest to a pure money\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dcauses\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dprice model is presented by Barro and Rush (1980, Table 2.2, columns 4 and 5). Here the price level is explained by the current level of money (in logs), a distributed lag of past money 'surprises,\" the current share of government spending in real GNP, and a time trend (an interest rate term is insignificant). The money surprises, in turn, are residuals from an equation that explains quarterly changes in money as a function of six lagged dependent variables, a federal spending variable, and lagged unemployment. The implied reduced form thus basically explaIns price changes by money changes, the two government spending variables, lagged unemployment, and the time trend. There is no consideration of any of the supply factors discussed below in Section VI.",
        "This does not deny a role for the prices of other inputs, e.g., capital or raw materials, since these variables can be entered as relative prices. See the more complete specification of the price mark\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dup equation in Gordon (1975, p. 620).",
        "In column (2) and all of the other equations presented in this paper the lagged dependent variable is adjusted to remove the estimated impact of the controls. Thus we assume that the impact of the termination of controls in raising 1974 inflation does not carry over in making inflation higher in 1975. This adjustment marginally improves the standard error of estimate of the basic equation in column (8), and has the advantage that the effects of controls may be seen in the coefficient estimates, rather than in the alternative dynamic simulations necessary if the controls have persistent effects.",
        "The exact method of performing the \"stripping\" process is described in Gordon (1975, pp. 656\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d660). This variable was updated using the methods described in that source to the end of 1976, and has been extra\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d polated using a regression of the 1954\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d76 variable on current and lagged values of the deflators of consumer direct expenditures on food and energy.",
        "For previous uses of this specification, see Gordon (1971, pp. 128\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d9) and (1975, pp. 619\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d20).",
        "The interaction with y comes in years like 1975\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d76, when the equation in column (5) \"cannot understand\" why inflation declined despite an acceleration in y, but in column (6) has the rapid growth of actual productivity available as an included variable to help explain the inflation slowdown. The interaction with the lagged dependent variable comes in 1969\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d70, when column (5) \"needs\" a high sum of coefficients on lagged inflation to explain high inflation but in column (6) has the help of the 1969\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d70 productivity slowdown.",
        "Cordon (1977) in Tables 2 and 3 shows that unity constraints substantially improve the ability of equations estimated to the 1954\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d71 period to track the 1971\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d76 period in post\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dsample simulations.",
        "Since the cumulative error over 2.5 years is L4 percentage points, the simulation after adjustment for the exchange rate effect underpredicts the annual inflation rate during 1978\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d80 by about 0.6 percentage points on average.",
        "Perry's most recent research (1980) limits the guidelines dummy to 1964 and 1965, in contrast to his earlier work that included 1963.",
