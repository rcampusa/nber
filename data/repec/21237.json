(2012). We have extended the dataset to 2010 using the same methodology and have amended some of the original data after double-checking it with secondary sources. Values have been normalized on a 0-1 scale. Capital account: Qualitative indicators of constraints on financial credits and personal capital transactions of residents and financial credits to non-residents, as well as the use of multiple exchange rates. The index is coded from zero (fully repressed) to three (fully liberalized).",
        "The source for the data is Abiad et al. (2008), following the methodology in Abiad and Mody (2005), based on various IMF reports and working papers, central bank websites and others."
