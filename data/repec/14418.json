A Theory Appendix A.1 Characterization of Equilibrium (cont.) In this section of the appendix, we complete the characterization of equilibrium. As mentioned above, we must impose an assumption on the shape parameter of the Pareto distribution in order to ensure that both the distribution of capability draws and the distribution of plant revenues in the final-good sector have finite means, in our case that k > max(q, 1).",
        "Several remarks are in order. First, if ci > 1, then both output price in physical units and revenues are increasing in y and hence are positively correlated with one another. Note also that setting ci = 1 yields a model in which higher y corresponds to higher quality but marginal cost and hence output price in physical units are constant, as alluded to by Melitz (2003, p. 1699).",
        "other variables in terms of y. In this case, (1), (3) and (7a)-(7d) become: U X= f x(y)~dy (Alla) p = 7 po(~)1_Cd~] (Allb) = q(y) = 1 (Allc) = ( a (Alld) ~a-l) y = (1 + Z) (a; l)~ (Alle) which correspond exactly to the Melitz (2003) model when transport costs are zero. Now suppose that the above equations refer to goods measured in quality units, which we call utils. Suppose further that higher-y plants, in addition to requiring fewer units of inputs to produce one util of output, also produce goods with more utils per physical unit, where utils per physical unit are given by: = (A12) The existence of a relationship of this kind is alluded to in Melitz (2003, p. 1699) but not explicitly specified. Given (A12), price in physical units is given by: = ~ ~ = (a ~ 1) ~ (A13) The expression for revenues is unchanged by the redefinition of units.",
