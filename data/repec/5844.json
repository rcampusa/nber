        "This point is stated clearly by Grossman and Helpman (1994, p. 35).",
        "29Authors include Aghlon and Howitt (1992), Grossman and Helpman (1991), King and Levine (1993), and Goodfrlend and McDermott (1995). 30Romers (1990) presentation pretends that there is a single price-taking producer of final output of consumables. Consequently, we shall not at this point distinguish between per person and aggregative magnitudes.",
        "31Actually, Romer (1990) has all labor allocated to the production of consumables and also includes a human capital measure, with some human capital used in the production of designs. Our specification is notationally simpler and basically equivalent. 32Romer (1990) emphasizes the monopoly power possessed by each design creator, market power that gives the Individual an incentive to devote resources to the research activity (in our exposition, by hiring labor). It should be noted that this is the rather benign type of monopoly power that is granted by patent systems.",
        "20For more comparisons of this type and some discussion, see Lucas (1990). And also a transversality condition. 221n this case the transversality condition requires lim (1+1.) kt+113t ~`/Ct 0. With k~+1 given by (32) and ct = (1-a$)Akt~4, the relevant expression is which does indeed approach zero as t -* ~. 231n (33), the h~ human capital measure enters in the same way as does the labor-augmenting technical progress term in the neoclassical setup. So it can be seen that constant growth will occur if the overall model is such that h~ grows (endogenously) at a constant rate.",
        "The following discussion is adapted from McCallum (1994). 19The interest rate portion of the foregoing argument counterfactually presumes two closed economies, but so does the usual neoclassical growth analysis.",
        "Specifically, Blanchard and Fischer suggest on page 191 that the Chicago Rule optimal inflation result--i.e., that the optimal steady inflation rate equals the negative of the real rate of return on capital--depends upon the property of monetary superneutrality, and on page 181 state that the Chicago Rule is not optimal in a monetary overlapping generations model. Both of these claims are overturned, however, by analysis that Imposes steady state restrictions after conducting a more general optlmallty analysis-- see McCallum (1990, pp. 976-8, 983). ~`6The Solow contribution is not a complete optimizing model, as has been mentioned, but is a model nevertheless, in the sense of a falsifiable depiction of some economic phenomena. 17The second line of defense, that the neoclassical model may do a reasonable job of explaining cross-country differences in the level of income, will be discussed below. 18 .",
