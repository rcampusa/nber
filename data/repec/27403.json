However, financial assistance to countries within Europe occurred earlier, during the Global Financial Crisis, at least since 2008. In this section, we follow the main text and discuss the details of the the lenders and borrowers during this time period, with an emphasis on the construction of our dataset. We begin by documenting broadly how the major lenders structured financial assistance during the European debt crisis. We then give a broad overview of the lending programmes for the Eurozone borrowers (Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain).73 Finally, we discuss the lending programmes for the Non-Eurozone borrowers.",

As discussed in this appendix, the margin was gradually reduced over time 73 For another treatment of this history, see Corsetti, Erce and Uy (2017). 74 See the \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00c5\u0093IMF at a Glance\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u009d on the IMF website.

        "As for repayments and interest, we use the realized repayment schedule as soon as the loan is disbursed. However, for loans not yet disbursed, we begin by using the requirements set out in the Euro Loan Facility Act and its amendments.

According to the original Euro Area Loan Facility Act (dated in May 2010), the loan terms were five years. We therefore assume that for each disbursement, the loans are amortized over the eight quarters beginning after the three year grace period. Interest payments for this period are tied to the 3-month Euribor rate with a margin of 300bp for the first three years and 400bp for the last two years. This affects the forecasts up to and including 2011Q2.",

At this point, all six loans had been disbursed, and the EFSF programme was scheduled to begin soon. Hence, we only need worry about the realized loans. As for realized loans, a detailed amended schedule is included in the Act. The margin was lowered to 150bp for all periods. These two changes affect calculations for loan schedules beginning in Q2 of 2012.",

The ESM assumes that the remaining e11.7 bn of this amount will be disbursed in July 2018, so we include that forecast.121 The fourth compliance report was first issued in June 2018 and updated in July 2018. We use this as our 2018Q2 forecast (EC (2018a)). At this point, e46.9 bn had been disbursed.

Note that this forecast is for a disbursement of July. For the 2018Q2 forecast, we therefore assume a date of July.122 For the 2018Q3 forecast, we assume the final disbursement of e15 bn will be given in August 2018, which is the end of the programme.",

There was an early repayment of e2 Billion in February 2017 coming from the sale of assets.123 Using the wayback machine, these repayments were applied to the final tranches in 2058 and 2059 of each disbursed loan, which we use as well.
