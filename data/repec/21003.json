I nevertheless address such concerns in Online Appendix Table 5 by repeating the paper\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 s main speci\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6cation when scaling investment by time-invariant pre-2003 measures of \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6rm capital stocks.",

The addition of this vector of controls barely changes the point estimate and con\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6dence interval. The econometric reasons are straightforward. First, the main speci\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6cation is reweighted on two-digit NAICS industry codes within each year, so cross-industry dierences were already \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a1 exibly controlled for. Second and su cient on its own, the distribution of asset lives of C-corporations and S-corporations in my sample are nearly identical: the C-corporation means of ELIGIBLESHAREit and MEANELIGIBLELIFEit are 85% and 6.05 years, while the S-corporation means are 84% and 6.04 years, respectively, implying that accelerated depreciation subsidized investment similarly for the two types of corporations.",

Whereas column 4 \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a1 exibly controls for the eect of accelerated depreciation only, columns 5-10 use the investment model of Auerbach and Hassett (1992, hereafter \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093AH\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d ) to control for the combined eect of contemporaneous changes in the top individual ordinary income tax rate, the capital gains tax rate, and accelerated depreciation on \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6rms\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2(user) cost of capital: the required pre-tax rate of return on marginal investments.",
        "An extensive literature in the 1980s (e.g. Summers 1981; Abel 1982; Feldstein 1982; Auerbach and Hines 1987; Auerbach 1989) extended the canonical model of investment, taxes, and the cost of capital (Hall and Jorgenson 1967) to encompass microfounded adjustment costs and 66 More precisely, eligible property comprises property depreciable under the General Depreciation System (GDS) of the Modi\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6ed Accelerated Cost Recovery System with an asset life of 20 years or less. Property required to be depreciated under the Alternative Depreciation System (ADS, typically property installed outside the United States) was not eligible regardless of asset life, so the small fraction of investment depreciated under ADS is not included in ELIGIBLESHAREit or MEANELIGIBLELIFEit. I assume that the small fraction of investment expensed under Section 179 was eligible.",
        "Relative to the paper\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 s main results (reprinted in column 1), these controls have almost no eect on the point estimate and standard error. Column 8 controls for a quartic in the cost of capital rather than just linearly, with very similar results. Columns 5-6 show the same when controlling only for the depreciation rate or only for the cost of capital.76 Econometrically, the coe cient on the cost of capital in the regression underlying column 7 is substantial and negative (mentioned above), but the cost of capital is largely uncorrelated with the key interaction term (between the C-corporation indicator and the post-2003 indicator).",
        "Thus the omission of the cost of capital from the main speci\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6cation induces little omitted variables bias. Economically, the cost of capital variable is conditionally uncorrelated with the interaction term because accelerated depreciation and the capital gains tax rate reduction had similar eects on the cost of capital for C- and S-corporations and because the reduction in the top individual ordinary income tax rate reduced S-corporations\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2cost of capital by similar magnitudes both before and after 2003. I explained in Online Appendix D.i why accelerated depreciation had similar eects across C- and S-corporations. The capital gains rate aects C- and S-corporations similarly via the discount rate ccorp(i);t. The legislated path of top ordinary income tax rate reductions immediately lowered S-corporations\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2cost of capital because economic depreciation is slower than tax depreciation, shown analytically in the very similar setup of Auerbach (1989 Section 3B).",
        "Alternatively and due to frictions not present in standard models like AH, it is possible that investment responds more to accelerated depreciation (e.g. due to \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6nancial frictions as in Zwick and Mahon 2014) than to small changes in business income tax rates (e.g. due to optimization frictions as in Chetty 2012).

        "placebo test is unsurprising given that the 2001-2002 cost-of-capital reduction for S-corporations was driven by the relatively small change in S-corporations\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2business income tax rate rather than by accelerated depreciation. Distinguishing between these explanations is left to future work. Regardless, none of the tests reported in Online Appendix 6 suggests that the paper\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 s main estimate of the eect of the dividend tax cut on investment is confounded by eects of contemporaneous tax changes.",
