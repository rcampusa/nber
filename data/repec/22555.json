        "of the datasets because of differences in reference period and questions asked. In the CPS-ORG we use the hourly wage as constructed in the National Bureau of Economic Researchs CPS Labor Extracts (Feenberg & Roth, 2007). For the CPS-ASEC and ACS we define hourly wages as total annual earnings divided by the product of usual hours worked per week and weeks worked per year.42 All wages are deflated into real 2005 dollars using the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, and wages exclude self-employment, self-owned business, and farm income.",
        "To do so we follow a methodology similar to that used by Aaronson & Sullivan (2001)\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u009d our primary adjustments are that we use five race/ethnicity categories instead of four and we define employment more narrowly as being employed exclusively in the private business sector to match the sample selection stated in Section A.1. Given that the methodology is substantively unchanged, this section is largely a restatement of Box 1 from (Aaronson & Sullivan, 2001, p. 65).",
        "Ideally this would have been estimated on ACS data to ensure consistency between these projection models and the log-wage regression. However, in order to distinguish age and cohort effects the projection model must be estimated on multiple years of data. Since there is no pre-2000 data for the ACS, this forces us to rely on another dataset to construct the education and employment projections. trols. The estimated model is then used to predict the fraction of individuals with each level of educational attainment based on the Census Bureau projections of the age, gender, and race/ethnicity distribution of the population.",
        "are constant over time means that the Fisher Ideal index collapses into the Laspeyres index, which does have the circularity property. This allows us to construct alternative projection scenarios based on assumptions about the education and employment distribution in a target year alone, without having to make assumptions about the path of educational attainment or EPOP between now and then. Therefore our projection scenarios discussed in 5 are based on the Census Bureau age projections for the years 2022 and 2025 and the education and employment assumptions described below."
