The wording of the trust question is identical to the one used by the WVS, although the answers are coded on a scale from 1 to 10, instead of the discrete 0/1 choices adopted by the WVS. To ensure comparability between countries, we convert into 1s all the answers greater than 5. The first round of the ESS was fielded in 2002/2003, the second in 2004/2005 and the third in 2006/2007.
