The citymonth data on NPIs and patenting rates is aggregated to an annual frequency represented by shifted years (where the start of each year is shifted by four months to the left (e.g., so that 1918 includes September of 1917 to August of 1918)). The top panel shows the coefficient estimates on the binary measure of treatment (cumulative NPIs longer than 90 days) interacted with year indicators, while the bottom panel reports the same for the continuous measure of cumulative days of NPIs (divided by 30). The regression models include city and year fixed effects, and the shifted year corresponding to September of 1917 to August of 1918 is the reference category. Point estimates are shown by the black circles, and the 95% confidence intervals (dashed lines in gray) are based on city-level clustering.",
        "A1.2 Extending the Markel et al. (2007) Sample Markel et al. (2007) provide the standard data set for NPI length during the 1918 pandemic.",
        "Their data includes the sum of days of enforcement for each type of NPIs in 43 cities for which they obtained a complete history of NPIs and weekly influenza data. The limiting factor is availability of weekly influenza data (Beach et al., 2020).",
        "We use the 43 cities included in Markel et al. (2007) and add seven cities for which there is systematic historical documentation of responses to the 1918 pandemic in the Influenza Archive 2.0 (2016), an extension of the historical data collected in support of Markel et al. (2007). These seven cities are Atlanta, GA; Charleston, SC; Dallas, TX; Des Moines, IA; Detroit, MI; Salt Lake City, UT; and San Antonio, TX. Whereas the 43 original cities in Markel et al. (2007) were primarily located in the Northeast and Upper Midwest, five of these seven additional cities are in Southeast and West.",
        "Second, mandatory I&Q measures appear to have been unpopular and used less commonly than other measures. Table 2 of Markel et al. (2007) is a bit difficult to parse, but appears to indicate that mandatory I&Q measures are used in fewer instances than other measures and combinations of measures, and when used alone, are used for relatively short periods of time. Moreover, at least one state (Iowa) banned mandatory I&Q measures as a violation of civil liberties, leading us to believe that they were relatively unpopular.",
        "We also show that our primary results hold when considering only the 43 cities in Markel et al. (2007). Columns (3) and (4) in Appendix Table A.3 replicate the Table 1 analysis and show that the estimated coefficient magnitudes in the 43 city and the 50 city samples are similar. Appendix Figure A.2 further documents the robustness of our main results to dropping individual cities from the estimation sample.",
        "A1.3 Other data sources We augment our estimation sample with city-level data on total population from the historical US Decennial Censuses, 1900-1930. Intercensal values are linearly interpolated between the Aprils of each Census year. We also construct city-level controls for literacy rates (share of the population that could both read and write) and schooling (share of the population enrolled in school) in the 1910 Decennial Census.",
        "Columns (7) and (8) in Appendix Table A.3 are based on the preferred specification in Table 1, but include an additional interaction between an indicator pandemic severity at the city level and indicators for the Post period (Simple DD model), and indicators for the Before, During, and After periods (Extended DD model). To measure pandemic severity at the city level, we use the log of excess pneumonia and influenza mortality per 100,000 population during the 24 weeks from September 8, 1918, through February 22, 1919, as reported in Markel et al. (2007).",
