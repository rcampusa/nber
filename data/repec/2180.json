        "1This leaves open the question of why citizens do not require their representatives to rebate any tax revenues in excess of optimal expenditures. There are a number of theories which attempt to explain non-responsiveness of this kind; such models tend to emphasize the costs that voters must Incur to obtain the relevant information and oust non-responsive incumbents. See, e.g., Atkinson and Stiglltz [1980, Chap. 10].",

        "10Alternatively, matching rates do not change the reduced form relationship, which is all that matters for Granger-causality. However, the matching rates are embedded in the coefficients, so they would have to be taken into account if one attempted to recover the coefficients of the underlying structural model.",

        "19 + 16 + 13 + 10 = 80. For each year we estimate 10 parameters; for a total of 50. The degrees of freedom is simply the difference: 80-50.",
        "16When expenditures are excluded from the equation, the other coefficients barely change. The coefficients on Rt_i, Rt2 Gti and Gt_2, respectively, a are 0.567 (.122), -0.00677 (.0216), -0.156 (.0575), and-0.0833 (.018)."
