        "Proof: Consider a set of x*(Ri) and a 1*(Ri) satisfying the above problem for each Ri for a A which causes the constraint to be satisfied. Now consider any x(Ri) and l(Ri) satisfying the constraint. By the optimality: (PjQi - Xv Ri' si)) < xj (piqi ~ Xv Ri Now, integrating both sides over Ri and imposing the constraint: / Y1 x*i (piqi\"> ~ Xv - (piqi\"> ~ Xv J R i \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u00be\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2 J R i \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2 < / ^XjiPjQi) R* 3 JRi 3 This proves the result, \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a1 A.2 First-Stage Regression Estimates First-stage regression for average utility 2SLS (dependent variable = price in $1000s) Variable Estimate constant 2.38 (0.64) Pi \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0080\u009e\u00c2\u00a2 8Dj dPj 0.12 (0.04) w 2.20 (0.63) Div ^4.89 x 10-5 (7.87 x 10-5) FP 0.20 (0.26) NFP -0.29 (0.23) Teach 0.74 (0.26) tech \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d 1.22 x 10 (1.78 x 10-2) K2 F N 0.086 4.91 374"
