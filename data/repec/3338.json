        "Footnotes This paper is a substantiallyrevised version of one prepared for the conference on 'The Problem of Development\" held at the State University of New York at Buffalo in May 1988. The analysis of the two sector model in our work, particularly in its open economy versions, draws heavily on some recent research by Marianne Baxter [1988L We also thank her for pointing out the relationship between our model building activity and the arguments of TW. Schultz [19811. Finally, we have benefitedfrom coents by Stanley Fischer and Arnold Harberger\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dwhodiscussed the paper at the Buffalo conference\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009das well as by Kenneth Judd, who discussed the paper at the Summer Econometric Society meetings.

        "1This class of models is very large, including structures with many capital stocks in the growth \"core\" and with nonreproduciblefactors outside the growth 'core' (Rebelo [1987]); or with steady states that are only asymptotically obtained (Jones and Manuelli [1990]).",
        "An important assumption in our approach is that the changes in productivity susasarized by the evolution of the composite human capital good are embodied in the representative worker. See Romer (1986, 1988b] for analyses that do not rely on this embodiment assumption. 10By Dg(x), we mean the derivative of the function g with respect to x; correspondingly,D2g(x) demotes the second derivative. 11The details of this procedure are reported in Appendix A 121t also depends positively on the number of hours, N, which is exogenous in our model. In economies with variable labor supply, therefore, policy may affect human capital accumnilation via the supply of labor, a channel not considered here.",
        "13The U.S., Japan and the U.K. follow this tax system. An alternative tax convention is the \"territorial system\" which exempts from taxes all capital income earned abroad. See Swenson [1989] for a detailed discussion."
