The value of common stock at the beginning of the year is the average price over the last fiscal quarter of the previous year times the number of shares outstanding at the end of the previous fiscal year.

        "Replacement Value of the Capital Stock (K). Kt represents the capital stock at the beginning of period t. The replacement value of property, plant, and equipment is estimated from book values using a method similar to Salinger and Summers (1983). We set the initial value of K to the book value of gross plant for the first year the firm appers on the Value Line database. The capital stock is then defined iteratively as B1 {I \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00b7 Kt_ij x (1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d1/LIFE).",

The final term is based on the assumption that economic depreciation is single\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009ddeclining balance. Our results were not changed substantially when we assumed double\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009ddeclining balance economic depreciation or when the initial value of K was set equal too the firm&apos;s net plant. For mature firms, the starting point for this procedure generally stretched back to the late 1950g. For newer firms, the initial book value of their capital stock probably is a good estimate of its replacement cost. Thus, the capital stock estimates should exhibit little inflationary bias for our sample that begins in 1969.",
        "Tax Parameters for Q. As in Salinger and Summers (1983), we estimate values for X1 and z, assuming that Ci) tax policy parameters are assumed to remain constant, and (ii) the sum of the required rates of return on investment and expected inflation is equivalent to the nominal BAA bond rate plus 0.06.",

The average effective tax rate on dividends (0) is taken from Feldstein and Jun (1986).

The corporate tax rate T was set at the statutory maximum marginal rate. Market value of inventories (N). Since inventories are included in the market valuation of the firm, but not in the replacement cost of the fixed capital stock, we subtract N from the market value of the firm.",
        "There was no substantial difference in the results when N was instead added to the replacement cost of the firm&apos;s capital stock. Inventories for each firm are converted from book value to market value using the procedure outlined in Salinger and Summers (1983) and Value Line data concerning whether the firm uses LIFO or FIFO methods of inventory accounting. B4 Investint Tax Credit (k). Information on legislated values of the investment tax credit was taken from the Washington University Macro Model. Information on the mix between equipment and structures was taken from aggregate data. Cash flow (cr). Our cash flow variable is taken from the Value Line database. Q Definitions.
