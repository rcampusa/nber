        "This series is defined as loans and leases net of unearned income, allowance and reserve. In March of 1984, the series was changed to include lease financing receivables, therefore prior to March 1984 rcfd2 125 and rcfd2 165 (lease financing receivables) must be summed to insure comparability. Starting in March 1984, transfer risk reserve is also being netted out. Prior to that time this type of adjustment does not appear to have existed, so there is no way to avoid a slight discontinuity.",
