I focus primarily on comparisons with other analyses of the minimum wage changes implemented during the Great Recession. The empirical debate over the longer panel of state and federal minimum wage changes, in which Dube, Lester, and Reich (2010), Neumark, Salas, and Wascher (2014), and Meer and West (Forthcoming) are prominent entries, is beyond this paper\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s scope.",

My estimation frameworks mirror those in Clemens and Wither (2014b) as closely as possible. They are the repeated cross sectional analogs of the prior paper\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s analysis of individual level panel data. One purpose of the current paper is thus to explore whether CPS data cross validate the prior paper\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s analysis of SIPP samples from the same historical episode. Several differences between the CPS and SIPP data environments are worth discussing.",
        "30Early analyses of employment-based human capital accumulation highlighted the theoretical possibility that minimum wage increases may reduce opportunities for on-the-job training (Rosen, 1972). In standard models of general and firm specific human capital, the incidence of firms\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 costs for general human capital training falls on workers through wage offsets. Wage floors may reduce the scope for these implicit exchanges of compensation for training. Direct analyses of the minimum wage\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s effects on training are rare and arrive at mixed results (Neumark and Wascher, 2001; Mincer and Leighton, 1980; Acemoglu and Pischke, 1999; Arulampalam, Booth, and Bryan, 2004). Clemens and Wither\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s (2014b) evidence on earnings trajectories suggest that dynamics of this sort, coupled with more straightforward losses in experience accumulation, may have been at work during this historical episode.",
        "31I have changed the years associated with Addison, Blackburn, and Cotti\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s (2013) references if the reference has subsequently been published or if I was unable to find the original source cited. As of this writing, the first three references remain in working paper form, while Hirsch, Kaufman, and Zelenska\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s (2015) analysis of Georgia and Alabama quick-service restaurants has subsequently been published.",
        "Even and Macpherson (2010) use CPS data from the 2005-2009 period to estimate standard minimum-wage employment equations, and report negative minimum wage effects on employment for teenagers during this interval.",
        "Gittings and Schmutte (2014), using both CPS and Quarterly Workforce Indicators data, find a negative effect on teenage employment for the longer sample period 2000-2009. Hoffman and Ke (2010) focus on the final installment of the latest federal minimum wage increase in 2009. They estimate cross-state differenced models of the minimum-wage impact, finding no significant disemployment effects among teenagers but a significantly negative effect for workers aged 20 to 24. On the other hand, Hirsch, Kaufman, and Zelenska (2015), who investigate establishment-level data for quick-service restaurants in Georgia and Alabama, 2007-2009, fail to uncover any evidence of a negative employment effect.",
        "The most obvious difference between the current paper and the analyses in the papers referenced above is their emphasis on employment among teenagers and/or in food service establishments.32 Analyzing populations beyond teenagers and food service establishments is important for two reasons. First, teenagers are less relevant than low-skilled adults from an anti-poverty policy perspective.33 They are more likely than low-skilled adults to be 32Somewhat earlier work on particular demographic groups, such as teenagers, includes Card (1992a), Card (1992b), Neumark and Wascher (1995), and Currie and Fallick (1996). Additional work on teenagers and/or specific industries, like food service and retail, includes Katz and Krueger (1992), Card and Krueger (1994), Kim and Taylor (1995), Neumark and Wascher (2000), Dube, Lester, and Reich (2010), and Giuliano (2013). An exception is Meer and West (Forthcoming), who analyze aggregate employment growth.",
        "33As emphasized by Burkhauser and Sabia (2007) and Sabia and Burkhauser (2010), it is primarily lowskilled adults, rather than teenage dependents, who are the intended beneficiaries of anti-poverty efforts.",
        "In the European context, Dolado, Kramarz, Machin, Manning, Margolis, Teulings, Saint-Paul, and Keen (1996) observed during the mid-1990s that teenagers, at that time, accounted for a relatively small share of all low-paid workers.",
        "Assessing the minimum wage\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s effects on poverty rates, employment opportunities, and the earnings distribution requires directly analyzing the employment and earnings of low-skilled workers themselves. In contrast with the studies discussed above, Clemens and Wither (2014b) use panel data to identify a much broader population of very low-skilled workers. In the CPS\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s repeated cross-sectional setting, the present study\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s differences-in-differences analysis focuses on individuals ages 16 to 30 with less than a high school education.34 Its second empirical approach exploits continuous variation in the minimum wage\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s bite across sets of skill groups that fully partition the 34See Sabia, Burkhauser, and Hansen (2012) for a recent paper that primarily analyzes low-skilled adults.",
        "36The discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of various estimation strategies by Dolado, Kramarz, Machin, Manning, Margolis, Teulings, Saint-Paul, and Keen (1996) is, in many respects, quite prescient regarding sources of disagreement in the recent literature.",
        "A key element of the program evaluation approach adopted here is the visual presentation of results (see Figures 4 and 5) that provide evidence on potentially relevant dynamics. Potentially relevant dynamics include anticipation effects and the possibility of differences between short and long run responses. Allowance for anticipation effects is particularly important in this setting due to the 26 month lag between the relevant legislation and the implementation of the third and final increase in the federal minimum wage. Regarding employment dynamics, simulations by Meer and West (2013) show why analyses of the longer panel of state minimum wage changes will tend to have difficulty estimating anything other than relatively short-run effects.",
        "The empirical approaches in this paper and Clemens and Wither (2014b) are facilitated in part by the historical setting. In contrast with the longer panel of state and federal minimum wage changes, the period analyzed here has three attractive features.",
