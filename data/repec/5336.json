        "10. This parameterization is unlikely to be literally true, since the relationship between changes in input quantity and utilization is generally state-dependent. It is, however, a convenient way of presenting the results.",
        "12. The only major difference between the industry groupings in the Jorgenson data and the standard 2- digit S.I.C. classification is that Motor Vehicles (S.I.C. 371) are separated from other transportation equipment (S.I.C. 372-79). (This is the standard practice of the BLS, though not of the BEA.) Thus, there are 21 manufacturing industries in the panel rather than the usual 20.",
        "14. Quality-adjustment makes very little difference to the main results of the paper. Most of the regressions in the paper use materials as the only quantity variable on the right hand side, and there has been almost no change in materials quality (i.e. composition). The only noticeable effect is on the conventional estimates of) (e.g. in Table I), which are about 5 percent larger with non-quality-adjusted data.",
        "18. Also, the two concepts of returns to scale are not the same. Conceptually, Hall is estimating the degree of increasing returns in the production of value added, which is larger than the degree of increasing returns in the production of gross output. Given an average materials share of 0.6 over the sample period, gross-output returns to scale of 1.10 translate to value-added returns to scale of 1.30 - still far from the estimates of about 3 reported by Hall [1990].",

        "25. Only the relative homogeneity of V to H matters, so the normalization of H is innocuous.",
        "30. Note, however, the caveat about composition bias discussed at the end of Section III."
