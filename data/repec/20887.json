        "A Data Our main data are restricted use data from the Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS), which contain data on almost all inpatient discharges in New York state from 1995 to 2011 \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u009d a period of 17 years. SPARCS data include all inpatient discharges from all Article 28 licensed hospitals, defined as general hospitals, nursing homes, and diagnostic treatment centers.",
        "To examine the completeness of the SPARCS data, we compare it to New York state hospital counts from the American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey, as compiled by the Kaiser Family Foundation (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2011). We plot the number of hospitals from both sources in Figure A1. There are approximately 225 to 250 hospitals in the SPARCS data in each year from 1995 to 2011. The figure shows that our data include more hospitals in each year than AHA reports because the AHA Annual Survey only includes \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00c5\u0093community hospitals,\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u009d a smaller subset of all hospitals."
