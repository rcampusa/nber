        "There is general agreement that Nicaraguas official GDP underestimates real GDP. There is less agreement, however, on the magnitude of this underestimation. While according to the World Bank (2002) adjusted GDP is approximately 1.7 times the official figure, other experts have argued that the adjustment should be closer to 1.3 times. For the sake of consistency, in the rest of the paper I use official GDP data. The results, however, would not be affected significantly if adjusted data are used. I briefly deal with this issue in the concluding remarks section.",
        "This figure assumes that Nicaragua has used all traditional debt relief mechanisms available to it under the so-called Naples terms. See World Bank and IMF (2000), Tables 3 and 4."
