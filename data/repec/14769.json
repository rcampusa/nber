        "The second dataset we draw on is the text files from Compact Disclosure. This is an electronic version of the 13-F forms that all institutional organizations are obliged to lodge at the SEC on a quarterly basis if they have at least $lOOm in equity assets under discretionary management. The data includes the numbers of institutional owners, the number of share issues and the percentage of outstanding shares held by each institution (our key measure of institutional ownership). This dataset is not wholly consistent before 1990, so we use ownership data from 1991 onwards. The ownership data covers almost all the firms in the Computsat-USPTO match (we lose only three observations due to ownership changes in 1990), so the merging of the two datasets is straightforward.",
