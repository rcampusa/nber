Some microfoundations for the wage Phillips curve In this appendix we sketch how one may derive our wage Phillips curve from a microfounded model. As shown in Gal\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00ad (2011), the aggregation of wage decisions by monopolistically competitive unions reoptimizing the nominal wage with a constant probability every period and with partial indexation to a measure of lagged price in\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a1 ation p t 1 in case of no reoptimization, implies the following relation between wage in\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a1 ation and the wage markup gap w;t n w;t, i.e. the gap between the average wage markup, w;t , and the natural (or \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a1 exible wage) wage markup, n w;t ew t = Etfew t+1g w( w;t n w;t) where ew t w t [ p t 1 + (1 ) ].

        "Gibbs sampling algorithm The Gibbs sampling algorithm is identical to that described in the online appendix of Gal\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00ad and Gambetti (2015). We use all the data points available from 1964:Q2 to 2017:Q4. We draw 50000 realizations discarding the \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6rst 40000 and then taking 1 out of 10 draws, therefore collecting a total of 1000 realizations."
