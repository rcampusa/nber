        "Direct inputs may include purchase of informational services from analysts or brokers, which we do not model in this paper, but this does not affect any of our results since heterogeneous analysts offer information signals of varying precision. Searching for good analysts and monitoring their performance is part of what we call asset management. Thus, unlike studies where purchased financial services are final inputs in the production of private information (see, e.g., Admati and Pfleiderer 1990 and Veldkamp 2006), in our approach investors draw independent inferences from information obtained from sellers.",
        "Our model\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0099s basic solution and inferences do not rely on the independence of \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b5 and x  or the ~~ diagonality of Sx. The former can be replaced with the the milder assumption that \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b5 and x are imperfectly correlated (see Admati, 1985). We assume that Sx is a diagonal matrix to simplify the exposition of the analytical proofs of some of our market level propositions.",
        "Put differently, PIC, which Verrecchia (1982) calls \u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u009cprice informativeness\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u009d, accounts for the difference between the variance of the risky returns that is conditional on both private and implicit public signals, - --12 -1 ) 1~ -1 ) 1 ~ Var(\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b5 z , P)=(S + S + rSS S , rather than just a private signal  Var(\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b5 z )=(S + S . i \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b5 ix i \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b5 i",
        "For proof see, for instance, Admati (1985).  The solutions we derive also indicate why investors must generally recognize that the observed prices are subject to supply noises, i.e., f2 .0  in equation (3a). If -1 f= 0 , then \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b5=f (P-f0 )  by (3a). Since rational investors know f andf , the observed prices",
        "Equation (6a) is a natural extension of EHY (2008) and Verrecchia (1982). Note that each investor\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0099s optimal precision Si is a function of Vi,kk, which in turn (see equation 4b) is a function of the average precision S. Since the latter represents the aggregation of individual asset management, equilibrium requires their mutual consistency. We can also prove the existence of information equilibrium in this framework.",
        "As checks for robustness of our regression specifications, we also run the baseline and expanded models by using projected wage rates from an extended Mincer regression model by including both sex ratios (the ratio of girls to boys in primary and secondary education) and infant mortality rates as additional instrument variables. The results are reported in Appendix Tables B4 and B5.  These results are consistent with the ones reported in the text.  As additional robustness tests, we have employed an alternative measure of average schooling attainments, based on Cohen and Soto (2007) in addition to the Barro and Lee measure in all regressions, and an alternative wage rate measure computed by OECD, in addition to our BLS measure, in our OECD-subsample regressions. All robustness tests produce similar findings."
