        "To convert the immunization shortfall into DALYs lost, the result from equation (1) is multiplied by 3 (PCV doses per immunization) times an estimate of DALYs per PCV dose from the following table based on results from Tasslimi, et al. (2011).",

(2011) in their cost-effectiveness analysis. They calculate that this is the number of doses required for PCV to have the same rate of infant coverage as DTP-3.",
        "Start with India, which did not participate in the AMC program until 2017 and then only in five states. The potential for market expansion can be gauged from India\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s experience with the HiB vaccine, introduced with GAVI support in 2013 in India. By our calculations, 79 million Indian children were immunized against HiB by 2018. Assuming that the coverage of PCV in India were similar, adding India to the program would have expanded the AMC market by 53% over the 143 million immunizations administered under the program by 2018. This 53% market expansion surpasses the 4.76% threshold by such a large margin that the copayment reduction would be justified even the expansion into the India market were uncertain, with a probability as low as 9% (where 9% = 4.76% \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00b7 53%). This is true even though the expansion is limited to one country but extra cost per dose to make up for the reduced copayment is paid in all countries and across all periods in the model.",
        "India rolled out PCV in five states in 2017. Calculations similar to those above can be used to show that if reducing the copayment to zero would have induced India to roll out PCV three  years earlier in those five states, this alone would justify the extra cost (indeed, even if this market expansion were only 88% certain)."
