        "The design of policy instruments in a world where economic issues are often global, but decisions are taken by (many) sovereign states, is the core of the analysis carried out in Carraro and Siniscalco (forthcoming). 4 These problems are more fully analyzed in Carraro (1999a). New results are provided by Katsoulacos, Ulph, and Ulph in this book."
