        "For instance, if a licensed NP lived in Washtenaw County (MI) from 1990 to 2002 and Wayne County (MI) from 2003 to present, they would be counted in the total for Wayne County for the entire 1990-present time period. This no-mobility assumption is more problematic for years further back in time or far from the license expiration date. Appendix maintain an active license even if they are not actively practicing. If this pattern changes over time, our trends may over or understate the true trends in provider supply.",
        "We successfully collected at least some historical license data on both NPs and PAs from 35 states. We found that many states did not retain or would not provide records on inactive/expired licenses, or these licenses were missing key fields (e.g. address or issue date). Our sample is geographically diverse, with representation from most parts of the country. Our weakest coverage is in the upper mountain/plains states and the lower Mississippi River states. The years for which data is available varies across states, so our county panel is unbalanced: NP and PA supply data is available for 23 states covering 52% of the U.S. population in 1996, but increases to 35 states covering 80% in 2008.",
