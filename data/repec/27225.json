In the generalized difference-in-difference setting, researchers explore three distinct sources of variations: the difference in treatment timing across the timing group, the timing group compared with the never-treated group, and the timing group compared with the always-treated group. Goodman-Bacon (2018) shows that the generalized difference-in-difference estimator is a weighted average of all possible twogroup /two-period difference-in-difference estimators in the data. As in any least squares estimator, the weights are proportional to group sizes and the variance of the treatment dummy within each pair. Treatment variance is highest for groups treated in the middle of the panel and lowest for groups treated at the extremes.",
