In Alfaro, Kalemli-Ozcan, Volosovych (2008), we show that private foreign capital \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00afows from poor to rich countries (the Lucas Paradox) in a large sample of developed and developing countries during the last three decades. This negative correlation between capital \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00afows and the initial level of GDP per capita is robust for 1970\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a22000 but it goes away once we account for the e\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00afect of institutional quality. Institutions, representing long-run productivity, are the most important determinant of capital \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00afows and they can explain the Lucas Paradox.",
        "Our results in this paper are fully consistent with our previous results. We show that capital is \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00afowing to productive places, measured as average growth, during the last three decades once we account for the fact that low-growth countries receive a lot of capital in the form of aid and public debt from other sovereigns or multinational bodies (sovereign-to-sovereign lending). Does this mean then there is also no Lucas puzzle within the developing countries? This would be the case if relatively poor countries are the growing ones within the developing country sample. In a sample of 90 developing and industrial countries between 1980\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a22004, Dollar and Kraay (2006) \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00afnd, after they control the outlier nature of China, that there is a negative relation between capital \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00afows and initial GDP per capita (no Lucas puzzle) and there is a positive relation between capital \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00afows and growth. Appendix Table 15 takes a look at this issue in our sample of developing countries.",
