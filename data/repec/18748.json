The estimation procedure generalizes DellaVigna et al. (2012) to allow for gender-specific parameters. In the theoretical model, we suppress gender indicators for notational simplicity; we then spell out in the description of the estimation procedure which estimates are gender-specific. We also report the reduced form results by gender of completion of an unpaid survey."
