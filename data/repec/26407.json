        "To make our linked samples more representative of the underlying populations, we adapt the Bailey et al. (2017) reweighting procedure, with some minor adjustments: 1. We do not include polynomials for the day of birth as this information is not available in any of the historical censuses we use. Much of Bailey et al. (2017) piece uses the Longitudinal, Intergenerational Family Electronic Micro-Database (LIFE-M) sample, which is based on a random draw of birth certificates from Ohio and North Carolina.",
        "This dataset contains more individual-level information than the historical censuses used in our paper, one of which is the day of birth. 44 See footnote 33 of Bailey et al. (2017). 2. We do not control for the presence of siblings (but control for the number of siblings), as our starting sample of twin brothers automatically guarantees the presence of at least one sibling. 3. We use the names of parents, but because not all twins in our sample have both parents residing with them in a given census year with interact these terms with indicators for parent in the household. 4. We use a quadratic (second-order polynomial) in both age and year of birth because we are linking children from multiple censuses.",
        "5. For the degree of commonness of first and last names, we use the log of the number of people in the 1900, 1910, and 1920 censuses with that first or last name.",
        "We start by looking at the twins we identify in the 1900 census. Figure A.1 indicates that some of our twin pairs have different birth months and may not be actual twins. Overall, 55% of the twins in our baseline sample have the same birth month. Put differently, about half of the twins identified in the main text are potentially incorrect. This is consistent with Tan (2019), which also compares the twin rates in 1900 under the two different definitions.",
        "However, because there may be error in birth month\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009deither in the enumeration or the transcription\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dsome of the 45% of twin pairs with mismatched birth months may still be true twins. Further, because the likelihood of twins misclassification varies systematically with various household characteristics (Tan 2019), the overall direction of the bias, if any, is unclear. The effect of such misclassification on our results thus remains an empirical issue.",
        "[Figure A.1 about here.] Table A.1 shows that the return to education among all twins tagged using our usual twin procedure in the 1900 census was 0.053 log points. That this is larger than our baseline estimate is not surprising, given the trend we found in the return to education across cohorts (see Figure 5). The twins in 1900 are born between 1875 and 1900, with most born between 1890 and 1900. 45 The 1910 census only records the month of birth for persons residing in Alaska.",
