        "FOOTNOTES 1. The model is based on Atkinson and Sandmo (1979), but the results and their derivation are somewhat different. 2. Those who prefer to work with the direct utility function will find that the mathematics is only slightly more cumbersome. 3. It can be shown that the second-order conditions for an optimum are satisfied if the revenue from each tax is an increasing function of the tax rate. 4. The only if follows provided all elasticities are finite.",
        "5. It should be noted that (23) is not equivalent to the condition that the utility function be weakly separable into labour supply and some function of the consumption levels in the two periods except when the function of consumption levels is homothetic; see Atkinson and Stiglitz (1976) and Auerbach (1979). 6. This enables us to obtain a result and proof both of which appear to be much simpler than those in the literature.",
        "The envelope theorem is discussed in, for example, Dixit (1976). 7. We are assuming here that the incentive to invest depends only on the real rate of interest which will not be true if the corporate tax system is unindexed. 8. To be strictly accurate equation (60) shows that t w and t have oppos i te signs. But from _( 34) it can be shown r that when the tax rates have opposite signs it is the tax on labour income which is positive provided that the share of capital income is less than b/(l+b) where b is the / ratio of the absolute magnitudes of t w to t r \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2 This condition is-satisfied in all of our examples and in all plausible cases. ;"
