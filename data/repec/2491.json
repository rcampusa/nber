        "7. The same tests on the U.S. equations yielded long-run coefficients for the real exchange rate with the lagged dependant variable that were equal to the sums of the six-quarter lags reported in Tables 1-4. Thus in the U.S. case, the evidence supported the serial correlation correction, once a 6-quarter lag was introduced.",
        "3. The Beach-Mackinnon (1978) maximum likelihood procedure for correcting first order autocorrelation was used in estimating the U.S. equations. The Cochrane-Orcutt procedure was used for the Japanese equations.",
        "2. We further considered the inclusion of a real interest rate variable, but found, surprisingly, that it had little explanatory power, and did not significantly change the estimated exchange rate elasticities. The lack of explanatory power may be due to mulitcolinarity between the interest rate variable and the three variables TREND, LURT, and LRENGY.",
        "1. The IMF defines the exchange rate as the inverse of EP*/W from Section II. An increase of the index is an appreciation of the home currency."
