        "(Davis 1979, 109, 124\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c5) and a markup estimate (Harley 1998, table 5, 64). Labor and capital shares in value added are assumed 50:50 based on Harley (1998), and Harley and Crafts (2000), but modifying for the absence in our model of the non-traded sector. The implied value added in \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093cottons\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d is 6.3% of total value added. The employment share of this sector in England and Wales in 1851 was 5.9%, so this figure seems reasonable (Parliamentary Papers, 1852\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c3).",
        "Other textiles: These are the wool and silk industries. The value of outputs of 60.4 m. and intermediate inputs (15.8 for wool and 6.3 for silk) are from Deane and Cole (1967, 196\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c210) and Davis (1979). Labor and capital shares are again taken as 50:50. The implied value added here is 6.6%. That makes the combined value added in all the textile industries 12.9%. The employment share of all textiles in 1851 in England and Wales was 11%, but this is assumed a more capital intensive sector than on average.",
        "Iron and steel: This is here taken to include other metals and metal manufactures such as tin, copper, lead and zinc. Employment in these sectors was 5.5% of all employment in England and Wales in 1851. To account for these other metal sectors output was taken as 69.4, 1.5 times the output for iron alone given by Deane and Cole (1967, 225) figure for iron alone.",

        "Labor and capital shares are 67:33 based on Harley and Crafts (2000). This implies a value added share of 10.1%. The employment share of the metal industries in England and Wales was just 5.5%, but given the high assumed capital/labor ratio this is reasonable.",
        "Coal: A physical net output of 65 m tons for Great Britain was estimated from Church (1986, 3, 19). This corresponded to a value of 37.1 based on an average price at final consumption of 0.57. There was a domestic farm input of horses, oats, timber, etc., of 0.8 from Church (1986, 502, 521\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c2).

Inputs of guano, etc. from UK imports given by Davis (1979) assuming all of this went to British agriculture . Labor, capital, and land shares of 0.41, 0.15, and 0.44 are based on Clark (2002), table 2. These outputs are again scaled up to Britain by multiplying by the relative farm areas of Britain and England in 1866.",

Value added in the rest of the economy is calculated as a residual between this scaled up figure and the sums of output for the above industries. All tropical raw materials not used as inports in other sectors are assumed to be inputs here. In this sector, which includes large amounts of services, the inputs were assumed to be 70% labor and 30% capital.

Exports: Exports to Ireland, North America and the Caribbean, and the rest of World are calculated separately. For North America and the Caribbean, and the rest of World the data is from Davis (1979), p. 101, and is the average of 1854\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c6. Exports of cotton, iron and steel and coal to Ireland are based on the assumption that Britain produces the entire UK output, and Irish consumption is 0.142 of the UK total.

All intermediate input shares are as in Britain, except coal is replaced by wood produced in the agricultural sector. Labor and capital shares are assumed at 70:30 for cotton textiles, other textiles, iron and steel, coal and the rest of the economy, reflecting less mechanization (lower capital shares) than in Britain. The labor, capital and rent shares in agriculture, tropical raw materials and tropical food are set at 40%, 20%, and 40% as in British agriculture.
