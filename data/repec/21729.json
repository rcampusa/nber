For instance, if the top bracket is 800-1000, and values above 1000 are top coded, we assign the value 1100 to the top code. This method is conservative if the housing price distribution, like the wealth and income distributions, is right skewed. We have also tried alternative top codings, including simply imputing the threshold value. Our qualitative results were not sensitive to the variation tried."
