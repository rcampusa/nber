        "In 1866, Henry Phillips (1866, v) concluded that, the history of the notes [Continental Dollars] and the reasons why they were not fully liquidated [redeemed by the states], have been but imperfectly known. Our knowledge has improved little since. Most discussions of the topic, both in the classic and in the modern literature, are cursory at best. For example, a comprehensive documentation and discussion of state redemption of Continental Dollars does not appears in Baack (2008), Bolles (1969), Breck (1843), Bronson (1865); Brown (1993), Bullock (1895, 1900), Calomiris (1988), Ferguson (1961), Gouge (1833); Harlow (1929), Hepburn (1967), Jensen (1950), Perkins (1994), Ratchford (1941), Sumner (1968), or in any general history or textbook treatment of the revolutionary period. 4 Farrand (1966, 2: 308-10). 5 An emission is considered to comprise all bills issued with the same date printed on the bill. See Newman (1997, 58-69).  6 JCC (2: 221-3). 7 JCC (3: 457-9; 4-12). 8",
        "Derived from Bezanson (1951: 344); Boyd (1954, 10: 42-3); Carter (2006, 1: 25; 5: 652-3); Grubb (2008a); McCusker (1978: 10); Rabushka (2008: 796, 825, 862-3). 9",
        "Elliot (1843, 11) also reported estimates by Senator Woodbury, former Secretary of the Treasury, of $2,070,240 and $2,071,085 total Continental-State Dollars emitted. By contrast, Ratchford (1941, 38) said that $4,468,625 of these new bills [Continental-State Dollars] were put into circulation citing Harlow (1929, 62). However, Harlow (1929, 62) really said, Less than half the authorized total--about $4,468,625--was put into circulation... Half of $4,468,625 is $2,234,313, which is almost the total given by Elliot (1843, 11); Gouge (1833, 2: 25); and Hepburn (1967, 16). Unfortunately, Harlow cited JCC (19: 399-400) [15 April 1781] as his source. It turns out there is no entry in the JCC for 15 April 1781--it was a Sunday and Congress"
