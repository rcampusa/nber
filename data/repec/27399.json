        "Relevant Narrative about the 2005 German Elections. The Christian Democrats (CDU, center-right) were the only German party in the 2005 electoral campaign advocating an increase in VAT by 2% starting in January 2006 to lower non-wage labor costs (see CDU (2005), page 14). The Social Democrats (SPD, center-left) strongly opposed an increase in VAT, and instead favored a 3% increase in income tax for top income earners (see SPD (2005), page 39). The Greens (center-left) and Liberals (center-right) also strongly opposed an increase in VAT. The Liberals, for example, promised to decrease the general tax burden by EUR 19bn. All parties except the CDU strongly opposed raising VAT, including CDU\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s preferred coalition partner, the Liberals. The projections of the election outcomes were highly uncertain (see below), as were the fiscal policy measures the new government would have implemented.",
        "A VAT increase of 3% was therefore highly unexpected. Consistently, the opposition parties and the popular press accused the new government between CDU and SPD of electoral fraud after it announced this policy measure in November 2005, and they fiercely criticized the new government. The online appendix contains press clippings commenting on the VAT policy (see section A.5 of the online appendix).",
        "Empirically, households\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 inflation expectation over the next 12 months did not increase until January 2006, after the new government had announced its plans in November 2005 to increase VAT in 2007, rather than 2006 as the CDU had planned initially which is direct evidence German households did not expect an increase in VAT in 2006, as the CDU proposed.1 Neither of the two blocks\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u009dCDU and Liberals on the one hand, and SPD and Greens on the other hand\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u009dhad a majority in polls before the elections.2 In the actual election on September 1",
        "If voters had considered the CDU proposal credible, we should already see an increase in inflation expectation during the campaign in the summer of 2005, because the plan was to increase VAT in January 2006. 2 Eleven days before the elections, the polling institute Infratest Dimap predicted a vote share of 41% for the CDU, 34% for the SPD, 8.5% for the Left, 7% for the Greens, and 6.5% for the Liberals.

        "The coalition agreed on an overall contractionary fiscal policy (see below), including the 3% increase in VAT, and the use of one third of the additional tax revenue to decrease non-wage labor costs by two percentage points. The government planned to use two thirds of the VAT increase to consolidate the federal budget to comply with the Maastricht Treaty and hinder an infringement procedure by the European Commission. Table ?? in the online appendix shows the total tax revenue indeed increased in 2007, and Germany no longer violated the EU Stability and Growth Pact.",
        "Willingness to Spend versus Actual Spending. We are ultimately interested in how inflation expectations transform into actual consumption expenditure. Our survey only reports the willingness to purchase durable goods. Figure A.1 in the online appendix is a scatter plot of the cyclical components of log real durable consumption expenditure and the average propensity to purchase durables.4 Real and reported spending on durables are positively related, which is consistent with Bachmann et al. (2015). The correlation is 0.46. 3 See http://www.kas.de/upload/ACDP/CDU/Koalitionsvertraege/Koalitionsvertrag2005.pdf for details. 4 We use a Hodrick-Prescott filter with smoothing parameter \u00c3\u0083\u00c5\u00bd\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00bb of 1,600 to extract the cyclical component.",
        "The reported willingness to purchase has potential advantages compared to measures of actual expenditures elicited with surveys. Spending data in surveys typically contain noise, because survey participants might not recall their actual purchases, or they might overstate their purchases of visible products, such as cars, and understate the consumption of \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00c5\u0093sin\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u009d products, such as tobacco and alcohol (see Hurd and Rohwedder (2012) and Atkinson and Micklewright (1983)).",
        "Our natural experiment resembles the proposals in Shapiro (1991), Feldstein (2002), and Hall (2011), but deviates from the setting in Correia et al. (2013) in a few dimensions. First, the German government used 2 percentage points of the 3% increase in VAT to consolidate the federal budget, and 1 percentage point to lower indirect labor taxes by 2%.5 Empirically, we do not find any effect on labor force participation or unit labor costs.6 Moreover, we find similar marginal effects of inflation expectations on the propensity to purchase durables for full-time, part-time, and unemployed survey participants. In addition, Nakamura, Steinsson, Sun, and Villar (2016) question whether producer price dispersion has real economic costs.",
        "Second, we only observe attitudes towards purchases of durable goods. In a model with both durable and non-durable consumption, the intertemporal substitution effect of higher future consumption taxes is larger for durable goods (see Barsky et al. (2007) and Barsky et al. (2016)).7 5 Efficiency gains in the unemployment insurance system financed the second percentage-point decrease in indirect labor taxes. 6",
        "Data from the OECD show unit labor costs decreased in Germany during 2006 and 2007 in absolute terms and relative to France, Sweden, and the UK (see: http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?QueryName=426).",
        "Labor force participation, instead, barely changed from 58.4% in 2005 to 59.1% in 2007 (see: http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.CACT.ZS?locations=DE). 7",
        "Shapiro (1991) already emphasizes the effect of unconventional fiscal policy should mainly operate through expenditure on durable goods. Storability of durable goods can lead to an increase in durable expenditure due to a future increases in VAT even if the IES is small through an arbitrage effect.",
        "A potential concern for policymakers aiming to stimulate overall consumption is that households might substitute intratemporally from non-durable to durable consumption, because the VAT change did affect nondurable goods less than durable goods (see discussion below). We do not observe households\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 attitudes towards purchases of non-durable goods. To address this concern directly, we show realized non-durable consumption growth increased during 2006. German households also lowered their savings attitudes during 2006 in absolute terms and relative to matched foreign households, supporting the conclusion that households increased overall consumption (see Table 5).",
        "Farhi et al. (2014) show an increase in VAT coupled with a decrease in payroll subsidy can, under certain conditions, replicate an exchange-rate devaluation even within a currency union. Theoretically, this fiscal devaluation makes goods in Germany cheaper than French goods and results in an increase in the demand for goods produced in Germany by both French and German households. Crucially, the fiscal devaluation should barely affect the overall consumption decision of French households, and hence the spending attitudes of French households represent a plausible counterfactual for the spending attitudes of German households in our setting.",
        "Salience of VAT Changes. Pre-announced VAT increases are a salient way to generate future consumer price inflation and induce current spending compared to conventional and unconventional monetary policy or future government purchases. Menz and Poppitz (2013) study the media coverage of inflation in Germany during the time period of our natural experiment and document a surge in coverage of inflation.",
        "Reduced and Full VAT. All services and products in Germany are subject to a valueadded tax that is part of the European VAT system. The general tax rate was 16% until December 2006, and increased to 19% in 2007. A reduced rate of 7% applies to many convenience goods, such as food, books, or flowers. The reduced rate has been unchanged since 1983. Rent, services for non-profit organizations, and medical expenses are not subject to VAT. Virtually all durable goods are subject to the full VAT, whereas only 59% of non-durables are subject to a VAT rate of 19%.",
