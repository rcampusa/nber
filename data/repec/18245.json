        "For each 4-digit industry this variable stores the trade weighted proportion of product categories that were covered by a quota in 2005 by 4-digit industry categories.54 The instrument is then constructed as the interaction between the quota level and a dummy which takes the value of 1 for all years starting 2005. We limit the analysis to industries which are similar to the treated group, thus focusing on the textile and related industry (SIC codes 22, 23, 28 and 29, which were the 2-digit industries including sub-industries impacted by the quotas). We restrict the analysis to a 7-year window around the change (2002-2008).",
        "Textile Quotas Instrument: The relaxation of quotas for China started when it joined the WTO in 2001, and peaked in 2005 when the quotas were completely removed. The removal of the quotas generated an increase in the imports of Chinese goods in the categories for which the quotas were removed. We use the 2005 quota variable constructed by Bloom, Draca, and Van Reenen (2011).",
        "However, starting in 1997, the CM does not separately report capital stocks for equipment and structures. For plants which existed in 1992, we can use the investment data to back out capital stocks for equipment and structures separately after 1992. For plants born after 1992, we assign the share of capital stock to equipment and structures to match the share of investment in equipment and structures. A.3.4 TFP and TFP Shocks For establishment j in industry i at year t we de\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6ne value added based total factor productivity (TFP) b zj;i;t as log (b zj;i;t) = log(vj;i;t) S i;t log(kS j;i;t) E i;t log(kE j;i;t) N i;t log(nj;i;t); where vj;i;t denotes value added (output less materials and energy inputs), kS j;i;t represents the capital stock of structures, kE j;i;t represents the capital stock of equipment and nj;i;t the total hours worked as described above.

        "Our last sample (used in Figures 1 and 2), is based on the \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6rst sample, but includes only establishments that were active in 2005, 2006, 2008 and 2009. When calculating annual dispersion measures using CRSP and Compustat (see Table 1), we use the same sampling criteria as in the baseline ASM-CM sample, keeping only \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6rms which appear for at least 25 years. A.3 Variable Construction A.3.1 Value Added We use the Census value added measure which is de\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6ned for establishment j at year t as vj;t = Qj;t Mj;t Ej;t; where Qj;t is nominal output, Mj;t is cost of materials and Ej;t is cost of energy and fuels. Nominal output is calculated as the sum of total value of shipments and the change in inventory from previous year (both \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6nished inventory and work in progress inventory). In most of the analysis we use real value added. In this case, we de\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a1 ate value added by the 4-digit industry price of shipment (PISHIP) given in the NBER-CES data set.",
        "The fourth sample uses a balanced panel of establishments which were active for all years between 1972 and 2009. This sample consists of 3,449 establishments and 127,182 establishment-year observations.",
        "The second sample, which is our baseline sample, keeps establishments which appear for at least 25 years between 1972 and 2009. This sample consists of 15,673 establishments and 453,704 establishment-year observations.52 The third sample we use is based on the baseline sample limited to establishments for which \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6rms have CRSP and Compustat records, with nonmissing values for stock returns, sales, equity and debt. The sample includes 10,498 establishments with 172,074 establishment-year observations.",
        "The NBER-CES data are available only through 2009. 2010 industry-level data are therefore projected using an AR(4) regression for all external datasets.

        "The NBER-CES Manufacturing Industry Database is the main source for industry-level price indices for total value of shipments (PISHIP), and capital expenditures (PIINV).44 It is also the main source for industry-level total cost of inputs for labor (PAY). The total cost variable is used in the construction of industry cost shares. We match the NBER data to the establishment data using 4-digit SIC87 codes for the years 1972-1996 and 6-digit NAICS codes starting 1997.45 We complete our set of price indices using FRB capital investment de\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a1 ators, with separate de\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a1 ators for equipment and structures, kindly provided to us by Randy Becker.",

The ASM covers all establishments which were recorded in the CM above a certain size and a sample of the smaller establishments. The ASM includes 50,000 to 75,000 observations per year. Both the CM and the ASM provide detailed data on sales, value added, labor inputs, labor cost, cost of materials, capital expenditures, inventories and more. We give more details on the variables we use in the variables construction subsection below. A.1.2 Firm Level We use Compustat and CRSP to calculate volatility of sales and returns at the \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6rm level.42 The Compustat-SSEL bridge is used to match Census establishment data to Compustat and CRSP \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6rm\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 s"
