As sample sizes for children living in nonintact families in available surveys are small, we pool data from two sources: first, the 2007 wave of the Danish Longitudinal Survey of Children (DALSC), and second, the 2009 wave of the Children and Youth in Denmark (CYD) survey.51 The DALSC is a panel study of all children born in Denmark in one week of October 1995. The CYD is a survey conducted among random samples of seven cohorts aged 3-19 in 2009 and 2013. Both panel studies examine a broad set of topics related to children\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s living conditions, including custody arrangements.",

Finally, we only look at one- and twochildren families with fathers in the relevant income range (around the guideline thresholds), as in the main analysis. Our final survey sample consists of parents of 819 DALSC and 702 CYD children for a total sample size of 1, 521.",
        "Finally, the lower panels of the table focus on variables only available in two waves of the DALSC. First, we look at the same sample of children in the 2007 DALSC and their parents\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 reports from any of the survey years (1996, 1999, 2003, 2007, 2011). These data show that joint physical custody arrangements are relatively fluid over separation time: among parents who have a sole-mother arrangement in 2007, 13 percent have joint custody in any of the survey years. Overall, 33 percent of parents have a joint custody arrangement in at least one of the survey years.",
        "Second, we use the 1999 DALSC wave to look at the prevalence of gifts and other in-kind transfers between separated parents.52 We find that in-kind transfers are relatively uncommon: 19 percent of fathers have bought winter clothing for their children and only around four percent of fathers contributed to the costs of child care."
