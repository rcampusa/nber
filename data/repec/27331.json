        "We discard workers who declare less than 20 hours of work per week. We postulate a minimum hourly wage that is equal, in every year, to the 2015 statutory minimum wage (8.50 euros per hour), discounted by the relative price index.",
        "Starting with the system of individual weights provided by the GSOEP for the original sample, we construct a system of weights that keeps the age distribution constant over the years to the 1984 distribution, in an analogous manner to the US sample. B Model Computation In computing the model, we impose a vector of 20 possible values for individual human capital, h, log-spaced between h1 = 1 and h20 = 20. We discretize the vector of turbulence shocks, , as 10 equally spaced values between 0.01 and  = 0.6. The calibration routine minimizes a loss function defined, for each vector of parameters p, as the sum of the squared differences between the data-generated and the modelgenerated moment: min L(p) = X m am [Datam \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00cb\u0086\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Modelm(p)]2 . where the weight am is set equal to 10 for the moments that concern the fraction of workers with short- and long-term tenure (which is particularly important to match given our mechanism), and equal to one for the other moments.",
