        "APPENDIX 2: ECONOMETRIC AND SIMULATION DATA ECONOMETRIC DATA The 14 countries in our econometric sample were those countries included in Williamson&apos;s &apos;tvolution of Global Labor Markets\" (Ezplorwioiu in Economic History. 1994, forthcoming) for whichreal GD? data was also available. The countries are: Belgium, Denmark, France. Germany, Great Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Australia, Canada. and the United States. Annual estimates for real GD?, labor force, and real wages were calculated, and then decadal averages (1870-79. 1880-89, 1890-99, and 1900-13) were utilized to generate the four observations for each country. The idea was to focus on benchmark observations, ignoring short-mn annual variations, thus emerging with a panel totaling 56 observations. In each case, weattempted to exclude the impact ofterritorial changes.",
        "20Hamamesh does not include these studies in his survey, as they were not primarily interested in determining labor demand elasticities. For a survey of this literature see Berndt, op. cit.; and Berndt, E. R., The Practice of Econometrics, Classic and Coiuempora,y, pndg, Mass.: Addjson-WesJey. 1991, pp. 211t should be noted, however, that in the case of both the marginal productivity relation (MPC) and the reciprocal production function (RR), we could rejectthehypothesis that both the slope coefficients and constant terms are constant across countries (though for RR the rejection is borderline). Estimating a total of 28 or 42 parameters based on only 56 observations seems inadvisable at best.",

King&apos;s estimate of 533% In 1890 is roughly comparable to that of Haley for the 1900-1909 period (55.0%). although King&apos;s figures show labor&apos;s share contracting in both 1900 and 1910.
