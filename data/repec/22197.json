See also the discussion of the legality of such sanctions under WTO provisions in Metcalf and Weisbach (2009). Cramton, Ockenfels, and Stoft (2015) make an analogous argument in the form of a numerical example indicating that committing to a price tends to be less risky than quantity targets. Thus, according to this reasoning, equity transfers under cap-and-trade would have to be larger than equity transfers under a uniform price because of the increased risk imposed by caps. In a separate argument, they also indicate that choosing a particular green-fund equity-payment formula to encourage participation in a uniform price regime can itself be reduced from a seemingly n-dimensional problem to a one-dimensional focal problem.",
