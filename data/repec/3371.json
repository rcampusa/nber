        "According Co Che AugusC 1988 (p. 69) and 1989 (p. 47) issues of Che Survey of Current Business. Che stock of Japanese direct investment capital in the United States grew by 38.9 percent in 1986, 31.0 percent in 1987 and 51.8 percent in 1988.",
        "The sharp drop in Japanese equity markets during the winter of 1989-90 occurred too recently to be accounted for in the data studied in this paper.",
        "Our figures for the United States for the years 1967-69 are taken from our earlier paper (AA 1988b) , since our current version of the Compustat tape does not provide data for this period. This use of earlier calculations does not appear to pose a problem of comparability, as our methodolgy is the same and the two samples nearly so. The aggregate results for the two data sets for overlapping years (1970-84) are virtually identical.",
