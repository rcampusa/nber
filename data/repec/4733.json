        "Whilst we could not get a capital stock series to perfectly match the industry classification of the quasi-rents variable, we did also construct a rents variable that nets out capital costs, albeit at a slightly higher level of aggregation. Effects remained much the same as in Table V when this variable was used: more experiments of this kind are reported in Disney et a!. (1993).",
        "9. Thepredsewordingofthe eyquestionisas follows: in l98Oand 1984 \"How long ago did this establishment first engage in its main activity?\"; in 1990 \"Howlong has this establishment been operating here at this address?\". Therange of responses also differs. In 1980 and 1984 responses were banded into 1-3 years, 3-5 years, 5-10 years, 10-25 years and 25 or more years. In 1990 responses were continuousup to 20 years and then open-ended as 20 or moreyears. 10. For completeness, note that for non-manual recognition the comparable rise in the marginal effect associated with age demonstrates an even sharper increase from 0.04 to 0.16.",
        "5. Gosling and Machin (1993) report evidence in line with this suggesting that wage inequality would have risen by about 15-20% less than it did between 1980 and 1990 had the union structure of 1980 still prevailed in 1990. 6. Of course, the 25 employee cut-off point excludes a sizable (considerably less unionized) proportion of aggregate employment and this should be borne in mind when interpreting the results reported in this paper.",

It also has the virtue of being exogenous in the sense that it is determined in an earlier time period, probably at or around the date at which an establishment is set up: we elaborate much more on the historical feature of the determination of recognition status below.",
