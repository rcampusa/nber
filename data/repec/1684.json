        "Aivazian and Callen (1979) have shown that the ecjuityholders&apos; discount rate will be the appropriate criterion to guide investment if the firm is in a perfectly competitive industry or in steady\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d state equilibrium. It should be noted that z(-) depends on the path of current and future values of p and that (1k) can be derived only when (3) is embedded in a discounted cash flow expression (e.g., (10)). To derive (8b), we assume that (t), i(t, and p(t, t) are constant from t onward. These .ssuinptions could be abandoned, and the debt term at time t would become 5 { exp(\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d5 (p(t + u, t) + y))du (i \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009d (t + s)) i(t, + y } ds. 0 0 C",
