        "See, for instance, Bean (1994, pp. 587-88), Blanchard (1990, p. 72), and Layard et. al. (1991, pp. 169-70). The Bazen-Martin (1991) analysis of the French minimum wage also takes productivity growth as exogenous (see esp. p. 211).",
        "An exception is Freeman (1994, p. 14), who includes one paragraph suggesting that &apos;The evidence that the United States has done better than Europe in employment growth but worse in growth of real wages and productivity suggests that perhaps these are two sides of the same coin.\" However, this idea is not explored further. Lindbeck (1994b, p. 3) states in passing that \"the United States may be regarded as having vpaid&apos; for its successful employment performance by slow productivity growth and stagnating real wages.\"",
        "A general introduction to the convergence issue is provided by Baumol et. al. (1990), Chapters 5 and 9. More recent evidence, with particular emphasis on the U. K., is provided by Crafts (1993). The important role of convergence in explaining the divergence between U. S. and European productivity growth rates is validated below in Table 5.",
        "See Bernard and Jones (1994). Two reasons for the discrepancy are that The Unemployment - Productivity Tradeoff, Page 49 Bernard and Jones make no adjustment for hours (thus basing their comparisons on output per employee), and also they use PPP price comparisons for 1980 rather than the 1992 figures underlying Table 1.",
        "This section provides a bare-bones graphical discussion of a model developed in more detail by Alogoskoufis and Manning (1988), Blanchard (1990), Bean (1994), and Layard et. al (1991).",
        "These comparisons refer to the official U. S. 1994 unemployment rate and the projection of the French 1994 unemployment rate, OECD Economic Outlook, December 1994, Annex Table 54, p. A58.",
        "The French and U. S. output per hour growth rates for 1979-92 are, respectively, 2.14 and 0.63 percent per year in private nonfarm nonmanufacturing nonmining, and 2.85 and 2.50 percent per year in manufacturing."
