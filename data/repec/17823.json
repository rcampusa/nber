For details on mean squared gaps, see Svensson (2011c). Several years ago, when I was still a big fan of the output gap, I had a discussion with Alan Blinder about which of the many concepts of potential output was most suitable. He strongly recommended the unemployment gap instead, on the grounds of simplicity and smaller measurement errors. I have obviously come around to his view.",

        "Adrian and Shin (2011) and Diamond and Rajan (2011) also do not contain the frictions, such as sticky prices, that allow meaningful modeling of the effects of monetary policy. Yet another argument, which I do not discuss below, is that tight money is not the problem for the U.S. economy, and therefore easier policy is not the solution. I fail to understand this argument. If the economy is affected by negative shocks independent of monetary policy, it seems that easier monetary policy would remedy the situation, if easier policy is possible. The best thing would be to directly undo the negative shocks, but if this is not possible, easier monetary policy is an obvious second best. Calvo-style price-setting firms are assumed to index prices to \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u008f* when not setting the optimal price."
