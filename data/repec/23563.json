        "Before 1972, for each month t we use the most recent Roe computed with quarterly earnings from fiscal quarters ending at least four months prior to month t. Starting from 1972, we use Roe computed with quarterly earnings from the most recent quarterly earnings announcement dates (Compustat quarterly item RDQ). We require the end of the fiscal quarter that corresponds to its most recent Roe to be within six months prior to month t. This restriction is imposed to exclude stale earnings information. To avoid potentially erroneous records, we also require the earnings announcement date to be after the corresponding fiscal quarter end.",
        "Cop, cash-based operating profitability. Following Ball, Gerakos, Linnainmaa, and Nikolaev (2016), we measure Cop as total revenue (Compustat annual item REVT) minus cost of goods sold (item COGS), minus selling, general, and administrative expenses (item XSGA), plus research and development expenditures (item XRD, zero if missing), minus change in accounts receivable (item RECT), minus change in inventory (item INVT), minus change in prepaid expenses (item XPP), plus change in deferred revenue (item DRC plus item DRLT), plus change in trade accounts payable (item AP), and plus change in accrued expenses (item XACC), all scaled by book assets (item AT, the denominator is current, not lagged, total assets). All changes are annual changes in balance sheet items and we set missing changes to zero. At the end of June of each year t, we calculate Cop for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00cb\u0086\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0099 1.",

We cumulate returns until one (trading) day after the announcement date to account for the one-day-delayed reaction to earnings news. rmd is the value-weighted market return for the Abr deciles with NYSE breakpoints and value-weighted returns.",
        "Ilr, industry lead-lag effect in prior returns. We start with the Fama-French (1997) 49-industry classifications. Excluding financial firms from the sample leaves 45 industries.

        "After year t + 3, we assume that the expected firm-level Roe mean-reverts linearly to the historical industry median Roe by year t + 12, and becomes a perpetuity afterwards. We use the Fama-French (1997) 48 industry classification. We use at least five and up to ten years of past Roe data from non-loss firms to compute the industry median Roe.",
