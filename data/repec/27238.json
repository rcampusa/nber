        "In Table B.1, we augment our baseline specification (reported in Panel B of Table 3) by controlling for the county level Democratic vote share in presidential elections of 1900 and 1904. Reassuringly, results, reported in Panel B of Table B.1, show that all coefficients remain precisely estimated and quantitatively very close to those reported in the baseline specification of Table 3 and displayed in Panel A of Table B.1 to ease comparisons.

        "very low immigration, and that could be potential outliers. In Tables B.6 and B.7, we replicate our baseline results trimming observations in counties with average 1910-1930 European immigration below (resp. above) the 1st and the 5th (resp. the 99th and 95th) percentiles respectively. Reassuringly, in all cases coefficients are in line with those reported in Table 3 (Panel B).",
        "Finally, we examine the possibility that the 1900 settlements of specific European groups across US counties might be correlated with both the long-run political ideology of Americans (or, with factors that determined them) and the migration patterns of that specific immigrant group in each decade between 1900 and 1930. As shown formally in Goldsmith-Pinkham et al. (2018), if this were to be the case, the validity of the instrument would be threatened. Following an approach similar to that used in Tabellini (2020), we replicate the analysis for each of our eight outcomes by adding \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c one by one \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c the share of each European group in the county in 1900 (relative to all immigrants from that group in the United States).",

Only for the 9th dot from the left, which plots results for the regressions that include the 1900 share of French immigrants, we note a slight drop in the magnitude of the coefficient. But, even in this case, results remain close to our baseline ones.",
