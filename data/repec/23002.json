        "Linearity. Equation (3) models the impact of places as a linear function of parental income. This is motivated by the strong linearity we observe in outcomes amongst permanent residents, but could potentially be violated when constructing the causal effects of places. Here, we relax the linearity assumption in two ways. First, we include quadratics in parental income for pc. This specification generates very similar estimates that are highly correlated with our baseline estimates at both p25 and p75. Regressing these alternative specifications on our baseline specification for p = 25, we estimate a coefficient of 0.974 at the CZ level and 0.991 at the county level; For p = 75, we estimate a coefficient of 0.994 at the CZ level and 0.969 at the county level. In short, consistent with the linearity in the outcomes of permanent residents documented in Chetty et al. (2014), the results are quite robust to relaxing the assumption of linearity in parental income.",
