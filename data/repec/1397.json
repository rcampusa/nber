        "1. Even the data on Japan are somewhat misleading, as they show total participation, including those employed in work for the market performed at home. When only work outside the home is included, the participation rate of Japanese women is also seen to have risen.",

        "5. If participation rates are diverging over time in some countries and converging in others, JDEV will be a bad measure of convergence. In only one of the 15 countries shown in Table I do they not converge, so this is not a problem here."
