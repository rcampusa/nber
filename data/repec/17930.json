        "For robustness, we compute two versions of a financial literacy index using the Van Rooij et al. (2011) method: one based on the four dummies used in our approach and another based on two dummies for each question \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c one each for the correct and \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093do not know\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d responses. Both versions of these indices are highly correlated with our index (Panel B).",
