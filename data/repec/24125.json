Though Griliches (1957) demonstrates that diffusion follows a logistic pattern over time, it is not ex-ante obvious that it does so in other variables \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c3\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u009c but in the event that it does, the results in Table C.1 lay to rest any concerns that the results in the paper are driven by mismeasurement of the dependent variable, as the patterns persist for the log-odds measure.",
        "As discussed in the paper, the focal definition also imposes an assumption of perfect indivisibility, despite evidence to the contrary of cooperative ownership (Myers 1921) and custom work (Gilbert 1930). To ensure that the results are not sensitive to this assumption, in Table C.2 I re-estimate these regressions defining diffusion as the number of tractors per 100 acres of county farmland. The regressions for 1925-1930 are estimated on a sample excluding the Plains states (North and South Dakota, Kansas, and Nebraska), where farmland was expanding rapidly at the time. The results are qualitatively similar to those in the body of the paper.",
