        "3. A database of all trademark filings at INAPI between 1991 and 2010. Constructing the linked database required matching the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical products with the associated patent application(s) and matching the product names with the associated trademark filing(s). In both cases there is no easy reliable way to do the matching and a large part of it was done manually. We describe the data sources and the matching effort in more detail in this appendix."
