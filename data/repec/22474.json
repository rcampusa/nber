        "Data are drawn from the Single Record Student Database (SRSD), the Michigan Student Data System (MSDS), which replaced the SRSD in 2010, and the Michigan Educational Assessment Program (MEAP) database. The SRSD and MSDS provide annual information on student demographics such as race, gender, subsidized meal eligibility, special education status, limited English proficiency (LEP) status, and migrant status. It also contains information on the grade level and schools a student attended each year since the 2002-2003 school year. The MEAP provides information on standardized test scores in a variety of subject-grade combinations. Students in Michigan are tested in 3rd through 8th grade and again in 11th grade."
