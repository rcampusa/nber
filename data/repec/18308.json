Wise. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 127-175. 31 Data Appendix Below is a list of expenditure categories for which we have compared Interview Survey (IS) and/or Diary Survey (DS) data to PCE aggregates. These categories were selected following Garner et al. (2006, 2009) and Passero (2011) who identified categories in the PCE and CE that are most comparable based on \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093concepts and comprehensiveness\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d. These comparable categories are 56 percent of the PCE in 2010. The concordance between PCE categories and the CE assembled in this previous work is based on integrated data\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dthe combination of data from both the IS and DS. Our analyses compare the IS and DS to the PCE separately. Consequently, some additional non-comparabilities will arise when a spending category is only available in one of the surveys.",
        "In the years 1980 to 1985, only two UCCs in this category are available in the DS, so we do not report DS ratios for those years. Outdoor equipment and supplies: Compatible. Although the IS and DS are compatible for this PCE category, the ratios in both surveys vary considerably over time. Because we are not able to resolve these sharp changes, we do not report the ratios for this category. 33 Televisions: Compatible.",
        "Audio equipment: Mostly compatible. Beginning in 1999:2 phonographs were replaced by \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093Accessories and other sound equipment\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d in the IS. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093Digital audio players\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d were added in 2005.",

In 2005, this UCC represented about 0.1 percent of the PCE aggregate for this category.",
        "In 1994:1 \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093Battery replacement, audio equipment, floor mats, seat covers, other accessories, batteries, and other equipment installed by CU\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d in the IS was split into two new UCCs: \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093Parts, equipment, and accessories,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d which is in the Motor vehicle accessories and parts category, and \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093Vehicle audio equipment excluding labor,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d which is in the audio equipment category. The latter seems larger, so we assign the pre-1994, combined UCC to the audio equipment category.",
        "Likewise, in 1994:1 \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093Purchase and installation of vehicle accessories, including audio equipment, customizing, and items such as luggage racks, fog lamps, and trailer hitches\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d was split into \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093Vehicle accessories including labor\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d and \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093Vehicle audio equipment including labor.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d As above, the pre-1994 combined UCC was assigned to the audio equipment category, which contains the latter UCC. In the years 1980 to 1985, only one UCC in this category is available in the DS, so we do not report DS ratios for those years.",
        "Recording media: Compatible. In the IS mail-order club purchases were merged into all audio media purchases beginning in 2005.",
