        "Data Appendix A. Processing of 1980, 1990, 2000 Census and 2005/2006 ACS 1. I begin with the 5% public use files of the 1980-2000 Censuses and the two ACSs. I define immigrants as all individuals whose citizenship status is either non-citizen or naturalized citizen - thus people born abroad to U.S. parents are not considered immigrants. From the Census files I extract 100% of all immigrants and a 50% random sample of natives over the age of 18. From the ACS files I extract all individuals over the age of 18.",
        "2. I adjust the person weight variables for the 1990 and 2000 Censuses to account for the undersampling of natives. I define a 1980 weight equal to 1 for immigrants and 2 for natives. For the ACS files I use the person weight.",
        "3. For the 1980 and 1990 Census files, I make two adjustments to the MSA/PMSA code. First, I assign MSA or PMSA to county groups (1980) or PUMAs (1990) that are not assigned an MSA/PMSA code if more than one-half of the residents live in a single MSA/PMSA. Second, I attempt to add or drop county groups or s to adjust for boundary changes between 1980 and 2000, for the 124 largest cities (as of 2000).",
        "4. For the 2000 Census I assign MSA or PMSA to PUMAs that are not assigned an MSA/PMSA code if more than one-half of the residents live in a single MSA/PMSA. For the ACS files, I assign the same MSA/PMSA to each PUMA as is assigned in 2000 Census (after adjusting for unassigned MSA/PMSA codes).",
        "3. The wage models for natives include the following variables: - cubic in experience - years of completed education - complete interactions of dummies for 4 education groups (dropout, high school graduate, some college, college graduate) with dummies for 5-year experience bins - a dummy for people with an advanced degree - a dummy for those who attended school last year - dummies for people who worked full time (>1400 hours) or low hours (under 1000) - interactions of dummies for black, Hispanic and Asian ethnicity with years of completed education and a dummy for college completion - a dummy for living in an MSA/PMSA that is at least partially in ones state of birth, interacted with dummies for 4 education groups - dummies for living in a smaller MSA/PMSA (not one of the top 124) or in a nonmetropolitan area."
