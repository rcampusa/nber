        "The resource constraint is Ct = Yt  &apos; t # (22) The model is solved with global methods. The agents take the presence of the zero lower bound into account and form their expectations accordingly. Therefore, the possibility of hitting the zero lower bound in the future aects potentially the equilibrium outcome in times of unconstrained monetary policy. We use time iteration (Coleman 1990 and Judd 1998) with piecewise linear interpolation of policy functions as in Richter et al. (2014).13 Expectations are calculated using numerical integration based on Gauss-Hermite quadrature. The state variable is d t , while the policy variables are t and labor Ht: t = g1 ( d t ) (23) Ht = g2 ( d t ) (24) where g = (g1 ; g2 ) and gi : R1 ! R1 . To solve the model, we approximate the unknown This approach can handle the non-linearities associated with zero lower bound. Richter et al."
