For example, let there be two predictors available: (1) perfect foresight, H(PNT.T)mP~, available at cost C>0; naive expectations H(P~_T)mP~_T, available at zero cost. Then Brock and Hommes (1994) show: If the dynamics (2.37h) are unstable when everyone uses naive prediction and are stable (in this case instant convergence holds) under perfect foresight, then, there is a critical value of choice intensity p such that limit cycles of period greater than two, as well as other complex behavior occur. In our context instability of"
