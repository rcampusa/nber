        "The estimates in Table A2 are also sensitive to the inclusion of trend terms by parity. Inclusion of a linear trend term almost triples the estimated effect for black women from-0.518 to-1.357 percentage points (columns 7 and 8), whereas a quadratic trend in parity eliminates any effect of the EITC on low birth weight (column 9). Trend terms interacted with parity may over fit the data, but as we show in Appendix A, Figure A1, the time-series pattern in low birth weight is clearly curvilinear especially The Tax Reform Act, 1986; Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, 1990; and the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, 1993 (Nichols and Rothstein 2016). among black women. At a minimum, the effect of the EITC expansions on low birth weight is observationally equivalent to nonlinear trends in low birth weight by parity unrelated to the EITC.",
        "In the lower panel of Table A2 we re-estimate the same model but limit the sample to the effective years 1983-1993. In this subsample there is no association between the Maxcreditpt and low birth weight for all women and all black women. Inclusion of a linear trend in parity eliminates any effect for white women. The lack of an association between the EITC expansions in 1986 and 1990 is not surprising given that take-up and the magnitude of the available tax credits were substantially less in these early expansions. The point, however, is that the estimated effect from the extended analysis is driven by the 1993 expansion, which we have argued lacks convincing evidence of a causal effect."
