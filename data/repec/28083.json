Data Appendix We draw on data from a variety of sources. Here we describe the main data sources we use for this analysis.",
        "Burning Glass Job Postings We use real time job postings data collected by Burning Glass Technologies (BGT). BGT is a private employment analytics company, which scrapes and processes the full text of online job postings from over 40,000 online job boards and company websites, producing a near-universe of online job postings since 2007. Because the data were new in 2007 and because there unfortunately exist no data for 2008 and 2009, we focus our analysis to 2010 onward. The data used in this paper were extracted on October 20, 2020 and use posting information from 2010 through October 18, 2020. Any information that is included in the job posting is available, including the job title, firm name, and any requirements such as a college degree. BGT assigns industry and occupation to ads that include firm name and job title, respectively.",
        "The ad-level data were first used in Hershbein and Kahn [2018] to understand the change in skill requirements before and after the Great Recession; after the Great Recession, harder-hit MSAs saw a relatively greater and persistent increase in cognitive and computer skill requirements. Combined with firm-level data on capital inputs they argued the evidence was most consistent with firm-level restructuring precipitated by the Great Recession towards labor-replacing technologies and away from routine workers.",
        "The CES is a survey of about 145,000 establishments each month, that collects data on total employment and payroll. Together with the CPS, data is collected each month for the week that contained the 12th of the month. The CES is used to construct the official measures of the total employment numbers. We report data from January 2020 through September 2020.",
        "The CPS provides the worker-level counterpart of to the CES, collecting a variety of data on individual-level labor market outcomes from a sample of about 60,000 households each month. The CPS is used to construct the official unemployment rate. In addition, the CPS uses a rotating panel, whereby households are surveyed for four consecutive months, take an eight month break, and are then surveyed again for four more months. In order to measure hiring and other mobility patterns, we match individuals across survey months using longitudinal link variables and confirm matches using sex, race, and age. Depending on the specification, we use data from as far back as January 1994, through September 2020. The JOLTS is a survey of approximately 16,000 establishments each month, that collects data on hires and separations over a month time frame, as well as job openings at the end of the month.",
        "We use this data to corroborate our findings using BGT. We use data from as far back as December 2000, when the series was created, through August 2020. Unemployment Insurance Data We use non-seasonally adjusted data on initial unemployment insurance (UI) claims that is reported by state agencies to the Department of Labor each week. These claims include all individuals who apply for regular state programs. This is a measure of individuals who have applied for benefits, but does not reflect whether they received benefits. We do not include claims for federal programs, including the new programs created during the pandemic. We retrieve the data from FRED (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ICNSA). Google Trends We use data from Google Trends on searches that include the word \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cjob\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d. Google Trends constructs an index of relative search intensity that allows for tracking the relative search volume over time."
