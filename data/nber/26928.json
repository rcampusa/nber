    "abstract": "\n\nWe document that, in rural Uganda, the entry of foreign aid reduces government provision of similar services because the organization that delivers aid often hires the government worker, thereby reducing state capacity. Access to any public services and population well-being worsen in villages where such \u201cpoaching\u201d occurs. In villages with no ex ante government presence, foreign aid has no effect on state capacity, increases access to any services and improves population well-being.\n\n",
