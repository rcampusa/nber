    "abstract": "\n\nHigh-frequency changes in interest rates around FOMC announcements are a standard method of measuring monetary policy shocks. However, some recent studies have documented puzzling e\ufb00ects of these shocks on private-sector forecasts of GDP, unemployment, or in\ufb02ation that are opposite in sign to what standard macroeconomic models would predict. This evidence has been viewed as supportive of a \u201cFed information effect\u201d channel of monetary policy, whereby an FOMC tightening (easing) communicates that the economy is stronger (weaker) than the public had expected. We show that these empirical results are also consistent with a \u201cFed response to news\u201d channel, in which incoming, publicly available economic news causes both the Fed to change monetary policy and the private sector to revise its forecasts. We provide substantial new evidence that distinguishes between these two channels and strongly favors the latter; for example, (i) regressions that include the previously omitted public macroeconomic news, (ii) high-frequency stock market responses to Fed announcements, and (iii) a new survey that we conduct of individual Blue Chip forecasters all indicate that the Fed and private sector are simply responding to the same public news, and that there is little if any role for a \u201cFed information e\ufb00ect\u201d.\n\n",
