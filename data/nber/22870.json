    "abstract": "\n\nWe examine the importance of ambiguity, or Knightian uncertainty, in the capital structure decision. We develop a static tradeoff theory model in which agents are both risk averse and ambiguity averse. The model confirms the usual idea that increased risk\u2014the uncertainty over known possible outcomes\u2014leads firms to use less leverage. Conversely, greater ambiguity\u2014the uncertainty over the probabilities associated with the outcomes\u2014leads firms to increase leverage. Using a theoretically motivated measure of ambiguity, our empirical analysis provides results consistent with these predictions.\n\n",
