    "abstract": "\n\nWe propose a new measure of the cost of information structures in rational inattention problems, the \"neighborhood-based\" cost functions, given that many applications involve states with a topological structure. These cost functions summarize the results of a sequential information sampling problem, and also capture a notion of perceptual distance. This second property allows neighborhood-based cost functions, unlike mutual information, to make accurate predictions about behavior in perceptual experiments. We compare the implications of our neighborhood-based cost functions with those of a mutual-information cost function in a series of applications: security design, global games, modeling perceptual judgments, and linear-quadratic-Gaussian problems.\n\n",
