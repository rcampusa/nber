    "abstract": "\n\nThere is an active debate about how to regulate electronic cigarettes, due to uncertainty about their health effects and whether they are primarily a quit aid or a gateway drug for combustible cigarettes. We model optimal e-cigarette regulation and estimate key parameters. Using tax changes and scanner data, we estimate relatively elastic demand and limited substitution between e-cigarettes and combustible cigarettes. In sample surveys, historical smoking trends for high- and low-vaping demographics were unchanged after e-cigarettes were introduced; this demographic shift-share identification also suggests limited substitution. We field a new quantitative survey of public health experts, who report that vaping is more harmful than previously believed. In our model, the optimal e-cigarette tax is probably higher than the current norm, but Monte Carlo simulations highlight substantial uncertainty.\n\n",
