    "abstract": "\n\nWe develop a new model of quality to capture the idea that even if a customer chooses to purchase a product, it may fail to deliver.'   In this event, the customer may wish to choose some other product.  We model this as a two stage game where firms first choose quality and then price. We find that in equilibrium, the high quality firm (the one with a higher probability of being able to  deliver') will always make higher profits than the low quality one even if costs of quality are sharply increasing.  Our work thus provides a reason for high quality niches to be inherently more profitable.  The implications for welfare and equilibrium under free entry are also studied.\n\n",
