    "abstract": "\n\nWe are the first to examine the effect of Superfund cleanups on infant health rather than focusing on proximity to a site.  We study singleton births to mothers residing within 5km of a Superfund site between 1989-2003 in five large states.   Our \"difference in differences\" approach compares birth outcomes before and after a site clean-up for mothers who live within 2,000 meters of the site and those who live between 2,000- 5,000 meters of a site.  We find that proximity to a Superfund site before cleanup is associated with a 20 to 25% increase in the risk of congenital anomalies.\n\n",
