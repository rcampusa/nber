    "abstract": "\n\nKeynes' General Th&ry was a brilliant attanpt to plain the paradox\nof 1CM interest rates, ineffectual easy rn,netaxy policy, and lowinvestrtnt\nduring the Great Depression. We argue that Keynes' failure to distinguish\nbetween low naninal and high real interest rates led hint to misinterpret a\ntight and ail too effective nonetary policy and unnecessarily hypothesize\na downward shift in investhent dnand. Keynesian ideas in tux profoundly\ninfluenced econanic policy in the 1960s and 1970s. The resulting postwar\ninflation -- rather than scholarship on what actually happened in the\n1930s -- appears to be the primary reason for the waning influence of the\nideas derived frcin the General Theory.\n\n",
