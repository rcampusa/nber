    "abstract": "\n\nA strong tradition in economic history, which primarily relies on qualitative evidence and statistical correlations, has emphasized the importance of patents as a primary driver of innovation.  Recent improvements in empirical methodology \u2013 through the creation of new data sets and advances in identification \u2013 have produced research that challenges this traditional view.  The findings of this literature provide a more nuanced view of the effects of intellectual property, and suggest that when patent rights have been too broad or strong, they have actually discouraged innovation. This paper summarizes the major results from this research and presents open questions.\n\n",
