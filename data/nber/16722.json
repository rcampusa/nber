    "abstract": "\n\nA growing body of work suggests that education offers a wide-range of benefits that extend beyond increases in labor market productivity.  Improvements in education can lower crime, improve health, and increase voting and democratic participation. This chapter reviews recent developments on these 'non-production' benefits of education with an emphasis on contributions made by economists.\n\n",
