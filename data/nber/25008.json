    "abstract": "\n\nI formally relate the consequences of climate change to the time series variation in weather extensively explored by recent empirical literature. I show that reduced-form fixed effects estimators can recover the effects of climate if agents are myopic, if agents' payoff functions belong to a particular class, or if the actions agents take in each period do not depend on actions taken in previous periods. I also show how to recover structural estimates of climate change impacts from reduced-form weather regressions in more general environments. Applying this new method, I find that an additional 2\u00b0C of global warming would reduce eastern U.S. agricultural profits by around 60% under the median estimates.\n\n",
