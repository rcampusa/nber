    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper investigates whether the diversity of activities conducted by financial institutions\ninfluences their market valuations. We find that there is a diversification discount: The market\nvalues financial conglomerates that engage in multiple activities, e.g., lending and non-lending\nfinancial services, lower than if those financial conglomerates were broken into financial\nintermediaries that specialize in the individual activities. While difficult to identify a single causal\nfactor, the results are consistent with theories that stress intensified agency problems in\nfinancial conglomerates that engage in multiple activities and indicate that economies of scope are\nnot sufficiently large to produce a diversification premium.\n\n",
