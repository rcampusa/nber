    "abstract": "\n\nThe recent Supreme Court decision NCAA vs Alston (June 2021) has heightened interest in the benefits and costs of participation in sports for student athletes. Anecdotes about the exploitation of student athletes were cited in the opinion. This paper uses panel data for two different cohorts that follow students from high school through college and into their post-school pursuits to examine the generality of these anecdotes. On average, student athletes\u2019 benefit- often substantially so\u2014in terms of graduation, post-collegiate employment, and earnings. Benefits in terms of social mobility for disadvantaged and minority students are substantial, contrary to the anecdotes in play in the media and in the courts.\n\n",
    "acknowledgement": "\nWe acknowledge, with thanks, the guidance and encouragement of Greg Curtner, who, as a lawyer for the NCAA, introduced us to this subject and framed the importance of the question of whether or not student athletes, especially at the well-known schools, are exploited or whether they benefit. We further thank Ron Laschever, Josh Sherman, Aniello Bianco, Daniel Stone, and Fredrick Flyer. The authors have worked on behalf of the NCAA in various litigation matters. This paper draws heavily on an expert report presented in one of those litigation matters (Heckman 2017) and published in summary form in Heckman, Loughlin, and Curtner (2021). The NCAA has not provided financial support for this paper. Opinions and errors are those solely of the authors. The views expressed herein are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Bureau of Economic Research.\n\n\n"
