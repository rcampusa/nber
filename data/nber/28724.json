    "abstract": "\n\nA new form of secured lending utilizing \u201cdigital collateral\u201d has recently emerged, most prominently in low and middle income countries. Digital collateral relies on \u201clockout\u201d technology, which allows the lender to temporarily disable the \ufb02ow value of the collateral to the borrower without physically repossessing it. We explore this new form of credit both in a model and in a \ufb01eld experiment using school-fee loans digitally secured with a solar home system. We \ufb01nd that securing a loan with digital collateral drastically reduces default rates (by 19 pp) and increases the lender\u2019s rate of return (by 38 pp). Employing a variant of the Karlan and Zinman (2009) methodology, we decompose the total e\ufb00ect and \ufb01nd that roughly one-third is attributable to (ex-ante) adverse selection and two-thirds is attributable to (interim or ex-post) moral hazard. Access to a school-fee loan signi\ufb01cantly increases school enrollment and school-related expenditures without detrimental e\ufb00ects to households\u2019 balance sheet.\n\n",
