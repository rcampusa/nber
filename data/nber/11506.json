    "abstract": "\n\nWe develop a model in which firms set impersonal salary levels before matching with workers.\nSalaries fall relative to any competitive equilibrium while profits rise by almost as much, implying\nlittle inefficiency. Furthermore, the best firms gain the most from the system while wages become\ncompressed. We discuss the performance of alternative institutions and the recent antitrust case\nagainst the National Residency Matching Program in light of our results.\n\n",
