    "abstract": "\n\nMedicare pricing is known to indirectly influence provider prices and care provision for non-Medicare patients; however, Medicare\u2019s regulatory externalities beyond fee-setting are less well understood. We study how physicians\u2019 outpatient surgery choices for non-Medicare patients responded to Medicare removing a ban on ambulatory surgery center (ASC) use for a specific procedure. Following the rule change, surgeons began reallocating both Medicare and commercially insured patients to ASCs. Specifically, physicians became 70% more likely to use ASCs for the policy-targeted procedure among their non-Medicare patients. These novel findings demonstrate that Medicare rulemaking affects physician behavior beyond the program\u2019s statutory scope.\n\n",
