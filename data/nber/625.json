    "abstract": "\n\nThe present paper is intended to accomplish two tasks. First, models predicting overshooting and magnification, respectively, will be checked for their consistency with two key empirical regularities: A. The observed pattern of price level vs. exchange-rate volatility. B. The observed pattern of spot exchange-rate vs. forward exchange-rate volatility. Second, a widely neglected reason for exchange-rate volatility, activist monetary policy, will be studied.\n\n",
