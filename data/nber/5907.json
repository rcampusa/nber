In the first part of the paper we study the optimal debt contract -- specifically, the trade-off between the size of the loan and the repayment -- under the assumption that some debt contract is optimal.  In the second part we consider a more general class of (non-debt) contracts, and derive sufficient conditions for debt to be optimal among these.\n\n",
