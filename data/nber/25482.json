    "abstract": "\n\nWe study how different forms of communication influence the inflation expectations of individuals in a randomized controlled trial. We first solicit individuals\u2019 inflation expectations in the Nielsen Homescan panel and then provide eight different forms of information regarding inflation. Reading the actual Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) statement has about the same average effect on expectations as simply being told about the Federal Reserve\u2019s inflation target. Reading a news article about the most recent FOMC meetings results in a forecast revision which is smaller by half. Our results have implications for how central banks should communicate to the broader public.\n\n",
