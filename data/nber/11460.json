    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper examines an ex-post rationale for the patenting of scientific discoveries. In this model,\nscientist do not know which firms can make use of their discoveries, and firms do not know which\nscientific discoveries might be useful to them. To bridge this gap, either or both sides need to engage\nin costly search activities. Patents determine the appropriability of scientific discoveries, which\naffects the scientists. and firms. willingness to engage in search. Patents decrease dissemination\nwhen the search intensity of firms is sufficiently elastic, relative to that of scientists. The model also\nexamines the role of universities. Patents facilitate the delegation of search activities to the\nuniversities%u2019 technology transfer offices, which enables efficient specialization. Rather than\ndistracting scientists from doing research, patenting may be a complement to doing research.\n\n",
