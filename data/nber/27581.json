    "abstract": "\n\nWe test whether age discrimination rises during recessions using two complemen-tary analyses. EEOC microdata reveal that age-related \ufb01ring and hiring charges rise by 3.4% and 1.4%, respectively, for each percentage point increase in a state-industry\u2019s monthly unemployment. Though the opportunity cost of \ufb01ling falls, the fraction of meritorious claims increases\u2014a su\ufb03cient condition for rising discrimination under mild assumptions. Second, we repurpose data from a hiring correspondence study conducted across di\ufb00erent cities and time periods during the recovery from the Great Recession. Each percentage point increase in local unemployment reduces the callback rate for older versus younger women by 15%.\n\n",
