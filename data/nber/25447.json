    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper shows that greater global spatial correlation of productivities can increase cross-country welfare dispersion by increasing the correlation between a country\u2019s productivity and its gains from trade. We validate this prediction using a global climatic phenomenon as a natural experiment. We \ufb01nd that gains from trade in cereals over the last half-century were larger for more productive countries and smaller for less productive countries when cereal productivity was more spatially correlated. Incorporating this role for spatial interdependence into a projection of climate-change impacts raises projected international inequality, with higher welfare losses across most of Africa.\n\n",
