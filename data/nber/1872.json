    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper analyzes the determination of the optimal tariff under the assumption of Consistent Conjectural Variations (CCV). A general characterization of the CCV equilibrium is given. We show that (i) there are, in general, a multiplicity of such equilibria, and (ii) under certain restrictions, the Cournot equilibrium, which is based on the assumption of no retaliation can also be a CCV equilibrium. By contrast, free trade is never a CCV equilibrium. Finally the CCV equilibrium is solved explicitly in a simple example.\n\n",
