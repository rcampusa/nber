    "abstract": "\n\nTo explore whether schools\u2019 causal impacts on test-scores measure their overall impact on students, we exploit quasi-random school assignments and data from Trinidad and Tobago to estimate the causal impacts of individual schools on several outcomes. Schools\u2019 impacts on high-stakes tests are moderately related to impacts on crime but weakly related to impacts on important outcomes such as dropout, teen motherhood, and formal labor-market participa-tion. To examine if parents value these causal impacts, we link them to parents\u2019 ranked lists of schools and employ discrete-choice models to infer preferences for school attributes. Many parents choose schools that improve high-stakes tests, that reduce criminality, and increase labor-market participation. Notably, many parents\u2019 choices indicate stronger preferences for impacts on non-academic outcomes than test-score impacts. These results reveal that evalua-tions based solely on test scores may be very misleading about the benefits of school choice, and education interventions more broadly.\n\n",
