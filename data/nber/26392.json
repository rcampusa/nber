    "abstract": "\n\nWe study how access to high-skill labor affects the outcomes of start-up firms.  We obtain exogenous variation in firms\u2019 ability to access skilled labor by using win rates in H-1B visa lotteries.  Relative to other firms that also applied for H-1B visas, firms with higher lottery win rates are more likely to receive additional venture capital funding and to have a successful exit via an IPO or acquisition.  H-1B visa lottery winners also subsequently receive more patents and patent citations.  Overall, our results show that access to high-skill labor is a critical determinant of success for start-up firms.\n\n",
