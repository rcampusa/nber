    "abstract": "\n\nWe quantify the role of global production linkages in explaining spillovers of  U.S. monetary policy shocks to stock returns across countries and sectors using a newly constructed dataset. Our estimation strategy is based on a standard open-economy production network model that delivers a spillover pattern consistent with a spatial autoregression (SAR) process. We  use the SAR model to decompose the overall impact of U.S. monetary policy on global stock returns into a direct and a  network effect. We find that nearly 70% of the total impact of  U.S. monetary policy shocks on  country-sector stock returns are due to the network effect of global production linkages. Our results are robust to changes in the definitions of stock returns and monetary policy shocks, to controlling for correlates of the global financial cycle, foreign monetary policy shocks, and to  alternative empirical specifications.\n\n",
