    "abstract": "\n\nFathers' multiple-partner fertility (MPF) is associated with substantially worse educational outcomes for children.  We focus on children in fathers\u2019 \u201csecond families\u201d when the second families are nuclear families \u2013 households consisting of a man, a woman, their joint children, and no other children.  We analyze outcomes for almost 75,000 Norwegian children all of whom, until they were at least age 18, lived in nuclear families. Children with MPF fathers are more likely than other children from nuclear families to drop out of secondary school (24% vs 17%) and less likely to obtain bachelor\u2019s degree (44% vs 51%). These gaps remain substantial after controlling for child and parental characteristics such as income and wealth, education and age: 4 percentage points (ppt) for dropping out of secondary school and 5 ppt for obtaining a bachelor\u2019s degree. Resource competition with the children in the father\u2019s first family does not explain the differences in educational outcomes. We find that the effect of having a father who had a previous childless marriage is similar to the effect of fathers\u2019 MPF and argue that this suggests that selection plays an important role in explaining the association between fathers' MPF and children's educational outcomes.\n\n",
