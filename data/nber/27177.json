    "abstract": "\n\nWe provide the first estimated economic impacts of students\u2019 access to an entire sector of public higher education in the U.S. Approximately half of Georgia high school graduates who enroll in college do so in the state\u2019s public four-year sector, which requires minimum SAT scores for admission. Regression discontinuity estimates show enrollment in public four-year institutions boosts students\u2019 household income around age 30 by 20 percent, and has even larger impacts for those from low income high schools. Access to this sector has little clear impact on student loan balances or other measures of financial health. For the marginal student, enrollment in such institutions has large private returns even in the short run and positive returns to state budgets in the long run.\n\n",
