    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper applies ideas from mechanism design to model procurement of prescription drugs.  We present a mechanism for government-funded market-driven drug procurement that achieves very close to full static efficiency -- all members have access to all but at most a single drug -- without distorting incentives for innovation.\n\n",
