    "abstract": "\n\nHow important are bureaucrats for the productivity of the state? And to what extent do the tradeoffs between different policies depend on the implementing bureaucrats\u2019 effectiveness? Using data on 16million public procurement purchases in Russia during 2011\u20132016, we show that over 40 percent of the variation in quality-adjusted prices paid\u2014our measure of performance\u2014is due to the individual bureaucrats and organizations that manage procurement processes. Such differences in effectiveness matter for policy design. To illustrate, we show that a common procurement policy\u2014 bid preferences for domestic suppliers\u2014dramatically improves performance, but only when implemented by ineffective bureaucrats.\n\n",
