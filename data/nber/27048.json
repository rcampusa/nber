    "abstract": "\n\nUsing a unique con\ufb01dential data set with industry-level disaggregation of U.S. cross-border securities claims and liabilities, we \ufb01nd that the growing U.S. securities are also increasingly intermediated by tax haven \ufb01nancial centers (THFC) and by less regulated funds. These securities are risky and respond to tax rates and regulation, suggesting tax avoidance and regulatory arbitrage. Issuers are mostly intangible-intensive multinationals, and investors require a high Sharpe ratio, suggesting search for yield. In contrast, safe Treasuries are mainly held by the foreign o\ufb03cial sector and increased with quantitative easing policies. Facts on private securities are rationalized through a model where multinationals with heterogeneous default probabilities endogenously choose to shift pro\ufb01ts and are funded by global intermediaries with endogenous monitoring intensity. A fall in the costs of global funds, by increasing \ufb01rms\u2019 pro\ufb01ts, shifts the distribution of entrants toward riskier ones and also reduces intermediaries\u2019 incentives to monitor both the extensive (fraction of monitored \ufb01rms) and intensive margin, hence raising ex post risk. Firms appear elusively safe.\n\n",
