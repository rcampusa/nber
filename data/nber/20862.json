The options that are currently being discussed are not likely to be more successful.\nIf there is a politically feasible way out of the crisis, it will be through revenue neutral fiscal incentives adopted by the individual Eurozone countries.  I describe some of these fiscal options after reviewing the history of failed attempts and the options that are currently on the table.\n\n",
