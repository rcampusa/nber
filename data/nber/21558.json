    "abstract": "\n\nWe construct representative firm-level longitudinal data for twenty-seven European countries using financial statements from the Orbis global database, providing a \u201chow-to\u201d guide on the construction. We validate our dataset by comparing its aggregate coverage to official statistics and present three new facts. First, smaller firms (SMEs) account for the largest share of economic activity. Second, industry concentration has increased among firms that report only consolidated statements, but decreased overall. Third, the increased concentration is accounted for by foreign-owned firms. Documenting these facts requires nationally representative data both in cross-sectional and time-series dimensions.\n\n",
