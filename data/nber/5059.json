    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper estimates and evaluates the contributions of R&D tax incentives and publicly financed R&D investment policies in promoting growth of output and privately funded R&D investment in US manufacturing industries.  Publicly financed R&D induces cost savings but crowds out privately-financed R&D investment while the incremental R&D tax credit and the immediate deductibility provision of R&D expenditures have a significant impact on privately financed R&D investment.  The optimal mix of both instruments is an important element for sustaining a balanced growth in output and productivity in the manufacturing sector.\n\n",
