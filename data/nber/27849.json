    "abstract": "\n\nCentral banks sometimes evaluate their own policies. To assess the inherent con\ufb02ict of interest, we compare the research \ufb01ndings of central bank researchers and academic economists regarding the macroeconomic e\ufb00ects of quantitative easing (QE). We \ufb01nd that central bank papers report larger e\ufb00ects of QE on output and in\ufb02ation. Central bankers are also more likely to report signi\ufb01cant e\ufb00ects of QE on output and to use more positive language in the abstract. Central bankers who report larger QE e\ufb00ects on output experience more favorable career outcomes. A survey of central banks re-veals substantial involvement of bank management in research production.\n\n",
