    "abstract": "\n\nI study knowledge spillovers, positive externalities that augment the information set of an economic agent, and reviews the evidence on such spillovers in the context of international economic transactions. Even though spillovers are by their very nature difficult to identify, over recent decades a number of advances-conceptual, empirical, as well as in form of new data\u2013have produced robust evidence that both trade and foreign direct investment lead to sizable knowledge spillovers.\n\n",
