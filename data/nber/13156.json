    "abstract": "\n\nUsing a unique longitudinal representative survey of both manufacturing and non-manufacturing businesses in the United States during the 1990's, I examine the incidence and intensity of organizational innovation and the factors associated with investments in organizational innovation.  Past profits tend to be positively associated with organizational innovation.  Employers with a more external focus and broader networks to learn about best practices (as proxied by exports, benchmarking, and being part of a multi-establishment firm) are more likely to invest in organizational innovation. Investments in human capital, information technology, R&D, and physical capital appear to be complementary with investments in organizational innovation.  In addition, non-unionized manufacturing plants are more likely to have invested more broadly and intensely in organizational innovation.\n\n",
