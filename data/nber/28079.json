    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper shows that foreign exchange intervention can be used to avoid a sudden stop in capital \ufb02ows in a small open emerging market economy. The model is based around the concept of an under-borrowing equilibrium de\ufb01ned by Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2020). With a low elasticity of substitution between traded and non-traded goods, real exchange rate depreciation may generate a precipitous drop in aggregate demand and a tightening of borrowing constraints, leading to an equilibrium with an ine\ufb03ciently low level of borrowing. The central bank can preempt this deleveraging cycle through foreign exchange intervention. Intervention is e\ufb00ective due to frictions in private international \ufb01nancial intermediation. Reserve accumulation has ex ante bene\ufb01ts by reducing the risk of a sudden stop, while intervention has ex-post bene\ufb01ts by limiting ine\ufb03cient deleveraging. But intervention itself faces constraints. When the central bank\u2019s stock of reserves is low, even foreign exchange intervention cannot prevent a sudden stop.\n\n",
