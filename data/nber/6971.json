    "abstract": "\n\nThe durability of health care treatment, the substantial technical change in health care treatment, and the prevalence of third-party payment interact to create substantial difficulty in measuring the price and output of health care.  This paper provides a framework for analyzing the demand for health care taking into account these difficulties.  It then suggests how this framework might be used to improve measurement of health care prices and output.\n\n",
