    "abstract": "\n\nEntrep\u00f4ts are hubs that facilitate trade between multiple origins and destinations. We study these entrep\u00f4ts, the network they form, and their impact on international trade. We document that the trade network is a hub-and-spoke system, where 80% of trade is shipped indirectly\u2014nearly all via entrep\u00f4ts. We estimate indirect-shipping consistent trade costs using a model where shipments can be sent indirectly through an endogenous transport network and develop a geography-based instrument to estimate economies of scale in shipping. Counterfactual infrastructure improvements at entrep\u00f4ts have on average ten times the global welfare impact of improvements at non-entrep\u00f4ts.\n\n",
