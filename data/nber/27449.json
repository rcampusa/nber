    "abstract": "\n\nThis article discusses cultural barriers to women's participation and success in the labor market in developing countries. I begin by describing how gender norms  influence the relationship between economic development and female employment, as well as how gender norms vary substantially across societies at the same level of economic development. I then examine several specific gender-related social norms and how they constrain women's employment. I present examples of policies aimed at dismantling these cultural barriers to female employment and the impacts they have.\n\n",
