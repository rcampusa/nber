    "abstract": "\n\nIdentification problems arise in New Keynesian and macro-finance models when the Taylor rule includes both responses to observable variables like inflation and output, and a shock unseen by economists. Identification of the rule's parameters requires additional restrictions on this unobserved shock. We demonstrate how this can be accomplished in a macro term structure model using only long-run neutrality restrictions consistent with a wide variety of theories. The resulting Taylor rule is comparable to those commonly found in the literature. The unobserved shock is closely related to the slope factor of empirical term structure models.\n\n",
    "acknowledgement": "\nPreviously circulated as \"Identifying Taylor Rules in Macro-Finance Models.\" The project started with our reading of John Cochrane's paper on the same subject and subsequent emails and conversations with him and Mark Gertler. We thank them both. Earlier versions of this work by the first three authors circulated with the title \u201cIdentifying Taylor rules in macro-finance models\u201d. We are grateful to the two anonymous referees and the Editor, Andrew Karolyi, for their thoughtful comments, which have helped us improve the manuscript. We also thank Rich Clarida, Patrick Feve, Kei Kawai, Guillaume Roussellet, Ken Singleton, Gregor Smith, Roman \u0160ustek, Tommy Sveen, and Tao Zha for comments on earlier drafts, and participants in seminars at ADEMU/CERGE-EI, BI Norwegian Business School, New York University, Stony Brook University, the Swedish House of Finance, Queen Mary University of London, and the Toulouse School of Economics.
