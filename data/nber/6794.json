    "abstract": "\n\nChina has legislated a mixed social security pension system with a defined benefit pay-as-you-go portion and an investment-based defined contribution portion.  This paper analyses the economics of these two types of systems in the Chinese context and calculates the advantage to China of using an investment-based portion.  Several options for reform of the recently legislated system are considered.\n\n",
