    "abstract": "\n\nWithout the Great Depression, the United States would not have adopted deposit insurance.  While the New Deal's anti-competitive barriers have largely collapsed become\" deeply rooted.  This paper examines how market and political competition for deposits raised the level of coverage and spread insurance to all depository institutions.  A comparison of the cost of federal insurance with a counterfactual of an insurance-free system shows that federal insurance ultimately imposed a\" higher cost but achieved political acceptance because of the distribution of the burden.\n\n",
