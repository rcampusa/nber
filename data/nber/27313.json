    "abstract": "\n\nCentral banks (the Fed) and markets (the market) often disagree about the path of interest rates. We develop a model where these different views stem from disagreements between the Fed and the market about future aggregate demand. We then study the implications of these disagreements for monetary policy, the term structure of interest rates, and economic activity. In our model, agents learn from the data but not from each other\u2014they are opinionated. In this context, the market perceives monetary policy \u201cmistakes\u201d and the Fed partially accommodates the market\u2019s view to mitigate the impact of perceived \u201cmistakes\u201d on output and inflation. The Fed plans to implement its own view gradually, as it expects the market to receive more information and move closer to the Fed\u2019s belief. Disagreements about future demand, together with learning, translate into disagreements about future interest rates. Disagreements also provide a microfoundation for monetary policy shocks: after a surprise policy announcement, the market (partially) learns the Fed\u2019s belief and the extent of future \u201cmistaken\u201d interest rate changes. We categorize these shocks into three groups: Fed belief shocks, market reaction shocks, and tantrum shocks, and analyze their impact on forward interest rates and economic activity. Tantrum shocks are the most damaging, as they arise when the Fed fails to forecast the forward rates\u2019 reaction. These shocks motivate additional gradualism as well as communication policies that reveal the Fed\u2019s belief, not to persuade the market (which is opinionated) but to prevent a misinterpretation of the Fed\u2019s belief. Finally, we also find that disagreements affect inflation and create a policy trade-o\u00a4 between stabilizing output and inflation.\n\n",
