    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper uses IRS tax data to evaluate the short- and long-term effects of California\u2019s 2004 Paid Family Leave Act (PFLA) on women\u2019s careers. Our research design exploits the increased availability of paid leave for women giving birth in the third quarter of 2004 (just after PFLA was implemented). These mothers were 18 percentage points more likely to use paid leave but otherwise identical to multiple comparison groups in pre-birth demographic, marital, and work characteristics. We find little evidence that PFLA increased women\u2019s employment, wage earnings, or attachment to employers. For new mothers, taking up PFLA reduced employment by 7 percent and lowered annual wages by 8 percent six to ten years after giving birth. Overall, PFLA tended to reduce the number of children born and, by decreasing mothers\u2019 time at work, increase time spent with children.\n\n",
