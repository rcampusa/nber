    "abstract": "\n\nThe 1996 US welfare reform introduced limits on years of welfare receipt. We show that this reduced program participation, raised employment for single mothers, and reduced divorce. A limited commitment, lifecycle model of labor supply, marriage and divorce, estimated on pre-reform data, replicates these e\ufb00ects. A large part of the responses occur in anticipation of bene\ufb01t exhaustion, impacting primarily women with low potential earnings. The reform reduces lifetime utility of women, even allowing for the government savings, but has negligible e\ufb00ects on men. The expectation of marriage attenuates the losses for women and an increased probability of single-motherhood raises them.\n\n",
