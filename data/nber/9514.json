    "abstract": "\n\nIn this paper we analyze whether  common currency' countries that is, dollarized and independent currency union countries have outperformed countries that have a currency of their own. The paper is empirical and estimates jointly the probability of being a common currency country and  outcome' equations for growth, volatility and inflation. We find that both type of common currency countries have lower inflation than countries with a domestic currency. Dollarized countries have lower growth and higher volatility than countries with a domestic currency. Currency unions, on the other hand, have higher growth and higher volatility than countries with a currency of their own.\n\n",
