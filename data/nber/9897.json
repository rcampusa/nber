    "abstract": "\n\nHealth, wealth and where one lives are important, if not the three most important material living conditions. There are many mechanisms that suggest that living arrangements and well-being derived from health and economic status are closely related. This paper investigates the joint evolution of the three conditions, using a microeconometric approach similar to what is known as vector autoregressions' (VAR) in the macroeconomics literature.\n\n",
