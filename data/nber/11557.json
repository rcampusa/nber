    "abstract": "\n\nHealth accounts document changes over time in the level and composition of health spending.  There has been a continued evolution in the ability to track such outlays.  Less rapid has been the ability to interpret changes in spending.  In this paper we apply quality adjusted price indexes for several major mental disorders to national mental health account estimates to assess changes in real \"output\".  We show that using the new price indexes reveals large gains in real output relative to application of BLS indexes.\n\n",
