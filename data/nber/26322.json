    "abstract": "\n\nUsing the government-sponsored enterprises\u2019 sharp securitization rules, this paper provides evidence that, in the aftermath of natural disasters, lenders are more likely to approve mortgages that can be securitized; thereby transferring climate risk when learning the \u2019new news\u2019 of default. The identi\ufb01cation strategy uses the GSEs\u2019 time-varying conforming loan limits at which mortgages bunch. Natural disasters increase bunching, suggesting an increased option value of securitization. The increase is lower where \ufb02ood insurance is required. A model identi\ufb01ed using indirect inference simulates increasing disaster risk without GSEs. Mortgage credit supply would decline in \ufb02ood zones. Endogenous guarantee fees are estimated.\n\n",
