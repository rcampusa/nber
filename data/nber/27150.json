    "abstract": "\n\nAlthough late-stage venture capital (VC) activity did not change dramatically in the first two months after the COVID-19 pandemic reached the U.S., early-stage VC activity declined by 38%.  The particular sensitivity of early-stage VC investment to  market  conditions\u2014which  we  show  to  be  common  across  recessions  spanning four decades from 1976 to 2017\u2014raises questions about the pro-cyclicality of VC and its implications for innovation, especially in light of the common narrative that VC is relatively insulated from public markets.  We find that the implications for innovation are not benign:  innovation conducted by VC-backed firms in recessions is less highly cited, less original, less general, and less closely related to fundamental science.   These  effects  are  more  pronounced  for  startups  financed  by  early-stage venture funds.  Given the important role that VC plays in financing breakthrough innovations in the economy, our findings have implications for the broader discussion on the nature of innovation across business cycles\n\n",
