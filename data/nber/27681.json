    "abstract": "\n\nWe explore heterogeneity in soil quality, lack of knowledge and autonomy as explanations for the low adoption of improved agricultural practices using a randomized field experiment that combined localized soil analyses, tailored input recommendations, extension services and an in-kind grant. We find that while neither the degree of recommendation specificity (plot vs cluster level) nor the extent of autonomy (defined as the freedom of choice in spending the in-kind grant) had any effect on adoption during the intervention, farmers with autonomy had substantially higher adoption of improved practices two years after the intervention ended.\n\n",
