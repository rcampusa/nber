    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper argues that detailed studies of particular economies, such as Bob Gregory%u2019s work on Australia, are relevant to all of economics. The paper builds on the concept of a model species from biology to develop the notion of a model economy %u2013 one whose experiences illuminate fundamental economic issues; examines the criterion for an economy to serve as a model economy; and describes three areas %u2013 labour relations and the awards system of wage-setting, marketizing public services and growth through immigration and natural resources %u2013 where Australian experience provides insights into economic behaviour and the operation of markets broadly.\n\n",
