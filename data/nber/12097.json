    "abstract": "\n\nThis study examines data drawn from the game show Friend or Foe?, which is similar to the classic prisoner%u2019s dilemma tale:  partnerships are endogenously determined, players work together to earn money, after which, they play a one-shot prisoner%u2019s dilemma game over large stakes: varying from $200 to (potentially) more than $22,000.  If one were to conduct such an experiment in the laboratory, the cost to gather the data would be well over $350,000.  The data reveal several interesting insights; perhaps most provocatively, they suggest that even though the game is played in front of an audience of millions of viewers, there is some evidence consistent with a model of discrimination.  The observed patterns of social discrimination are unanticipated, however.  For example, there is evidence consistent with the notion that certain populations have a general %u201Cdistaste%u201D for older participants.\n\n",
