    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper develops a framework for analyzing unemployment in terms of\nvariations in the nt.imber and distribution of people becoming unemployed and in\nindividual probabilities of leaving unemployment. Contrary to the emphasis on\nexit probabilities in the recent macroeconomics literature, we present\nempirical evidence in support of the proposition that changes in the size and\ndistribution of the inflow Into unemployment are the primary determinant of\nthe unemployment rate. Instead of falling at the beginning of a recession,\nthe outflow rate rises (with a lag) in response to the increased inflows which\ndrive the recession. In contrast to normal unemployment, cyclical unemployment\nis concentrated in groups with low normal exit probabilities; so the\nobserved procyclical variation in the average exit probability may largely he\nexplained by predictable distributional effects.\n\n",
