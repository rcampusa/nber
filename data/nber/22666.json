    "abstract": "\n\nWe estimate the effect of physician-patient relationships on clinical decisions in a setting where the treating physician is as good as randomly assigned. OBs are 25% (4 percentage points) more likely to perform a C-section when delivering patients with whom they have a pre-existing clinical relationship (their \u201cown patients\u201d) than when delivering patients with whom they had no prior relationship. OBs\u2019 decisions are consistent with receiving greater disutility from their own patients\u2019 difficult labors. After a string of difficult labors, OBs are more likely to perform C-sections on their own patients, and this can explain the entire own patient effect.\n\n",
