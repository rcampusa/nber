    "abstract": "\n\nMany development policies, such as placement of infrastructure or local economic development schemes, are \u201cplace-based.\u201d Such policies are generally intended to stimulate private sector investment and economic growth in the treated place, and as such they are difficult to appraise and evaluate. This paper sets out a framework for analyzing the effects of such policies and assessing their social value. It then reviews the literature on place-based policies in the contexts of transport improvements, economic corridors, special economic zones, lagging regions, and urban policies.\n\n",
