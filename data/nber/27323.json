    "abstract": "\n\nIn the past three decades, governments in emerging markets have accumulated large amounts of international reserves, especially those with \ufb01xed exchange rates. We propose a theory of reserve accumulation that can account for these facts. Using a model of endogenous sovereign default with nominal rigidities, we show that the interaction between sovereign risk and aggregate demand ampli\ufb01cation generates a macroeconomic-stabilization hedging role for international reserves. Reserves increase debt sustainability to such an extent that \ufb01nancing reserves with debt accumulation may not necessarily lead to increases in spreads. We also study simple and implementable rules for reserve accumulation. Our \ufb01ndings suggest that a simple linear rule linked to spreads can achieve signi\ufb01cant welfare gains, while those rules currently used in policy studies of reserve adequacy can be counterproductive.\n\n",
