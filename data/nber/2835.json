    "abstract": "\n\nTechniques of regulated Brownian motion are used to analyze the behavior of the exchange rate when official policy reaction functions are subject to future stochastic changes. We examine exchange-rate dynamics in alternative cases where the authorities promise (i) to confine a floating rate within a predetermined range and (ii) to peg the currency once it reaches a predetermined future level. Similarities between these and several related examples of regime switching are stressed\n\n",
