    "abstract": "\n\nWe study the problem of learning about the effect of one market-level variable (e.g., price) on another (e.g., quantity) in the presence of shocks to unobservables (e.g., preferences). We show that economic intuitions about the plausible size of the shocks can be informative for the parameter of interest. We illustrate with applications to the grain market and the labor market.\n\n",
