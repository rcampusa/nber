    "abstract": "\n\nNo firm or sector of the global economy is untouched by innovation. In equilibrium, innovators will flock to (and innovation will occur where) the returns to innovative capital are the highest. In this paper, we document a strong empirical pattern in green patent production. Specifically, we find that oil, gas, and energy producing firms \u2013 firms with lower Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) scores, and who are often explicitly excluded from ESG funds\u2019 investment universe \u2013 are key innovators in the United States\u2019 green patent landscape.  These energy producers produce more, and significantly higher quality, green innovation.  Our findings raise important questions as to whether the current exclusions of many ESG-focused policies \u2013 along with the increasing incidence of explicit divestiture campaigns \u2013 are optimal, or whether reward-based incentives would lead to more efficient innovative outcomes.\n\n",
