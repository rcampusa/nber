    "abstract": "\n\nPatterns of political unification and fragmentation have crucial implications for comparative economic development. Diamond (1997) famously argued that \u201cfractured land\u201d was responsible for China's tendency toward political unification and Europe's protracted political fragmentation. We build a dynamic model with granular geographical information in terms of topographical features and the location of productive agricultural land to quantitatively gauge the effects of \u201cfractured land\u201d on state formation in Eurasia. We find that either topography or productive land alone is sufficient to account for China's recurring political unification and Europe's persistent political fragmentation. The existence of a core region of high land productivity in Northern China plays a central role in our simulations. We discuss how our results map into observed historical outcomes and assess how robust our findings are.\n\n",
