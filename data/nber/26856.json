    "abstract": "\n\nWe derive a measure of firm-level regulatory costs from the text of corporate earnings calls. We then use this measure to study the effect of regulation on companies\u2019 operating fundamentals and cost of capital. We find that higher regulatory cost results in slower sales growth, an effect which is mitigated for large firms. Furthermore, we find a one-standard deviation increase in our preferred measure of regulatory cost is associated with an increase in firms\u2019 cost of capital of close to 3% per year.  These findings suggest that regulatory risk is a major cost to firms, but the largest firms are able to manage that risk better.\n\n",
