    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper studies quantitative implications of model economies that exhibit multiple equilibria. The goal is to assess two interrelated issues.  First, do economies with multiple equilibria have falsifiable predictions?  Second, is identification possible in economies that exhibit multiple equilibria?  Put differently, are these economies observationally equivalent to economies with unique equilibria?  We raise these questions within a general framework and then study a series of examples to determine how the existing literature has addressed them.\n\n",
