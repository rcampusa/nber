    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper uses administrative tax data to examine the long-term effects of an experimental job-search assistance program operating in Nevada in 2009. The program required randomly-selected unemployed workers who had just started collecting unemployment insurance (UI) benefits to undergo an eligibility review and receive personalized job-counseling services. The program led to substantial short-term reductions in UI receipt, and to persistent, long-term increases in employment and earnings. The program also affected participants\u2019 family outcomes, including total income, tax filing, tax liability, and home ownership.  These findings show that job-search assistance programs may produce substantial long-term effects for participants and their families.\n\n",
