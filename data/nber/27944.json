    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper presents a model of consumption behavior that explains the presence of \u2018wealthy hand-to-mouth\u2019 consumers using a mechanism that differs from those analyzed previously.  We show that a two-asset model with temptation preferences generates a demand for commitment and thus illiquidity, leading to hand-to-mouth behavior even when liquid assets deliver higher returns than illiquid assets.  This model fits other features of the data, such as the fact that the Marginal Propensity to Consume declines only slowly with shock size.  Moreover, temptation and commitment have important policy implications:  we show that housing subsidies and mandatory mortgage amortization increase household savings.\n\n",
