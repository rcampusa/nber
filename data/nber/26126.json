    "abstract": "\n\nWe use the universe of birth records in the United States from 2013 to 2018 to examine the effect of e-cigarette tax rates on pre-pregnancy smoking and prenatal smoking.  We study these questions using two-way fixed effects models and pregnancy fixed effects models.  We show that e-cigarette taxes increase pre-pregnancy smoking, increase prenatal smoking, and lower smoking cessation during pregnancy.  These findings imply that e-cigarettes and traditional cigarettes are substitutes among pregnant women.  We also find evidence that e-cigarette taxes reduce pre-pregnancy and third trimester e-cigarette use.\n\n",
