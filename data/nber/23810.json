    "abstract": "\n\nWe examine multi-generational impacts of positive in utero and early life health interventions using state-year variation in public health insurance expansions that targeted low-income pregnant women and children. We use restricted use Vital Statistics Natality files to create a unique dataset linking individuals\u2019 childhood Medicaid exposure to the next generation\u2019s health outcomes at birth. We find robust evidence that the health benefits associated with treated generations\u2019 early life access to Medicaid extend to later offspring\u2019s birth outcomes. Our results imply that the return on investment is larger than suggested by evaluations of the program that focus only on treated cohorts.\n\n",
