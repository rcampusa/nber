    "abstract": "\n\nGlobalization of trade and finance has gone a long way over the last half-century.  But it is less impressive than most non-economists think, judged either by the standard of 100 years ago or by the hypothetical standard of perfect international integration.  The paper documents the extent of globalization, and some reasons for the barriers that remains.  It then briefly considers the implications for economic growth and the implications for goals not measured by GDP   equality and the environment.  The conclusion is that globalization is not the primary obstacle to efforts to address such concerns.\n\n",
