    "abstract": "\n\nWe document five novel facts about Uncovered Interest Parity (UIP) deviations vis-\u00e0-vis the U.S. dollar for 34 currencies of advanced economies and emerging markets, using survey data on expected exchange rate. First, the UIP premium co-moves with global risk perception (VIX) for all currencies, whereas only for emerging market currencies there is a negative comovement between the UIP premium and capital inflows. Second, the comovement of the UIP premium and the VIX is explained by changes in interest rate differentials in emerging markets, and by expected changes in exchange rates in advanced countries. Third, country risk measured by the degree of policy uncertainty can explain both the negative comovement of the UIP premium with capital inflows and the positive comovement of the UIP premium with the interest rate differentials in emerging markets. Fourth, there are no overshooting and predictability reversal puzzles\u2014for any currency\u2014when using exchange rate expectations to calculate the UIP premium. Fifth, the classical Fama puzzle disappears in advanced economies in expectations, but it remains for emerging markets. As a result, while global investors expect zero excess returns and earn positive returns in the short-run and negative returns in the long-run by investing in advanced country currencies, the same global investors always expect and earn positive excess returns from emerging market currencies. These results imply that in advanced countries the UIP premium is largely due to deviations from rational expectations and full information, whereas in emerging markets, the UIP premium is a risk premium. Global investors charge an \u201cexcess\u201d premium to compensate for policy uncertainty in emerging markets \u2014a premium that is over and above the expected and actual depreciation of these currencies.\n\n",
