    "abstract": "\n\nWe analyze a two-country economy with complete markets, featuring  two national currencies as well as a global (crypto)currency.  If the global currency is used in both countries, the national nominal interest rates must be equal  and the exchange rate between the national currencies is a risk- adjusted martingale. We call this result Crypto-Enforced Monetary Policy Synchronization (CEMPS).  Deviating from interest equality risks approaching the zero lower bound or the abandonment of the national currency. If the global currency is backed by interest-bearing assets, additional and tight restrictions on monetary policy arise.  Thus, the classic Impossible Trinity becomes even less reconcilable.\n\n",
