    "abstract": "\n\nIn this note, we consider a broad class of network models where a large number of heterogeneous agents simultaneously interact in many ways. We provide an iterative algorithm for calculating an equilibrium and offer sufficient and \u201cglobally necessary\u201d conditions under which the equilibrium is unique. The results arise from a multi-dimensional extension of the contraction mapping theorem which allows for the separate treatment of the different types of interactions. We illustrate that a wide variety of heterogeneous agent economies \u2013 characterized by spatial, production, or social networks \u2013 yield equilibrium representations amenable to our theorem's characterization.\n\n",
