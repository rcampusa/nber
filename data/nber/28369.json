    "abstract": "\n\nThe interplay between investors\u2019 demand and providers\u2019 incentives has shaped the evolution of exchange-traded funds (ETFs). While early ETFs o\ufb00ered diversi\ufb01cation at low cost, later ETFs track niche portfolios and charge high fees. Strikingly, over their \ufb01rst \ufb01ve years, specialized ETFs lose about 30% in risk-adjusted terms. This underperformance cannot be explained by high fees or hedging demand. Rather, it is driven by the overvaluation of the underlying stocks. Overall, providers appear to cater to investors\u2019 extrapolative beliefs by issuing specialized ETFs that track attention-grabbing themes.\n\n",
