    "abstract": "\n\nWe present new evidence on the impact of more generous unemployment insurance (UI) on workers\u2019 ability to find jobs better suited to their skills. Using Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics data, we find the UI extensions introduced in the U.S. improved the quality of worker-job matches. Using Current Population Survey data, we also find that longer UI benefit durations decrease the mismatch between workers\u2019 educational attainments and the educational requirements of jobs. We find bigger effects of UI on match quality for those more likely to be liquidity constrained\u2014women, non-whites and less-educated workers\u2014,suggesting UI extensions improve the functioning of the labor market.\n\n",
