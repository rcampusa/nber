    ABSTRACT

             This paper analyzes the demand for nursing home care for the
    aged. The cross—sectional analysis indicates a high price elasticity
    of demand (—2.2), and that the demand is greater the less capable are
    the aged of providing own care, the better the job opportunities of
    adult women, and     the   wealthier the SMSA. Utilization increased 67
    percent    from 1963 to 1973,   but 64 percentage points is attributable
    to changes in these demand shift variables. This casts doubt on the
    view that the growth in utilization was largely stimulated by changing
    public   policies   during the period.

 I.      Introduction

         During   the last quarter—century one of the most   rapidly growing
 sectors     of the economy has been   institutional nursing home   care for the
        1/
aged.    Although this sector grew rapidly after the adoption of Medicare
and Medicaid in 1965, there was also a strong trend in the earlier period

 (see   Table 1).                             -

         Since 90 percent of nursing home residents are age 65 and over, the

quantity or utilization variable in this study is the number of residents

in nursing homes per thousand persons aged 65 or over in the population."

The use rate varies considerably across the country. In 1971, for

example, it ranged from 18 in West Virginia to 92 in M.innesota.3/

         This   paper analyzes the demand for nursing home care in the
cross—section     and over time. The cross-sectional analysis, using

Standard Metropolitan statistical Areas (SMSAs) as the unit of

observation, reveals a high price elasticity of demand for nursing

home care and a strong substitution between care provided in an
                                                                      1/
institutional setting, a nursing home, and noninstitutional care.

changes over time in the demand shift variables are found to account

for 95 percent of the growth of nursing home utilization per thousand

aged persons during the decade 1963 to 1973.

         In recent years several states established regulatory agencies

to   limit the growth of the nursing home sector on the presumption that
this   growth has arisen     from increased public subsidies. The analysis
in   this paper, however, suggests that the nursing home sector may not

have had a substantially smaller growth rate in the absence of the

public   programs enacted in the last decade.
       A supply and demand model for nursing home care is developed in

section II, and estimated empirically in section III using 1967

utilization data for 201 SMSAs. The cross—sectional parameters are

then used (section IV) in a "growth accounting" analysis to explain

statistically     the   growth of nursing home care from 1963 to 1973. This

is followed by a summary and concluding      section.
II. The Model

       The analysis of nursing home utilization is based on equations for

the industry price for and the population's demand for nursing home

services. The equations are discussed in turn.


1/ SMSAs are defined, and the data sources are presented, in Appendix A.
                                    —4—


          (a) The Supply Price Equation
           Industry supply curves can be upward rising either because
 an expansion of output has the effect of increasing the measured prices
 of factor inputs or because unmeasured factor price increases are
 subsumed under the label of decreasing returns to scale. There does
 not appear to be any input that is specialized to the nursing home
 sector in an SMSA. Nurses, aides, cleaning workers    and cooks   are
 mobile between industries within their occupation, and   between SMSAs.
 Nor would there appear to be any long—term constraint of entrepreneurial

 ability   on nursing home expansion. Nonlabor inputs (food, sheets, beds,

electricity, etc.) are purchased in a market in which nursing homes

constitute a minor demand for output, and hence the expansion of the

nursing home sector would leave the price unchanged. And, nursing homes

are not geographic—specific within SMSAs (e.g., they need-not be by

the ocean, or at the highest elevation).
                                             Finally, although in principle
firm supply curves may be upward rising    because of "lumpy"   factor
inputs,    studies of nursing homes suggest that this is not   a charac-
                           1/
teristic of the industry.— Even if it were, it would be relevant

only for small areas that have very few (one?) nursing homes, and

this is not characteristic of SMSAs.

      Thus, there does not appear to be a reason in the long run

for the industry   supply curve within an SMSA to rise with increasing

1'  Several studies of nursing homes have found that average costs are
invariant with size. See H. S. Ruchlin and S. Levey, 'Nursing Home
Cost Analysis: A Case Study," Inquiry, September 1973, pp. 3—15;
and 1). E. Skinner and D. Yett, "Estimation of Cost Functions for Health
Services: The Nursing Home Case," mimeo 1970.
                                      —5—


demand for nursing home care, in the relevant range. This means that
the long-run supply curve is perfectly elastic.
     --    Appropriate data on the price of nursing home care are not available
by SMSA for the period under consideration. Data are available, however,
on the average usual monthly charge in the state in which the SMSA is
(primarily) located. Because this variable may be subject to substantial
error as a measure of nursing home prices within an SMSA, a modified
instrumental variables approach is adopted in which the supply price
for each SMSA is predicted on the basis of the area's relevant charac-
teristics. The observed price and the predicted         price are both applied

in   the empirical estimation of the demand equation.
       The height of the industry supply price depends on the prices
of the relevant factors of production and the technology employed. It
is assumed that the knowledge of how to provide nursing home care,
the production function, is the sante in all SMSAs. The 'speed with
which knowledge is transmitted makes this a reasonable assumption.
This      is facilitated by the nationwide associations of nursing home

administrators and of      the personnel they employ (nurses, occupational
therapists,      cooks).

           'The nursing home price variable is the average "usual monthly

charge" for nursing home services in the state. Three wage variables

are hypothesized      to enter the price equation ——   the median earnings
of   females who worked a    full year (50 to 52 weeks in 1969) in the

SMSA      as (a) Registered Nurses (WRN), (b) Nursing Aides, Orderlies
and Attendants (WAIDES), and (c) Cleaning Service Workers (WCLN).
                                     —6—

 These occupations account for a large proportion of nursing home staff

 The wage rates are entered as exogenous variables, that is, as Variables

 whose   values are determined outside of the supply and demand model for

 nursing home care. This procedure is valid so long as nursing homes

 in an SNSA employ a sufficiently small proportion of persons in these
 occupations so that an expansion of employment in the nursing home
 sector has no significant impact on their wages. 2/

       The wage data are available only for the 122 SMSAs with a population
 in excess of 250,000 in 1970. The smaller SMSAs were assigned the
                                                                           wage
 rate values of neighboring larger SMSAs on the assumption that labor
 and firm migration tie together wages in neighboring cities. However,
 a dichtolm)us explanatory variable SMSMSA is created which takes the
 value of unity for small SMSAs and the value of zero for the        122
 large SMSAs. This variable would be expected to have no effect on
 price if wages in small SMSAs are not systematically different from
 those in neighboring large SNSAs, the productivity of nurses, aides
 and cleaning service workers does not vary with the size of the SMSA
and there are no other cost differences between large and small
cities.       Because of a tendency toward lower wages (especially for

women)    and land values   in smaller SMSAs, production costs may   be
         1/
lower.         It is, therefore, hypothesized that SMSMSA has a negative

partial effect on costs.

 owned by physicians, in part because of the complementarity of physician

 services and       nursing   home services. This ownership pattern is more likely

 where physicians have light work loads in their primary activity. For

 example, a study of urban—rural differences in nursing homes in Georgia

 found   a much higher     physician ownership in the rural areas where
                            rate of

there is a smafler demand for the services of physicians qua physicians. 1/
Thus, a greater number of physicians per capita (PaYS) in an area            may
increase the supply of potential entrepreneurs for nursing homes and
lower    the price of this input. The variable PHYS         is hypothesized to
have   a negative effect n the cost (price) of nursing home services.

         The price equation, with hypothesized Signs in parentheses, is:


                =   - [w,     WCLN, WAIDE, PHYS, SMSMSA}.

         (b)   The Demand Equation

               The dependent variable in the demand equation is the number
of residents of nursing homes in the SMSA per thousand aged population
of the SMSA (RES*)             The ncre costly is nursing home care, other
variables held constant, the greater the incentive on the part of
those who pay the bill -- the aged, their relatives, county and state
welfare officials —— to encourage the use of alternative facilities.

2/  Since the' demand and supply equations are Q = 1 (P, X) and P =     (Z)
where Q and  P are quantity and price and X and Z are exogenous variables,
there is no simultaneous equations bias when an OLS regression of Q on
P and X is computed.

       For the aged, living in one's own residence, with adult children,

 with others, or in a hospital are alternatives (substitutes) for residing

 in a nursing   home.!!'   The more attractive is the noninstitutional environment,

 relative to institutional nursing home care, the smaller is the demand for
 nursing home seriices, However, the extent to which this substitution
 is made depends on the nature of the required nursing and personal care.
 Noninstitutional care is a better substitute for a nursing home residence,
the less important are the nursing services demanded by the aged person,
and the more able is the aged person to provide domiciliary services
for himself or herself.
     Hence, variables that reflect the demographic structure of the aged
population are important demand shift factors. The older the aged
population, the greater their demand for nursing services and the less
able they are to provide their own routine domiciliary (personal) care.
Three age structure variables are created, the percent ot those 65
and over who are 70 to 74 years of age (%70.-74), 75 to 84 years of
age (%75—84), and 85 or over (%85+). The partial effects and signi-

ficance of these variables are expected to be greater for older age
groups. Holding the age structure constant, the poorer the health of
the aged, the greater would be the demand for nursing home care. An
age—specific death rate for the aged (DEATH) is used as an index of
poorer health.                             -

          Aged   men and women may have different capabilities in providing
own care.        Most aged women devoted
                                   a greater proportion of their
adult life to operating a household. If this has training components
or creates habits which are acre difficult to generate when one is
older, ceteris paribus, aged women would           have   a smaller demand for
nursing home care. Then, other variables held constant, the greater
the proportion of the aged population that is female (%F65), •the smaller
the demand       for   nursing home care.
          Companionship and care outside of an institutional setting may

more likely to be provided by adult women than adult men relatives.

Then, the higher the value of time in the labor market of adult

women, the more costly is providing this care fo± the aged relatives,

and the less it will be provided."             The labor force participation

Thus, the greater the labor force participation rate of adult married

women (%MWLF) the greater would be the demand for nursing home care for

the   aged.

and mental health of the aged. See, for example, Ruth Bennett, "Social

        Support for this hypothesis is provided by data on variations in

health status of nursing home residents when they enter the home. The

adult relatives to provide companionship or care, are more likely

        Nursing   homes provide companionship for the aged, and may provide
a   higher quality of personal care and nursing care than the aged could
obtain on their own. It is therefore hypothesized that higher income

greater quantity and quality of nursing home care for the aged,

hypothesized to be greater in SMSAs with higher median family incomes (INC).

         The !ederl Government has been            directly   or indirectly involved

in the subsidization of nursing homes for the aged for nearly 40 years.

"Prior to the 1930's, only a few such homes existed. With the enactment

of the Social Security Act in 1935, which made Federal funds available

to the needy aged, the nuaber of proprietary boarding and nursing homes
for elderly persons began to flourish and public almshouses subsequently
declined."2" While the provisions of Federal social security legislation,
including the adoption of Medicare in 1965, lowered the cost of nursing

home care to the aged, the legislation was uzüform throughout the

         Medicaid,   also adopted in 1965, resulted in differential subsidization

of nltrsing homes     by region for the year under study, 1967.1' The program
is administered by the states with federal—state sharing of financing

and    became operational   in some of the states from January 1, 1966, while

others joined in later years. A dichotomous varithie MEDAID is created

which takes the value of unity          for   SMSAs in the 27 states for which

Medicaid became operational on or prior to January            1,   1967, and takes

the value of zero for SMSAs in the remaining 23 states and the District

of Columbia.

        The variable MEDAID      is   hypothesized to have a positive effect on

the demand for nursing home care since Medicaid lowers the cost of this

care   to   the aged. An alternative explanation for a positive effect

is that states in which there is a higher demand for nursing home

care would have a greater incentive to pass the Medicaid legislation

so as to have the Federal Government (i.e., the rest of the country)

contribute to the cost of providing this service. This latter hypo-

thesis implies that      state   enactment of Medicaid is endogenous to the

demand for health services in the state.

        A dichotomous variable taking the value of unity for small SMSAs

(SMSMSA) is also entered to test the effect of city size on the demand

for   nursing    home care when other variables are held constant. A

negative    coefficient would    imply   a smaller demand per aged person
in   smaller SMSAs. No prediction is offered as to its partial effect.

 III. The Estimated Cross—sectional Equations
         Tables 2 arid a present the estimated price and demand equations
respectively for nursing homes in which all of the variables, other than
dichotomous variables, are expressed in natural logarithms.
         (a) Price
                 In   the first price equation (Table 2, regression (1)), the

exogenous variables explain only 21 percent of the variations in the

log ot the price variable. Because of the nature of the price data,

the    average   usual monthly charge in the state the s145A is (primarily)

located,the dependent variable is subject to substantial error as
a measure of the price in the SMSA. If this error is not correlated
with the explanatory variables or with measurement error in the
explanatory variables, it would not bias the regression slope
coefficients,         but it would bias downward     the explanatory power
(R2) of the equation.
        The wage of nursing aides, who comprise about one—half of nursing
home employees, is found to          have a very strong positive effect on the
price   variables. The wage of registered nurses has a positive but

 insignificant effect. The lack of significance may arise from the
 relatively minor role registered nurses play in the nursing home
 sector.    It is surprising, however, that the   wages of cleaning
 service   workers have a significant negative effect on price. As

 hypothesized, prices are lower where the SMSA has    a population less
 than   250,000, and where there are more physicians per thousand

population. The latter effect can be interpreted as arising

from a lower price of managerial or entrepreneurial talent where

physicians are in greater relative supply.

         In regression (2) of Table 2, a crude, and questionable index

of quality of services is included in the equation, the number        of
employees per resident in    nursing homes (EMPL) in the SMSA. Itis

a crude measure of quality of services since it     reflects inputs, not
the   service output. It is a questionable measure since the denominator is

the number of residents, which may not be determined independently of

price.     A simultaneous equations bias does pot arise if the ratio of
employees to residents is not causally dependent on price, holding the
other variables constant.

        When the quality variable is included, the regression's explanatory

power jumps to 58 percent. The quality variable is     highly significant
and   the variable for the wages of nursing aides and physicians per

capita remain significant. The sign of the coefficient of the wage for

cleaning   workers becomes positive but is not significant. The small
SMSA dummy variable is no longer significant, presumably because of a
smaller number of employees per resident in smaller SMSAs.

             (b) Demand
     -             Table   3 presents three sets of demand equations, one for each
price variable. The three variables are the observed price (LPRICE), and
the prices predicted on the basis of Table 2 regressions (1) and (2),
LPRIcE1 and LPRIcE2, respectively. The "best" set uses the predicted
variable LPRXCE1. This variable is not subject to the substantial
measurement error of the observed price, or a potential simultaneous
equations bias inherent in the second price equation in Table 2. Two
regressions are computed for each price variable. Regression (B)
includes         all 10 explanatory variables discussed above, while regression (A)
does       not   include two variables which are found to be insignificant.

            Using the most appropriate price variable, LPRICE1, the demand

equation variables explain 34 percent of the variation in the log

of the utilization rate. Price has           a   significant negative effect on

quantity         demanded, with an elasticity of —2.2.1/

            A significant income elasticity of 0.7 is obtained; a 10 percent

increase in an SI4SA's median family income (INC) is associated with a

7    percent     increase in nursing home use. The measured income effect

is       not a consequence of greater labor force participation (and hence
family income) among adult married women, since this variable is
held constant.

           The labor force participation rate of adult married   women (%tIWLF)
-
     has a strong positive partial effect on nursing home
                                                          use (elasticity
     of 1.4). This suggests substitution between care provided for the

     aged by adult women outside an institutional setting and care provided

     in nursing homes; The more expensive is noninstitutional care (higher

    market value of time of adult women) the more nursing home care demanded.

          The demographic variables have the hypothesized effects.     The

    greater the proportion of the aged who are women, the smaller the

    demand for nursing homes by the aged, presmnably because aged women

    are better able to provide own care than aged men. An SMSA's demand

    for nursing home care is greater the older the aged population; the

    slope coefficients for the three age groups are positive and either

    the slopes or t—ratios increase with age. And, holding constant the

    age and sex distribution of the aged, the poorer the health of the

    aged, as measured by an age—specific mortality rate, the'greater

    the demand for nursing home care.

          The existence of a Medicaid program in the state prior to 1967 had

    a positive but insignificant effect on the demand for nursing homes.

    The weak Medicaid effect may be due to the newness of the program.

    Since the program is now nationwide, its impact cannot be tested using

    current cross—sectional data. Finally, there is no correlation between

    city size (SMSMSA) and the utilization rate for nursing homes.
                                        —21—

         In summary, the cross—sectional analysis indicates that the amount
of   nursing home care demanded for the aged is sensitive to the relative
monetary azd nonmonetary price of institutional compared to noninstitutional
care. The demand is also greater in wealthier areas.
IV. Time Series        Analysis

        As   indicated in Table 1, there has been a rapid increase in
nursing home use       by the   aged in the last quarter of a century. This
increase can presumably be related to changing economic and demographic
factors. Although the model developed in section II           can in principle

be applied directly in a time series analysis, in practice, the

series is too short and subject to too much autocorrelation. However,

if the model is correctly specified and if the population partial

effects (elasticities) are the same in the cross—section as in the

time    series,    the estimated cross—sectional coefficients can be usad

to analyze the time       series.
        This procedure requires time series data on the quantity variable,

residents    per thousand aged persons in the country, and on the explana-
tory variables. Appropriate time         series   data exist for utilization and
for   the demand shift variables for the decade 1963 to 1973., but not
              1/
for price.          The increase over time in median family income, the

labor   force participation rate of adult married        women, and the average


1/  Adequate price data are not available nationally on an annual basis.
In addition, the wage variables in the price equation are not available
annually. It is assumed that there has been no change over time in the
age—specific health of the aged (DEATH) and the variable for small
SMSAs (S?4SMSA). The time series variables are described and their
sources presented in Appendix A.
 age of the aged would increase the             demand.for nursing home care, while
 the increasing proportion of          the aged who are female would have the
 opposite eUect.

           Table 4 presents the contribution of the demand shift variables
                                                               1/
 to the growth of nursing home care for the period 1963 to 1973.— The
 growth due to changing income, female labor force participation and

 the age—sex composition of the aged would have been 95 percent of the

observed growth if all other relevant factors had been unchanged in

the interim. Of the predicted 64 percent increase in utilization in

the decade, four—tenths is attributable to the increased female labor

force participation rate, three—tenths to increased real family income,

and the final three—tenths to the changed demographic (age—sex) composition

of the aged.

           The three shift variables are also important in the four sub—perfods.

As a set, these variables are more successful for explaining the time

 V. Summary    and   Conclusions
       This   paper   has examined the demand       for       nursing home care for the
 aged using cross—sectional and      time       series data. The variable under
 study is the number of residents of nursing and related care homes per
thousand    persors age 65 and over. A two-equation model is developed

 (section II) and tested empirically (section III) for explaining

regional differences in the utilization of nursing homes, using 1967

data arid 201 Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas (SMSAs) as the

observations.

      The industry supply price man              SMSA   ——    cost per re,sident -—   is
constant    in the long run in the relevant range because there is no

input that is specialized to the nursing home industry within an SMSA.

That is, the supply curve is perfectly elastic. The height of this

price line is greater, the higher the price of factor inputs, including

wages, the higher the quality of service, and the      smaller the   number of

physicians per capita in the area. The latter variable may reflect the

supply of entrepreneurial or managerial talent for the nursing hone

sector    in the SMSA, as this is sometimes a part-time employment for
physicians.
         The amount of nursing home care demanded in an SMSA is a negative

function of price, with an elasticity of —2.2. such a large price

elasticity implies that there are good alternatives to or substitutes

for nursing hone care. Care outside of an institutional setting is

an obvious substitute.

         Nursing   home care would be preferred, the less able the aged are
to provide their own personal and nursing service and the more expensive
it is for adult (nonaged) relatives to provide these services. Expirically,
the   demand for nursing home care is greater, the older the aged population
and the poorer their health, as measured by age—specific death rates.
The demand is also greater the larger the proportion of men among the
aged. This presumably arises because aged men are less likely than aged
women to have acquired the training, and perhaps more important, the
habits of providing for their own home—oriented personal care services.
The demand is also     greater, the higher the value of time in the labor

market   of adult married women, as reflected in a greater labor force
participation rate. A higher value of time in the labor market raises
the cost of tSe family's providing noninstitutional care for aged
relatives.                                                     -

          The demand for nursing home care is greater in wealthier areas;
a   higher median family income in an SMSA is    associated with a larger
number of residents per thousand aged population (elasticity 0.7).

City size is apparently uncorrelated with the demand for nursing home

care.

        By January 1, 1967, 27 states had Medicaid coverage for.nursing

home care for the aged poor. The demand for nursing home care was

greater, but not significantly greater, in SMSAs situated in these

states. It is not clear whether the lack of statistical significance

arises because the program was so recently initiated.

        The cross—sectional regression coefficients for the demand shift

variables were applied to an analysis of the growth of nursing home care

from 1963 to 1973 (section IV). During this period there was a 67

percent increase in the number of residents per thousand aged persons.

By themselves, the increased real family income, and laboç force parti-

cipation among adult married women, as well as the changing age—sex

composition of the aged would have increased utilization by 64 percent.

That is, 95 percent of the observed growth from 1963 to 1973 can be

attributed to these demand shift variables.

        It is anticipated that real family income, the labor force

participation rate of adult women and the average age of the aged

population will continue to increase. This suggests that there will

be an increased demand for nursing home care for the aged in the

future.     This increased demand   will not be the consequence of public

policy, but will clearly impact on public policy.

A. Cross-sectional Variables
     The unit of observation is a Standard Metropolitan
Statistical Area (SMSA). An SMSA is a county or group of
contiguous counties which contain at least one city of
50,000 inhabitants of two or more contiguous cities with a

combined population of at least 50,000. For New England,
State Economic Areas, but not SMSAs, are defined on a
county basis and are used as the unit of observation. For
simplicity, ntn—New En:jland SMSA5 and New Ehgland StateS
Economic Areas are referred to as SMSAs   in   this study and
provide a sample of 201 observations.

1. Quantity (RES*)
     The data on nursing home residency are from the nationwide
Master Facility Inventory (1967) of the National Center for
                   1/
Health statistics.    A resident is defined as a person who
is not an employee or owner but who stayed in the home the

night before the survey day in 1967. For the purposes of
this study, the term nursing homes is used to include Nursing
Care Homes, Personal Care Homes with and without Nursing
Services and Domiciliary Care Homes. Facilities that

2. Price (PRICE)

     The price variable is the average most frequent (modal)

monthly charge per resident in nursing homes in the state
during 1968. This is the only quantitative variable not
available on an SMSA basis. Each SMSA is assigned the price
value for the state in which it is located, or in which the

greater proportion of its population resides for SMSAs that
overlap two states. Charges for Care in Nursing Homes:
