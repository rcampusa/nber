                                              ABSTRACT

In 1975, 50 year-old Americans could expect to live slightly longer than their European counterparts.
By 2005, American life expectancy at that age has diverged substantially compared to Europe. We
find that this growing longevity gap is primarily the symptom of real declines in the health of near-elderly
Americans, relative to their European peers. In particular, we use a microsimulation approach to project
what US longevity would look like, if US health trends approximated those in Europe. We find that
differences in health can explain most of the growing gap in remaining life expectancy. In addition,
we quantify the public finance consequences of this deterioration in health. The model predicts that
gradually moving American cohorts to the health status enjoyed by Europeans could save up to $1.1
trillion in discounted total health expenditures from 2004 to 2050.

A. Introduction

The populations of the United States and Western Europe have experienced large gains in
life-expectancy over the last century. For example, U.S. life expectancy at birth increased
from 61 years in 1933 to 78 years in 2004.2 In most developed countries, age-specific
death rates have declined exponentially at a constant rate (Tuljapurkar et al., 2000). Large
declines in infectious diseases drove down mortality rates during the first half of the 20th
century, particularly for the young. During this period, life expectancy across developed
countries also converged (White, 2002).
           The second half of the 20th century witnessed continued growth in longevity, but
of a much different nature. Reductions in mortality among the elderly, rather than the
young, dominated movements in life expectancy (Olshansky and Carnes, 2001). During
this era, another difference emerged: the US began to fall behind other developed
countries in terms of life expectancy (Oeppen and Vaupel, 2002). So far, little is known
about the causes of this widening gap (Lee, 2003).
           According to the Human Mortality Database (HMD), in 1975, life expectancy at
age 50 was similar in the US and Europe. Americans lived on average 27.3 years,
compared to 27.1 years for a representative group of Western European countries
(Denmark, France, Italy, The Netherlands, Spain and Sweden).3 Over the ensuing
decades, however, European life expectancy grew more quickly. As Figure 1 shows, a 50
year-old American in 2004 could expect to live 31 years, compared to 32.5 years in
Europe. A difference of 1.5 years in life expectancy implies a non-trivial welfare loss.
For example, using $100,000 as a lower-bound estimate of the value of a statistical life
year (Viscusi and Aldy, 2003), this represents at least a $700 million dollar disadvantage
for the current generation of 50 year olds. While the cross-country longevity gap remains
smaller than within-country differences along the lines of socioeconomic status, the

    We used period life-table data from the Human Mortality Database (HMD, www.mortality.org). The
HMD did not have data going back to 1975 for Germany.


                                                                                                     2
surprise lies in the divergent paths of the US and Europe, in spite of their similar levels of
economic development.
        Over that same period, chronic illnesses associated with more sedentary lifestyles
have spread, somewhat mitigating improvements in life expectancy (Goldman et al.,
2005; Lakdawalla et al., 2005). Due to data limitations, it is hard to assess whether trends
in chronic disease have spread more rapidly in the US, but historical data do exist on
risky health behaviors that contribute to chronic disease. Using data from the OECD,
Figure 2 shows tobacco consumption per capita (1960-2005) and obesity rates for the
U.S. and European countries where data exist (1978-2005). While tobacco consumption
is higher in Europe today, it was much higher in the US for the earliest years in the
figure. While near-elderly Americans are less likely to be smoking now than their
European counterparts, they are much more likely to have ever smoked. One plausible
explanation for this rapid decrease is that smoking cessation programs have been more
effective in the U.S. than in Europe but that take up as started earlier. For example, Cutler
and Glaeser (2006) argue that 50% of the gap in current smoking status is due to
differences in beliefs about the health effects of smoking, Europeans thinking it is not as
harmful for health as Americans do.
        The second panel shows the obesity rate, defined as BMI>30, for the U.S. and a
set of European countries for whom data is available. Both the level and slope are larger
in the U.S. The U.S. and Europe have diverged starkly since the 70s.4 Reduction in the
costs of food consumption and technological innovation which led to more sedentary
work are two key explanations put forward to explain the U.S. trend (Lakdawalla and
Philipson, 2002). Cutler et al. (2003) argue that these changes may have taken place more
slowly in Europe due in particular to stricter food regulation.
        Figure 3 displays what are perhaps the consequences of these divergent trends; the
US prevalence of chronic disease and risky behavior is much higher than in European
countries (Banks et al., 2006; Andreyeva et al., 2007). The figure displays these data

            Data based on measured weight and height rather than self-reported. Data for the U.S. is from the
NHANES survey. The OECD and WHO harmonize these measures across countries for survey and
methodological differences.


                                                                                                           3
among the 50-55 year old population using internationally comparable survey data.5
Except for current smoking status, Americans look worse in terms of health. Several of
the differences are quite large. For instance, Americans are about twice as likely to have
hypertension, twice as likely to be obese, twice as likely to have diabetes, and nearly 50%
more likely to have ever smoked, As we demonstrate latter, these differences are
unlikely to be explained by differences in diagnosis or reporting. For example, the
prevalence of stroke is twice as low in Europe as in the U.S., a condition which rarely
goes undiagnosed.
         Clearly, the apparent gaps in observed health status would contribute to a gap in
longevity, but it is not obvious how big the contribution will be. For instance, there are
well-documented longevity gaps across racial and socioeconomic lines, within countries.
These are not fully explained by differences in observed health status. The question is
whether “being American” is an independent mortality risk factor, in the same way that
being poor or being black increase risk above and beyond observed health.
         Furthermore, it is worth considering the fiscal consequences of these trends as the
United States and Europe begin to grapple with the consequences of shifting population
demographics. On the one hand, decreased longevity—especially due to higher mortality
at older ages—can ease the burden on public pension programs such as Social Security
and public insurance. However, if the longevity decrease comes at the expense of
increased chronic disease and disability, then there is increased pressure on public health
insurance and disability insurance programs. The net effects then are unclear.
         This paper aims to address this and several related questions. First, we assess
whether differences in near-elderly health are enough to explain the longevity gap across
countries. From a policy perspective, it is important to know whether differences in life
expectancy are due to differences in health before or after age 50. The answer to this
question identifies the target population for health interventions, and provides insight into
the relative value of preventive or curative care. While consistent historical data on health

         5
             We used the 2004 waves of the Health and Retirement Study in the U.S. and the Survey of
Health Ageing and Retirement in Europe to produce these numbers. Properly weighted, both surveys are
representative of the age 50+ population in each country. Questions on health conditions are very similar.
The text of those questions is reproduced in Table A.1 of the appendix.

conditions are unavailable across countries, we use a dynamic microsimulation model
calibrated to match historical U.S. health and longevity dynamics over the life course. We
then simulate a counterfactual where the health of an American cohort mimics the health
of Europeans observed in 2004. Second, we quantify the fiscal consequences of
differences in health and longevity across countries, using the detailed policy modules
from the micro simulation model.
       The paper is structured as follow. Section B describes the model that is used to
describe the long-term economic consequences of these trends. Section C uses the model
to quantify the effect of differences in health on longevity and government
expenditures/revenues, and Section D discusses the results.


B. Microsimulation Model of Health and Economic Dynamics
B.1 Background

       To link morbidity to longevity, one needs a transition model that relates current
health to the future risk of mortality. Given our interest in fiscal consequences, we also
need a model linking health and economic outcomes. Both the epidemiological and
economic literatures contain complex models of each, but few integrate both.
       The current social science literature features several well-known and
complementary approaches for measuring population health and projecting future disease
burden and mortality—including models by Manton and co-authors (Manton, Singer et
al. 1993), Lee (Lee 2000), and Hayward (Hayward and Warner 2005). Across these
models, there is an underlying trade-off between the complexity of the data required, and
the broad applicability of the model. For instance, early life table approaches like those
of Sullivan (1971) require only age-specific population data as well as corresponding
disability rates at those same ages; these elements are all present in cross-sectional data.
However, these straightforward data requirements come at a cost, as the Sullivan method
appears too insensitive to large changes in disability and mortality, and may thus
underestimate future trends in population health (Bonneux, Barendregt et al. 1994).
Multistate life table models and microsimulation models that exploit longitudinal data,
however, can accommodate richer dynamics than Sullivan’s method and thus provide


                                                                                               5
more flexibility in modeling the dynamic interplay between morbidity, disability, and
mortality. Such dynamic models obtain population health trends as aggregates from
individual stochastic processes underlying these outcomes.
        We use a model that considers the dynamic interplay between a large number of
health outcomes as well as economic outcomes. The model is an extension of the Future
Elderly Model (FEM) (Goldman, Hurd et al. 2004). This is a reduced-form markovian
model that allows for unobserved heterogeneity and correlation across outcomes. In that
sense, it is well equipped to analyze the effect of the health differences on longevity and
public financial liabilities, as it allows for complex interactions between multi-
dimensional measures of health and economic outcomes.

B.2 Functioning of the Dynamic Model

B.2.1 Overview
The Future Elderly Model (FEM) was developed to examine health and health care costs
among the elderly Medicare population (age 65+) (Goldman, Hurd et al. 2004). The FEM
has been used to assess the technological risk facing Medicare(Goldman, Shang et al.
2005), to forecast the costs of obesity in older Americans (Lakdawalla, Goldman et al.
2005); to model disability-related trends (Chernew, Goldman et al. 2005); to examine the
future costs of cancer (Bhattacharya, Shang et al. 2005); to estimate the value of
preventing disease after age 65 (Goldman, Cutler et al. 2006), and to compare the impact
of pharmaceuticals on longevity in Europe and the United States (Lakdawalla, Goldman
et al. 2009). The most recent version now project these outcomes for all Americans aged
50 and older using data from the Health and Retirement Study. The defining
characteristic of the model is the use of real rather than synthetic cohorts, all of whom are
followed at the individual level. This allows for more heterogeneity in behavior than
would be allowed by a cell-based approach. The model has three core components:
         The initial cohort module predicts the health and socio-economic outcomes of
new cohorts of 50 year-olds. This module calibrates the Health and Retirement Study
(HRS) to reflect population trends observed in younger populations from the National
Health Interview Study (NHIS). It allows us to generate new cohorts as the simulation
proceeds, so that we can measure outcomes for the age 50+ population in any given year.


                                                                                              6
        The transition module calculates the probabilities of entering and exiting various
health states, and the likelihood of various financial outcomes. The module takes as
inputs risk factors such as smoking, weight, age and education, along with lagged health
and financial states. This allows for a great deal of heterogeneity and fairly general
feedback effects. The transition probabilities are estimated from the longitudinal data in
the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). These probabilities are then used to simulate the
path of individuals in the simulation.
        The policy outcomes module aggregates projections about individual-level
outcomes into policy outcomes such as taxes, medical care costs, pension benefits paid,
and disability benefits. This component takes account of public and private program rules
to the extent allowed by the available outcomes. Because we have access to HRS-linked
restricted data from Social Security records and employer pension plans, we are able to
realistically model retirement benefit receipt.
        Figure 4 provides a schematic overview of the model. We start in 2004 with an
initial population aged 50+ taken from the HRS. We then predict outcomes using our
estimated transition probabilities. Those who survive make it to the end of that year, at
which point we calculate policy outcomes for the year. We then move to the following
year, when a new cohort of 50 year-olds enters (with a different health profile). These
entrants, along with the survivors from the last period, constitute the new age 50+
population, which then proceeds through the transition model as before. This process is
repeated until we reach the final year of the simulation. The model can be run for a single
cohort, without entering cohorts, or at the population level where successive cohorts enter
the simulation. In the population-level simulation, we can track both population as well
as cohort outcomes. In what follows we give an overview of each component of the
model. The technical appendix accompanying this paper contains more details on the
implementation.

B.2.2   Initial Cohort Module
        We aim to characterize outcomes for the age 50+ population. Hence, we need to
predict the characteristics of the current and future 50 year-old population, in terms of
health, demographics and economic outcomes. Unfortunately, the HRS does not include
respondents younger than age 50; therefore, the characteristics of future 50 year-olds


                                                                                             7
must be modeled using data on younger individuals. It is not sufficient to merely
replicate the 50-year olds observed today because of the non-stationarity of health in
younger populations.
        We estimate trends in the health of 50 year-olds using two methods. First, we use
the method described in Goldman, Hurd et al. (2004) to calculate trends in disease
prevalence from the National Health Interview Surveys (NHIS). The trends we estimate
are relatively close to other independent estimates, as documented in the appendix. For
outcomes other than disease prevalence, we use existing estimates, all of which are
documented in the technical appendix.
        Second, we use the 50 year-old HRS respondents from 2004 as a template for
future cohorts of 50 year-olds. We adjust their health to match projected prevalence
levels, using the trends estimated in the first step. For example, if obesity is projected to
rise in 2020, we increase the rate of obesity within the cohort of 50 year-olds, by
reassigning enough non-obese individuals to obesity status. Since obesity is correlated
with other outcomes such as hypertension and diabetes, we reassign obesity status so that
those at greatest risk are more likely to acquire it.
        The reassignment is governed by a latent health model with correlated
unobservables. An individual’s disease status is a function of the mean population
probability of the disease, along with a random error term. For an individual, the error
terms are correlated across diseases. This builds in the possibility that, for instance, the
occurrence of diabetes and hypertension are correlated. We jointly estimate the
population means and the covariance structure of the error terms by maximum simulated
likelihood (more details appear in the technical appendix). Table 1 lists all the outcomes
that we model. There are seven binary outcomes: hypertension, heart disease, diabetes,
fair or poor self-reported health, labor force participation, insurance status and positive
wealth. (The inclusion of this last indicator is necessary because of the observed spike in
the distribution of net wealth at zero in the HRS.) There are three ordered outcomes:
BMI status, smoking status and functional status in the transition model. Finally, there are
five continuous outcomes: average indexed monthly earnings (AIME), the number of
quarters of coverage; earnings, financial wealth, and defined contribution (DC) wealth.
We also model respondents’ pension plan outcomes: whether they have a defined benefit


                                                                                                8
(DB) or DC plan on the current job; the earliest age at which they are eligible; and the
conventional retirement age. We group the latter around peaks in the empirical
distribution. The most common early retirement age is 55, and the modal retirement age
is 62. Finally, each of these outcomes depends on fixed characteristics such as race,
education, gender and marital status. We also consider cancer, lung disease and stroke as
fixed covariates, because their prevalence is very low in this population (age 50-53).
Estimates are presented in the appendix.
        Finally, the size of the entering cohort is adjusted to reflect population projections
from Census by gender and race. We also adjust the size of the initial new cohort in 2004
to Census estimates by gender, race and ethnicity.

B.2.3  Transition Model
The transition model tracks movement among states as a function of risk and
demographic factors. The technical appendix provides details on the parametric
structure, estimation, and validation of the model. Here we enumerate and discuss all the
key inputs and outputs of the model, and how they are measured.
        The data come from the 1992 to 2004 biennial waves of the HRS. We consider
both health and economic outcomes, all of which are listed in Table 2. The table lists
several groups of variables: diseases, risk factors, functional status, labor force and
benefit status, financial resources, nursing home residence, and death. At a particular
point in an individual’s life, the model takes as inputs the individual’s risk factors, along
with her lagged disease status, functional status, labor force and benefit status, financial
resources, and nursing home status. The outputs are current disease status, functional
status, labor force and benefit status, financial resources, and nursing home status. More
detail on variable measurement is presented below.
        Transition rates are allowed to differ across demographic and economic groups. In
particular, we allow differences by gender, race and ethnicity, education, and marital
status. Transition equations are estimated on 7 waves of the HRS. We assess the fit of
the model by simulating 2004 outcomes for the 1992 HRS respondents; these are then
compared actual outcomes. We use half the sample for estimation and the other half for
simulation. In general, the model fits the data quite well, with a close correspondence




                                                                                                9
between predicted and actual outcomes in most areas. Complete results can be found in
Table A.9 of the technical appendix.
        Measurement of Variables
       The list of diseases includes the most prevalent conditions in the HRS survey:
hypertension, stroke, heart disease, lung disease, diabetes and cancer. An individual’s
disease status is estimated using the responses to questions of the form: "Has a doctor
ever told you that you had…." Consistent with the chronic nature of these illnesses, we
assume there is no chance of recovery and model the time until diagnosis (after age 50).
       Second, we consider risk factors, focusing particularly on smoking and obesity.
We model transitions across three “obesity” states: not obese (BMI<25), overweight (25-
30) and obese (BMI>30). This information is derived from self-reports on weight and
height; while not as accurate as physical measurement, they are nonetheless highly
predictive of population outcomes. For smoking, we model whether the respondent: has
never smoked, has ever smoked but quit, or is still smoking at the time of the interview.
       Third, we measure functional status using ADL (activities of daily living) and
IADL (instrumental activities of daily living) limitations. These are counts of positive
answers to questions (5 for ADL limitations and 7 for IADL limitations) such as whether
the respondent has trouble walking, getting out of bed, dressing, etc. IADLs are typically
less severe impairments than ADLs. We measure functional status by classifying
respondents into the following categories: no IADL or ADL limitations, 1-2 IADL
limitations but no ADL limitations, 1-2 ADL limitations, or 3+ ADL limitations. This
classification scheme yields four mutually exclusive categories (based on the data). These
are not assumed to be absorbing states in that we allow for recovery.
       Next, we add labor force and benefit receipt outcomes. (We express all monetary
units in terms of 2004 dollars using the Consumer Price Index.) First, we track whether
someone works for pay (any positive hours), and we track earnings on the main job. We
also track whether the respondent has employer-based health insurance, or derives
coverage from other sources (apart from Medicare). We do this for the population
younger than age 65. After age 65, nearly all respondents have insurance through
Medicare. An individual can derive coverage through his employer, the employer of
his/her spouse, a private insurer, or a government assistance program such as Medicaid


                                                                                           10
(if disabled). We also record whether someone has a pension on his job, and whether this
is a defined benefit (DB) or defined contribution (DC) type. If the respondent reports a
DC pension, we also consider the self-reported account balance as another dependent
variable. If the respondent reports a DB pension, we record the earliest age at which the
pension can be claimed, as well as the number of years on the job and the normal
retirement age on that plan. We also construct a variable recording whether someone is
claiming a DB pension on the current job (quitting a job with a DB pension). Hence, we
have two binary state variables (DC and DB entitlement) and one continuous state-
variable (DC account balance) to take account of private pensions.
           We model Social Security retirement benefit receipt using the self-reported age at
which benefits were first claimed. Since we have access to earnings records for
respondents in the HRS, we also determine who is eligible upon reaching age 62 using
quarters of coverage. We construct the Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME) for
the initial interview and update the AIME in the simulation using a simplified rule as in
French (2005).6 The AIME is the basis for computing benefits. We also model disability
insurance (DI) benefit receipt and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) using self-reports
from the HRS. When reporting SSI figures however, we use a measurement error
correction model estimated from merging self-reported with administrative data from
SSA to correct for underreporting (see Technical Appendix for details).
           We then add measures of financial resources. We construct a measure of net
financial wealth using self-reports from the HRS and imputations performed by RAND
(Hurd, Hoynes et al. 1998). Net financial wealth is defined as the value of financial assets
(checking, savings, stocks, IRAs, Certificate deposits, bonds) plus the value of real assets
(primary house, other real estate, other real assets) minus all debt (mortgage, home loans,
credit cards, etc). We also track earnings, and whether wealth is positive. To account for
the skewness of the wealth and earnings distribution, we use the generalized inverse
hyperbolic sine transformation. For both wealth and earnings, we censor observations
above the 99th percentile in 2004.

6
    We estimate a regression function of next period’s AIME as a function of baseline AIME and earnings.
We allow coefficients to be age specific and consider a second-order approximation. Estimates available

                                                                                                           11
        Finally, we track nursing home residence, and mortality. The HRS initially did
not sample from the nursing home population. Because our simulations typically start at
age 50, this is not a major limitation. More importantly, the HRS follows respondents
into nursing homes and also records transition back to independent or assisted living
outside nursing homes. Mortality is recorded in exit interviews in the HRS. Mortality
hazards derived from the HRS correspond closely with life-table probabilities (Adams,
Hurd et al. 2003; Michaud, Kapteyn et al. 2006)).
         Model Restrictions
        We make several restrictions on the transition risks permitted in the model. First,
we only allow feedback from diseases where clinical research supports such a link based
on consultation with several physicians from the Southern California Evidence-Based
Practice Center. For example, we allow hypertensive patients to have higher risk of heart
disease, but we do not allow hypertensive patients to have higher risk of cancer. These
clinical restrictions are documented in the technical appendix and elsewhere (Goldman,
Hurd et al. 2004).
        Another important restriction we impose is that economic outcomes do not
feedback to health. This is consistent with the findings from previous studies (Adams,
Hurd et al. 2003). SES does not appear to have a causal effect on health outcomes in this
age range. The correlation between SES and health appears to be generated by feedback
effects from health to economic status, most notably through the effect of health shocks
on labor supply and medical spending. Also playing a role are predetermined (earlier)
events or common factors (genetics, etc) that induce a non-causal correlation between
SES and health. These two factors are accounted for in the estimation.

B.2.4 Policy Outcomes
The model simulates a number of relevant health and economic outcomes for individuals.
First, we consider a set of health outcomes such as life expectancy, healthy life
expectancy (no ADL limitations), and medical expenditures. Average medical
expenditures by disease and demographic group are calculated from two sources. For
those younger than age 65, we use the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) and
include in medical expenditures the respondents’ medical care costs and the cost of drugs.
For those above age 65, we use the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS). The


                                                                                          12
MEPS is known to under-predict expenditures compared to National Health Expenditure
Accounts (NHEA) (Sing et al., 2006). We also find that the MCBS under-predicts
expenditures from the NHEA. Without adjustment, we seem to under predict payments
(by $59 billion for Medicare and $38 billion for Medicaid). Our cost estimates are based
on average expenditures in the Medical Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) and total
costs in the MCBS are also lower than in the NHEA. The MCBS is known to undercount
medical spending by both the Congressional Budget Office and the CMS (Christensen
and Wagner 2000).7 Hence, we adjust those numbers to match the NHEA, inflating costs
by 15%. More detail can be found in the Appendix (section 5, p. 12).
         In addition to the individual outcomes, the model predicts revenues and
expenditures by the Federal Government, for the age 50+ population. As part of the
predicted medical expenditures, we also predict expenditures by source, including those
by Medicare and Medicaid. Next, we compute Social Security retirement benefits for
those predicted to receive such benefits. Since we have the AIME of both respondent and
spouse, we can precisely estimate the distribution of retirement benefits. We account for
spouse and survivor benefits. We also compute disability insurance (DI) benefits and
Supplemental Security Income (SSI). As Michaud et al. (2009) report, the simulation is
able to replicate basic fiscal aggregates for 2004. We compute DB pension income from
average pension payments by tenure, last earnings and early and normal retirement ages
using Pension Plan characteristics reported by Employers of HRS respondents. Using all
these income flows, for the respondent and the spouse (if present), we compute net
household income where taxes include Federal, State, City income taxes as well as the
Social Security taxes (OASDI and Medicare). More detail is provided in the appendix.

B.2.5  Simulation Methods
For population scenarios, the simulation starts with the existing age 50+ population in the
2004 wave of the HRS. The microsimulation is stochastic, meaning that transitions are
randomly drawn from the joint distribution of state variables which is estimated from the
HRS. There are two stochastic elements in the model: the simulation of new cohorts and
the simulation of transitions. To generate new cohorts, we make use of the estimated joint


         7
           The Congressional Budget Office, for example, inflated MCBS prescription drug spending by 15 percent to
produce its official forecast of the cost of Part D.


                                                                                                                13
distribution and use random draws from the correlated errors to generate a new cohort.
Second, for each respondent in a given year, we calculate transition probabilities. We
then draw random numbers to attribute new outcomes. This process is repeated a number
of times to ensure independence from any particular sequence of random numbers. We
average over 10 replications. For cohort scenarios, we only use the 2004 age 50 cohort
and simulate outcomes until everyone has died.


C. Results
As noted earlier, our objectives are to assess whether health differences explain the
longevity gap, and to quantify the fiscal consequences of gradually closing the health
gap. To meet the first objective, we examine the 2004 cohort of 50 year-olds, and
consider the counterfactual in which Americans have the same health as Europeans. The
resulting longevity is compared to the longevity predicted using the baseline health status
of Americans. We also assess the total differences in public spending generated by these
underlying differences in health. The second experiment requires analyzing population-
level projections for health and economic outcomes if we gradually moved American
health levels to those of Europeans.

C.1 Explaining Longevity Differences

We use the prevalence rates presented in Figure 3 to construct the first counterfactual
cohort. We simulate the baseline outcomes of the cohort using the adjusted prevalence
rates from European data. Using the methodology outlined in B.2.2, we preserve the
correlation between health and other outcomes in the model. We keep other socio-
economic characteristics constant at American levels while varying health status of the
cohort. We then simulate transitions until every one dies in the simulation. We compare
this counterfactual with the status quo case where American health is unchanged.
       Our baseline projection of remaining life-expectancy at age 50 is 31 years. This is
very close to the 30.98 years estimate from life tables presented in Figure 1. In Figure 5,
assigning European health status levels to Americans increases healthy life expectancy
(years without ADLs) by 1.3 years, and decreases unhealthy life expectancy (years with
1+ ADLs) by a tenth of a year. The overall effect is to increase life expectancy by 1.2


                                                                                          14
years, which is 92% of the difference in life expectancy reported in World Health
Organization data.
       These gaps in health and longevity have important fiscal consequences. The
resulting change in life expectancy may increase both revenues and expenditures, while
possibly reducing medical care costs. Table 3 computes the overall fiscal effects on a per
capita basis. Revenue would increase by $2,425 per capita, partly due to the increase in
life expectancy and increase in earnings/labor force participation. On the expenditure
side, there are two effects. First, old age pension benefits increase by a substantial
amount ($6593 per capita). This is roughly the size of the average annual Social Security
benefit payment. But, there is a larger decrease in Medicare, Medicaid and Disability
insurance (DI) benefit payments. Total lifetime health care expenditures decrease by a
stunning $17,791. This represents an 8.5% reduction in lifetime medical expenditures.
The average reduction in lifetime payments is $4,717 for Medicare and $3,687 for
Medicaid. Adding the reduction in DI costs, the net effect on government expenditures is
$2,477 per capita. Overall the net fiscal impact of this scenario is an increase in per capita
net revenue of $4,902 for the government.

C.2 Long-Term Financial Consequences

The experiment above computes the contribution of health differences to longevity, and
public spending. We are also interested in the more practical question concerning the
consequences of gradually, rather than immediately, moving cohorts of near-elderly
Americans towards the health status of their European counterparts.
       To implement a gradual scenario we allow prevalence rates in the entering cohort
to reach European levels by 2030. This is compared to a status quo scenario in which
current trends observed and projected among the new elderly persist. Hence, this scenario
can be interpreted as a transition from the current steady-state to a new one. The fiscal
effects have a direct economic interpretation for policies that would help reach that
steady-state. Figure 6 provides the time path for various conditions among entering
cohorts in the baseline and the counterfactual scenario. Each year, the population alive is
representative of the age 50+ population alive in the U.S.




                                                                                            15
       We report the results for the status quo in Table 4. Given current trends, we
project the size of the population aged 50+ will increase by nearly 75% from 80.7 million
in 2004 to 144 million in 2050. The population forecast for 2050 is very close to that of
the Social Security Administration (80.8 million). Life expectancy is projected to
increase from 31 years in 2004, to 31.6 years in 2050. However, as estimated in Michaud
et al. (2009), this improvement is likely to coincide with more time spent in a disabled
state, since disability-free life expectancy is projected to be lower in 2050.
       We compare the baseline to the scenario described in Figure 6, of gradual
movement towards European prevalence levels. Table 5 reports the results. Because of
longevity gains, the population age 50+ is 4%, or 5.75 million, larger in 2050. The
population is also much healthier in 2030 and 2050 than under the status quo. For
example, the obesity rate falls by 24 percentage points, while the prevalence of lifetime
smoking and of diabetes both fall by roughly 10 percentage points each.
       Government revenue rises by 10%, or $30 billion, by 2050, as a result of the
longevity gains. As before, there are two offsetting expenditure effects. On one hand,
longer lives imply larger annuity burdens: OASI benefits go up by $70.4 billion. On the
other hand, medical costs decrease by $124 billion, or 6.7%, in 2050. Medicare saves
$36.4 billion despite the increase in longevity. The overall effect on expenditures is
initially negative, but turns positive by 2050. As found in Michaud et al. (2009), a
transition to better health first decreases expenditures, but gains in longevity eventually
exert upward pressure on spending.
       In Figure 7, the gains in health expenditure materialize quickly, while the annuity
burden takes longer to emerge. This is essentially a timing issue, cost savings due to
lower disability appear before extensions in life expectancy. The total effect on
expenditures is largest around 2030 and goes to zero by 2050. Since revenue rises as
well, the net fiscal effect is positive in 2050 but slowly converging to zero. Hence, the
transition to better health involves important fiscal effects, but these largely vanish once
the new equilibrium is reached.
       Figure 8 shows that, in present value terms from the 2004 perspective, the
increase in tax revenue almost entirely offsets the annuity burden. The effect on health
expenditures remains. The present discounted value of Medicare and Medicaid savings


                                                                                              16
combined is $632 billion, or 1.6 years of combined 2004 spending on the two programs.
In terms of total medical spending, the present value of those savings is $1.1 trillion
dollars.

C.3 Robustness to Cross-Country Differences in Diagnosis

An alternative interpretation of cross-country differences in health focuses on differences
in rates of diagnosis, rather than real differences in health status. The literature
documents under-diagnosis of diseases like diabetes and hypertension in the US (Smith,
2007), but it is difficult to find comparable European studies. However, one direct
analysis of this question suggests that differences in diagnosis are relatively modest.
Banks et al. (2006) compare objective clinical diagnosis among men, using commonly
used thresholds on biomarkers, to self-reports of whether respondents have previously
been diagnosed. For diabetes among those aged 40-70, they find a clinical prevalence of
4.8% in the UK and 8.9% in the US, but self-reported prevalence of 4.4% and 8.6%,
respectively. The cross-country difference is similar using self-reports or clinical
measurements (4.2% versus 4.1%). They find a similar result for hypertension. These
discrepancies are not large relative to the differences we observe in the data.
           Of course, the Banks et al. evidence is somewhat narrow in its focus on diabetes
and hypertension, and on the US-UK difference specifically. To test the sensitivity of our
results to diagnostic differences, we ran the cohort analysis under various assumptions
about differential diagnosis. We defined 6 scenarios in which the difference between the
U.S. and Europe prevalence rates for doctor-diagnosed diseases went from 0% to 100%
of the differences we found in the data. In all these scenarios, we kept differences in
obesity and smoking constant, as differential reporting across countries seems less clearly
linked to systematic institutional factors. Figure 9 reports the variation in computed life
expectancy across these various scenarios. If all of the difference we observed was due to
under-reporting, life expectancy would only increase by 0.25 years, as a result of
differences in baseline obesity and smoking. On the other hand, the absence of
differential diagnosis yields an effect of 1.2 years. If the Banks et al., result holds more
generally, and there is at most a 5% difference in diagnosis, the effect drops to about 1.1




                                                                                              17
year. This suggests that the differences are likely to remain meaningful under reasonably
assumptions about differential diagnosis.


D. Conclusion
There is a growing longevity gap between the US and Europe with no settled
interpretation. We have demonstrated that differences in observed disease prevalence can
almost entirely account for this difference. In this sense, the international longevity gap
appears much easier to explain than, for instance, the racial or socioeconomic longevity
gaps, which are not well explained by health differences. Internationally, however, there
is no “American-specific” effect on longevity, above and beyond differences in disease at
age 50. This suggests further that addressing the health gap will likely erase the
longevity gap, although the same cannot necessarily be said for analogous disparities
within countries.
       Clearly, further research is needed into the cause of the gap in good health,
although several candidates have emerged through our investigation. The expansion of
the gap in longevity and health coincided with relative increases in obesity among the US
population. Moreover, near-elderly cohorts of Americans took up smoking at much
higher rates than their European counterparts.
       The gap in health and longevity has obvious private costs to the citizens suffering
from disease. There are also significant public finance consequences, to the tune of
$17,800 in per capita medical costs, and net public finance costs of roughly five thousand
dollars per capita. Gradual transitions of US cohorts towards European levels could
generate large fiscal benefits. In the long-run, medical expenditures may fall by $1.1
trillion on a present value basis. It is not clear which policies could help reach this goal.
But if history is a guide, looking back at the success of anti-smoking campaigns, it shows
that changing behaviors is possible. The costs of such policies will need to be weighted
against the welfare and economic consequences we have analyzed in this paper.

Source: Authors’ calculations using the microsimulation model. The figure shows the average life
expectancy of a 50 year old under different scenarios regarding the difference between Americans and
Europeans in terms of doctor diagnosed diseases. 0% refers to a scenario where Americans and Europeans
have the same prevalence of doctor diagnosed diseases. They have however different levels of obesity and
smoking. The 100% scenario refers to the scenario considered in the analysis: there is no relative
underdiagnosis in Europe.
