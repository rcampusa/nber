                                              ABSTRACT

We explore the principal trends that are shaping the future landscape of energy supply, demand, and
trade. We take a long-term view, assessing trends on the time scale of a generation by looking 25 years
into the past, taking stock of the current situation, and projecting 25 years into the future. We view
these market, technology, and policy trends at a global scale, as well as assess the key regional dynamics
that are substantially altering the energy scene. The shift from West to East in the locus of energy growth
and the turnaround of North American gas and oil production are the most pronounced of these currents.
Key uncertainties include the strength of economic and population growth in emerging economies,
the stringency of future actions to reduce carbon emissions, the magnitude of unconventional natural
gas and oil development in non-OPEC countries, and the stability of OPEC oil supplies.

1. Introduction
        In this paper we explore the principal trends that are shaping the future energy landscape.
We take a long-term view, on the time scale of a generation, by looking 25 years into the past,
taking stock of the current situation, and projecting 25 years into the future. We view these
trends at a global scale, as well as assess the key regional dynamics that are substantially altering
the energy scene. The shift from West to East in the locus of energy growth and the turnaround
of North American gas and oil production are the most pronounced of these currents.

        In doing so, we place significant strategic value on the projection of alternative future
energy scenarios for the purpose of informing business investment, domestic public policy,
foreign policy, international trade, and other decisions. Some trends may appear neutral, but
require reaction in response to changing conditions. Other developments present opportunities
that can be seized upon. Still others may look distinctly negative, requiring risk mitigation or
prodding us like Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu that “if you do not change direction, you may end
up where you are heading.” In many or even most cases, whether particular trends look positive
or negative will depend on one’s point of view. Given that the bounds of uncertainty may be
large, projections 25 years into the future must be done with humility, and there is considerable
value to exploring multiple scenarios.

1.1   Major Shifts in the Energy Landscape
        Several aspects of the energy landscape have changed significantly over the past decade.
Expected growth in global energy consumption has come down, and regional growth
expectations have shifted more strongly eastward. At the same time, unconventional oil and
especially natural gas are poised to play a more significant role in fulfilling the world’s energy
needs, while lingering uncertainty remains regarding the place of nuclear power in the energy
mix. Non-hydro renewables are now making measurable inroads into the electricity mix, as are
biofuels as a component of liquid transport fuels. On both fronts, the ability of existing energy
infrastructure to accommodate renewables is being tested, requiring new approaches and
additional investment.

       As an example of earlier expectations, take Sieminski (2005), who anticipated that world
energy consumption would increase about 50 percent from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching almost




                                                  1
340 million barrels per day (MMBD) of oil equivalent, not including non-marketed biomass.1
Current expectations are now generally lower, with comparable estimates in the range of 300 to
330 MMBD of oil equivalent in 2035, five years later (Table 1). Projections of future oil
consumption follow a similar pattern. In 2005, Sieminski estimated that oil demand would grow
to 124 MMBD by 2030, whereas the highest current projections are in the range of 110 MMBD
for 2035 (Table 5). These lower projections of both overall energy consumption and oil demand
reflect a number of developments, including the lasting impact of the global economic downturn,
higher energy prices, and improved energy efficiency due to policy interventions.

        There are both similarities and differences in past and current fuel share projections. The
expected share of petroleum 20-25 years hence has decreased significantly from 38 percent to
around 30 percent (excluding non-marketed biomass). At the same time, while the overall share
of fossil fuels appears likely to remain above 75 percent and possibly closer to 80 percent, this is
significantly lower than an earlier estimate of almost 90 percent for 2030 (Sieminski 2005).

        New technologies such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing have made
previously untapped reserves of oil and natural gas profitable, and are beginning to shift regional
supply dynamics. The abundance and location of these unconventional sources, coupled with
patterns of demand, have the potential to significantly change the energy trade balance in certain
parts of the world (Figure 2). Shale gas in particular has radically altered the outlook for North
American natural gas production, shifting the United States from a position of increasing
liquefied natural gas (LNG) importation to one where it is preparing to export natural gas. This is
in turn having ripple effects on spot market prices for natural gas, the global LNG market, and
international price structures for natural gas contracts.

        Oil sands and now tight oil are having a similar impact on the North American liquids
front, although at this time the magnitude of impact is less pronounced than for unconventional
gas. Still—when coupled with increased fuel economy, dampened liquids demand, and increased
biofuels and natural gas liquids production—this increase in petroleum production has placed
North America on a path to net self-sufficiency in liquids over roughly the next 20-25 years.

        It is still unclear how the incident at the Fukushima nuclear reactor in Japan will impact
the future of nuclear energy. Some countries have announced plans to reevaluate, reduce, or
completely dismantle their nuclear programs, though the form and timing of implementation are


1Note that these fuel share comparisons do not include traditional, non-marketed biomass energy. This is to ensure
an accurate comparison with Sieminski’s figures, which also excluded non-marketed biomass energy.

still in flux. General issues surrounding nuclear have changed little in the past several years:
economically it remains a relatively expensive electricity source, and concerns about safety,
waste disposal, and nuclear material proliferation have not subsided, particularly in light of the
Fukushima incident. On the other hand, fast-growing Asian economies like China and India, as
well as some Middle Eastern countries, are looking for large-scale non-fossil sources of power
and so have turned to nuclear energy as a part of their electricity mix. Whether the presence of
nuclear power in the energy supply mix increases substantially may be driven largely by the
extent of efforts to mitigate carbon emissions and the effects of climate change; if such efforts
are significant, nuclear power may be much more economically competitive.

1.2   Types of Energy Scenarios
        Energy outlooks—in the form of detailed quantitative projections of energy consumption,
supply, technologies, prices, and other variables—are one way to explore future energy trends,
the impacts of energy use, and the implications of current, expected, and potential future policies.
Some organizations, including the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) and the
International Energy Agency (IEA), provide multiple scenarios within each of their energy
outlooks. One benefit of this approach is a better understanding of how critical assumptions
impact the results from these organizations’ respective energy models. Some other organizations,
such as ExxonMobil and BP, do not publish multiple scenarios (though they may internally
perform sensitivity analysis), and as such their projections are presented as a single benchmark
or “best guess” scenario. In all cases, some of the key factors that differentiate models/scenarios
are assumptions regarding economic and population growth, policies, energy prices, and
expected technological innovation and deployment.

        Energy scenarios can be grouped into roughly three types: (1) reference case or current
policy scenarios, (2) best guess or expected value scenarios, and (3) alternative policy and
technology scenarios. Reference case and current policy scenarios assume that existing market
and technology trends—and particularly current policy—will continue into the future. Examples
include EIA’s Reference Case scenario and IEA’s Current Policies scenario. This type of
scenario provides a very useful baseline against which the impact of new policy proposals and
significant technology/market changes can be measured, and it avoids judgments about policy
proposals that have not yet been put into law. By construction, however, these scenarios only
capture the current state of policy—which can be very important to the energy system—and we
know from experience that our best guess is that policy does in fact change rather than remaining
stagnant. Technological change can also be discontinuous or abrupt at times, rather than




                                                     3
incremental along a continuous path. Alternative policy and technology scenarios are therefore
an important complement to business-as-usual projections.

        One alternative approach is to consider a scenario of what one might reasonably expect
will occur with future policy developments; that is, a “best guess” of those policies most likely to
be adopted based on recent policy trends. This second group of energy scenarios, which could be
labeled as “expected” or “new policy” scenarios, include projections made by private companies
such as ExxonMobil and BP, as well as IEA’s New Policies scenario. For example, despite
current political uncertainty, ExxonMobil’s Outlook for Energy expects policies in OECD
countries, China, and many other non-OECD countries to place a cost on CO2 emissions of $80,
$30, and $20 per ton by 2040, respectively.

        The third group is a much wider range of alternative policy and technology scenarios,
which take this type of exploration one step further, envisioning a future where political action
and technological capabilities go beyond current trends, plans, and proposals. IEA’s 450
scenario is a useful example, where assumptions are based on the steps necessary to limit
greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere to 450 parts per million of carbon-
dioxide equivalent (ppm CO2-eq). This scenario includes more vigorous climate-related policy
action than is assumed in the New Policies scenario or other major energy outlooks, translating
into significant GHG reductions over the projection period and significant energy system
changes for all of the world’s major economies (IEA 2011a). In addition to the Reference Case,
the EIA also produces a range of alternative scenarios, considering significant variations in
economic growth, oil prices, and implementation of U.S. policy proposals.2

2. World Primary Energy Consumption
       Global primary energy consumption3 is on a path to grow in the range of 30-35 percent
over the next generation, reaching about 700 quadrillion Btu (quads) or 340 MMBD of oil


2 Shell has taken a somewhat different approach to energy scenario development, formulating more complex
scenarios that differ across a number of societal, policy, economic, and technological dimensions. For example, in
the Shell Scramble scenario, “policymakers pay little attention to more efficient energy use until supplies are tight.
Likewise, greenhouse gas emissions are not seriously addressed until there are major climate shocks” (Shell 2009,
2011). In a second Shell scenario, called Blueprints, “growing local actions begin to address the challenges of
economic development, energy security and environmental pollution.” Because the most recent Shell scenarios at
the time of this writing were produced in 2008 and are published at a lesser level of detail, we do not include them in
detail here with more recent projections dating from 2011.
3 Primary energy consumption refers to the direct use at the source, or supply to users without transformation, of
crude energy; that is, energy that has not been subjected to any conversion or transformation process.




                                                               4
equivalent by 2035, including all energy sources (Figure 1 and Table 1).4 Scenarios assuming the
continuance of current policies tend to show significantly higher consumption growth (about 10
percent higher in absolute terms), illustrating the impact of policy on moderating the overall
growth of energy consumption. In contrast, scenarios assuming very substantial reductions in
CO2 emissions along the lines of IEA’s 450 scenario, could limit energy consumption growth to
half that amount (about 16 percent) if pursued.

        Reflecting back historically, this rate of growth is much slower in percentage terms than
in both of the two previous 25-year periods, 1960-1985 (107 percent growth) and 1985-2010 (67
percent growth). In absolute terms, however, a roughly 80 MMBD of oil equivalent increase
from 2010-2035 is only about 20 percent lower than the just over 100 MMBD of oil equivalent
increase from 1985-2010—a period of rapid global growth—and is essentially equal to the 80
MMBD of oil equivalent increase experienced from 1960-1985. All-in-all, while the energy
consumption growth rate is clearly slowing, the absolute magnitude of additional supply that will
be required to meet increased energy needs over the next 25 years is roughly similar to what has
been required over the past two generations. Nonetheless, this increment is on top of an already
sizable consumption base.

2.1    Factors Driving Regional Energy Consumption
        Energy consumption can be decomposed into three factors: population, GDP per capita,
and the energy intensity of economic activity (i.e., energy per unit of GDP). This approach can
be expanded to include carbon emissions, with the addition of a factor for the carbon intensity of
energy.5 Given this relationship, the growth of energy consumption (or carbon emissions) is
directly related to the growth of these constituent factors. This simple relationship is useful for
quickly grasping the underlying factors driving energy consumption, as well as understanding
what may be required to moderate the growth of energy consumption or emissions.

        Policymakers of course tend to promote the growth of per capita income, a key driver of
energy consumption growth. And while population is also a fundamental determinant of
economic activity and energy needs, population dynamics are driven by forces largely outside
the domain of energy markets and policies. Policymakers, the energy industry, and other
stakeholders therefore tend to focus on reducing the last two of these factors—energy intensity
and the emissions intensity of energy—to achieve economic, environmental, and energy security
objectives.

        Current regional differences. Looking regionally, North America and Europe/Eurasia
have significantly higher levels of both income and energy use per person than the rest of the
world, with income per capita at almost two to four times the level of Central/South America and
the Middle East, and four to twelve times the income levels of Asia and Africa (Table 2). Energy
use follows suit, with North America and Europe/Eurasia consuming energy at two to nine times
the per capita level of other regions, excluding the Middle East. Due to its energy-intensive
industrial base and degree of energy price subsidization, the Middle East consumes an unusually
high amount of energy given its stage of overall economic development. Asia contains over half
of the world’s population, and despite the fact that it is still largely developing, accounts for
more than a third of global GDP, primary energy consumption, and carbon emissions.




5 The relationship between these factors and energy consumption (or carbon emissions) is sometimes referred to as
the Kaya Identity. The equation for energy consumption can be written: E = E/GDP × GDP/Pop × Pop. The
extended equation for carbon emissions is: CO2 = CO2/E × E/GDP × GDP/Pop × Pop.

        Regional population growth. A range of scenarios indicate that the growth in these
factors over the next 25 years will be very different across regions. Most projections focus on a
moderate population growth scenario where global population reaches about 8.6 billion by 2035,
or 26 percent higher than 2009 levels. Europe/Eurasia will have the slowest growth, roughly flat
at perhaps 2-4 percent total growth, while population growth in Africa will likely be over 50
percent and potentially as high as 70 percent or 720 million additional people. Similarly,
projections for the Middle East also show population growth of around 50 percent over the next
generation. The Americas and Asia are on a population growth path of perhaps 20-25 percent,
roughly in the middle of the two other regional extremes (EIA 2011a; IEA 2011a). However,
Asia is starting from a much higher population base, adding a projected 725 million people
(similar to Africa) compared to an additional 200 million people in the Americas over the next
25 years. In absolute terms, about 45 percent of global population growth looks likely to occur in
the East (Asia and the Middle East) with another 40 percent of the growth occurring in Africa.
There is, however, significant uncertainty around these moderate population growth figures, and
current U.N. population projections for 2035 range from 8.0 to 9.2 billion—or plus or minus 7
percent compared to the 8.6 billion medium variant (UN 2010).

      Regional GDP growth. A different set of regional patterns emerges when considering
GDP. The major outlooks assume roughly 2.5-fold growth in global GDP from 2010-2035, when
measured in terms of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), or closer to a doubling of GDP when
measured using market exchange rates (MER).6 Across the different outlooks, regional GDP
growth projections over this 25-year period (in PPP terms) are in the range of 70-80 percent for
Europe/Eurasia, 85-95 percent for North America, 150-175 percent for the Middle East and
Africa, and 230-250 percent for Asia (EIA 2011a; ExxonMobil 2012; IEA 2011a). There is a
somewhat greater divergence in views about Central/South America GDP growth (about 130
percent for IEA and ExxonMobil versus 170 percent for EIA).

        In absolute terms, over 60 percent of global income growth appears likely to occur in the
East (Asia and the Middle East), about 30 percent in North America and Europe/Eurasia, and the
remainder in Central/South America and Africa. Uncertainty surrounding the continuance of
rapid growth in emerging economies, especially in Asia, could therefore have significant
consequences for global energy demand moving forward, as it did over the last decade.



6 This difference is largely due to substantially different meaures of Asian GDP growth when measured in PPP
(about 3.5-fold growth) versus MER (about 1.7-fold growth) (EIA 2011; IEA 2011a).




                                                            9
       Regional energy consumption growth. Over the next 25 years, Asia and the Middle East
will experience close to half of the world’s population growth and over 60 percent of its income
growth, forming a potent combination that implies about 70 percent of global energy
consumption growth will occur in the East. All developing regions of the world—Asia, the
Middle East, Africa, and South and Central America—will likely see energy consumption
growth in excess of 40 percent and, in some regions, perhaps by as much as 60-70 percent or
more over the 2010-2035 period.

        Despite the consistency of population and economic growth projections across the major
energy outlooks—as well as the relative regional shares in energy consumption growth—there is
considerable variation in the resulting levels of energy demand. In some cases, this difference is
due to assumptions that current policies remain unchanged—leading to higher consumption
growth across the board (as in the EIA Reference Case and IEA Current Policies scenarios)—or
to assumptions of very stringent climate policy and much lower demand growth, as in the IEA
450 scenario. Carbon emissions tend to closely follow energy consumption estimates, with the
amount depending on assumptions about climate policy.

       However, even among central cases like the IEA New Policies scenario and the
ExxonMobil outlook, there are some considerable differences in energy consumption growth.
Generally speaking, ExxonMobil projects significantly lower energy demand growth, both
globally and for most major regions.7 ExxonMobil’s outlook, for example, has essentially zero
net energy consumption growth in North America and Europe/Eurasia through 2035, and 29
percent growth globally—compared to 33 percent global growth in the IEA New Policies
scenario.

       Energy efficiency and energy intensity. Two main subcomponents tend to determine the
energy intensity of the economy—the energy efficiency of the capital stock (such as vehicles and
equipment) and the overall structure of the economy (such as the relative shares of the
manufacturing and service sectors). As such, reductions in energy intensity can occur both
through energy efficiency improvements and through a shift towards services as a larger share of
economic activity (although at a global level such shifts are offset if manufacturing simply
moves from one location to another).




7The exception is Africa, where ExxonMobil projects higher energy consumption growth than any of the other
major outlooks.




                                                          10
        Trends in the industrial8 share of GDP are useful indicators of energy intensity
differences among countries and where they are headed. For example, 34 percent of U.S. GDP
was associated with industry in 1980, but had declined to 20 percent by 2010. In contrast, the
industrial shares of the economies of India and China have remained relatively steady. China’s
industrial share barely changed from 48 percent in 1980 to 47 percent in 2010, and India’s share
increased moderately from 24 percent to 27 percent during that period (World Bank 2012b).

        Economic projections highlight how countries’ economic structures are likely to evolve
over the next few decades. For instance, macroeconomic forecasts have the industrial share of
U.S. shipments (by value) remaining roughly steady between 2010 and 2035, decreasing only
slightly from approximately 22 percent to 21 percent over that period (EIA 2012a). On the other
hand, recent World Bank (2012a) estimates have the industrial share of GDP for China dropping
to about 35 percent by 2030, compared with 47 percent in 2010.

        Without improvements in energy efficiency and energy intensity, energy consumption
would grow by more than 120 percent globally in the ExxonMobil outlook, for instance, rather
than 30 percent. Even more striking are such differences for the OECD and non-OECD when
considered separately: energy demand is nearly flat in the OECD when expected efficiency and
intensity improvements are included, versus 90 percent growth without these gains. In the non-
OECD, projections show 60 percent versus over 250 percent growth with and without such
developments, respectively (ExxonMobil 2012).

        Potential future regional differences. Regional differences in growth rates will have a
significant impact on the potential future distribution of key energy drivers in 2035; here we use
the IEA New Policies scenario as a central example (Table 3). While North America and
Europe/Eurasia are on track to maintain the highest levels of GDP and energy consumption per
capita, the Middle East, Asia, and South/Central America should experience significant increases
by that time. This is not necessarily the case for Africa, which in most outlooks is assumed to
experience population increases that consume the majority of gains in income growth or
alleviation of energy poverty. The energy intensity of GDP decreases for all regions and for the
world as a whole, indicating continued uptake of energy efficient technologies and a relatively
higher share of services than of manufacturing in economic growth. Finally, all regions show a
decline in the carbon intensity of energy, reflecting the spread of renewables, nuclear power, and


8According to the World Bank definition, industry “comprises value added in mining, manufacturing…,
construction, electricity, water, and gas” (World Bank 2012b).

the potential use of other technologies such as carbon capture and storage (with CCS playing a
greater role in scenarios with substantial CO2 reductions).

2.2   Implications for Regional Trade
         These shifting regional patterns of demand, coupled with changing sources of supply,
have the potential to alter energy trade balances around the world (Figure 2). One striking trend
is the reduction of the energy trade imbalance in North America, with the Americas overall
looking increasingly self-sufficient in energy. Over the next few decades, North America is
likely to close this gap through the combination of two trends: modest consumption growth and,
at the same time, a continued turnaround in supply, due in large part to unconventional sources
of oil and natural gas in Canada and the United States. In contrast, most other regions of the
world become either greater importers or exporters, following historical trends. Net importers are
Europe, China, India, and the rest of Asia Pacific, while the Former Soviet Union, Middle East,
Africa, and South and Central America continue to export increasing quantities of fossil fuels
(the majority of which is oil, with growing levels of natural gas). The need for increased imports
of all types is most acute for China, India, and other Asian countries, although European natural
gas import needs will also continue to climb, especially with the desire to reduce CO2 emissions
and concerns about nuclear power.

3. The Global Energy Mix
        We turn now from overall energy consumption trends to the specific fuels and
technologies that supply these energy needs. The energy mix has important implications for the
economic, environmental, and security performance of the global energy system. It changes
slowly, but it does change. A key focus is often the share of energy supply from fossil fuels—
coal, oil, and natural gas—relative to other energy sources, such as nuclear power, renewable
electricity sources, and biofuels (Table 4). The fossil fuel share provides a high-level indication
of the diversity of the energy system, its dependence on (eventually) exhaustible resources, and
its environmental impact. It of course also signals the continued overall importance of fossil
fuels to the global energy system.

BP are for 2030 rather than 2035. hEIA and BP renewable shares do not include traditional, non-marketed biomass
energy consumption. iEIA (2011a).

        The fossil fuel share of global primary energy actually increased from 76 percent to 82
percent during the period 1960-1985 as the world industrialized, while traditional biomass-based
renewables remained roughly constant in absolute terms and fell as a share. In the subsequent 25
years from 1985-2010, the global fossil share remained constant at 82 percent. Note that
projections from EIA and BP show much higher fossil shares because they do not include non-
marketed biomass in renewables.




                                                            13
        Looking forward, the future share of fossil fuels looks almost certain to decline, with the
magnitude of that decline depending on the stringency of actions to address climate change. In
scenarios assuming climate policy actions along current trends—such as the IEA New Policies
scenario and ExxonMobil outlook—the fossil share falls to 76-79 percent by 2035. In the IEA
450 scenario, the fossil share falls to 63 percent, which—although a very substantial reduction—
signals that even under stringent climate policy scenarios, fossil fuels are likely to remain a
majority share of global energy for at least the next few decades. Despite this focus on fuel
shares, it is also important to keep in mind that—with the exception of ExxonMobil’s outlook
for coal and the IEA 450 scenario for coal and oil—all of the major projections show absolute
increases in the consumption of every fuel, regardless of shifting shares.

3.1   Fuel Shares
       Oil. Turning to specific fuels, while oil consumption rose much more than any other fuel
from 1960 to 1985—from 28 percent to 39 percent of global energy—its share had declined to
34 percent by 2010. The downward trend in oil’s share is set to continue to about 30 percent by
2035, plus or minus 2 percent. As discussed in greater detail below, fuel shares of aggregate
consumption tend to mask the dependence of certain end-use sectors on particular fuels.
Transport stands out as by far the least diverse sector in these terms, with over 95 percent of
world transport energy needs being met by oil and other liquids (EIA 2011a).

        Coal. Despite the maturity of coal as an energy source, its history over the last 25 years is
one of resurgence compared to the period 1960-1985, a time when natural gas and especially oil
expanded rapidly. Although coal’s share in primary energy consumption is now lower than its 37
percent share 50 years ago, coal actually grew more than any other fuel source during 1985-
2010, stabilizing at about 26 percent by the end of that period. Due to its emissions of CO2 and
other pollutants, the future of coal—more than any other fuel—will depend on actions taken to
mitigate climate change and local air pollution. As a result, projections have the coal share
falling to 20-23 percent under recent policy trends, or as low as 15 percent if actions such as
those in IEA’s 450 scenario are undertaken.

        Natural gas. The share of natural gas rose from 11 percent in 1960 to 19 percent in 1985,
and had doubled to 22 percent by 2010; its annual consumption increased almost two-fold during
the 1985-2010 period. Across all major projections, both the share and absolute amount of
natural gas in primary energy consumption remains steady or increases between now and 2035,
particularly in the ExxonMobil outlook where the natural gas share rises to 26 percent.




                                                     14
        Renewables. Renewables include electricity sources—hydroelectric, biomass, wind,
geothermal, and solar—as well as biofuels and traditional non-marketed biomass and waste
fuels. The measured renewable share depends heavily on whether traditional non-marketed
biomass and waste fuels are included (as in IEA and ExxonMobil figures) or whether only
marketed renewables are included (as in EIA and BP figures). Including non-marketed biomass
(which is a significant source at 9 percent of global energy), renewables currently meet about 13
percent of global energy consumption needs, with 4 percent coming from marketed renewables.
Renewables are the fastest growing energy source in percentage terms, and projections suggest
that the total renewables share will increase to 14-18 percent by 2035, or up to 26 percent in
scenarios with dramatic CO2 reductions. The share of marketed renewables could double over
this 25-year period.

        Nuclear. The emergence of nuclear power has been a significant development over the
past half century. Its share of primary energy consumption rose from zero in 1960 to 5 percent of
global energy by 2010, and in most projections will rise to around 6-7 percent by 2035. In
scenarios with very substantial CO2 reductions (e.g., IEA’s 450 scenario), nuclear power
becomes a more competitive source of low-carbon power, resulting in a nuclear share of up to 11
percent—double the current share.

        End-use sector fuel shares and diversity. Fuel shares as a fraction of aggregate
consumption do not highlight differences among end-use sectors—transport,
residential/commercial buildings, and industry—in their dependence on particular fuels, or their
fuel diversity and ability to substitute among alternative options. Given that supply diversity is
an important component of energy security, understanding these connections helps to identify
areas of risk and vulnerability.
         For instance, while the world’s transportation system is fueled almost entirely by liquids
(95 percent), the industrial sector obtains approximately 29 percent, 23 percent, and 26 percent
of its delivered energy directly from oil, natural gas, and coal, respectively—and another 15
percent from electricity, which is itself diversely fueled (EIA 2011a).9 Residential and
commercial buildings also rely on a diversity of fuel sources, including 18 percent, 36 percent, 7
percent of their delivered energy directly from oil, natural gas, and coal, respectively, and 38
percent from electricity (EIA 2011a). The most significant global shift projected for these
sectoral energy shares is for residential and commercial buildings, which are becoming more


9   Note that these shares do not include non-marketed energy consumption.

reliant on electricity (50 percent share in 2035) rather than directly consuming natural gas, oil,
and coal (EIA 2011a). Although the oil share of transport fuel consumption is very likely to
decline, it will continue to serve the vast majority of transport needs for the foreseeable future,
even in scenarios assuming significant policy change and innovation. For example, the oil share
of transport energy consumption falls to 88 percent in IEA’s New Policies scenario, while in the
450 scenario it falls to 76 percent—although biofuels, electricity, and natural gas make greater
inroads into transport, oil maintains its dominance.

       Future emissions of CO2 from fossil energy combustion follow directly from overall
trends in energy consumption, coupled with forecasts of the carbon intensity of the energy mix.
As discussed above, both of these key trends vary widely across future energy projections,
principally as a function of differing assumptions about the path of future energy and
environmental policy. The resulting range of energy-related carbon emissions trajectories is
large, corresponding to the three types of scenarios introduced earlier (Figure 3): (1) at the high
end, scenarios that hold current polices constant (EIA Reference Case and IEA Current Policies);
(2) in the middle, scenarios that assume the addition of new policies along recent policy trends
(ExxonMobil outlook and IEA New Policies); and (3) IEA’s 450 scenario at the low end. For
moderate projections along recent policy trends, global CO2 emissions increase by about 16
percent from 31 billion metric tons annually in 2010 to 36 billion metric tons in 2035. In
contrast, with unchanged current policies, CO2 emissions could rise 40 percent to 43 billion
metric tons. With actions targeting a 450 ppm concentration, emissions would need to fall 30
percent from 2010 levels to under 22 billion metric tons by 2035.

         Distinguishing among regions (Tables 2 and 3), moderate policy scenarios tend to yield
flat or declining emissions in North America and Europe/Eurasia moving forward, but allow for
moderate emissions growth in other regions before leveling off. The IEA New Policies scenario,
for example, has OECD CO2 emissions declining about 10 percent from 2010 levels by 2035,
while non-OECD emissions increase by about 50 percent. In contrast, in the IEA 450 scenario,
OECD emissions must decline 50 percent and non-OECD emissions by 10 percent from 2010
levels, together achieving a 30 percent reduction in total global emissions.

       To understand how these different energy projections relate to climate impacts, it is
informative to draw from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which has
produced a set of emissions scenarios and likely associated temperature changes (Figure 4).
These scenarios make it clear that to map energy and emissions to climate impacts, one must

look well beyond the next 25 years, as it is the long-term stock of greenhouse gases that really
matters.

Notes: Data sources are EIA (2011a), ExxonMobil (2012), IEA (2011a), and IEA (2011b). Historical data from IEA
use the Reference Approach to estimating emissions.

        Nonetheless, moderate policy scenarios that have emissions peaking globally within the
next 25 years (e.g., the ExxonMobil outlook)—assuming that emissions decline gradually
thereafter—correspond roughly to IPCC emission scenario group III and an atmospheric CO2
concentration of 550-600 ppm CO2-equivalent. The IPCC’s best estimate of the associated global
mean temperature increase is about 3-3.5ºC (5.5-6.5ºF), with a likely range of 2-5ºC (3.5-9ºF).
For the IEA 450 scenario to actually achieve 450 ppm (and a 2ºC expected temperature target),
post-2035 emissions would need to fall faster than shown in the most stringent emission scenario
in Figure 4. On the other hand, if new policies do not further restrain CO2 emissions from
business-as-usual trends, CO2 concentrations would tend toward 700 ppm CO2-equivalent or
greater.

4. Electricity
        Electricity represents close to 40 percent of worldwide primary energy consumption, a
role that will be increasing going forward. In terms of end-use energy consumption, electricity is
growing much faster than direct use of fuels. Given the importance of electricity to the energy
system, it is important to consider the current role of different fuels and technologies for
electricity generation, and how that fuel mix may change in the future. In 2010, the global
electricity generation mix was 41 percent coal, 22 percent natural gas, 16 percent hydro, 13
percent nuclear, 5 percent oil, and 4 percent other renewables including wind, biomass/waste,
geothermal, and solar (IEA 2012b).

        As with overall energy consumption, electricity generation has risen substantially over
time and such increases will continue (Figure 5). In addition to population and income growth,
how much electricity consumption grows will depend in part on the extent to which future
policies: (1) encourage energy conservation through efficiency programs, and (2) reduce carbon
emissions through pricing or other means. As shown in Figure 5, global electricity generation is
on a path to grow about 80 percent by 2035, plus or minus about 10 percent depending on future
policy developments (IEA 2011a; EIA 2011a; ExxonMobil 2012). Over the longer term,
widespread electrification of the transportation sector has the potential to dramatically impact the
consumption of electricity, the fuels and technologies for generating electricity, and the use of oil




                                                           18
for transport. Research indicates, however, that the vast majority of such changes—if they were
to unfold—are likely to occur after our 25-year time horizon.10


     Figure 5: Electricity Continues to Grow, with Generation Sources Depending on Fuel
                   Prices, Environmental Policy, and Technology Innovation




Note: East is comprised of Asia and the Middle East, while West is the rest of the world. Data is from IEA (2011a).

        The trend of increasing electricity demand holds for both the East (Asia and the Middle
East) and the West (the rest of the world), though in 2009 the East was just approaching the
electricity generation levels the West had reached in 1990. Looking forward, growth of
electricity consumption will be much faster in the East than in the West, with the East growing


10 For example, EIA (2012a) includes a High Technology Battery case that explores the effects of battery
technology breakthroughs and the use of electric vehicles. In this scenario, significant improvements in technology
help to reduce vehicle battery costs for consumers, which in turn lead to greater sales of electric vehicles (24 percent
of new light-duty vehicle sales in 2035 versus 8 percent in the Reference case). However, turnover of the entire
light-duty vehicle fleet is slow, and although the resulting reduction in U.S. liquids consumption in 2035 is
measurable, it is modest at about 400 thousand barrels per day.




                                                               19
2.4-fold while the West grows about 40 percent by 2035. The East will likely surpass the West in
terms of absolute electricity generation by the 2020-2025 period.

        Another divergence between East and West is the anticipated amount of coal use for
electricity generation. While coal consumption is likely to be roughly flat or declining in the
West, it could increase dramatically in the East unless policies inhibit its expansion. In both
major regions, generation from hydro, other renewables, and nuclear power is set to rise, and
especially so if ambitious climate policies unfold. Natural gas for electric power generation is
likely to continue to increase in every region, due to its low air emissions compared to coal,
attractive construction cost profile, and (particularly recently) reasonable fuel prices. It’s only
under substantial carbon reduction scenarios (e.g., the IEA 450 scenario) that natural gas power
in the West would decline, although it increases in the East under all three of IEA’s scenarios.
Finally, the role for oil in electricity generation is set to diminish regardless of the region or
scenario. We further consider coal, nuclear, and renewable electricity briefly below—all energy
sources used largely or exclusively for the production of electricity.

4.1   Coal
        It is striking that total coal consumption grew by about the same amount (roughly 50
quadrillion Btu) in the first decade of the 21st century as it did over the last four decades of the
20th century, 1960-2000 (Figure 6). In fact, coal grew more than any other energy source and
comprised almost half of the total growth in global energy use during 2000-2010, with the major
part of this growth being for the power sector in emerging economies. The global coal share of
electricity generation stood at 41 percent in 2010, almost twice the size of the next largest fuel
for electricity, natural gas (IEA 2012b). We do not, however, expect this dramatic upward trend
to continue. Even scenarios assuming no new policies that would inhibit coal—and therefore
representing the highest projected coal consumption—have coal growth rates that are
significantly less than that seen during 2000-2010.

         Under current trends, it seems likely that coal consumption will continue to grow but then
level off within the next couple of decades. How much global coal consumption grows, exactly
when it levels off, and whether, when, and how fast it starts to decline will depend heavily on
ongoing developments in environmental policy (both conventional pollution and CO2) and the
availability of substitute electricity sources at reasonable cost. With a moderate to stringent cost
applied to carbon emissions, coal consumption would decline substantially, as illustrated by the
ExxonMobil and IEA 450 scenarios (where, for example, coal declines by one-third from 2010
levels).

4.2    Renewables
        Renewable electricity sources—such as hydro, wind, biomass11, geothermal, and solar—
have the advantage of negligible air emissions and fuel operating costs, and have been the fastest
growing part of the energy mix in percentage terms, albeit from a relatively small base. Due to
their higher capital costs, however, renewable sources remain relatively expensive on average
compared to fossil-fuel alternatives. In 2010, renewables comprised about 20 percent of global
electricity generation, the vast majority of which (16 percent) was hydro, and the remainder other


11 When biomass is combusted it releases emissions, but CO2 is also removed from the atmosphere during biomass
gowth. Ongoing research is investigating the full life-cycle emissions of biofuels and their potential impacts on
climate change. The typical accounting protocol used in projections is to assume biomass has net zero CO2
emissions.




                                                            21
renewables (2 percent wind, 1.4 percent biomass, 0.3 percent geothermal, and 0.3 percent solar).
Renewable sources are favored to the extent that clean energy, diversification, and climate
change mitigation is a priority. As an illustration, the share of renewable electricity generation by
2035 in IEA’s Current Policies, New Policies, and 450 scenarios grows to 23 percent, 30 percent,
and 46 percent, respectively.

         Although all major analyses see the share of renewables in the energy mix growing,
policies to promote the use of renewables for electricity generation— particularly in the form of
subsidies—have been a critical factor in driving renewables growth given their cost relative to
fossil fuels. For example, in IEA’s New Policies scenario, cumulative renewable subsidies total
almost $5 trillion between 2011 and 2035, with nearly $250 billion in 2035 alone (IEA 2011a).
Government fiscal constraints in the wake of the great recession could pose a mounting
challenge to renewables subsidies, potentially leading to alternative support mechanisms
including mandates and/or carbon pricing. Continued cost reductions and mechanisms to address
intermittency through energy storage, demand-side management, market structures, and/or
smarter transmission networks are also crucial to continued growth in renewables.

4.3   Nuclear
       The nuclear share of electricity generation stood at 13 percent in 2010 (IEA 2012b), and
world nuclear capacity and generation are expected to increase significantly over the next several
decades. In IEA’s New Policies scenario, nuclear power generation rises 70 percent and nuclear
capacity rises from 375 GW in 2010 to over 630 GW by 2035, and more so with more stringent
CO2 policies (IEA 2011a; IEA 2012b). Similarly, ExxonMobil’s outlook anticipates 80 percent
growth in nuclear capacity by 2040, though as with other sources, this growth rate is lower than
ExxonMobil’s prior estimates due to effects of the Fukushima incident (ExxonMobil 2012).
Following this trend, although the IEA’s World Energy Outlook 2012 still includes substantial
global growth in nuclear capacity, the total for 2035 is 50 GW (8 percent) lower in the 2012
edition as compared to the 2011 edition of the World Energy Outlook (IEA 2012d).

        These global trends can, however, overshadow differences among countries and regions.
For example, between 2009 and 2035 in IEA’s New Policies scenario, more than 40 percent of
global nuclear capacity growth takes place in China alone. This scenario projects substantial
increases in other developing countries as well, such as two-thirds and ten-fold growth in Russia
and India, respectively. In contrast, much of the capacity additions in the OECD are to replace
retiring plants, leading to total OECD nuclear capacity growth of only 16 percent over this period
(IEA 2011a). In the 2012 IEA update, OECD nuclear capacity is basically level (IEA 2012d).



                                                     22
        As mentioned previously, the incident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station in
Japan has had definite and potentially long-lasting impacts on the role for nuclear in the global
energy mix. A number of countries are reviewing their nuclear programs, reducing capacity,
and/or completely phasing out the use of nuclear energy. In an effort to explore the ramifications
of a world with lower nuclear supply, the IEA developed the Low Nuclear Case, which assumes:
no new reactors in OECD countries, 50 percent lower capacity additions in non-OECD countries
than the New Policies scenario, and somewhat shorter average lifetimes of nuclear reactors (IEA
2011a).

       These modifications result in several notable outcomes. The first is that world nuclear
capacity decreases by 15 percent over the projection period, rather than rising 60 percent.
Instead, electricity demand is met by an additional 80 GW of coal-fired capacity, 122 GW of
additional natural gas electricity generation, and 260 GW of additional renewables capacity (IEA
2011a). Moreover, in a future both with stringent climate goals and with restricted generation
from nuclear sources, the required contribution from renewables, energy efficiency, and carbon
capture and storage would be even more significantly increased.

5. Petroleum and Other Liquids
         Petroleum and other liquids have been an essential source of energy for a variety of
reasons, including their high energy density, transportability, and thus especially for
transportation applications. Looking forward, demand for oil and other liquids is likely to
continue growing—albeit it at a slower pace—and will remain the world’s largest energy source
for the foreseeable future. With at least three-fourths of that growth occurring in emerging
economies of the East, petroleum trade will be shifting eastward. At the same time, while
OPEC’s share of supply will almost surely increase, the emergence of unconventional liquids
(e.g., oil sands and biofuels) and tight oil is moderating that trend. Coupled with low demand
growth, these supply dynamics are pushing North America, in particular, toward net balance in
liquids supply and demand over the next 20-25 years or so.

5.1   Liquids Demand
        Global consumption of petroleum and other liquids is on a path to grow to roughly 105-
110 MMBD by 2035, or 15-20 MMBD higher than current levels of around 90 MMBD. With the
exception of IEA’s 450 scenario, all major projections show world oil consumption increasing
over the next several decades by 20 percent or more compared to 2010 levels (Table 5). In both
absolute and percentage terms, however, the growth of oil consumption is slowing compared to
the previous two generations.


                                                   23
        The upward trend in world oil consumption also masks very different outlooks for the
West and East (Table 5 and Figure 7). While oil consumption in the West has historically been
much higher than in the East, projections across a range of scenarios indicate that by 2030-2035
they will have equalized. Rising population and GDP per capita in the East are leading to greater
consumption of all energy sources, including an approximately 50 percent increase in liquids
consumption over the next 25 years. In contrast, it appears that the West is close to reaching a
plateau in oil demand—or “peak oil demand”—a threshold that OECD countries as a block
probably passed in 2005. The flattening of oil consumption in advanced industrialized countries
is due to a combination of saturated demand for transportation services, government regulation
of automotive fuel economy, and higher fuel prices. As a result, the vast majority of oil growth
will be for transport in the emerging economies of the East, where vehicle ownership currently
stands at about one-tenth or less of the level in OECD countries.

5.2    Oil Resources and Liquids Supply
         Worldwide recoverable oil resources12 (both proved and unproved) currently stand at 5
trillion barrels or more, split roughly equally between conventional sources and unconventional
sources, the latter including extra-heavy oil, tar sands (bitumen) and oil shale (kerogen) (IEA
2011a; ExxonMobil 2012). When conventional and unconventional resources are considered
together, North America contains the most by far (over 2 trillion barrels, including bitumen and
kerogen). Focusing on conventional resources, the Middle East ranks highest—with well over 1
trillion barrels of proved reserves or other potentially recoverable conventional oil.

       Worldwide proved oil reserves13 tell a somewhat different story, however, and stand at
about 1.5 trillion barrels; 73 percent of it in OPEC countries, 52 percent in the Middle East, 14


12 Recoverable resources include volumes that are judged likely to be ultimately producible, including proved
reserves, future reserves growth, and as yet undiscovered resources.
13 Proved oil reserves are the subset of oil resources that have been demonstrated with reasonable certainty (often
taken to be 90 percent) to be recoverable under existing economic and operating conditions.




                                                              25
percent in North America, and less than 2 percent in the United States (EIA 2012b). Concerns
about the physical availability of global oil resources are therefore largely misplaced.
Nonetheless, there are significant above-ground issues associated with the location and
governance of available conventional reserves, as well as technical, financial, environmental, and
political challenges to the development of much of the unconventional resource base.

        Given the global distribution of oil reserves, it is not surprising that most projections
foresee an increasing production share for OPEC (Tables 6 and 7). OPEC’s share of supply stood
at 40 percent in 2010 (the same as when it was formed in 1960), but is likely to increase to 45-50
percent over the next couple of decades.14 The OPEC members of the Gulf Cooperation
Council—Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and Qatar—constitute about half of
OPEC’s production, a similar share of its incremental production potential, and hold all available
spare crude oil production capacity. The strategic importance of these countries is apparent.

        There is a range of potential country-level sources to supply a global liquids market of
100 to as much as 115 MMBD if demanded (Table 7). The IEA has a stagnant outlook for non-
OPEC liquids supply, but most other forecasts still see the potential for increased non-OPEC
production. The distribution of production between OPEC and non-OPEC countries, and among
countries within these blocks, will depend on market prices; country-level energy and
environmental policy and fiscal regimes; the degree of political and military conflict; and as yet
unknown technological innovations and resource discoveries. Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the United
States, Canada, Brazil, and Venezuela hold the greatest potential for incremental liquids
production.




14For several reasons—most notably the energy crises of the 1970’s, subsequent increases in non-OPEC
production, and the resulting oil surplus of the 1980’s—OPEC’s share was much lower through the 1980’s than it
was either before or after that decade.

       Most unconventional production will occur in non-OPEC countries, with major sources
including Canada (oil sands) and the United States (biofuels and possibly coal-, gas-, and/or
biomass-to-liquids), as well as China (biofuels, coal-to-liquids) and Brazil (biofuels) (Table 7).
The exception is Venezuelan extra heavy oil, which has substantial production potential if the
country can overcome significant financial, technical, and political hurdles to its development.
Tight oil is also an increasingly important supply source in the United States. We consider North
American oil production specifically in more detail below.

5.3    North American Oil Production
        North America has the potential to significantly increase its oil production over the next
several decades, particularly through use of its unconventional resources. A 2011 study by the
National Petroleum Council (NPC)15 on North American oil and gas resources provides a
comprehensive distillation of recent developments (NPC 2011). The study concluded that the
potential oil and natural gas supply in North America is larger than previously thought, and in

15The National Petroleum Council is a federal advisory committee whose sole purpose is to advise, inform, and
make recommendations on oil and natural gas at the request of the Secretary of Energy.




                                                                28
the case of gas, much larger. Importantly, the study also found that realizing the benefits of these
resources will depend on “safe, responsible, and environmentally acceptable production and
delivery…” (NPC 2011, p. 8).

        The United States is the world’s third largest oil producer, following Saudi Arabia and
Russia (Table 7). Including Canada and Mexico—the sixth and seventh largest producers,
respectively—North America produced almost 20 percent of global liquids in 2010. Looking
forward, increased production in the United States and Canada should more than offset continued
declines in Mexico, with total increases of as much as 50 percent on the high side over the next
two to three decades. Coupled with a flattening of liquids consumption growth, these production
increases are putting North America on a path towards net self-sufficiency in liquids by 2035.
This view has been reinforced by all of the major energy outlooks.

        The turnaround in U.S. liquids production began in 2007 after a more than thirty-year
slide, and now stands at its highest level in twenty years. As a result, the United States, Saudi
Arabia, and Russia are now roughly on par as the world’s largest producers of liquids, and
appear likely to maintain similar production levels going forward. The largest U.S. gains have
come from onshore production in the lower-48 states, through the application of advanced
techniques such as enhanced oil recovery and horizontal drilling/hydraulic fracturing technology
transferred from the shale gas experience. Development of shale and other tight oil has expanded
rapidly in formations such as the Bakken (North Dakota and Montana) and Niobrara (Colorado
and Wyoming), as well as the liquids-rich areas of shale gas plays, such as the Eagle Ford
(Texas). The rapid learning and deployment of technologies for extracting shale gas have not
been fully transferred to oil opportunities yet, and so it is difficult to predict how expansive these
opportunities will be. On the high side, tight oil could contribute as much as 3 MMBD to North
American production by 2035 (NPC 2011).

        In addition to tight oil, natural gas liquids production has expanded along with the
substantial growth in dry gas production from shale gas, and could contribute as much as 3
MMBD to U.S. (EIA 2012a) and 4 MMBD to North American liquids supply (NPC 2011). U.S.
biofuels have been another source of growth in liquids, driven by federal and state tax credits, the
federal Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), and high oil prices. Already close to 1 MMBD,
production of ethanol and other biofuels could potentially double over the next generation,
depending on commercialization of advanced biofuels production techniques and the stability of
the U.S. federal RFS mandates (EIA 2012a).

        Potentially the largest growth in North American petroleum production over the next
quarter-century could come from unconventional Canadian oil sands (i.e., bitumen). Production


                                                     29
from Albertan oil sands stood at 1.6 MMBD in 2011, and could more than triple to 5 MMBD by
2035, including both surface mining and in situ production processes (National Energy Board
2011). Whether oil sands production develops to this extent will depend upon world oil prices
(given its relatively high cost), and the degree to which local environmental impacts and
concerns related to CO2 emissions can or must be addressed. In any event, most major
projections of future liquids supply assume that Canadian oil sands production will expand along
this path.

6. Natural Gas
        In terms of prospective production, consumption, and trade, no other major fuel source
has seen as much change as natural gas over the past decade. In fact, 2005 marked a turning
point for U.S. natural gas production due to the shale gas revolution, and the ripple effects of this
transformation are still unfolding in North America and around the world. This includes the
impact of unconventional gas development on supply diversity, global LNG markets (and
potential North American LNG exports), and long-term contracts, particularly their relationship
to spot natural gas prices and the price of oil.

        Along current policy, market, and technology trends, there is likely to be a substantial
increase in world natural gas consumption (of at least 45 percent) between 2010 and 2035 (Table
8). Aside from scenarios with rapid CO2 reductions (e.g., IEA’s 450 scenario), gas consumption
in the West is set to grow 20-30 percent between 2010 and 2035, while corresponding total
growth in the East is expected to be much higher, about 90-110 percent or roughly double. Under
more stringent CO2 reduction efforts, natural gas consumption would grow much more slowly,
but it would likely still grow—in contrast to oil which shows zero growth and coal which
substantially declines in such projections (e.g., IEA’s 450 scenario).

6.1    Regional Gas Consumption
        A number of factors will combine to produce significant changes in the international gas
landscape over the next several decades. Although demand is likely to increase in all major
regions, the supply sources for each region vary significantly. Figure 8 illustrates ExxonMobil’s
outlook of how regional natural gas consumption growth will be supplied over the 2010-2040
period. Other projections from IEA and BP depict qualitatively similar dynamics, although
quantitative comparisons are difficult given available data. While the Middle East and Africa
will be able to support the vast majority of their additional gas needs through local conventional
production, Latin America and especially North America will turn increasingly to local
unconventional sources of natural gas—in part to offset declining conventional supplies. In
contrast, while the Asia Pacific region is also likely to turn to local unconventional sources, it
will also need increments in LNG and pipeline imports of an even larger magnitude to meet its
burgeoning demand growth. There is significant uncertainty about whether Asian unconventional
gas will grow to levels seen in North America. The composition of additional gas supply needs
in Europe looks similar to Asia, albeit at a more modest scale. The increasing importance of
unconventional gas and of LNG as a viable way to transport natural gas from producing to
consuming regions stands out as a key element of this unfolding picture.

6.2   North American Unconventional Gas Development
        The United States is now the world’s largest producer of natural gas and in combination
with Canada, accounts for 25 percent of global production. The turnaround in U.S. gas
production is due to the application of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques to
shale gas deposits. Shale gas development took on significant scale in the Barnett (Texas) in the
early 2000s and accelerated significantly around 2007. Shale gas drilling then expanded rapidly
to the Fayetteville (Arkansas), Woodford (Oklahoma), Haynesville (Louisiana and Texas), and
Marcellus (Pennsylvania and West Virginia) shales. As prices dropped in reaction to this
dramatic supply shift, production began to focus more on the liquids-rich deposits of the Eagle
Ford (Texas) and Bakken (North Dakota) shales, where output could be sold into liquids markets
at price multiples several times higher than for dry gas.

        As a result of these developments, U.S. shale gas production increased 13-fold, from 2
billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in 2005 to 26 bcfd by the middle of 2012, and now comprises
over 30 percent of U.S. dry gas production. U.S. natural gas proved reserves grew 50 percent
from 2005 to 2010 and now stand at their highest levels ever (EIA 2012c). Estimates of
technically recoverable gas resources (proved and unproved) have in turn been updated, and
stand at about 2,203 trillion cubic feet (EIA 2012a)—a natural gas resource base that could
support supply for five or more decades at current or even greatly expanded levels of use (NPC


                                                     32
2011). Canada and Mexico also have significant shale gas deposits, with the Bakken extending
up into Canada and continuing into the Colorado Group.

       The greater availability of supply sources that are producible at competitive prices has led
to a much more positive outlook for future U.S. natural gas production, with current projections
placing shale gas at about 50 percent of U.S. dry gas production by 2035 (EIA 2012a). Natural
gas has also become the favored fuel for new electric power capacity additions, as well as current
dispatch, due to current low prices and expectations of continued low to moderate price levels for
many years. Low conventional air pollutant emissions, and CO2 emissions half the level from
coal-based power, add to the appeal of natural gas relative to coal.

        At the same time, the rapid expansion of shale gas production has brought with it
significant public concerns about environmental impact on water and air resources, particularly
in regions where there has not recently been a significant oil and gas industry presence. While
this has not resulted in a significant slowdown in U.S. shale gas production in major producing
regions, environmental rules have been strengthened in many places, and some countries (e.g.,
France and Bulgaria) have banned hydraulic fracturing altogether. Several reports, including
some from the Secretary of Energy’s Advisory Board (2011), the IEA (2012a), and the National
Petroleum Council (2011), have made recommendations for continuously improving the
environmental performance of shale gas extraction using hydraulic fracturing techniques, and for
ensuring the public’s confidence that it is safe.

        For example, the IEA (2012a) put forward a set of “Golden Rules” in seven high-level
categories: measure, disclose and engage; watch where you drill; isolate wells and prevent leaks;
treat water responsibly; eliminate venting, minimize flaring and other emissions; be ready to
think big; and ensure a consistently high level of environmental performance. While many
companies already follow most of these recommendations, the IEA estimated that applying these
rules across the board could increase the overall financial cost of developing a typical shale-gas
well by an estimated 7 percent (IEA 2102b). While not trivial, this is not a substantial enough
cost hurdle to significantly impede future shale gas development, were environmental
compliance costs to rise in response to increased regulation.

6.3   Unconventional Gas Implications for Exports and the International Gas
      Market
        Another implication of the shale gas boom is that the United States has moved from a
position of declining production and increasing imports to one where developers are moving
forward with plans to export LNG. In fact, the same LNG import and regasification terminals
that were reopened or constructed in the mid-to-late 2000s are now seeking to export LNG to


                                                    33
take advantage of the substantial price differentials between U.S. spot prices and delivered LNG
prices abroad. Natural gas prices are more than double into Europe and four times as high in
Asia, compared to the United States. While there is still considerable uncertainty over the timing
and magnitude of U.S. exports—which hinge both on permit approvals as well as project
financing—LNG exports from the lower-48 states could begin as soon as 2016, with the U.S.
becoming a net natural gas exporter soon after 2020 if current trends persist (EIA 2012a).

         Domestic benefits of such exports include economic growth, job creation, and the supply
stability that would come from an additional demand outlet for currently oversupplied U.S.
natural gas markets. Internationally, the availability of North American supply sources would
also have a dampening effect on prices abroad, and could further encourage the de-linking of
long-term natural gas contract prices that are directly tied to the price of oil. Increased U.S. gas
production has already redirected LNG shipments (originally meant to satisfy U.S. demand) to
the Atlantic and Pacific Basins, thereby loosening international LNG markets.

        Shale gas deposits are also not limited to North America, and substantial resources are
thought to exist in China, Argentina, Australia, Europe and other countries (EIA 2011b). While
commercial development of these resources is still at an early stage, it has the potential to
significantly shake up international gas market dynamics, and upset the previously growing
influence of Russia and other large natural gas exporters on international gas markets. Russia,
Iran, and Qatar alone collectively contain over 50 percent of world proved gas reserves, and
members of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum,16 formed in 2001, together control close to 70
percent of proved gas reserves and over one-third of production (EIA 2012b).

        The main potential stumbling block to U.S. export permit approvals is the possible
impact of gas exports on domestic natural gas prices, which would be negligible for small export
amounts, but would be more sizable if the full amount of export capacity for which approval has
been sought was actually built. As of late 2012, applications had been submitted for over 20 bcfd
of natural gas export capacity, but only one project (Sabine Pass, for up to 2.2 bcfd) had received
the necessary approvals from both the Department of Energy and the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission. While 2.2 bcfd is only 3 percent of current U.S. natural gas consumption, 20 bcfd
is equal to a 30 percent share of the same. Any price increases associated with natural gas




16GECF member countries are Algeria, Bolivia, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Iran, Libya, Nigeria, Oman, Qatar,
Russia, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela.

exports would of course be self-moderated by reduced demand for such exports on world
markets, as well as encouragement of new supply sources in response to the higher prices.

7. Conclusion
        Many aspects of the global energy outlook look similar to the past, but there is also
significant movement afoot. Although the energy system evolves slowly due to the very large
and long-lasting installed capital base, it does change and sometimes it changes faster than we
expect. While energy consumption continues to grow, it is growing at a slower rate as energy
continues to decouple from economic growth, due to structural transformation in the economy
and technological improvements in energy efficiency. Fossil fuels will continue to dominate the
energy mix, but their share is falling, and for the first time the absolute level of some fossil fuels
looks ready to plateau and then potentially decline. Coal and oil are each already at or near their
peak consumption in the West, and global coal consumption may level off and then decrease
over the next two to three decades if polices unfold as expected.

       As a result of this changing outlook for energy consumption and how it is fueled, major
long-term energy projections are starting to foresee global CO2 emissions flattening out by 2030-
2040 if policy trends persist, rather than rising inexorably. These projections incorporate
substantial energy efficiency improvements, continued policy supports for renewable energy,
sizable growth in nuclear power, and an explicit or implicit cost on CO2 emissions rising to
significant levels in both OECD and non-OECD countries. If climate change and other
environmental risks are to be given more weight, even more will need to be done. On the other
hand, if these technology and policy changes do not unfold as expected, future energy
consumption and emissions could be much higher.

        The locus of demand growth has shifted strongly eastward, and is pulling with it the
attention of project investment, equipment sales, trading relationships, policymakers, and
geopolitical strategists. The capital equipment side of both energy production (e.g., electricity
generation technology) and use (e.g., vehicle technology) has emerged as a strategic economic
issue. Regarding global trade in fuels, while many regions look set to continue along historical
trends—with the Middle East, Africa, and Former Soviet Union exporting increasing amounts to
an increasingly import-dependent Europe and Asia—North America is undergoing a historic
shift. The dramatic turnaround in oil and gas production coupled with moderate energy
consumption growth has placed North America on a path to net balance in fuels over the next 20-
25 years. The application of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing technology to shale gas
and oil plays is having a long-term impact on the U.S. outlook that is still unfolding, while



                                                      35
Canada’s vast oil sands hold both a tremendous resource as well as a formidable environmental
challenge.

        These North American developments will continue to have global impacts and open up
opportunities for market innovation and project development, while at the same time challenging
existing relationships and structures. Although these North American energy dynamics will have
clear benefits to the United States and Canada in terms of trade, economic development, and
employment, they do not alone guarantee energy security. North America will continue to be
deeply connected to the global oil market regardless of how much oil is produced locally, and
may become more connected to the global natural gas market. Those markets will continue to be
subject to both the beneficial effects of diverse supply sources and trade, as well as the adverse
influences of strategic actions by states and supply disruptions associated with political and
military unrest.

        From an environmental point of view, the rise of unconventionals brings with it both
near-term opportunities as well as significant long-term challenges. Abundant, low-price natural
gas can make it significantly easier to phase out more polluting, conventional, coal-based electric
power—a trend that is now happening in some cases due purely to market forces. However, all
types of energy production bring their own environmental impacts and, over the longer-term,
greater abundance of fossil fuels will increase the need for either ways to mitigate fossil
emissions (such as carbon capture and storage) or for low-cost alternatives. Private and public
innovative effort will therefore continue to be essential. At the same time, the strong incentive to
develop these ample unconventional resources raises an equally strong imperative to do so in a
manner that continuously lowers the environmental footprint of their production and use.

        In the context of this global energy outlook, energy security can be enhanced by the key
market conditions of diverse, competitive energy trade, proper pricing of energy including
environmental impacts, and incentives for a robust energy distribution network. Reducing
exposure to energy risks through energy efficiency, diversifying options through research and
development of alternative fuels and technologies, and insuring against disruptions through wise
use of strategic reserves and spare production capacity can also improve energy security. From
the perspective of private planning and investment, the ongoing transformation of the energy
system will open up new demand, supply, and arbitrage opportunities, as well as present
substantial uncertainties in policy, technology, and market dynamics that will require robust
investment and hedging approaches.
