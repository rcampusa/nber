   The Fisher Hypothesis and the Forecastability and Persistence of Inflation




                                              ABSTRACT




     For the period 1860 to 1939, the simple correlation of the U.S. commercial paper rate with the
contemporaneous inflation rate is -.17. The corresponding correlation for the period 1950 to 1979 is
.71. Inflation evolved from essentially a white noise process in the pre-World War I years to a highly
persistent, nonstationary ARIMA process in the post-1960 period. I argue that the appearance of
an ex post Fisher effect for the first time after 1960 reflects this change in the stochastic process of
inflation, rather than a change in any structural relationship between nominal rates and expected
inflation. I find little evidence of inflation non-neutrality in data from the gold standard period.
This contradicts the conclusion of a frequently cited study by Lawrence Summers, who examined
the low frequency relationship between inflation and interest rates using band spectrum regression.
Deriving and implementing a frequency domain version of the Theil misspecification theorem, I
find that neither high frequency nor low frequency movements in gold standard inflation rates were
forecastable. Thus even if nominal rates responded fully to expected inflation, one would expect to
find the zero coefficient obtained by Summers.

     The Fisher hypothesis, which states that nominal interest rates rise point—for—point with ex-

pected inflation, leaving the real rate unaffected, is one of the cornerstones of neoclassical monetary

theory. Yet prior to World War II, there is essentially no evidence of the Fisher effect in data from

Britain or the United States (see e.g. Friedman and Schwartz, 1976, 1982; Summers, 1983). For

the period 1860 to 1939, the simple correlation of the U.S. three month commercial paper rate with

the ex post inflation rate over the horizon of the bill is -.17. The corresponding correlation for the

period 1950 to 1979 is .71.

     This essay has three purposes. The first is to explain why data from the post—World War II

period (particularly post—1960) look more "Fisherian" (in the sense of displaying a high correlation

between short—term nominal interest rates and measured inflation or proxies for expected inflation)

than do the pre—war data. I find that one can do better than the argument that the financial

markets only gradually "learned their Fisher" (Friedman and Schwartz, 1976; 1982). This essay

emphasizes, instead, the widely divergent serial correlation (in particular, persistence) properties of
inflation under different monetary regimes. Inflation evolved from essentially a white noise process

in the pre—Worid War I years, to a highly persistent, nonstationary ARIMA process in the post—

1960 period. I argue that the appearance of an ex post Fisher effect for the first time after 1960

reflects this change in the stochastic process of inflation, rather than a change in any structural

relationship between nominal rates and expected inflation.

    The second focus of this essay is the possible non—neutrality of inflation vis a vis the real

interest rate. Especially prior to World War II, there is a drastic negative relationship between the

realized inflation rate and the ex post real commercial paper rate. Does such a negative relationship

carry over to the ex ante real rate? Mishkin (1981) reports that, in data from 1930 to 1980, high

lagged inflation systematically predicts a significantly lower ex post real rate, which under rational

expectations also implies that the ex ante real rate is negatively correlated with past inflation.

Extending Mishkin's analysis to the pre—1930 period (especially the gold standard years prior to
                                                  1
1913), I find no such correlation in these earlier years. Interestingly, the gold standard years, which

look by far the least Fisherian in regression studies of the relation between inflation and nominal

interest rates (e.g. Summers, 1983), also show the least evidence of inflation non—neutrality. The

postwar period, which shows much evidence of the Fisher effect (Friedman and Schwartz, 1982;

Cagan, 1984) also indicates a strong negative relationship between inflation and the expected

real return on short—term financial instruments. An important methodological conclusion is that

attempting to estimate the response of nominal interest rates to inflation may not be the most

reliable approach to studying whether expected inflation lowers real rates or whether financial

markets exhibit inflation illusion.

    I find little evidence of the non—neutrality of inflation in data from the gold standard period.

This contradicts the conclusion of a frequently cited study by Summers (1983), which examines the

relationship between interest rates and inflation using band spectral regression. My third goal in this

essay is to understand the discrepancy between my inference and that of Summers (1983), and to

challenge the validity of Summers' conclusions. To a large extent, this argument follows easily from

the previous sections of the paper. Inflation in this early period was very nearly white noise, so that

the variance of anticipated inflation was very small relative to the variance of realized inflation. This

would lead to a massive errors—in—variables problem in ordinary least squares regression, causing

the investigator to conclude incorrectly that interest rates failed to respond to expected inflation.

However, the question remains whether or not band filtering the data, leaving only low frequency

components, alleviates the problem because "low frequency variations in the rate of inflation are

almost completely forecastable, so the assumption that expected inflation can be proxied by actual

inflation is warranted" (Summers, 1983, p. 216).
    McCallum (1984) shows that low frequency estimation is not in general robust against mis-

specification of the distinction between anticipated and unanticipated movements in the regressors,

but gives no indication of the empirical importance of his critique. I show that data on interest

                                                   2
rates and inflation from the pre—Worid War I period in the United States represent a particularly

unfortunate confrontation between McCallum's general problem and the stochastic environment.

Deriving and implementing a frequency domain version of the Theil misspeciflcation theorem, I

find that the covariance between anticipated and cx post inflation displays no tendency to increase

(relative to the variance of inflation) as the frequency is lowered.

     The plan of this essay is as follows. Section I examines the serial correlation, persistence and

forecastability of inflation in the several subperiods, and their implications for the Fisher effect

under a limited information version of rational expectations. Section II applies the Mishkin (1981)

approach to the study of real interest rates and inflation in an attempt to answer the question of

whether periods of generally higher inflation rates were associated with a lower cx ante real interest

rate. Section III tests (and does not reject) the hypothesis that, despite the markedly different (cx

post) decadal mean inflation rates in the gold standard period, the population mean was constant

across decades. Section IV presents a misspecification analysis of the Summers (1983) study of the

long-run Fisher hypothesis in the frequency domain. Section V contains a brief summary and some

conclusions.


I. Inflation Persistence and the Appearance of an Ex Post Fisher Effect

    A number of authors have documented that the behavior of the bivariate stochastic process

of short—term interest rates and inflation shows a marked change somewhere between the end of

the classical gold standard and the beginning of the 1960's (see, in particular, Sargent (1973),

Klein (1976), Shiller and Siegel (1977), Friedman and Schwartz (1976, 1982), Summers (1983),

Barthold and Dougan (1985)). The essence of this change is that interest rates displayed a zero

(or slightly negative) correlation with contemporaneous inflation prior to 1930, while a strongly
positive correlation has been observed since about 1960. I shall refer to a strong correlation between

nominal interest rates and realized inflation as an cx post Fisher effect (as distinguished from the

                                                  3
ex ante Fisher effect, an unobservable relationship between nominal rates and underlying expected

inflation).

     In this section I develop relations linking the correlation between interest rates and inflation to

the serial correlation, or persistence, properties of inflation, and to the percentage of forecastable

variation in inflation. I go on to show, based on comparative analysis of the pre— and post— 1913

inflation processes, that the simple considerations developed here explain at least the gross features

of the dramatic historical change in the relationship between interest rates and inflation.


     A. Implications of Forecastability and Persistence

     Following McCallum (1983), suppose that the underlying model generating nominal interest

rates is t p + Et[irt + 1] + et. For now, let et be a white noise uncorrelated with ltj, lit + 1,
and E [lrt + 1]; this will be relaxed somewhat in Section IV, where we consider estimation in the
frequency domain. A regression of the nominal rate i on ire, the inflation rate just realized, yields

an estimated coefficient just probability limit cov(it, lit) var(ir). This probability limit is in turn

just the first order serial correlation coefficient of inflation, regardless of the (stationary) process

generating inflation, since (under our assumptions) cov(it, lit) = cov(lrt+ 1, lit). If inflation is nearly

serially uncorrelated, an investigator regressing j on lit would obtain a coefficient close to zero, and

conclude that there is "no Fisher effect", even though Fisher's theory is built into the underlying

model. Thus, under this scenario, regression of the nominal interest rate on inflation measures the

persistence of inflation rather than the response of interest rates to inflationary expectations.

    Alternatively, consider the regression of the nominal interest rate on the ex post inflation rate

realized at the maturity of the bill. Under our hypothesised underlying model, this corresponds

to the case of classical errors in variables, and the probability limit of the estimated coefficient is

var(Et[irt+1})/var(li). This probability limit corresponds to plim(R2) from a regression of ir+1 on

all of the variables in the agents' information sets that would have been relevant to one—step—ahead

                                                    4
forecasting of inflation. The estimated "Fisher coefficient" from this regression will have probability

limit zero if inflation is a martingale difference with respect to all of the relevant information. A

regression of the nominal rate on ex post inflation measures the percentage of forecastable variation

in inflation, and (once again) is not a test of Fisher's hypothesis about nominal rates and expected

inflation.

     In summary, regression of it on rj tells us something about the persistence of inflation, while

regression of i on 7rt + 1 is likely to convey information about the forecastability of inflation, as

measured by the percentage of total variation in inflation that agents were able to forecast on the

basis of information including, but not limited to, inflation's own past. In the highly simplified

model given above, these are the only considerations reflected in the regressions, since the Fisher

hypothesis of full adjustment for expected inflation was built into the structure. More generally, as

discussed in Summers (1983) and in Section IV of this paper, the real rate will exhibit systematic

(rather than merely white noise) variation, and regressions of it on lrj or lrt + 1 will reflect this

fact as well.' This in no way undermines the point that we have made: a full underlying, or ex

ante, Fisher effect is consistent with any observed correlation between i and lrt or lrt + 1. Even

when other conditions are favorable (i.e. variation in the real rate is uncorrelated with inflation), a

strong ex post Fisher effect will appear in the data only when inflation is highly persistent and/or

forecastable.

     One modification of the Fisherian model with et white noise will prove useful. If inflation is

a martingale difference, as I am about to show was apparently the case prior to World War I, the

above model predicts that nominal interest rates will also be white noise. In fact, nominal rates

prior to 1913 followed highly persistent processes, although they were not a random walk (Mankiw

and Miron, 1985). One can easily account for the coexistence of interest rate persistence and serially

uncorrelated inflation by letting et, which represents real rate variation, follow an ARMA process.

It is useful to think of a version of Fisher's underlying theory obtaining as long as et is uncorrelated

                                                   5
with current, lagged, and future 7rt; i.e. real rate variation has a life of its own, independent of the

inflation process. Our essential results from above continue to hold; interest rates will display no

correlation with lrj if inflation is serially uncorrelated (or with r1 + 1 if inflation is unforecastable

from other information as well), although the underlying model incorporates full adjustment of

interest rates for expected inflation. The variation in nominal rates under this formulation is
indicative entirely of real rate variation.


     B. Persistence and Forecastability of Inflation from the Gold Standard to the Present: Empirical

Analysis

     i. Data
     I examine data from both the United States and Britain. The U.S. data are quarterly. I
use the Warren—Pearson all—items wholesale price index prior to 1919, and the Bureau of Labor

Statistics consumer price index thereafter. Prices are taken from the third month of each quarter

to limit the problem of time aggregation (which distorts the serial correlation properties of the

resulting inflation rates), and to match as closely as possible (with respect to timing) the three
month commercial paper rate taken from the first month of the quarter.

    The British data are annual, and were constructed by linking the Elizabeth Schumpeter con-

sumer price series with the Gayer, Rostow, and Schwartz index and the Sauerbeck—Statist series,

as in Shiller and Siegel (1977) and Barsky and Summers (1985).

     ii. Persistence

    Table 1 presents estimated autocorrelation functions for various subperiods of the quarterly

U.S. and annual British data. The contrasting nature of the data from the different monetary

regimes is striking. Pre—Worid War I inflation shows no sign of persistence at all, while the data

from 1914 to 1959 show nontrivial, though moderate positive serial correlation. Finally, post—1960

inflation shows very great persistence.
                                                   6
    Prior to World War I, inflation in both the United States and Britain was very nearly white

noise,2 as indicated by the substantively small estimated autocorrelations, most of which are also

(individually) statistically insignificant. Note, in particular, that the first order autocorrelations,

which are the "predicted" regression coefficients for the regression of it on lrj, are essentially zero.

The Q statistics, which test the joint hypothesis that the first n autocorrelations are all zero for
specified n, do not reject the white noise hypothesis for the U.S. although for the British annual data

that hypothesis is formally rejected at the one percent significance level. These rejections reflect

the negative estimates for lags three through five, all of which are negative. The predominance of

negative serial correlation in inflation from the gold standard period was noted earlier by Klein

(1976).

    It is striking that the data form the pre—World War I gold standard years show no sign of

positive serial correlation. To the extent that there is some negative serial correlation, this could

be indicative of "business cycles", as suggested by Sargent (1973), or adjustments peculiar to a

gold standard (see, e.g. Rockoff, 1984; Barsky and Summers, 1985). One might note, however,
that plausible moving average measurement error in the underlying price data would also lead to a

predominance of negative values in the correlogram of the inflation series. Thus the true inflation

data may have been even closer to white noise than the measured series.

    An alternative (though isomorphic) characterization of the behavior of inflation over the past

two and a half centuries makes use of frequency domain techniques. Instead of estimating spectral

densities — which involves an important judgemental aspect, since smoothing is required to obtain

consistent estimates — I present the results of the Durbin cumulative periodogram test (see, e.g.

Malinvaud, 1980). This compares the sum of the periodogram values (beginning at the low—

frequency end) with a 45 degree line through the origin, the integrated spectral density of theoretical

white noise. The 45 degree line (not shown explicitly) is flanked by confidence bounds derived

under the null hypothesis of white noise. Note that no ad hoc decisions need to be made in order

                                                   7
to implement this procedure.

     Figures 1—a, 1—b, and 1—c, show the cumulative periodogram with confidence bounds for the

U.S. from 1870 to 1913, Britain from 1729 to 1913, and the U.S. from 1940 to 1979, respectiveLy.

The results here simply restate in terms of frequencies our previous conclusions. Since the cumula-

tive periodogram in Figure 1—a stays well within the region bounded by the two parallel diagonals,

the early U.S. data show no departure at all from random behavior. The long British series subtly

rejects pure randomness in light of the accentuated middle (i.e. "business cycle") frequencies. The

1940 to 1979 U.S. sample is sufficiently concentrated in the low frequencies (i.e. persistent) that

the cumulative periodogram exceeds the upper bound from the beginning. Note that the slope is

steeper than that of the 45 degree line until the upper third or so of the frequency band, where

it becomes flatter, confirming that the higher frequencies contribute proportionately less to the
variance of this series than to a white noise series.

    Table 2 summarizes my Box—Jenkins identifications for United States inflation over the past

140 years. I experimented with ARMA models even for the 1870 to 1913 sample, but asymptotic

F—tests of the hypothesis that all of the coefficients are zero did not reject.3 For subperiods of 1913

to 1979, I obtained parameter estimates which yielded approximately white noise residuals. These

are shown in the column at right. Note that I identify the 1960 to 1979 inflation process as a
nonstationary IMA (1,1). The estimated fraction of each period's innovation that is permanent is
about .5.

    All of the results presented here accentuate the marked change that inflation underwent over

the last seventy years. Inflations prior to 1913 displayed no tendency to persist. If anything, there

was a slight tendency for inflations to be followed by deflation two to four years later. From 1913

to 1979 the persistence of inflation became progressively greater. The great momentum of inflation

in the last twenty years or so is reflected in an ARIMA representation with a unit root. As noted

by Granger and Newbold (1977), forecasting the level of an integrated series is a relatively easy

                                                  8
task. This is reflected in the strong correlation between interest rates and inflation seen after 1960.

    The greater the persistence of inflation, the more expected inflation will resemble current

inflation, and hence the stronger will be the appearance of an cx post Fisher effect. In particular,

this regularity will hold over a class of models in which di/dire, the response of nominal interest

rates to true expected inflation, is identically unity, as required for superneutrality. Thus the
correlation between nominal interest rates and realized inflation may say more about the stochastic

process followed by inflation than about the truth of Fisher's theory that expected real interest

rates are orthogonal to inflation. In Section IV, I show that this continues to be true even at the

low frequencies.


    iii. Forecastability

    As noted above, it is impossible to say with complete confidence how forecastable inflation was

in a particular historical setting, since we have access to at most a subset of the agents' information

sets. In this section, I focus on the percentage of total variation explained by inflation's own past

and by lagged gold production to obtain a "limited information" metric of forecastability. I use
                                                 —
the "corrected" squared correlation coefficient R2 = 1   —
                                                                           2
                                                                               so that results involving
                                                             r—1

different numbers of lagged regressors will be comparable. Note that as the sample size increases,

    converges in probability to the ratio of the variance of the "forecastable component" to the

total variance.

    Table 3 presents W's from regressions of U.S. inflation on lagged information from the various

subperiods. In addition to univariate autoregressions, regressions using the growth of the world

monetary gold stock from Kitchin (1930) are shown. The gold stock regressions necessitate the

use of annual data. The choice of the growth rate of world gold stocks as a forecasting variable

was suggested by what I call the "traditional view" of price movements during the gold standard

period, to be discussed further in Section II. Briefly, this view attributes the major swings in prices

                                                     9
prior to 1913 to changes in the rate of gold production, particularly as a result of discoveries of

new gold and improved methods of extraction.

    The results in Table 3 suggest that the forecastability of inflation underwent the same evolution

that characterized inflation persistence. Past inflation explained none of the variance of current

inflation prior to 1913. Lagged gold production was somewhat more useful; However, it is somewhat

doubtful whether agents had access to all of the information about gold production reflected in

the data used here, which were not assembled until 1930. Inflation shows a moderate degree of

forecastability between 1919 and 1959, with R2's based on past inflation alone on the order of 20

percent. Finally, inflation from 1960 to 1979 was highly forecastable. Nearly 80 percent of the

variation in inflation from this period could have been foreseen from the past behavior of inflation

alone. The increased forecastability and persistence of inflation since 1913 (and especially since

1960) account impressively for the gross features of the historical evolution of the relationship

between interest rates and inflation. In particular, the complete absence of an ex post Fisher effect

prior to 1913 and the strong emergence of such an effect after 1960 are fully rationalized.

    Some puzzles remain. The rather abrupt appearance of mild inflation persistence after 1914

was not met even by a small increase in the correlation between interest rates and inflation, in

contradiction to the implications of the illustrative model presented in this section. The period

between 1914 and 1953 was characterized by so many special cirumstances — two world wars, the

Great Depression, price controls, and a massive interest rate pegging program — however, that it

is not clear what to make of this failure.


II. Real Interest Rates and Inflation Non—neutrality: Evidence from the Pre—1914
period

    The essence of Fisher's hypothesis is that nominal interest rates are set so that forecastable

inflations do not systematically lower real interest rates. Thus an alternative approach to testing

                                                 10
the Fisher proposition focuses on its implication that the ex post real rate should bear no systematic

relationship to lagged inflation. Mishkin (1981) notes that if X/3 is the projection of the cx ante

real rate on any information set known at time t (represented by the vector Xe), the projection of

the cx post real rate on that same information set is also Xf3. This follows from the fact that, under

rational expectations, the projection of the expectational error on Xt must equal zero. As noted

by Mishkin (1981), these regressions have no structural interpretation. However, if the paradigm

of Summers (1982), in which "high inflation" decades alternated with periods of deflation or low

inflation, and in which nominal rates failed to adjust for these regime changes, really characterized

the pre—1940 period, regression of cx post real commercial paper rates on a number of lags of

inflation should yield a significantly negative estimate of the sum of the coefficients.

    Table 4 presents regression results involving 3 month commercial paper rates and 4, 8, and

20 quarters of lagged inflation. F—tests of the hypothesis that the lagged inflation rates do not

help predict the cx post real rate are shown in the final column. For 1870 to 1913, the hypothesis

that lagged inflation rates are irrelevant for predicting the ex post real rate is not rejected for any

choice of the number of lags. For the post—1930 period, that hypothesis is soundly rejected. After

1930, real rates were on average lower during inflationary periods. This conclusion continues to

hold when the 1930's and 1940's are omitted (not shown here).

    These results distinctly fail to lend support to the view that non—neutrality of inflation char-

acterized the period prior to 1913. They do suggest that inflation non—neutrality may have charac-

terized the post—1930 and post—1950 periods. The earlier years are usually thought of as the least

"Fisherian" because of the absence of close co—movement of nominal rates and cx post inflation,

while the post—1950 period is characterized by a high correlation of realized inflation and nominal

rates. Yet, when the Fisher theory is restated in such a way that the expectational error is in the

left—hand—side variable, it is the pre—1913 period which provides the least evidence against Fisher's

neutrality theory.
                                                  11
     Since the nominal rate is known at time t, it is appropriate to add it to the information set,

alongside lagged inflation. This is done in the middle set of entries in Table 4. The coefficient of

the nominal rate and its standard error are shown, in addition to the sum of the coefficients on

lagged inflation and its standard error. The results are quite striking. Lagged inflation continues

to be irrelevant for predicting the ex post real rate. The nominal rate is a statistically significant

predictor of the real rate, although the R2 is quite low. The estimates are consistent with the view

that changes in nominal rates indicated changes in real rates on a one—for—one basis prior to 1913,

a hypothesis put forth by Shiller and Siegel (1977).

     In the previous section of this paper, we found that inflation during the gold standard years was

nearly white noise, implying that the price level was essentially a random walk. A more traditional

view (see Delong, 1985 and Cagan, 1984 for recent restatements) divides the 1870 to 1913 period

into two segments: an era of generally declining prices from 1870 until 1896, and an inflationary

period after 1896. To the extent that this "traditional view" is based on an examination of plots

of the price series alone, it requires little discussion; the appearance ex post of spurious trends
in random walks is a well known phenomenon. A more sophisticated version of the traditional

view emphasizes changes in the trend growth of world gold stocks. Prior to 1896, the argument

goes, a dearth of gold discoveries combined with a high growth rate of potential GNP lead to
a deflationary regime; after 1896, new sources in South Africa and Australia combined with the

discovery of the cyanide process lead to more rapid increases in the world stock of gold, and hence

inflation. Furthermore, it is claimed (Delong, 1985), agents living at the time were aware of a
switch from a deflationary to an inflationary regime.

    Underlying the Summers (1983) view that the gold standard provides substantial evidence

against the Fisher hypothesis is the notion that the period included important swings in the trend

growth of prices. Since the univariate inflation process is white noise, it shows no evidence of such

variation. The possibility remains that the alleged "regime change", along with a failure of nominal

                                                 12
interest rates to adjust, would be reflected in a negative relationship between real rates and recent

rates of gold production. Thus, the final entries in Table 4 show the results of regressions of real

interest rates on lagged growth rates of the world gold stock from Kitchin (1930). This necessitated

a move to annual data. Real interest rates do show a stronger negative relationship to lagged gold

production than to lagged inflation, which corresponds to our finding in Section I that inflation was

somewhat forecastable from lagged gold production numbers. If there is an argument in defense of

the Summers (1983), it is more likely to be based on the forecastability of inflation from lagged gold

growth, rather than any features of the univariate inflation process. However, there are alternative

scenarios other than inflation non-neutrality which could also have lead to a correlation between

real rates and the growth of the gold stock.


III. Variation in Inflation Within and Between Decades
     Summers (1982) prints decadal mean inflation rates for 1860 to 1940, and argues that their

substantially varying values indicate important changes in trend inflation and should not have been

ignored by bondholders. To test the validity of this claim, we might ask whether the data provide

evidence that the population means in fact varied across decades. This is the problem of "one way

analysis of variance". The null hypothesis that the decadal means were all equal can be tested with

the statistic   I1                               where =x .is the pooled sample mean and x3 is the

mean for decade j. The statistic is distributed FT_k,k_1 (Rao, 1973). The numerator represents
the variation between decades, while the denominator measures the within variation. Only if the

"between" variation is of sufficient relative magnitude is the hypothesis of equality rejected.

     Table 5 presents the analysis of variance for the subperiods 1870 to 1909, 1860 to 1939, and 1940

to 1979. Only for the post—1940 decades is there strong ground for rejection. For the earlier periods,

the F—statistics are surprisingly small, reflecting the large amount of within—decade variation in the

inflation rates. The observed variation in sample means is consistent with a constant population

                                                  13
mean up to 1940.

     It is true that the foregoing tests assume constancy of the population variance, and that this

can sometimes be rejected by the data. For instance, the variability of inflation was especially great

during the Civil War decade of the 1860's and the World War I period 1910 to 1919. However, Box

(1954) shows that, as long as the number of data points in each cell is the same, the bias in the

test from falsely maintaining a constant population variance is always in favor of rejection. Thus

failure to reject in the early decades cannot be attributed to bias from the maintained hypothesis

of a constant population variance.

     The results in this section cast serious doubt on the view that there were "high inflation" and

"low inflation" (or deflationary) decades during the gold standard period. When one allows for

the possibility of sampling variation, the likelihood emerges that the appearance of changes in the

trend growth of prices so central to the arguments of Summers (1983), Cagan (1984), and Delong

(1985) is spurious.4 Our findings thus further undermine the view that data from the gold standard

years can provide substantive evidence against inflation neutrality.


IV. Specification Analysis of Summers' Spectral Estimates of the Fisher Equation

    Summers (1983) uses band spectral regression to filter out high frequency components of the

inflation and interest rate data, and estimate a "long run" Fisher equation. Summers argues for

this procedure on the grounds that: 1) economic theory suggests approximate super—neutrality of

money only as a steady state proposition; and 2) low frequency estimation is robust against the
errors—in—variables problem that arises from the use of actual inflation as a proxy for anticipated

inflation. In this section I focus on the second claim. I first show that it is not correct in general,

a point previously made in a slightly different way by McCallum (1984). I then go on to show that

for the 1870 to 1913 period in particular it leads to extremely misleading conclusions.

    Suppose that the "true" population model is i = p + E [2rt+i] + e, so that rationally expected

                                                  14
inflation appears with a coefficient of unity, p is the unconditional expectation of the real rate, and

e reflects variation in the ex ante real rate. In general, c will be correlated with E [lrj+i], as well

as serially correlated. Thus, even if it were possible to observe inflationary expectations exactly,

OLS estimation of the above relation would not be meaningful.

     Let us assume, however (with Summers, 1983), that the steady state superneutrality result

properly implies the absence of low frequency correlation between e and E [lrt+ ].     In other words,
we assume that if we could observe true expected inflation, the low frequency band spectral estimate

of its coefficient would have probability limit equal to unity. In fact, in order to isolate the effect of

proxying expected inflation with 'rt, let us go a step further and proceed as if e is uncorrelated with

both E [lrt+1] and lrj at all frequencies. If regression of t on rj does not make sense in this most
favorable of circumstances, it will be no better when endogeneity (of       or E [rj+l]) is readmitted.

     We can now ask what the probability limit of the band spectral estimator B over specified

frequencies will be. This is given by plim B =       f S1,,,.(w)/ f S(w), where S1,,,.(w)   is   the (pop-
ulation) cross—spectrum of interest and inflation, S,,.,,r(W) is the spectrum of inflation, and the

integral is taken over the specified frequency band (—,w). Under our assumptions, plim B =

f           , irt(w)/ f S,. and is thus equal to the band spectral regression (over the same frequency

band) of expected inflation at t + 1 on actual inflation at t.

    If the integrals are taken over the entire interval (—pr, ir), the probability limit of the OLS esti-

mator is obtained, and this is seen to be cov(lrt, Et[irj+i])/var(irt). This coincides with the standard

Theil (1957) specification error result: the estimated coefficient in a regression with an erroneous

explanatory variable differs (for large samples) multiplicatively from the true coefficient by the

regression of the "correct" explanatory variable on the erroneous, included one. Letting p be the

correlation between ir and Ej[irt+i], note that cov(irt,Ej[irt+i])/var(irt) = po(Ej[?rj+i])/o(lrt) <    1,

since p <   1   and a rational forecast varies less than the series being forecast. Thus the OLS esti-

mate of the response of i to expected inflation must be biased downward as long as inflation is a

                                                   15
stationary series. The extent of this bias depends on the stochastic process followed by inflation.

In the limit as it   approaches   white noise behavior, cov(lrt, Et[irt+i])/var(irt) approaches zero, and
regression of i on it will yield a zero coefficient even though a full response of i to expected inflation

obtains by hypothesis.
     Does the situation improve as we focus on the relation at lower frequencies? Suppose that

it has an auto regressive representation tj = A(L)irt + Cj, and that expectations are based on

                                                                  f
the univariate process followed by inflation. Then plim B = A(e_"), the integration once again

taking place over (—, w). The probability limit of the limiting zero frequency estimator (the limit
of the integral as —+ 0) is just the sum of the coefficients in the autoregressive representation of it.

Only if these coefficients sum to unity does low frequency estimation circumvent (in the limit) the

specification bias from using itt in place of Et[irt+i}. Alternatively, the required condition is that

the process generating inflation have a unit root (Box and Jenkins, 1976, p. 102). The IMA(1,1)
process is a noteworthy special case. It should not be surprising if low frequency regression results

from a period in which inflation followed an IMA(1,1) process appear more favorable to the Fisher

effect than results from a period in which inflation was nearly white noise.

     It is not hard to implement the above formulae under the assumption that inflationary expec-

tations do not differ too much from the predictions of a univariate ARIMA model. The procedure

is to generate ARIMA forecasts and then to compute the cauxilliary regression" (Theil, 1957) of

the one—step--ahead inflation forecast on inflation at t. Corresponding to each quarter from 1860

to 1980, I estimated an ARMA (1,1) model using the previous 80 observations (and hence only

information that would have been available to agents at the time of the forecast), and computed

the one—step—ahead predictions.

    Table 6 presents OLS regressions of E[it÷1} on itt for the subperiods 1870 to 1913, 1930

to 1979, and 1960 to 1979. Figures 2—a through 2—c show the gain                                    as   a
function of frequency. The gain (or transfer function) indicates the magnitude of the relationship

                                                    16
between the two series as at each frequency. For the 1870 to 1913 period, the OLS relation between

inflation at t and the one—step—ahead inflation forecast is negligible, and there is no tendency for

this relation to strengthen at lower frequencies. In the later periods, on the other hand, a substan-

tial OLS relationship appears, and the downward—sloping gain function shows that the coefficient

at lower frequencies is larger than that at high frequencies, and larger than the OLS regression

coefficient. The 1960 to 1979 results are particularly striking in this regard. The coefficient ap-

proaches one closely for long cycles. This is precisely the period in which we identified inflation as

an IMA (1,1) process.

     We thus can account for the coefficient estimates obtained by Summers solely in terms of the

stochastic properties of inflation, i.e. in a model in which the adjustment of nominal interest rates

to rationally expected inflation is always one—for—one. The more "Fisherian" results for the post—

1930 and particularly the post—1960 period appear to reflect an increase in the extent to which

(a smoothed version of) actual inflation proxies for expected inflation rather than a change in the

structural relationship between interest rates and expected inflation. Even more surprisingly, the

estimated gain functions suggest that the apparent strengthening of the Fisher relation at lower

frequencies in the post—1930 data may also reflect properties of the inflation process rather than

short—run vs. long—run adjustment to expected inflation. Recall that the gain functions shown

above are estimates of what the regression coefficient of i on actual inflation "should" be under the

maintained hypotheses of full adjustment to expected inflation and (limited information) rational

expectations. The closeness of these hypothetical coefficients to those actually obtained in Summers

(1983) is striking.


V. Summary and Conclusions

    In assessing empirical evidence on the Fisher hypothesis, it is important to distinguish between

two quite separate issues. The first is the degree of correlation between nominal interest rates and

                                                 17
realized inflation. The second is the relationship between expected inflation and expected real rates.

    This chapter concurs fully with Friedman and Schwartz (1982) and Summers (1983) in the

conclusion that essentially none of the variance of nominal interest rates prior to 1930 is accounted

for by inflation, actual or expected. However, I do not conclude that the data, at least those prior

to 1913, show much evidence of inflation illusion or non-neutrality of expected inflation vis a vis real

rates. The time series properties of inflation prior to 1913 suggest that the relationship between

actual inflation and expected inflation in this period was negligible (although there are some caveats

regarding lagged gold production), and was no stronger at low frequencies than at high ones. The

estimated nonresponse of nominal rates to inflation in these data is as likely a reflection of this

phenomenon as it is evidence of a nonadjustment of nominal rates to expected inflation. Indeed,

when the Fisher equation is "turned around" so that the expectational error is associated with

the left—hand—side variable rather than the regressor, no significantly negative relationship between

real rates and inflation appears.

    I conclude with an important caveat. One way of restating the main empirical result of this

paper is that there was probably little variation in expected inflation prior to 1913. Thus, although

this period cannot provide significant evidence against Fisher's hypothesis, neither can it tell us

what would have happened if expected inflation had varied widely. It would be wrong to conclude

that the early period provides positive evidence in favor of Fisher. However, when the data from

the gold standard years are understood within the framework of this paper, much of the apparently

ovewhelming case against the Fisher hypothesis disappears.

         For this reason, I do not test a formal restriction that the coefficient of inflation in the interest

rate equation should equal the first order serial correlation of inflation.
     2
         Very similar results obtain beginning in 1880, or splitting the sample at 1896 and examining

the two halves separately.

         Summers (1984) reports that regressions of interest rates on ARIMA forecasts of inflation

yielded results virtually identical to those from regressions of interest on ex post inflation for the

pre—1930 period. Summers argues that the regressions using ARIMA forecasts are robust against

the change of specification error made by McCallum (1983). Our asymptotic F—tests do not sup-

port Summer's claim. The ARIMA models have no explanatory power. However, the coefficients

estimated from finite samples will not be identically zero, and therefore the forecasts display con-

siderable spurious variation.

         My calculations agree with DeLong (1985) that if one splits the sample around the 1896

turning point, a "t—test" rejects equality of the two means. But such an cx post choice for the

breaking point hardly seems legitimate.
