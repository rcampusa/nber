    1.   Introduction

    Immigration     has been   an important component of demographic change since

Biblical   times.    International differences       in economic and     political
conditions   remain sufficiently large to encourage the flow of millions of

persons across national boundaries.         United Nations statistics, for example,

report that in the 1975—1980 period, nearly 5 million persons migrated to a

different country, with nearly two thirds of these individuals migrating to

one of three countries, the United States, Canada, and Australia.1 There

exists, therefore,       a large reservoir of persons who believe that better

opportunities    exist elsewhere and who are willing to incur costs to

experience those opportunities.         These two conditions       imply that the pool of

migrants will not be randomly chosen from the population of the countries of
                                                            the potential
origin, and that it will not be randomly distributed across

countries of destination.        Instead the pool of immigrants in any host

country will be composed of the subsample of persons who face better oppor-

tunities in that particular host country than either in the country of
                                                                       are
origin or in other potential host countries, and whose migration costs

sufficiently low to make the move profitable.

    The insight that migrants may be systematicallydifferent                from persons

who do not choose to migrate has long played an important               role in

                                                                                           for
sociological and historical studies of the           irrsrd.gration   phenomenon   (see,


example,   the studies contained in Jackson, 1969)           .   The selectivity hypothesis

has also played a major role in the modern economic literature that analyzes

how immigrants do in the tLS. labor market.            For example,      the early studies

of Chiswick     (1978)   and Carliner   (1980)   invoke the assumption that immigrants

are positively selected from the population           of the countries of origin to
explain the remarkable cross—section empirical finding that immigrant

earnings (after a short time         period)   "overtake" the earnings of natives with

the same observed socioeconomic         characteristics,     such as age and education.2

      1y recant work in this area (Borjas, 1985, 1987) has addressed two

related questions raised by the early studies.              Since most of the literature

that analyzes immigrant earnings focuses on the study of single cross—section

data sets, my 1985 paper raiosd the possibility that the 'overtaking"

findings could be due to the fact that cross-section              regressions confound

aging and cohort effects.3 The positive correlation between immigrant

earnings and years of residence in the U.S. observed in the cross—section

could arise because immigrants "adapt" rapidly to the U.S. labor market, or

because earlier waves of immigrants differ in substantial ways (labor market

productivities,     unobserved abilities or skills) from the more recent waves.

Eorjas (1985) adapted well-known techniques              (see, for example,   Heckman, 1983)

to separately identify aging and cohort effects using the 1970 and 1980 U.S.

Censuses.      This methodology,      which "tracks" synthetic cohorts of immigrants

over time,      showed   that:   (a) immigrant      assimilation was not as fast as the

cross—Section studies indicate;          (b) the    more recent immigrant waves performed

substantially worse in the labor market than the early postwar waves; and

(C)   there   was little likelihoodthat the most recent immigrant waves would

ever earn substantiallymore than natives of comparable age and education.

      n important insight provided by the             study of synthetic cohorts is that

invoking the assumption of positive selection, though it may be correct for

some cohorts of     ixrartigrants,   may be   completely   wrong for other cohorts of

immigrants.      This raises the important question of exactly which factors

determine whether immigrants are positively or negatively selected from the

population in the countries of origin.              Borjas (1987) presents an initial

attempt to address this problem and derives a simple economic model of

                                              —2—
selection on the basis of unobserved characteristics          (which after all form

the focus of much of the literature on imnigrant earnings)         .   This   model,

which will    be discussed in    detail below,    shows that there is no general       law

stating that imuigrants must be positively selected.          In fact, under a

reasonable set of conditions it is likely that inunigrants are negatively

selected (i.e., persons who have below average earnings and productivities

are the most likely persons to migrate to the United States).            My empirical

analysis revealed that positive selection was more likely to characterize

ixmnigrants from the advanced industrial countries,        and negative selection

was more likely to characterize iimoigrants from the Third World countries

that form the bulk of migration to the U.S. in the         pot—l65     period.

    This paper expands my earlier work in a number of significant ways.                The

theoretical analysis below will argue that although most of the literature

has focused on the role that selection in unobserved characteristicsplays in

determining ixmnigrant earnings, there is also selection in observed charac-

teristics     such as education,     Surprisingly,   it is easy to show that there is

no relationshipbetween the types of selections that are generated in

unobserved characteristicsand the types of selections that are generated                 in,


for example, education.        It is completely possible for the most educated

persons to migrate to the U.S. (i.e., positive selection in education), but

for these persons to be the least productive persons in the population of

highly educated persons (i.e., negative selection in unobserved character-

isticS)   .   The analysis   below will   present a number of propositions that

yield insights into the process that determines the selection of immigrants

in these two separate dimensions of "uality.

    The empirical analysis in this paper expands my previous work in two

ways.     First, it presents a detailed analysis of the U.S. earnings of

immigrants by focusing on the roles played by both selection in observed

                                           '-3—
characteristicsand in unobservedcharacteristics.                 It will be seen that a

number of the theoretical predictions are confirmed by the data.                   Second, as

noted earlier, potential migrants can choose among a number of countries of

destination. The empirical analysis below will present a systematic Study of

the selection biases generated by the sorting of migrants among three

potential countries of destination:           Australia, Canada, and the United

States.     It   will be   seen that both country-of-origin       and country—of-

destination characteristicsplay an important role in determining the

performance of immigrants in        any   labor market.

    The paper is organized as follows.             Section 2 presents a theory of

immigration based on       the hypothesis that migration is determined through the
process of    wealth—maximization.        Section 3 presents the basic empirical

framework    that will be used throughout         the analysis to test the various

propositions predicted by the economic model of immigration.                   Section 4

presents the empirical analysis on          the   earnings of   ixrsnigrants   in the United

States, while Section 5 compares the performance of immigrants                  in the U.S.

labor market with the performance of ixmnigrants in Australia and Canada.

Finally,    Section 6 zuxmrarizes    the   main results of the Study.

    Migration     is assumed to flow from country 0, the country of origin or the

"homer country,     to country 1,    the   country of destination or, for

concretenees,     the United States.       This   simple   framework ignores three

potential complications.         First, it is likely that persons born in the United

States also consider the possibilityof migrating to other countries, and

perhaps many of them do so.         Second, even persons choosing the United States

as a country of destinationmay         find that     things did not work Out (or perhaps

worked Out much better than expected) and some return migration is generated.

                                            —4—
Third, individuals contemplating migration in a particular country of origin

enter the "immigration market" in which a number of other host countries

(such   as Australia and      Canada) compete  for the immigrant's human and physical
capital. Little is known          about the size and composition of the migrant flows

from the United States to other         countries, and hence these possibilities are

ignored   in    what   follows.   Much more, however,   is   known   about the size and

composition of         the flows from any given home country to each of three

                                                                     and the
potential host countriea (Australia, Canada, and the United States),
                                              will be applied below to the
implications of the simpler two-country model

more general framework where potential migrants decide not only whether or

not to migrate, but also choose a country of destination.

    Residents of the home country face an earnings             (w)   distribution given by:




    £nwXS0+E0                                                                        (1)


where X    is a vector of socioeconomic characteristics with value S 0 in

country 0, and the disturbance            is independent of K and is normally

distributed with mean zero and variance         &0
    The earnings distribution facing individuals in the United States

is given by:



    Zn            (l—M) xS    + M K 5, + e1,                                         (2)
          w1




where M is a dumsoy variable indicating if the individual is foreign-born or

native.        The vector 5          the value that the U.S. labor market attaches to         me
                             n gives
socioeconomic characteristics K for natives.            This valuation may differ due

to discrimination or other unobserved factors from the value 5                that the

labor market attaches to the characteristics brought in by potential
migrants.       The disturbance             is again independent of X (and M) and is

normally distributed with mean zero and variance                                    a       Finally, the random

variables       E   and        have correlation coefficient p.

    Equations        (1)   and   (2) completely          describe the earnings opportunities

facing a potential migrant (as well as U.S. natives)                                    .   Three questions are

raised by this simple framework.                 First, what factors determine the size of

the migration        flow generated by the income-maximization                               hypothesis?      Second,

what types of selection in the unobserved characteristics                                        a are created by

the endogenous migration decision?                   Third, what types of selection                         in the

observed characteristics             X are created by the endogenoua migration decision?

    The migration decision is determined by the sign of the index function:


                                                     -
    i     tn [      —-     3     [   x (   8—8   )       it        ]
                                                                        +   (e1-e,                              (3)



where C gives the level of mobility costs, and                                it    gives a "time—equivalent"

measure   (iv       w/C) of the       costs of migrating to the United States.

    The level of migration costs C is likely to vary across individuals for

two reasons:         First, there are time costs associated with migration,                                   and

these time costs are likely to be higher for persons with higher opportunity

costs.    Second, there are transportation                             costa associated with migration, and

these direct costs include not only the air fare (which is likely to be

constant across individuals), but also moving expenses of family and

household goods, and it is reasonable to suppose that these expenses may also

be a positive function of              w.   These assumptions give little hint as to how

the time—equivalentmeasure of mobility costs,                                 it,    varies across individuals.

It is instructive to first assume that                        it       is constant across individuals

since the main implications of the Roy model are clearest in this special

case.    The analysis below will show that the treatment                                    of   it   as a random

variable in the population does not substantially alter the analysis, and

                                                     —6—
will, in sons instances,                      reinforce the conclusions of the simpler model.

       Since migration to the United States occurs when I > 0, the emigration

rate   from the country of origin for persons of given characteristics                                         X   is
given by:

distribution function.                       If the characteristics                X have a joint density

function given         by       f(x), then the emigration rate from country                           0   is given by:



       P            P(x)f(x)dx.                                                                                    (5)

       Equations          (4)    and        (5)   suzrsnarize the          (rather obvious) economic content of

the theory of migration proposed by Hicks                                  (1939) and further developed in

Sjaastad (1962).                In particular, the emigration rate is:                        (a)    a negative

function of mean income in the home country                                   .L     x6);   a positive function

of mean income in the United States                             ().L
                                                                       =   X1);     and a negative     function     of

migration         Costs.        such    of the literature on the internal migration of persoos
in   the United States is devoted to testing these theoretical predictions                                              (see

the survey by Greenwood, 1975)

       The   irrsmigration          literature, on the other hand, has not historically

focused on explaining the size of migration flows, but on explaining their

composition or            labor market quality.                  far back as 1919, for example,
                                                                  As

Douglas was         asking whether or not                  the skill composition of immigrant cohorts
was constant across successive immigrant waves.                                      The theory of migration

implicit in equations                   (1)-CS)      has important implications about the selection

biases that characterize the pool of migrants both in terms of unobserved and

observed characteristics.                               Consider initially the selection mechanism in the

unobserved characteristios S                                     In particular, consider the conditional

means condition on two dimensions: the observed characteristics X and the

variables                and           measure the "quality" (in terms of unobserved character-

istics) of the migrant pool.                                 The Roy model identifies three cases of sub-

stantive interest.

A.     Positive Selection:                      Q       > 0 and            >   0.
       This type of selection exists when migrants have above average earnings

in the country of origin (for given characteristics X(, and also have

U.S. earnings which exceed the earnings of comparable                                                 US.   natives (ignoring

the possibility that immigrant earnings may be reduced because of their

ethnic or racial background)                             .   Inspection of           equations (6) and (7) shows that

the necessary and sufficient conditions for this type of selection to occur

are:

       p >   min(,         k) and k         >    1.                                                                          (8)




                                                                     —8—
    If p is sufficiently high and if income is more dispersed in the U.S.

than in the country of origin,            iztsrd.grants arriving         in the U.S. will be

selected from the upper tail of the home country's income distribution, and

will outperform comparable natives upon arrival to the U.S.                        Intuitively, this

occurs because the home         country,    in a sense, is "taxing" high—ability

workers and "insuring" low-ability workers against poor labor market

outcomes.   Since high income workers benefit relatively more than low income

workers from migration to the United State, (regardless of how much higher

mean incomes in the United States may               be      relative to the country of origin),

a brain drain is generated and the United States, with its greater

opportunities,    becomes a magnet for persons who are likely to do well in the

labor   market

    Negative Selection:          0      < 0 and         <   0.
    This type     of    selection    is defined to exist when the United States draws

                                       in the country of origin, and who,
persons who have below average incomes

          min),    k)




    negative selection also requires that p                      be   "sufficiently" positive,    but


that the income distribution in the country of origin be more unequal than

that in the U.S.         Intuitively, negative selection is generated when the

United States "taxes" high-income workers relatively more than the country of
                                          low—income workers against poor
origin, and provides better insurance for

labor market outcomes.           This opportunity set leads to large incentive, for

                                                       their situation in the
 low—ability persons to migrate since they can improve

United States, and to decreased incentives for high-ability persons to

                                                  —9—
migrate since income opportunities in the home country are more profitable.

C.   Refugee Sorting:    Q   < 0 and    > 0.

     This kind of selection ooours when the U.S. draws below-average

immigrants   (in terms of the oountry of origin), bot migrants have above—

average earnings in the United States labor market.        The necessary and

sofficient condition is:




     p < min(-, k)                                                             (10)




     In other words, if p is negative or "small", the composition of the

migrant pool is likely to resemble a refugee population.        For instance, it is

likely that p is negative for countries that have recently experienced a

Communist takeover,     After all, the change from a market economy to a

Communist system is often accompanied by structural changes in the income

distribution, and by confiscation of entrepreneurial assets and redis-

tribution to other persons.     The Roy model suggests that immigrants from

such systems will be in the lower tail of the "revolutionary" income

distribution, but will outperform the average U.S. native worker.

     The basic Roy model thus provides a useful categorization of the factors

that determine the guality or composition (in terms of unobserved

characteristics) of the migrant pool.         Even at this level, several important

implications are generated which give some insight into a number of empirical

findings in the literature.     For example, many studies have documented the

fact that refugee populations perform quite well in the U.S. labor market

when compared to native workers of similar socioeconomic characteristics.

These empirical results are explained by the income—maximization hypothesis

and by the fact that these refugee populations, prior to the political

changes which led to a worsening of their economic status, were relatively

                                       -10—
well off in the country of origin.     It is, therefore, unnecessary to resort

to the arbitrary distinctions between "economic" and "non-economic" migrants

to explain the refugee experience.

    The Roy model also provides an interesting explanation for the empirioal

finding that the quality of migrants to the United States has declined in the

postwar period (where quality is defined by the wage differential between

migrants and natives of the same measured skills) .   Prior to   the 1965

Amendments to the Immigration and Nationality Aot, ixmnigration to the United

States was regulated by numerical quotas.    The distribution of the fixed

number of quotas aoross countries was based on the ethnic population of the

United States in 1919 and thus encouraged migration from (some)    Western

European countries, and strongly discouraged immigration from other

continents, particularly Asia.     The favored countries have one important

characteristic:   their income distributions are probably much less dispersed

than those of countries in Latin America or Asia.     The 1963 Amendments

abolished the discriminatory restrictions against immigration from non—

European countries, established a 20,000 numerical limit for legal migration

from any single country (subject to both Hemispheric and worldwide numerical

limitations) , and led to a substantial increase in the number of migrants

from Asia and Latin America.     The new flow of migrants thus originates in

countries that are much more likely to have greater income inequality than

the United States.5   It would not be surprising, therefore, if the quality of

immigrants declined as a result of the 1965 Amendments.

    In addition, the 1965 Amendments led to a fundamental shift in the

mechanism by which visas were allocated among potential migrants.     In

particular, the role played by observable skills and occupational

characteristics was deemphasized, and the role played by family relationships

with relatives currently in the United States became the primary focus of

                                     —11--
the policy.      In   1985,       for example, nearly 70 percent of all (legal) migrants

entered the United Statea through one of the kinship provisions                        in the

immigration law.       The Roy model suggests that this change in the statutes

will lead to a substantial decline in immigrant quality.                         In particular, the

family of the migrant that resides in the United States provides a "safety

net" that insures the immigrants against poor labor market outcomes and

unemployment periods in the months after immigration.                         Low—ability persons who

could not migrate without family connections in the United States, and hence

without that insurance, will now find it worthwhile to do so.                         In effect, the

kinship regulations in the immigrat ion law create a lower bound in the income

distribution that low-skilled immigrants face in the United States, and hence

make it more likely that migrants are negatively selected from the

population.

    The theoretical analysis yields two equations that can guide empirical

analysis.      These equations are given by:



         =       4t1 ,lt,G,C,       ,p)                                                     (11)



         = h)m,m1,p)      ).                                                                (12)




    Equation      (11) gives a "reduced form" equation, where immigrant quality

in the United States (i.e., the wage differential between migrants and

natives of equal measured skills) is a function of all the primitive

parameters of the model             (i.e.,      the parameters of the two income distributions

and migration costs)          .
                                   My earlier      paper   (Sorjas,   1987)   provides a detailed

hymothesia on the direction of the effects of the various variables

model.       These effects are usually ambiguous and can be categorized in terms

                                                    —12—
of "composition effects" and "scale effects".              In particular, a change in any

variable a will create incentives for a different type of person to migrate

(the composition effect), and for a different number of persons to migrate

(the scale effect)


       Equation       )l2)   is a "structural" equation and states that if knowledge

of X    is    available, a subset of the parameters of the model enter multi—

plicatively through the h function )see equation (7))            .   By holding   ).   con-

stant, the structural equation essentially nets out the scale effect, and

leads to more unambiguous predictions of the impact of the exogenous vari-

ables on the quality of insnigrants.             It is important to note that the h

function in (12) does not depend on mean income levels in the countries

of origin and the country of destination, or on the level of migration

costs since these factors only play a role through the selectivity vari-

able    2..

country       to a decrease in the quality of migrants in the United States

    2. An increase in the variance of the income distribution in the United
States leads to an increase in the quality of migrants in the United States.6
       3      An increase in the correlation coefficient between earnings in the

home    country and earnings          in the United States increases immigrant quality if
there      is positive selection, and decreases immigrant quality if there is

negative       selection.       The   ambiguity arises because the larger the correlation
coefficient, the better the "match" between the two countries. The
improvement in the match increases the quality of the immigrant flow if there
is   positive selection, and decreases it if there is negative selection.

       2.2.       Random Mobility Costs

       These insights have been derived from the simplest version of the Roy

model that treats mobility oosts (defined as a fraotion of
                                                           potential income

in the country of origin) as a constant in the population.                                               This assumption

stay   be restrictive, and it                  is important to ascertain how its relaxation

affects the results of the model.                         Suppose that mobility costs are normally

distributed in the population and can be written as:

                                                                                                                          (13)

where    )L   is the mean level of mobility costs in the population, and                                            C     is

a normally distributed random variable with mean C and variance                                                         The

where   V'    =
                   C—C—C.
       Equations        (14)        and    (15) show that the addition                of migration costs does

not affect any of the substantive results of the simplest version of the Roy

model if migration costs are uncorrelated with earnings opportunities.

However, if migration coats are correlated with earnings opportunities the

tyme of seleotion that is generated may change in either direction.                                                  Suppose,

for example, that migration costs are positively correlated with earnings

opportunities.              For instance, high ability persons may take longer to find

appropriate jobs.                   This positive correlation makes both                               and    l more
negative, and hence increases the likelihood of negative selection.

                                                       —14—
Conversely, if migration costs         (measured in time   units)   and earnings

opportunitiea       are negatively correlated, the likelihood of positive selection

is increased.

     Two additional points about this more general model are worth

stressing.        First, the importance of variable migration costs in the analysis

will diminish greatly if the variance in migration costs is relatively small

compared to the variance in the income distributions.               Secondly, regardless

of how important migration costs are, the key result that negative selection

is more likely from countries with high levels of income inequality and

positive selection ia more likely from countries with more              equal income
distributions       is unaffected.

2.3.     Selection in    Observed Characteristics

       Equation    (4), the probit equation determining the migration        rate,

contains an additional insight;          The migration rate is a function of X

through the parameter                   ience,   the migration of persons with larger

levels of X is more likely if K has a higher return in the United States than

in the country of origin, and the migration          of persons with lower levels of       K


is   more likely if the country of origin values the characteristic K more than

the United States.          A complementary analysis to the Roy model can be derived

if it is assumed that the vector K consists of only one variable, say

education    (5),    that   this variable is uncorrelated with the disturbances rn

the earnings functions, and that this variable, too, is normally distributed

in the population.          The assumption of only one variable in the vector K is

irrelevant, since the results can be easily generalized to any number of

variables. The assumption of normality, though unrealistic for some socio-

economic characteristics, does simplify the mathematics substantially and

allows a useful extension of the Roy approach to the determination of the

observed income distribution.

                                                                                            (16)

and that the education distribution in the population of the country of

origin can be written as:


    5 =            +    5,                                                                  (18)



where C           is    noa11y distributed         with mean zero and variance       a2

    Assuming that            nobility coats are constant, the emigration rate for the

population in the country of origin is given by:


    P = Pr                        +            a   >   —   C       +                       (19)
                   {(e2_eO)                                            (5t_5o)_z]}
         =    l_(z*),
where    t=                  +       (8—3), and z              —



    Two interesting questions can be addressed within this framework.                      First,

consider the conditional expectation of schooling of persons who do migrate.

It is easy to show that:




    E(s
              j
                   I    > 0) =   i    +—     (8—8).                                         (20)



Hence the mean schooling level of migrants will be less than or greater

than the mean schooling level of the population depending on which of the two

countries values schooling more.                       Positive selection in schooling will be

observed when             (5—3) > 0,         so that the U.S. labor market attaches a higher value

to schooling, while negative selection in schooling will be observed when

              <    0,    so that highly educated individuals have little incentive to leave


                                                        —16—
the country of origin.

      It is important to stress that these selection conditions have nothing

to do with the conditions determining selection in unobserved character-

istics.    Any permutation of selection mechanisms in unobserved and observed

characteristics is theoretically possible.            Hence negative selection in

unobserved characteristics (or ability) may be jointly occurring with posi-

tive selection in education, or vice versa,            Simply because the United

States attracts highly educated persons from some countries                    does not imply


that these highly educated persons are the most productive highly educated

persons   in that particular country of origin.7

      This important insight implies that little can be learned from com-

      Mean earnings     of migrants      depend on the mean education of migrants,                 as

given by (20), and on the mean level of their unobserved characteristics.

Since the two kinds of selections are independent, nothing can be said about

how the average migrant performs in the host country unless the sinds of
                                                                      known.

a relatively small fraction of earnings variation across individuals.

not uncommon,    for example, to find that the observed characteristics                          explain



                                              —17—
much less than a third of the variance in wage rates cr weekly earnings.                             The

selection in unobserved characteristics, therefore, is
                                                       empirically much more

important than the selection in observed characteristics.

          A number of comparative statics results can be genecated by
                                                                      analysis of

equation         (20)   .
                             Perhaps the most interesting of these results          is:

That      is,   a one year increase in the mean education level of the countcy

of origin will increase the mean education level of persons who actually

migrate to the United States, but this increase will be by less than one

year.       The intuition for this result follows from the fact that an increase

in   (I    will   change the size of the immigrant flow.                 Suppose, for concreteness,

that (31—30) > C so that there is positive selection in education.                           The

inccease in p               makes it worthwhile for more persons to migrate, and thus

dilutes the mean education level of the population of migrants.                        Hence the

increase in the conditional expectation is less than the increase in the

populationmean.                  An important implication of this theoretical prediction is

that the variance in education levels across irmnigrants                      (from different

countries)        in the United States will be smaller than the variance in education

levels of the actual populations across countries in the world.                           In other words,

the population of migrants in the United States is more homogeneous                          (in terms

of education) than the populations of the different sending countries.

      In general, equation                  (20) implies the existence   of observable quality

equations analogous to (11) and (12)


                                                                                                   (24)

where   Q   gives the mean    level      of the observed characteristics of immigrants

in the U.S.    The estimation of             (24) and   (25),   of course, is likely to be

extremely difficult in practice since they introduce a number of primitive

parameters    (e.g.,              that   are unobservable and likely to remain so.

3.   Eirical Framework
     Recent empirical research on the earnings of immigrants stresses the

importance of disentangling the cohort and aging effects that are confounded

by a single cross—section of data.                 In the analysis presented in this paper,

two Censuses in the country of destination will be pooled (e.g.,                       the 1970 and

1980 U.S. Censuses),        and   the    following regression model will be estimated:


     Zn w.,     x5.    +
                           a1y,
                                  ÷

person 8; X    s   a vector of socioeconomic characteristics                    (eg., education,

age, eto.(; y is a variable measuring the number of years that tne inmigrant

has resided In the country of destination; C is a vector of duumy variables

indicating the year in which migration occurred; and S                     is   a dummy variacle

set to unity if the observation is drawn from the 1980 Census, and rero

otherwise.     The vector of parameters             (a;,a;)     along   with the age coefficients in

the vector X provide a measure of the assimilation effect (i.e.,                       the rate at

which the age/earnings profile of migrants is converging to the age/earnings

profile of natives), while the vector of parameters                        estimate the cohort

effects. The period effects are given by                      for immigrants and by 7n for

natives.

     The model in equations           (26)   and   (27) is underidentified.         In particular,

some of the right hand side variables in the immigrant earnings function are

                                                 —19—
perfectly collinear.                 Suppose,    for example, thst the immigrant              arrived in

cslendar year 9 so that                     1.      Then:
                        C9


       y      (T—k—9) + mk                                                                                 (28)



where T is the calendar year in which the latest cross-section                                is observed

and k is the number of years separating the two cross—sections.                                The

variable cspturing the period effect, therefore, is a linear combination of

the cohort variable and of the years—since-migration                              variable.   Cbviously,

two cross-sections             cannot be used to identify three separate effects:

period,    cohort, and aging effects.

       In order to estimate the structural                   parameters describing the extent of

immigrant assimilation and cohort quality change a restriction must be

Imposed on the size of the period effect in the migrant population.                                  A

reasonable,      though unverifiable,               assumption         is that the period effect

experienced by           irtsnigrants    (7,)    is identical to the period effect experience

by natives (7)           .    In    other words, changes in the wage rate due to shifts in

aggregate      economic conditions affect the irmnigrant and native wage levels by

the same relative magnitude. It is easy to show that this restriction is

sufficient to exactly identify all the structural parameters in equations

(26)    and   (27)   .       This   theoretical     restriction leaves some amplitude for its

empirical implementation since the choice of the native base is essentially

arbitrary.       The choice of a native base for the various irrmigrant groups

under study will be discussed in detail below.

       There are two dimensions of migrant quality that can be calculated from

the estimated regressions in                 (26)   and     (27)   :    (a)   the entry wage of immigrants

when they arrive into the United States; and                            (b)   the rate at which this

wage changes over time.                 To simplify the empirical analysis the two measures

will be combined into a single measure of ixmnigrant quality. In particular,

                                                      —20—
let   .(8) be          the entry wage of an ixmsigrant cohort that arrives in the

United States at age 20 in calendar year                        8,      and let     be the entry wage

of a comparable (in terms                 of   all observable economic variables)            native

person that enters the labor market at age 20. Similarly, let g. be the

rate at which the earnings of irmnigrants grow over their lifetime,                              and

g     be the growth rate for natives.                     Finally, let r be the rate of discount

(assumed to be the same for migrants and natives)                                 If persons are in-

finitely lived, the present values associated with the earnings streams

of migrants and natives are given by:

      The percentage difference in present values between ixtmigrants of cohort 9

and   natives         is defined by:



      tn(V(9)/V )              (Zn   ,(e)      — Zn         — Zn(r—g.J       + Zn(r—g n ),              (31)
                                                      n(


and a first—order approximation                     (using the assumption that earnings

growth rates are small relative to the discount rate) yields:


                                                                p

      Hence the percentage difference in the present value of the earnings

streams faced by imnigrants                 and natives is an additive function of               the wage
differential at the time of entry, and of the difference in earnings growth

    The present value differential in                          (32)       oan be easily evaluated from the

rate of discount is assumed to be 5 percent.                                  Clearly, the assumption of any

higher discount rate would lead to a worsening of relative Immigrant earnings

since the latter part of the working life cycle (where immigrants tend to do

better) would be more heavily discounted.                                                                  and g
                                                                          Second, the growth rates
                                                                                                      ,
must be evaluated from the age and years-since—migration coefficients in the

earnings functions          in   (26)      and    (27)   .    The quadratic specification for age and

years-since-migration            in the earnings functions implies that the growth rate

is not constant over time.                     The empirical analysis below will define the

growth rate g. and g             by:

where Y(X,A,y,8) is the predicted                        (Zn) earnings           for an immigrant

States, and who migrated in cohort e.                           Similarly,           Yn)XA) gives the predicted
earnings for a native with characteristics X at age A.                                    In other words, the

average growth rate experienced by immigrants and natives between ages 20 and

50 (evaluated at the mean characteristics                             of the migrant population,       X) is

used for estimation of the growth rate in the present value expressions.

    This approach has the useful property that the growth rates (for both

immigrants        and natives) are basically a linear function of regression

coefficients,        and since the entry wages are given by Y,(X,20,0,8( for

immigrants and Y(X,20( for matives, the present value expressions in                                      (33)

and   (34)   ar   also linear functions of regressions coefficients          and hence a

standard error      can be easily evaluated.

      This approach marks a rather important departure from the empirical

tradition in the literature         that analyzes immigrant earnings.        The entire

literature essentially         focuses on the estimation of entry wage levels, and on

Ite   calculation of "overtaking" points (if they exist)            This type of

analysis is basically irrelevant         if overtaking points occur rather late in

the life cycle (or if they do not occur at all) as some recent evidence

suggests.     The empirical use of the present value of earnings is much more

consistent with the theoretical content of the theory of migration and

deemphasizes      the somewhat misleading concept of overtaking points.           The

analysis of the success of migrant groups in the United States, to borrow

from the huoan      capital theory that guided much early     research on immigrant

earnings, should not be based on the calculation of wage differentials                at

given ages, but on       the   life cycle wealth accumulated by migrants and natives.

Hence the present value approach used in the empirical sections of this paper

is much more in the tradition of the human capital literature and of the Roy

model of immigration developed in the previous section.

4.    Zarnings of    Iigrants in the United      States

      4.1.   Data and Descriptive Statistics

      This section analyzes the relative earnings of immigrants             in the U.S.

labor market.       The data are drawn from the 1970 2/100 U.S. Census          (obtained

by pooling the 5% SMSA and County Group Sample and the 5% State Sample) and

the 1980 5/100     A   Sample.   The complete samples are used in the creation of

the immigrant extracts, but random samples are drawn for the native

'baseline" populations.9         The analysis is restricted to men aged 25-64 who

satisfied five sample selection rules:           (1) the individual   was   employed in
the   calendar year prior to the Census;       (2) the individual     was not self—

                                          —23—
employed   or working without pay; (3) the individual was not in the                Armed

Forces   (as   of the survey week)   ;    (4) the individual did not reside in group

iarters; and      (5)   the individual reported annual earnings exoeeding $1000.

Throughout     this section, the dependent variable is the logarithm of the

individual's wage rate in the calendar year prior to the Census.

    Forty one countries were chosen for analysis.             These countries were

selected on the basis that both the 1970 and 1980 Censuses contained a

substantial number of migrants           from that country.   In particular, it is

necessary to have at least 80 observations cf persons born in a particular

foreign country in the pooled 2/100 1970 Census to enter the sample of 41

countries.     The countries thus chosen account for over 90 percent of all

irmigration to the United States between 1951 and 1980.               It must be noted,

however, that this restriction omits some countries which during the late

l970s became important       source countries (e.g., Vietnam)     .   Since   two

Censuses are reotired for the complete identification of the parameters

of the model presented in Section 3, hcwever, a systematic analysis of

the relative earnings of these migrants will have to await the 1990 Census.

    Table 1 begins the empirical analysis by presenting the unstandardired

differential between the log wage rate of the various migrant groups and

"natives".     In these statistics, the native population is defined as the

group of U.S. born white, non-Hispanic, non-Asian men aged 25-64.                   Perhaps

the most striking finding in the table is the fact that migrants from

European countries tend to have wage rates that often exceed the wages of

white natives,    while migrants from Asian or Latin American countries tend to

have wage rates that are substantially below those of white natives.

    Table 1 also presents the relative earnings of the 1965—1969 cohort cf

migrants as of 1970, the relative earnings of the same cohort in 1980, and

the relative earnings of the 1975—1979 cohort as of 1980.              These statistics

                                            —24—
yield important insights into the process of assimilation        (the rate at whicn

the earnings of migrants and nativea are converging) and into the extent of

productivitydifferences across successive cohorts.          The "tracking" of the

1965—1969 cohort across Censuses shows that the relative earnings of this

cohort of migrants improved over time for most national groups.         At the same

time, the comparison of successive     issnigrant cohorts   (i.e., the comparison   of

the 1965—1969 cohort as of 1969 and the 1975—1979 cohort as of 1979) shows

that for some countries     the relative earnings of migrants increased, while

for other countries     the relative earnings of migrants decreased substanti-

ally.   For example, the most recent migrant from France in 1970 was earning

about 8 percent less than natives at the time of entry, while the most recent

migrant from France in 1980 was earning about 22 percent more than natives at

the time of entry.      Conversely, the most recent migrant from India in 1970

earned about   4   percent more than white natives at the time of entry, but the

moat recent migrants from India in 1980 was earning 21 percent less than

white natives at the time of entry.

    Table 2 continues the descriptive analysis by presenting the mean

(completed) education     level of four different cohorts of immigrants that

arrived in the 1960—1980 period.      Since the education data available in the

Census does not differentiate between education obtained prior to

immigration and education obtained in the United States after immigration,

the mean education levels for the 1970—74 and 1975—79 cohorts are obtained

from the 1980 Census, and the mean education levels for the 1960—64 and 1965—

69 cohorts   are obtained from the 1970 Census.     This use of the available

data is designed to minimize the contamination of the education

variable by post—migrationschooling.

    The statistics in Table 2 are consistent with the well-known secular

increase in education levels over time for practically all migrant cohorts.

                                       —25—
It is worth noting, however, that for some countries        the increase in

education has been quite small    (e.g.,    Portugal(, while for other countries

(e.g., Norway) it has been amazingly       large.   As the theoretical analyais in

Section II shows, these truncated education means can only be understood

in terms of the population means of the education distribution in the

countries of origin.    To provide some insights into the extent of self—

selection on the basis of education,       Table 2 also presents mean education

levels calculated for the population in the countries of origin.        The mean

education level for the lSGOs is calculated using enrollment data in the

various countries   of origin during the 1950s, while the mean education level

for the l970s is calculated using enrollment data in the various countries of

origin during the l960s.    The "lagged" construction of the variable giving

mean education levels in the country of origin is designed to account for the

fact that, in the samples used here, the average person migrated at age 20.

The relevant education distribution, therefore is given by that of persons

enrolled in school a few years earlierJ°

    The means in Table 2 present a remarkable picture.        Even after allowing

for the substantial errors involved in calculating the population means for each

country of origin, the truncated means are almost always much greater than

the population means.    For example, the mean of education in Haiti is about 3

years, but the most recent Haitian immigrants report 10 years of education in

the 1980 Census.    Surprisingly, the two statistics are most similar for Mexico,

where both immigrants and the Mexican population have 6-7 years of education.

Overall, Table 2 suggests that immigrants are positively selected on the

basis of education.     The model presented earlier implies that this result is

consistent   with the hypothesis that the "rate of return" to education is

greater in the United States than in most countries of origin.11



                                      —26—
    4.2.     Basic Regression Results

    The regression model in equations           (26)   and   (27)   was estimated on each of

the 41 countries under analysis using the pooled 1970 and 1980 Census data.

As noted earlier, the choice of the native baseline is an important step in

the estimation procedure.            In this section, the reference group is chosen

according to the race/ethnic background of the population of each country of

origin.     The estimation uses the white, non—Hispanic, non—Asian sample of

native men as the reference group for migrants from Europe, Canada, and the

Middle East.        The group of Asian natives is the reference group for migrants

from all other Asian countries.            The group of Mexican natives is the

reference group for Mexiran migrants, and the group of "other Hispanic" men

is the reference group for persons from all other Spanish—speaking                countries

in the American continent.           Finally, the group of black natives is the

reference group for migrants from countries with predoninantly black

populations     (i.e., Haiti, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago).

    The definition of the reference group in terms of the racial/ethnic

baokground of the      irrsnigrant   population is a simple way of specifying

different    period effects for the various         itisnigrant groups.    Presumably, the

impact of changes in aggregate economic conditions on irrmigrant earnings is

likely to be better approximated by the period effects experiencedby

populations     which closely resemble the inroigrant group.            It is important to

note, however,      that although che baseline populations differ across the 41

countries,    the calculation        of the present value differentials defined in

equation     (32)   will always be relative to white, non—Hispanic,          non—Asian

natives (as in Table       1) .   In   other words, the use of alternative      reference


groups is simply used to "net out" the period effect in the 1980 Census, and

after controlling for period effects all comparisons between migrants and

natives are conducted with respect to the "white" population.

                                             —27—
    The calculated present value differentials        estimated   from the 41 runs of

the model are presented in Table      3   for each of the 6 cohorts identifiable    in

the Census data.     it is worth stressing that these present value

differentials    measure the differences in earnings among migrants and white

natives of equal measured skills, and hence are empirical         counterparts   to the

quality measure Q     defined in terms of unobserved characteristics.

    Table 3 shows that there are substantial differences in the "abilities" of

migrant groups aoross the 41 countries of origin.         Immigrsnts from European

countries    (particularly   Western European countries) tend to do otite well

relative to white natives of comparable socioeconomic        characteristics.

Recent immigrants from the U.K., for example, can expect about 10 percent

larger earnings over their lifetime than comparable white natives;         recent

immigrants from France will earn about 8—19 percent more then comparable

white natives;    and recent immigrants from Sweden will earn about 10—20

percent more than white natives over their lifetime.

    On the other hand, immigrants from most Asian and Latin Amerioan

countries    do not perform well in comparison to white natives of equal

observable skills.     Recent immigrants from Taiwan, for example, will earn

about 16-34 percent less over their lifetime than comparable         white natives;

immigrants from Israel will earn about 20—30 percent less than whites;

immigrants from Argentina will earn about 20 percent less than whites, and

immigrants from    Coloia    will earn about 24-38 percent less than comparable

whites.     An immi.grant's birthplace plays an important role in determining the

type of selection that characterizes the migrant flow.

    In addition,    Table 3 shows that even within a given country of origin

there are sizable differences     in the unobservedquality of immigrants across

the various cohorts. The quality of immigrants         from some countries has been

increasing rapidly, while the quality of immigrants from other countries has

                                          —28—
been declining rapidly.     For instance, the most recent French immigrants             have

a higher earnings potential than earlier cohorts             (particularly those arriving

before 1970), while the most recent Polish migrants have much lower earnings

potential than migrants of earlier cohorts.              Similarly,   the most recent

Canadian immigrants earn about 8—15 percent more than most of the earlier

cohorts,    while the most recent Mexican inraigrants earn about 9—13 percent

less than the earlier Mexican cohorts.1

    4.3. Determinants of Selectiom in Unobserved Characteristics

    The Roy model suggests that the quality differentials documented in Table 3

ran be flexpiained by economic and political characteristics              of both the vsricus

countries    of origin end the United States at the time of migration.

    Because it is easier to obtain such data for the post-1960 period, and

also to maintain comparability with the analysis that will be conducted in

the next section across nost countries, the empirical study in this

section focuses in explaining the variation in quality across the four

cohorts that arrived in the post-1960      period         Hence there are 164

observations    (41 countries   times 4 cohorts per country) in the data set

analyzed here.     The aggregate variables used in the analysis, for the most

part, are obtained from my earlier study (sorjas, 1987) and are described in

Table 5.    They include measures of political conditions in the country

of origin, mobility costs, and characteristics            of the income distribution

(the mean and the variance)

    The empirical analysis of the differences in the present value

differentials between immigrants and natives in the 164 observation data set

is presented in Table    5.     The first column of the table presents estimates

of the reduced—form equation derived in       (11)   .   This   regression reveals that a

relatively small number of country-specific variables explains a large

fraction of the inter-and intra-country variance in the unobserved quality

                                       —29—
of immigrants      Many of the aggregate characteristics are statistically

significant.     Consider,   for inatance,   the variable measuring the extent of

income inequality in the country of      origin.   The coefficient of this variable

is negative and marginally significant,       as predicted by the theory.

Similarly,    the difference between mean GNP in the country of origin and

mean GNP in the U.S. is positive and significant, indicating the fact that

migrants from countries with advanced economies are characterized by

larger levels of unobserved abilities or productivities.

    It is worth stressing that the measure of income inequality is not only

statistically significant, but also has a sizable numerical impact on the

quality of the immigrant flow.      This point is best illustrated by

considering two countries:      the United Kingdom and Mexico.    The inequality

measure takes on a value of 4.0 for the U.K. and of 12.3 for Mexico.          The

regression coefficient in Table 5 suggests that, holding all other factors

constant,    Mexican immigrants earn 3—4 percent less than Eritish immigrants

simply because of the selectivity effects of higher levels of income

inequality.

    Three other variables seem to be quite important in the regression.             The

first measures the English proficiency of the immigrant pool.        Immigrants

from countries    wher   English is prevalent do much better in the U.S. than

immigrants from non—English—speakingcountries.         Second, the unemployment

rate in the U.S. is an important determinant of immigrant quality:          The

higher the unemployment rate at the time of migration, the better the

quality of the migrant pool.      This result is consistent with the Roy model if

unemployment particularly affects the earnings opportunities of low—skilled

workers.     For instance, an increase in the unemployment rate will worsen the

opportunities for persons in the lower end of the ability (i.e., income)

distribution,    and hence will lead to reduced incentives for these persons to

                                       —30—
migrate.    The quality of the self-selected ixmaigrant pool increases as a

result of the withdrawal from the "immigrant market" of these persons.

      Finally,    the reduced form regression in Table 5 introduces a       duxmrty


variable signaling whether the cohort arrived in the post—1970 period.

Recall that U.S. ixmmigration policy was changed drastically by the 1965

Amendments (which became fully effective in 1968)        .   Hence pnst-1968 cohorts,

holding constant characteristics        of the country of origin, should have

                                                             This is precisely what
significantly lower earnings than earlier cohorts.

the results in Table 5 indicate.         In particular, post-1970     cohorts have


nearly 16 percent lower (relative) earnings over the life cycle than
                                                                       This result
immigrants who arrived prior to the change in U.S. policy.
                                                                  occurred in
provides striking evidence of a significant structural shift that

the unobserved quality of U.S. immigrants         in the last two decades.       This


change may well be due to the fact that occupational and skill requirements

were deemphasired by the 1965 Amendments, and that family reunification was

made the primary goal of U.S. immigration policy.

      As noted earlier, since data exists on the emigration rate of
                                                             the number of immigrants
irmnigrants from any given country of origin (i.e.,

in a particular cohort, and the population         of the country of origin at the

time of migration),      the selectivity variable k can be calculated, and

the   structural equation in     (12)   can be estimated.    The   structural equation is
written as         = h? and  the h function can be approximated by h =
where   I is     the vector of variables proxying for the relevant primitive
                                                             (ZX(=
parameters.        Hence the empirical counterpart to (12) is Q,

This structural equation is presented in the second column of Table 5. The

selectivity variabie directly controls for changes in mobility costs anc
means   of income distributions and these variables are omatted
from the structural regression.          Remarkably, the structural     equation leads to

                                           —31—
estimates that are highly significant and very supportive of the Roy model.

In particular,     the   ineality   variable becomes negative and very significant,

the unemploment variable       retrains   pcaitive and significant,   and the dummy

variable indexing post—1970 cohorts remains negative and strong.

      The estimated regression parameters can be used to calculated h =         z.
The estimates of h are presented at the bottom of column 2 in Table 6.            Three

estimates are presented:       one evaluated at the mean of all the variables,         a

second one evaluated at the same means but letting the dummy variable UStAW

index pre-1970 cohorts, and a third evaluated at the same means but letting

the dummy variable USLAW index post-1970 cohorts.          These simulations   show

that there seemed to be weak positive selection prior to 1970, but very

strong negative selection in the post-1970 period.

      4.4.   teterminants of Seleotiom in Education

      As noted earlier, self-selection       occurs not only on the basis of

unobserved ability, but also on the basis of observed characteristics           such

as education. Table 2 documented that there are strong differences in

educational attainment across immigrant groups from different countries.               In

addition,     it was seen that the observed educational attainment of immigrant

groups differed from the mean educational attainment of the population in the

country of origin.       It is of interest, therefore,    to analyre whether the same

variables that detemmine the extent of differences in unobserved char-

acteristics can also explain the differences in educational attainment

across immigrant groups.

      Table 6 presents the regressions attempting to estimate equations         (24)


and   (25)   using the 164 observations for all four post—1960 cohorts.        Consider

the reduced foum regression in the first column of the table.           Many of the

variables are stetistioally significant, and the regression has a relatively

high explanatory power: the few variables included in the regression

                                          —32—
explain nearly two thirds of the educational attainment differential across

io'migranta cohorts.    It is worth noting that the political variables have

significant positive impacts on the level of educational attainment of

immigrants.    Individuals from countries      with politically competitive parties,

from communist countries,    or from countries that recently lost their

freedom all have higher educational attainment        (relative to countries that

are not cormounist and that are not politically competitive)      -   It       is also

worth noting that distance from the IhS. has a positive impact on educational

attainment.    This is what wouid be expected if there is positive selection in

education. As distance increases the emigration rate declines-                 Since fewec


persons migrate, and since there is positive selection, the mean educatconai

attainment increases.     cn the other hand, the ON? variable implies the

opposite,   since it has a negative impact on educational      attainment.        As ON?

in the country of origin increases (relative to the        USJ   the migration        rate

should also decline, and if there is positive selection in education the

educational attainment of migrants should increase-         The reduced form

regression in Table 6 contradicts this prediction.

    Finally,   the regression   shows that the mean level of educational

attainment in the country of origin has a positive impact on the mean

educational attainment of immigrants, and that the coefficient, as predicted,

is between 0 and 1.     This confirmation of the theory, however, should be

treated with some caution since the mean education level in the country of

origin is measured with substantial error.

    The second column in Table 6 presents the structurai regression on the

truncated mean of the education distribution (see equation (25))           -    One

interesting experiment that can be conducted with the structural estimates is

to predict the coefficient of X, as in Table 5.         This prediction (at the mean

ievei   of the variable in the regression) is presented in the last row of the
                                       —33--
table and is seen to be positive and significant.                There seems to be,

therefore,    aignifioant positive selection in the educational              attainment of

irrmigrants.    Note that the USIAW coefficient is insignificantly                 different

from zero.     This implies that the positive selection found in educational

attainment was unaffected by the changes in policy associated with the 1965

Amencments.

5.    Ixigrant Sorting Across Host Countries
      The last section showed that the labor market performance of                  issnigranta
currently living in the U.S. is strongly influenced by economic and political
characteristics of the country of origin at the time of migration. Potential
emigrants in the source countries, however, chose to come to the United
States instead of migrating to other potential countries of destination. In
a    sense, the observed pool of irmigrants in the U.S. is the outcome of

competition in the "irrmigrant market' among various countries of destination.

Different countries,     by offering different         ixzsnigraticn   policies and different

income distributions,      wil_ attract different kinds of inigranta.

      As noted earlier, three countries, Australia, Canada, and the United

States, have been the main countries of destination               for permanent migranta in

recent years.     Each of theae countries, of course, is characterized by a long

history of irrmigraticn.       The size of the recent flows generated by the self-

selection of    irrsnigranta   into each of the three potential countries of

destination is illustrated in Table 7.           Over the 1959—81 period, about 14.7

million persons legally left the various countries of origin and migrated to

either Australia, Canada, or the United States.               Sixty percent of these

migrants chose the United States as their destination, and the remainder were

evenly split between Australia and Canada.              Table 7 also shows that these

statistics vary significantly between the early part of the period (1959-70),

and the later part of the period (1971-81)         .     Recent migrants     are

                                          —34—
disproportionatelymore likely to select the 0.5. as their destinaton

(nearly two thirds of migrants in the 197 Os chose to do so) ,       and

disproportionately     less likely to choose Australia as therr destination          (only

14 percent did so)

     These aggregate    statistics mask important country—of-origin     differences.


During the 1971—91 period, the        US.    was less likely to attract immigrants

from Africa, the United Kingdom, and Europe, and significantly more likely to

attract immogrants from Asia or North and South America           Canada,   on the

other hand, seemed a relatively attractive destination for irmzigrsnts from

Africa, the U.K.       and Europe, while Australia was the destination of choice

for persons anigratong the United Kingdom:          Nearly half of the 2 million

persons who left the U.K. in the 1959-1981 period migrated to Australia          S4

     5,1.    Migration Policies in Most Countries

     One important     constraint   on the size and the composition of the flow of

mIgrants to potential host countries is the set of statutes and policies used
by the various countries to screen the applicant pool. U.S. immigration
policy, prior to the 1965 Amendments to the Immigration and Nationality Act,
was guided    by the   objective    of restricting the migration of persons whose

national origin did not resemble the national origin and ethnic composition

of the United States population in 1919.           The 1965 Amendments abolished the

"discriminatory"national origin quota system, and instituted the goal of
                                                                                     Tnese
family reunification as the main objective of U.S. immigration policy.

changes,     as we saw above, may have been responsible for a very large decline

in   the unobserved skills of immigrants admitted by the United States.
     Canadian    immigration policy, until 1961, also had a preferential

treatment     of immigrants originating in Western European countries.        The 1962

                                                                      and
Immigration Act (and further relatively minor changes in the statutes
                                                                      and racial
regulations through the l970a) removed the country—of-origin
                                            —35—
restrictions,     and shifted emphasis towards skill rewioements. Under the new

regulations,     potential migrants who were not relatives of Canadian citizens

or residents could enter Canada if ohey passed a "teat"                 -
                                                                            Applicants were
graded and given up to 100 points according to a "point system", and 50

points were necessary to obtain permission to migrate to Canada.                       These

points were given according to the applicant's education                    (a point   per year of

schooling,    up to 20 points)   ,   occupational demand      (10   points if the

applicant's occupation was in strong demand in Canada), age )up to 10 points

for applicants under the age of         35,    minus 1 point for each year over age 35),

a "personal assessment" by the irmsigration officer that was valued up to 15

points, etc.      In 1976, the Canadian Irigration Act was amended to

incorporate    the goal of family reunification         as an important policy

objective.

      Australian lrmLigratson policy has a long history of restricting the

migration of persons who are not of British origin.                 These restrictions,

known as the "white Australia Policy", operated both in terms of denying

entry to persons of non—British or non—Northern European origin, and also in

terms of denying financial assistance            (to cover   transportation       and

resettlement expenses) to undesirable migrants.

      World War II raised doubts among Australian officials about the

feasibility    of defending a large continent with a small population, and a

series of governments pursued a national policy of substantially increasing

the   nuxer of   irmigrants who chose Australia         as their destination.           This

objective,    however, could not be achieved by only allowing the migration                    of

British citizens, and thus Australia began looking elsewhere for migrants

(e.g., Germany,    the Netherlands, Malta, Italy and Greece all signed formal

arrangements with the Australian government to recruit and assist persons

from these countries in their migration to Australia)               .   Further political
                                              —36—
changes in Australia         led to the abolishment of the White Australoa Policy on

1972.     An immigration policy devoid of discrimination       by national origin and

cace was announced,         and a point system based on the Canadian system was

instituted.          During the early l980s, Australia began to stress the concept of

family reunification         in its migration policy (see Sirrell,   1983) -    It   is


unlikely,       however,   that this shift in policy will have much impact on the

1981 Australian Census data that will be analyzed below.

    The impact of tnese changes in immigration policy on the national orogin

composition of the immigrant pool in each of the countries is documented in

        5.2.     Data and Descriptive Statistics
                                                                        each of
        The data are drawn from Census Public Use Samples available for

 the three destination countries.           The U.S. data is identical to that used in

                                             —37—
 the previous sectaon,    and reuires no further description.

     The Canadian Censuses were conducted in 1971 and 1981.        Both of these
Censuses have the important characteristic that they report the year in which

 foreign—born persons arrived in Canada.       Hence the aging/cohort decomposition

described in Section 3 can be carried out.         The 1971 data for both iossigrants

and natives residing in Canada is a 1/100 rsndom sample of the Canadia

                while the 1981 micro file is a 2/100 random
population,                                                 sample of the

Canadian population.      All observations that satisfy the sample restriction of

being prime-age men (aged 25-64), not self-employed, not residing in group

quarters,   and whose records report positive annual earnings in the year prior

to the Census are used in the analysis.

    The Australian data used in this paper are drawn from the 1981 Census of

Population and Housing, the only micro Australian Census file available at

present.    This Census file is a 1/100 random sample of the Australian

population,     and the entire sample (for both iiigrants and natives) that

satisfies   the sample restrictions listed above is used.

    Three important     problems are raised by the Australian data.     First, only

one Census is available     and, therefore, the aging/cohort                    cannon
                                                                decomposition

be conducted.     The Australian results, therefore, are not directly comparable

to those for the other two countriea.        Nevertheless, a simple solution that

allows some rough comparisons will be proposed below,         Second, the Australian

Census does not report annual earnings, but instead reports annual incomes

)whirh inolude non—salary receipts)    .   This   problem may not be very serious
since the analysis    focuses on native/imigrant earnings differences,      end

self—employed    persons are umitted from the study.     Finally, the Australian

Census (unlike the U.S. or Canadian data) does not contain good measures

of labor supply. Hence a wage rate for the year prior to the Census cannot

be calculated.     The empirical analysis in this section, therefore,     will be

                                      —38—
conducted on the logarithm of annual earnings.                Tt is important to note,

however,    that the analysis for both the U.S. and Canada was replicated

using the wage rate as the dependent variable, with little change in the

otalitative nature of the results.

    Table     9   presents   surwtary   statistics     (mean earnings and education)   as well

as sample sires for the various samples that will be used in the analysisS6

In addition,       Table 9 decomposes the immigrant population          in each of the host

countries     according to the continent of origin.            This decomposition by

continent (rather than country) is mandated by the fact that in both the

Australian and Canadian Censuses the decomposition by country leads to a very

small    nuer of      observations for most countries.           In addition, the Canadian

Censuses identify the country of origin only for a select group of Western

European smaigrants.

    The results for the United States, as expected, show a downward trend
in the earnings of immigrants (relative to natives) over the decade. Tne
average     immigrant   in 1970 earned, on average, about as much as the typical

native     wor:Cer.   By 1930, however, immigrant earnings were about 15 percent

below the native wage.          The Canadian data show little change in the rela-

tive earninga of ixrmigrants between 1971 and 1981.                Tn both Censuses, the

                                                                native
average immigrant had slightly higher earnings than the typical

worker.      The exception seems to be immigrants originating in Latin Pmerioa;

their earnings are about 10 percent lower than those of Canadian natives in

1971, but 19 percent         lower in 1981.      The Australian Census shows that the

                                                        as the typical native
typical immigrant in 1981 had roughly the same earnings

person, and that the differential varied somewhat by country of origin.
                                                                           with the
        Tt is instructive to compare the Australian statistics

relevant numbers for Canada end the U.S.                 For instance, European immigrants

                                                                  the migrant
 in Australia actually have the lowest education levels of any of
                                               —39—.
 groups in Australia, and have a wage disadvantage of only 5 percent.              In

 Canada, European immigrants also tend to have slightly lower educational

 levels, but higher eernings than natives, while in the U.S.            Eurocean

 immigrants    outperform   all other   immigrant groups    despite the fact that they
 have lower educational levels than        the native population. This comparison
 (as   well as similar comparisons for other regions of origin) reveals the non—

 random sorting of migrants across the various host countries.

       An important insight is provided by these statistics:          Generalizations

about the productivity or earnings capacities           of ethnic or national groups
are misleading sinre they ignore the self-selectivity that
                                                           generated the

composition of the migrant pool in each of the host countries.             In other

words, there is no such thing as "the" impeot of Asian ethnicity or race on

immigrant esrnings.      The value attached by the host country's        labor market 00

ethnic/racial characteristics      depends greatly on the kinds of selections           ohao
generated the particular flow of migrants.
       5.3.   1980-81 Cross-Section     Regressions

       Since the aging/cohort decomposition        cannot be conducted for the

Australian data, it is instructive to begin the empirical analysis by

focusing on the 1980—81 cross—section.           Table 10 presents cross—section

earnings function estimated separately in the samples of immigrants and

natives in each of the three countries           of destination.   The regressions in
the native samples are of interest mainly because
                                                  they are so similar across
the destination countries.       The coefficients      of age, marital status, and

urbanization status all have the expected signs and are of similar magnitudes

whether the labor market is in Australia, Canada, or the United States.               The

only coefficient that seems to be an outlier in the native samples is that of

education in Australia, where the coefficient is almost twice as large as

that in the U.S. or Canada.

                                          —40—
     The regressions     in the immigrant samples are interesting because they

illustrate the general result that practically all socioeconomic variables

have a smaller impact among immi.grants than among natives regardless of the

country of destination.       The earnings of irtsrtigcants are much less responsive

to socioeconomic characteristics       than the earnings of natives in these

economies.

     The immigrant regressions      in Table 10 also include a vector of variables

indicating the time of migration.1           An important use of these coefficients

(and of the socioeconomic       variables)    is to predict the size of the wage

                 between immigrants and natives for each of the cohorts.            These
differentials

                                                                                     of
predictions are calcalated ising the mean socioeconomic characteristics

the immigrant sample in each of the host oountrres.           In addition, these

                                                                           20
predictions ace obtained by holding the age of immigration constant at age

for all cohocts         Hence the typical immigrant    in the 1975—1980 cohort is 23

years   old   when   the predictron is calculated, the typical     immigrant in 1970-74

is   28 years old, etc.      The predicted age/earnings profile, therefore,

                                                      These profiles are presented        in
incorporates both aging and cohort effects.

Table 11.

      The U.S. and Canadian profiles resemble the ones usually reported in the

literature:      The earlier cohorts, either because they are older and have oeen

in   the country longer, or because there are vintage or cohort effects,            do

much better in       the labor market than more recent cohorts.      Table 11, however,


shows that the Australian experience          is very different.   The Australian

                                                                                     In
cross-section age/earnings profile for immigrants is essentially flat!
                                                          in the relative
fact, it is impossible to find any statistical difference
                                                                   after
earnings of immigrants among the cohorts that arrived in Australia

1950.    Their relative earnings hover around 7-8 percent less than natives,

and there is no discernible trend over time.            This result implies that if

                                             —41—
there is any assimilation effect in Australia the quality of imaigrants to

Australia must have increased in the 1960—80 period.            Hence a simple

comparison of the cross-section regressions acrcss the destination countries

leads to an important finding ebout the trends that mark the self—selection

of irmnigrant flows to the host countries over the last two decades.

     5.4.   Present Value Differentials

    Sinoe two Censuses are required to identify aging and cohort effects, the

analysis of equations    (26)   and (27) is initially restricted to the U.S. and

Canadian Censuses.     Within each country of destination,        five insnigrant

samples will be analyzed:       the pooled sample, and the subsamples         of

imzsigrants originating in Africa, Asia, Europe and Latin America.             These

regressions    are used to calculate the present value differential between

immigrants and natives for each of the cohorts.            These present value

differentials    are presented in Table 12. (The date presented in Table 12 too

Australia   will be discussed in detail below)

    Consider initially the pooled sample of immigrants.            Table 12 documents

the systematic decline in the quality of iigrsnts arriving in the U.S. over

the lest two decades.     For instance, the typical imaigrent arriving in           i0E0
64 in the U.S. hed only a slight wage disadvantage           relative to a compsoshie

native, while the typical issnigrent arriving in the U.S. in 1975—1979 has a

wage disadvantage of nearly 27 percent over the life cycle as compared to the

native baseline.     Remarkebly, the Canadian Censuses reveals very similar

patterns:     The 1960—64 migrant to Canada has a 6 percent wage disadvantage

over the life cycle    (relative to natives)   ,   while   the disedventege   for the

most recent migrants (1975—80) has increased to nearly 23 percent.

    The Ameriren and Canadian trends are less similar when the analysis is

restricted to men from a specific country of origin.            For example, among

European immigrants, the U.S. Census reveals a substentiel decline in quali:y

                                       —42—
(from a 4 percent advantage to an 11 percent disadvantage)                       over the last

twenty years, while the Canadian Census reveals a roughly stable wage

differential between immigrants and natives over the post—1960 cohorts.

Similarly among Asian immigrants, the Canadian data reveals that the 1960-64

cohort and the 1975-80 cohort had            essentially the       same    relative standing,
white   the U.S    data reveals a        decline in quality from          a 15   percent
disadvantage    to   a 27   percent disadvantage.          Theseresults, therefore, imply
that at least part of the similarity between               the U.S. and Canada at the

aggregate    level is   due      to the fact that the nationai origin composition of
the cohorts shifted over time,           away from European immigrants (who tend                  to   do

quite well in the labor market) to Asian             and   tatin American         immigrants (who
do much worse     in the labor market(
     As noted earlier, the Australian Census is only available for 1981.

Since cohort and      aging effects cannot be identified, the present value
differentials cannot        be   calculated directly.       Recall, however, that the              1981

cross—section regressions estimated in the Australian data showed that

immigrants in Australia face signcfcantly different age/earnings profiles
than their counterparts in the U.S. and Car.ada. In particular, in the cross—
section, there seers to          be   little relationship    between      the earnings of
immigrants   in Australia and         the length   of residence in Australia.              If   tnere
is ai    assimilation effect          in Australia, therefore, this result           must       imply
that the quality of immigrants to Australia                has increased over       the last two
or   three decades.

     A rough   estimate of       this   increase can be obtained          if it is assumed that
the unobserved assimilation           effect experienced by immigrants in Australia
reseles the       assimilation effect of similar            (i.e.,   persons from the           same

country of origin) persons in            Canada   or the United States.           Given thcs

approximation, the assimilation           effects    cam   then be subtracted from the
                                              —43—
Australian cross— section coefficients (thus netting out the role played by

pure aging in the generation of the croas-section      resulta), and the present

value differentials can be computed for each of the cohorts.        Since there are

two sets of assimilation parameters    (one for Canada and one for the U.S.), a

number of different approximations can be calculated,        in general, these

experiments   led to aimilar qualitative findings.     in this paper, therefore,

the assimilation rate used is the average of the two assimilation ratea

(i.e., the U.S. and Canada aging effects) experienced by ironigranta from the

same continent of origin.

    Given theae assimilation rates, and the cross—section regressions

estimated in the Australian Census for each region of origin, it is a simple

matter to calculate the predicted present value differential between the

various cohorts of i.migrants and comparable natives in Australia.          These

predictions   are also presented in Table 12.    Two substantive results are

worth noting.    As implied by the flat earnings profiles found in the (pocled(

Australian cross—section,    the quality of irigrsnts to Australia increased

slightly over the last 20—30 years.     The typical ironigrant in 1960—64 could

expect a 7 percent wage disadvantage over his life cycle, while the typical

irroigrant in 1975—80 has no wage disadvantage     relative to natives over his

life cycle.     Second, this increase in irmsigranr quality can essentially be

found in every one of the national origin groups under analysis.         For

example,   the typical European ixmnigrant   in the early l960s had a   7   percent

wage disadvantage,    while the typical European irroigrant in the late l970s has

a 7 percent wage advantage over natives.       Similarly,   the average Asian

ironigrant in the early SOs had 24 percent lower earnings over his life cycle

than natives, while the differential is only 6 percent (and insignificant)

for the most recent migrants.

      Given   this   assumption, the   statistics presented in   Table 12 present an

     The specification of                    (35)   builds in a very important         (and restrictive)

assumption.                 In particular, the relative earnings of s person from country i

 independence of irrelevant alternatives" assumption into the study.

Although this assumption is not likely to be strictly satisfied,                                it does

simplify the empirical analysis greatly,                               If the assumptionwas invalid,           fo

the characteristics                  of all ether potential countries of destination, snd the

reduced form equation,    for example, explain over 80 percent of the variance

in the quality measures presented in Table         12.    Despite this success,

however,    it must be noted that because the countries of origin are defined in

terms of continents, the two variables measuring country—of—origin

characteristics     (the relative GN? level and the extent of income inequality)

                                                                         It

Similarly, the inequality measure for the country of destination has a

measured by USLAW) has a negative and marginally significant effect, and thus

characteristics      (such as abilities and productivities)     .    In   addition, this

non-random sample is then scrted across various possible host countries in a

non—random way.       hence the pool of irsnigrants in any host country is,        in
a sense, doubly self-selected:         the pool of inmigrants       in the host country

are persons who found it profitable to leave the country of origin and

who did not find it profitable to go anywhere else.

    This paper attempts to use the economic theory of self—selection              as a

guide to undersoanding      how irrmtigrants perform in the labor market.        The

assumption      of wealth—maximizing   behavior provides important insights into the

mechanics    that guide the selection process.       It was seen, for example, that

the conditions required for positive (or negative) selection in abilities

have nothing to do with the conditions required for positive (or negative)

selection in education.       Self—selection    in abilities   (or unobserved

characteristics)      is guided by a comparison of income distributions         in the

country of origin and the country of destination: Positive (negative)

selection    occurs when the income distribution      in the country of origin has

lass   (more)   variance than the income distribution in the country of

destination,       self-selection   in education, on the other hand, is based

entirely on a comparison of which country attaches a higher value to

educational attainment.       Thus it is possible foo a given country of

dastination to attract highly educated persons, but that these highly

educated migrants are the least productive in the population of highly

educated workers.

    The empirical      analysis studied the role played by self—selection         in the

earnings of immigrants in the U.S., and compared these migrants to the pool

of migrants who chose to reside in other countries         (Australia or Canada)

       Data on international differences in income inequality are published
by the World Bank (1986)   .These data, however, do not correspond direotly

     6There is a slight technical problem which must be taken into account in
the derivation of this result. An increase in C1 "stretches" the income
distribution of the U.S., and will lead to a different mean wage level in
the pool of migrants even if this pool is restricted to include the same
persona.   A simple solution to this problem is to define quality in terms of
"standardized units", or Q1 Ic1   The prediction in the text ran then be

easily derived.

    7The determinants of the two tpes of selection, however, are not all
that different at a much more fundamental level. The sorting in observed
characteristics is guided by international differences in the prices    and
3,.  In the case of unobserved characteristics, the variances c and cI are
measures of the "prices" of unobserved ability aince this type of ability is
better rewarded in countries with higher levels of income inequality. The
sorting in unboserved characteristics, therefore, is also guided by
international differences in the relevant prices.

                                                                responsible
for this simple framework.   In particular, growth rates for insnigranta ace

allow for these typea of intersctions. However, the estimating equations

among the right-hand aide variables.

    9The construction of the data sets is described in detail in Sorjas
(1987)

    10The enrollment data is available in United Nations Educational,
Social, and Cultural Organization (1969,1980). Enrollments are available
for each "level" of education.  The data sources also give the number of
years of education associated with that "level" for each country.
The means presented in Table 2 are calculated using both of these
statistics.

    lt   is also consistent with the hypothesis that migration costs are
lower for persons with higher education levels. This hypothesis has
received intensive study in the migration literature; see, for example,
Schwartz (1968)

         is important to note that many of these differences in guality
across cohcrts from a given country of origin are statistically significant
at conventional levels. For some evidence on this point see Borjas (1987).

     13Since the dependent variable in the "second—stage" regressions is a
linear function of regression coefficients, the regressions are weighted to
account for neteroscedasticity.   See Borjas (1987) for details.

     14A number of previous studies (e.g., Tandon, 1978; Chiswick and
Miller, 1983; and Chiswick, 1987) analyze the labor market performance of
immigrants in Australia and Canada.   These studies, however, do not study
the non—random sorting of migrants across host countries.

    16Throughout this section, the entire native base in each of the host
countries is the entire population of native—persons (regardless of ethnic
or racial origin) - This differs from the native baselines chosen in the
previous section, but makes the comparisons among host countries less
