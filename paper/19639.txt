                                            ABSTRACT

Evidence from behavioral economics reveals that decision-making in health care settings can be affected
by circumstances and choice architecture. This paper conducts an analysis of choice of private Medicare
plans (Medicare Advantage plans) in Miami-Dade County. We provide a detailed description of the
choice of MA plans available in Miami over much of the program’s history and the composition of
Medicare beneficiaries in Miami over the 2000s. Our analysis suggests that first becoming eligible
for Medicare is the key transition point for MA, and that there is significant status quo bias in the MA
market. This consumer behavior has important implications for policy that regulates the MA market.

1. Introduction

           The Medicare program that provides health insurance to older Americans, offers

beneficiaries a choice of health plans. Beneficiaries can enroll in Traditional Medicare (TM),

which offers fee-for-service health insurance administered by the government, or they can

participate in the Medicare Advantage program (MA), also known as Part C of Medicare, where

beneficiaries select a private health plan offered by a health insurance company.1 MA plans

provide benefits that are at least actuarially equivalent to TM and most are managed care plans.

           Private plans were introduced into the Medicare program in 1985 with the dual goals of

offering beneficiaries a choice for their health insurance plan and of stimulating what was

thought to be efficient provision of health care stemming from competition and managing care

under a budget (McGuire et al 2011). The enrollment patterns of beneficiaries affect whether

the MA program is able to achieve these goals. In particular, when consumers are efficient

decision-makers who recognize and take advantage of a “better deal” when it is offered by an

MA plan, there is an incentive for plans to compete on price and quality. Yet, research on

consumer choice of health insurance plans finds that consumers’ enrollment decisions are often

affected by factors unrelated to the cost and quality of the health plan, such as the decision

context in which they choose a plan, and that this can result in consumers making poor choices.

In Medicare Advantage health insurance products are complex, many beneficiaries of the

program are frail, and only crude measures of plan performance exist. These market features

can increase the likelihood of errors in choice, for example, by a beneficiary failing to enroll in

the Medicare option (either an MA plan or TM) that best meets their needs.2

    Throughout the program’s history Part C has had several different names. Medicare Advantage dates

to the Medicare Modernization and Improvement Act of 2003.

    As a practical matter, it is difficult to identify errors in choice.


                                                             3
       Medicare Advantage regulations and policy have varied over the history of the program,

as has beneficiary enrollment. In the most recent decade, the enactment of the Medicare

Modernization and Improvement Act of 2003 (MMA) changed MA payment policy so as to

encourage growth in the MA program, both through an increase in number of private plans

offered to beneficiaries and an increase in the number of beneficiaries who enroll in MA. The

MMA’s efforts to spur growth in MA were primarily through large, across-the-board increases in

plan payments – that came at a high cost to the Federal government. Since 2003, the number

of plans available to beneficiaries steadily increased and plans began to offer richer benefit

packages than TM in the form of reduced out-of-pocket costs and extra benefits (MedPAC

2007; MedPAC 2009a). Nationally, MA enrollment increased dramatically, from 13% in 2003 to

27% in 2012 (Gold et al 2012). In general, Medicare beneficiaries who enroll in MA accept

having their care managed and the fact that they face some restrictions on physician networks

in exchange for more comprehensive coverage. The exceptions are the Private Fee-For-

Service (PFFS) plans, a set of MA options that during our study period did not impose

restrictions on physician networks. PFFS plans have been available since the mid-2000s.

Previous research on demand for MA, which we describe below, has focused on the

characteristics of beneficiaries enrolled in MA plans. Less attention has been given to

understanding the extent to which take-up of MA is consistent with efficient consumer decision

making.

       In this paper, we examine the choices of MA plans available to Medicare beneficiaries

over time and answer two sets of questions about the patterns of MA enrollment within one

market in order to enhance our understanding of demand for MA plans. First, what are the

patterns of demand for and enrollment into MA over the mid-2000s, when it becomes arguably a

“better deal” for consumers? Second, what characteristics of individuals and their

circumstances are associated with choice of MA? Is there evidence of status quo bias in

demand for MA plans?


                                                 4
          The study focuses on Miami-Dade County, Florida, a setting that we select for two main

reasons. First, Miami-Dade has a large elderly population with ethnic and socioeconomic

diversity. This variation provides a good setting to examine the role of beneficiary

characteristics on MA enrollment. Second, Miami-Dade County has consistently offered

beneficiaries an attractive alternative set of plans to TM, and MA penetration has been high.

MA plan choices in Miami have become even richer over the past decade. Thus, for payers and

policymakers who seek to understand the potential for MA to create an efficient marketplace,

analysis of the MA experience in Miami-Dade is potentially very informative.

          The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the relevant

literature on health insurance choice and decision-making. Section 3 describes and discusses

the MA market in Miami-Dade. Section 4 describes the data and methods. Section 5 presents

results, where we find evidence that certain observable sources of frictions explain why subsets

of Medicare beneficiaries select or switch into MA when others do not. We conclude in Section

6.



2. Relevant Literature

          Existing literature documents the experience of MA in terms of plan payments, the

number and types of MA plans offered, and the enrollment of beneficiaries in MA over time.3

Recent studies identify MA enrollees as more likely to be racial/ethnic minorities, have lower

income, and have less education than enrollees in TM (Norwalk, Testimony March 21, 2007;

McWilliams et al 2011). Particularly relevant to this study is the literature that examines the

3   Details on MA performance, in terms of program enrollment, spending, and quality are published

annually by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (see for example MedPAC 2011), and in

several reports available through The Commonwealth Fund (www.cmwf.org) and the Kaiser Family

Foundation (www.kff.org). (Gold 2009) and (Gold et al 2012) report on recent years of the MA program.

McGuire et al (2011) provides a review of the program’s economic history.



                                                     5
quality of consumer decision-making. Two types of problems have been identified in demand

behavior (a) poor information and (b) seemingly irrational behavior. A large literature has

treated information problems in health care. During the first two decades of the MA program,

when MA plan payments were adjusted for demographic factors but not enrollee health, thereby

creating strong incentives for plans to avoid enrolling sicker beneficiaries, MA plans experienced

favorable selection in comparison to TM by enrolling beneficiaries who were lower cost than

those in TM (Physician Payment Review Commission 1996; Medicare Payment Advisory

Commission 2000; Riley and Zarabozo 2006-2007). As of 2006, the introduction of risk-

adjusted payments that account for both an enrollee’s demographics and clinical diagnoses has

been found to have reduced favorable selection into MA (Newhouse et al 2012; McWilliams et al

2012).

         In this paper we focus on factors that lead to seemingly irrational choice, and in

particular draw on literature that health insurance choices are prone to frictions that lead to

status quo bias, i.e., the tendency for people to stay with their current health plan rather than

switch plans, which can inhibit optimal choices. In their seminal paper, Samuelson and

Zeckhauser (1988) discuss several factors that may contribute to status quo bias, some of

which, such as the presence of search and transition costs, uncertainty about alternate options,

and the decision to realize investments made in current choices (i.e. sunk costs), are consistent

with rational choice because they make change costly. The authors also find evidence

suggestive that status quo bias can result from psychologically based deviations from the

rational choice model, due to an endowment effect where a possession takes on an

exaggerated value relative to what people would pay for it for the first time in the market

(Tversky and Kahneman 1991) and regret avoidance, where people do not switch plans so as to

avoid learning that their initial choice was a bad one (Kahneman and Tversky 1982). Other

studies report evidence of status quo bias in private health insurance markets (Strombom et al.

2002), including one instance where the consequence of this inertia was for consumers to


                                                  6
remain enrolled in a plan that was unequivocally worse than another available option for all

enrollees (i.e. a dominated plan) (Sinaiko and Hirth 2011).

       A substantial theoretical and empirical literature finds that consumers are frequently

susceptible to defaults, often as a result of inertia, and that these passive decisions are not

reflective of conscious or meaningful choices but instead result from other forces, like

procrastination (Beshears et al 2008). This literature on passive choice and susceptibility

towards defaults is largely focused on financial planning and savings decisions but has also

been applied to a range of other issues ranging from organ donation to product warranties (see

for example, Goldstein et al 2008; Madrian and Shea 2001), where there is significant

uncertainty, high-stakes, and anxiety. Uncertainty, high-stakes and anxiety are three features

often present in decisions to enroll in or switch among health plans, and thus different outcomes

from decisions made in circumstances of passive versus active choice are likely to be observed

in the Medicare program as well.

       Complexity in the decision context can arise both due to difficult choices and an

increasing number of choices. This latter circumstance, termed “choice overload” has been

shown to exacerbate status quo bias, as complexity in the decision context leads individuals to

avoid making a choice, and is inconsistent with standard economic models of demand (Baicker

et al 2012). Frank and Lamiraud (2009) evaluate patterns of health plan choice in Switzerland,

and find a negative relationship between the number of health plan choices available and

whether a consumer decides to switch plans. Similar patterns have been observed with

consumer choice of other goods, such as mutual funds (Kempf and Ruenzi 2006).

       It is reasonable to expect similar or even enhanced frictions in the Medicare program,

because beneficiaries face diminished decision-making and cognitive capabilities due to age

and health status (Hanoch and Rice 2006), where the number of MA plans and Part D

prescription drug plans is high, and where most Medicare beneficiaries need not make an active

choice about coverage since they are already enrolled in an MA plan or TM so their default


                                                 7
option is to do nothing. Only new Medicare beneficiaries, through the process of enrolling in

Medicare, must make an active choice.

       A few papers examine “mistakes” in plan choices among Medicare beneficiaries, where

beneficiaries are enrolled in plans that appear less optimal than other plans. McWilliams et al

(2011) find that beneficiaries with reduced cognitive function were less likely to enroll in MA

(versus TM), even in instances of increasing plan generosity. These authors also find evidence

consistent with choice overload, showing that while rates of enrollment in MA increased as

beneficiaries faced increasing numbers of plan choices up to 15 plans, they were unchanged for

choice sets including more than 15 plans.

       Evidence that Medicare beneficiaries have difficulty selecting the plan that is best for

them has been found in the context of Medicare Part D plans (which provide stand-alone

prescription drug coverage) and where, on average in the late 2000s, beneficiaries could

choose from among more than 50 Part D plans (Neuman and Cubanski, 2009). Abaluck and

Gruber (2011) studied choice among Part D plans during this period and found that the vast

majority of beneficiaries selected a suboptimal Part D plan, defined as plans that have higher

expected out-of-pocket costs for the enrollee than another plan that offers an equivalent level of

risk protection. They also present evidence that beneficiaries over-weighted information about

plan premium (relative to all out-of-pocket costs) when making their Part D plan selection.

       However, there is no evidence in the literature of status quo bias in Medicare beneficiary

plan choices. We now turn to describe the market for MA plans in Miami-Dade County and lay

out the context for our analysis of patterns of demand for MA plans.



3. Medicare Advantage in Miami-Dade County

       Over the course of the MA program’s history, the MA market in Miami-Dade County has

been one of the most robust in the United States. Hurley et al (2003) analyzed data from the

Community Tracking Survey, a longitudinal project conducting in-depth case studies in twelve


                                                 8
nationally representative urban markets, including Miami-Dade County. As early as 1996, the

authors characterized Miami-Dade as a Medicare managed care “high penetration” area,

reporting one of the highest numbers of MA plans offered to beneficiaries (9 plans), and a high

rate of beneficiary penetration in MA plans (37%). The authors attribute this finding in large part

to Medicare plan payment rates that were significantly higher in Miami-Dade county than the

national average, and plan competition for enrollment using generous benefit packages and

large networks (Ginsburg et al 1997). At that time, the only type of risk-bearing MA plan allowed

to be offered was a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO).

         Over the next five years, MA plans began to withdraw from almost all other markets in

the country due to decreases in plan payments imposed by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.

The total number of MA plan contracts in the United States decreased from a high of 346 in

1998 to 180 in 2001, while the percent of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in MA dropped from

16% to 12% (CMS). For the most part, the MA market in Miami-Dade did not experience the

same contraction. During the same time frame the number of plans available in Miami-Dade

held steady at 9-10 plans and by 2000, and MA penetration in Miami-Dade county increased,

from 43% in 1998 to 46% in 2000 (Hurley et al 2003). Things began to change in 2001 with the

beginnings of erosion in the generosity of MA plan benefits, including reduced pharmacy

benefits and some higher co-payments (Mays et al 2001). These effects were not to be long-

lived.

         The enactment of the Medicare Modernization and Improvement Act (MMA) in 2003

dramatically increased MA plan payments and led to significant changes in the number and

types of plans available to beneficiaries in MA. Although it was the BBA that authorized new

types of private plans within MA, including preferred-provider organizations (PPOs), provider-

sponsored organizations (PSOs), and private fee-for-service plans (PFFS), none were offered in

Miami-Dade until 2003. PSOs are similar to HMOs, except that they are run by a provider or

group of providers. PPOs have provider networks and negotiate rates with providers, but there


                                                 9
is much less use of medical management through gatekeeping and prior authorization. PFFS

plans are indemnity plans (like TM) that were prohibited from having restrictive provider

networks and from actively managing care. With the introduction of Medicare’s prescription

drug benefit, as of 2006, MA plans could be “stand-alone” MA plans, or coupled with a Part D

prescription drug plan (MA+PD). The extension of prescription drug coverage through Part D

reduced a major advantage of MA plans had over TM, but MA plans often provided more

generous drug coverage than was available through Part D plans in TM. MA plans also

continued to differentiate themselves from TM through provision of disease management, care

coordination and preventive care, as well as continuing to obviate the need to purchase a

supplementary insurance (i.e. Medigap) policy. Many MA plans became even more affordable,

as they took advantage of new permission to subsidize a beneficiary’s Part B premium, thereby

reducing a beneficiary’s out-of-pocket obligations further.

          Table 1 shows the choices by type of plan available to the elderly in Miami-Dade from

2003-2008.4 These include both stand-alone MA plans and MA+PD. It is clear that both the

number and diversity of MA plans available to beneficiaries grew between 2003 and 2008.

There was relatively steady growth in the overall number of plans each year starting in 2003

until plan choices more than doubled between 2007 and 2008. For the first few years of this

period HMOs were the dominant plans offered, and they continue to be the most common type

of plan available. PPOs and PSOs began to appear in the market in 2005, but it was the

emergence of PFFS plans that really changed the landscape of the choice set in 2007 and

2008. In particular, while PPOs and PSOs were like HMOs with restrictive physician networks

(PPOs were somewhat less restrictive), PFFS, with its lack of network restrictions, offered a

private TM-like option (often with more generous coverage terms).


4   We excluded all MA plans that are cost-based, Medical Savings Accounts, and all plans associated with

an employer/retiree groups.



                                                    10
          The diversity in choices available across MA plan offerings and TM is evident in the side-

by-side comparison of covered benefits and expected costs in Miami-Dade in 2007 (Table 2).5

MA premiums and out-of-pocket costs need to be considered against what beneficiaries must

pay in TM for comparable coverage. In order to have TM coverage be equivalent with what is

offered in a typical MA plan that includes a Part D prescription drug plan, the beneficiary needs

to buy Part D coverage and a supplemental Medigap plan.6 Table 2 presents data on the

average beneficiary-paid monthly premium and expected out-of-pocket costs (OOPC) in each

MA plan and in TM with supplemental coverage through Medigap Plan C. Medigap Plan C is

one of the two most popular Medigap policies and it covers nearly all of the cost-sharing

requirements in TM (MedPAC 2012). The estimates in Table 2 are an average of premium and

OOPC estimates for beneficiaries by age, gender and self-reported health status in plans of

each type.7 The expected OOPC of MA plans, in particular HMOs, are considerably lower than

that in TM. In addition, all MA plans offered some additional benefits over those provided

through the TM option, and some HMOs and PSOs offered prescription drug coverage that

covered the gap (“the doughnut hole”) in the Part D benefit.

          The historically high MA penetration in Miami since the mid-1990s suggests that

Medicare beneficiaries in Miami have high levels of “taste” for managed care (i.e. a willingness




5   This diversity in plan benefits and expected out-of-pocket costs across plans and between MA and TM

is similar in the latter part of the study period (2006-2008). For ease of exposition we present data on one

year, the mid-point, here.

6   This is assuming the beneficiary does not have supplemental insurance through a prior employer (30

percent of beneficiaries) nor is she eligible for Medicaid (18 percent).
7
    A description of how these data are calculated is in the data section below.



                                                      11
to accept the restrictions of managed care in exchange for more benefits and cost-savings).8 By

2007, however, beneficiaries no longer had to forgo the freedom to choose their physician in

order to get the benefits of being in an MA plan, because PFFS plans offer similar added

benefits and lower costs without requiring such sacrifices. It is thus evident that the choices

among MA plans facing Miami-Dade beneficiaries in 2008 were dramatically different than in

2003 or earlier, that MA offered a much richer benefit at lower cost than TM, and that many

more Medicare beneficiaries, even some of those with lower “tastes” for managed care, would

be potentially better off in MA than in TM. We now turn to examine empirically patterns of

demand for MA in Miami-Dade over the mid-2000s.



4. Data and Methods

Data

          We obtained data on the entire population of elderly (age 65+) Medicare beneficiaries in

Miami-Dade County for the years 2003-2008 from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid

services (CMS). We excluded beneficiaries who became eligible for Medicare due to disability,

those dually eligible for Medicaid, the long-term institutionalized, and those enrolled with an

insurer outside of Miami-Dade. We analyzed 1,028,772 elderly person-year observations, or

about 171,000 beneficiaries per year.

          The data include information on beneficiary date of birth, gender, race (non-white vs

white)9, zip code of residence, whether enrolled in MA and TM in each month, and for those in

MA, the year of first enrollment in an MA plan. We also obtained previously determined



8   Indeed, national survey results have found that relative to enrollees in TM, enrollees in MA plans are the

most likely to report being willing to forgo choice of provider in order to spend less out-of-pocket for their

care (Tu 2005), a not-so-surprising finding given that MA enrollment is voluntary.
9
    Due to data limitations we are unable to control separately for ethnicity.



                                                        12
estimates of the out-of-pocket costs (OOPC), including premiums, associated with each MA

plan option in Miami-Dade. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) calculated

these estimates by taking medical utilization data for a standard population of Medicare

beneficiaries and applying the coverage and cost-sharing rules specific to each MA plan to

these utilization data to determine the average monthly out-of-pocket costs expected for a

beneficiary enrolling in that plan.10 These calculations were conducted separately for five self-

reported health status groups and six age groups.

          Generally, insurers contract with Medicare to offer a specific type of plan (i.e. HMO,

PPO, or PFFS) in a county but often offer multiple plans with different names and variable

benefits under each contract. Our data include contract-level (but not plan-level) enrollment in

MA in Miami-Dade county. Thus, for each age group in Miami-Dade in given year, we averaged

OOPC estimates for the five health status groups within plans, and then averaged the OOPC

plan estimates for all plans under a given MA contract. We applied Miami-Dade contract-level

enrollment data to calculate an enrollment-weighted average OOPC of being in MA in Miami-

Dade for each age group and year, and we assigned these averages to beneficiaries in our

sample based on their age and year. Expected monthly out-of-pocket costs for those in

traditional Medicare with a supplemental Medigap Plan C policy coverage were similarly

estimated based on the uniform benefits and premiums of traditional Medicare and Florida-

specific supplemental benefits and premiums of Medigap Plan C. As we did for MA, we

averaged the estimates across health status groups to come up with single estimate for TM for

each age group and year.

Methods


10
     The standard population was a two-year sample of TM-enrolled respondents to the Medicare Current

Beneficiary Survey. This estimate assumes that the quantity of services consumed does not vary with the

differing cost sharing rules across the MA plans.



                                                    13
        We analyzed the demand for MA by beneficiaries over our study period 2003-08. We

term beneficiaries who enroll in MA within their first twelve months of eligibility for Medicare and

remain continuously enrolled in MA as “incident” enrollees and members of the “incident cohort.”

Members of this group enrolled in MA at a time when they were forced to make an active choice

between TM and MA. Beneficiaries who choose to switch into MA at any point after their first

year in the Medicare program, or those who at some point in their history in the Medicare

program have a spell during which they are enrolled in TM, are referred to as “non-incident

enrollees.” At the time when they chose to switch into MA, these enrollees faced a status quo

default or an option to make a passive choice.

        We estimated logistic regression models to examine the impact of traditional factors that

affect demand for health insurance (personal characteristics and prices), and of two contextual

factors: when a beneficiary enrolled in MA and a beneficiary’s tenure in the Medicare program.

The standard economic model of demand does not recognize the difference between an active

choice and a default situation in affecting demand. Including measures of these factors in the

models allows us to understand whether these latter factors exert an impact on demand for MA

plans and if so how.

        The dependent variable in these models is binary indicating whether a beneficiary is

enrolled in MA (1=yes). Independent variables in our base specification include whether a

beneficiary is in her first year of eligibility for Medicare (because we restrict our sample to those

eligible for Medicare because of old age, beneficiaries in their first year of eligibility are all age

65), whether a beneficiary is in the incident cohort (i.e. she joined MA when she first became

eligible for Medicare and has been continuously enrolled in a MA plan since that time), and

whether she was enrolled in MA in the previous year. We also included variables that a priori

we thought would affect beneficiary transitions into MA, including beneficiary race, gender, and

zip code, the latter being a proxy for income and ethnicity. We also control for the relative

generosity of MA through a measure of relative price for MA versus TM, which is defined based


                                                  14
on the average expected OOPC of enrollment in MA in Miami-Dade and enrollment in TM with

supplemental Medigap Plan C in Miami-Dade that we calculated for each of our age groups,

and is equal to (average expected OOPC in TM with Medigap Plan C) – (average expected

OOPC in MA).

          We study the effect of inertia in demand for MA by including indicators for the year in

which a beneficiary turned 65 (and first gained eligibility for Medicare), which we term their

“cohort year.”11 Negative coefficients on the cohort year variables would indicate beneficiaries

who have been in the Medicare program longer (i.e., members of any of the cohort years 1970-

2007) are less likely to switch into the MA program than are members of the 2008 cohort,

suggesting status quo bias.

          The sample for the logistic regression models includes data from the years 2004, 2005,

2007 and 2008. Because of missing data on expected MA plan costs we exclude data from

2006 from this analysis. Models include year fixed effects for the period spanned by our data,

and standard errors are clustered at the beneficiary level. For ease of interpretation, we report

our results in terms of predicted values based on the logistic regression models varying the

indicator for whether a beneficiary is in their first year in Medicare, a member of the incident

cohort and enrolled in MA in the previous year and as marginal effects with p-values.



5. Results

Descriptive results

          From 2003-2008 approximately 55% of our study population was enrolled in an MA plan,

almost three times the rate of average penetration observed across the US (Table 1). Table 3


11   Because Medicare eligibility rules deem all individuals in our sample first eligible for Medicare when

they turn 65, age and cohort are perfectly collinear and we are unable to separately estimate the effect of

beneficiary age on transitions into MA in this analysis.

describes the characteristics of Miami-Dade enrollees in TM and MA. MA enrollees are more

likely to be non-white and in their late-60s and 70s than are enrollees in TM. Within Miami-

Dade there is considerable variation in elderly demographics and MA penetration by

neighborhood (Table 4).

       There is a consistent and high rate of take-up of MA among the incident cohort over the

entire study period; approximately 40% of the elderly who are newly eligible for Medicare elect

to enroll in MA while the rest enter TM (Table 5). Among the non-incident cohort, which

includes all beneficiaries who were enrolled in TM in the previous year, approximately 5%

switch into MA from TM in each of the study years. Even though the percentage of non-

incident enrollees going into TM is much smaller, because the pool of these beneficiaries

(relative to the incident cohort) is quite large, slightly more than half of new MA enrollees each

year are from the incident cohort each year and the remainder switch in from TM.

       The bottom row in Table 5 reports on the composition of all MA enrollees in terms of

whether beneficiaries joined MA during their incident year versus any other year. These results

provide an indication of whether transition patterns observed in 2003-08 are consistent with

transitions into MA in earlier periods. In 2003, 35% of all Miami-Dade MA enrollees had joined

the program during their first year of Medicare eligibility, and by 2008 this proportion increased

to 44%. Thus, by the end of our study period, a greater proportion of MA enrollees are incident

cohort enrollees, suggesting that being a member of the incident cohort is incrementally much

more important to MA take-up than it was in earlier periods.

Regression Results

       Logistic regression models analyzing the probability that a beneficiary is enrolled in MA

(vs TM) give an indication of the contribution of first joining the Medicare program, relative to

other characteristics, on transitions into MA. These results suggest that the first year of

eligibility for Medicare is an important decision point for beneficiaries. Table 6 reports the

predicted probability, based on our models, that individuals with certain attributes are enrolled in


                                                 16
an MA plan, and that individuals in their first year of eligibility (age 65) are significantly more

likely than those who have been enrolled in Medicare for at least one year to join MA (61.4% vs.

57.5%, p<0.001).

        We find evidence of status quo bias in MA transitions. The most important factor in

explaining whether a beneficiary is in MA in the current year is whether or not they were in MA

in the previous year. Table 6 shows that beneficiaries in MA in the previous year are seven

times as likely to be in MA in the next year in comparison to enrollees in TM in the previous year

(98.0% vs. 14.7%, p<0.001), suggesting that beneficiaries who enroll in MA stay in the program

over time. Estimates on the cohort year control variables (Table 7) show that the probability of

being in MA (versus TM) is monotonically decreasing with each year that a beneficiary is in

Medicare, suggesting that inertia also exists in transitions from TM to MA, and that this inertia is

time dependent as beneficiaries enrollment in TM becomes increasingly “sticky” with time.

        We also observe that individuals who joined MA during their incident year are

significantly more likely than those in the non-incident cohort to be enrolled in MA (68.3% vs.

56.8%, p<0.001). This finding illustrates that incident cohort enrollees have a disproportionate

role in the composition of MA enrollees, which is, in effect, the long-term impact of the

combination of the facts that beneficiaries are more likely to join in their first year and that there

is substantial inertia in the market.

Implications for Enrollees

        MA plans offer additional benefits over TM including vision coverage, hearing coverage,

and some additional drug coverage; however the primary additional benefits provided by MA

over TM are lower expected out-of-pocket costs for an equivalent benefit. In the case of PFFS

plans in 2007 and 2008, this benefit is available without having to sacrifice access to physicians

or to be in a plan where care is managed. We estimate the average annual out-of-pocket cost

for all elderly beneficiaries of being in TM (plus Medigap Part C), in an MA-HMO, in an MA-




                                                  17
PFFS plan, or in any MA plan in 2007 and 2008.12 We then calculate the beneficiary’s annual

savings from being in MA versus TM in 2007 and 2008 by type of MA plan as the difference

between the average annual out-of-pocket cost between TM and the relevant MA option. Table

8 shows that an enrollee could save around $3000 annually in MA in those years. In 2011, the

median household income for householders age 65+ in Miami-Dade county was $24,108; thus

estimated savings from MA represents more than 10% of average annual income. Savings

would be greater, between to $3500 and $4000, if a beneficiary chose to enroll in an HMO and

somewhat less, between $1300 and $1600 if they enrolled in a PFFS plan.13



7. Discussion

        Gaining eligibility for Medicare, most commonly when one turns age 65, marks a key

decision point for beneficiaries as this is when elderly beneficiaries first enroll in Medicare. At

that time new beneficiaries consider whether TM or MA is better for them. While TM is given

special emphasis in enrollment materials (page placement and separation from other plans)

new beneficiaries are asked to make an active decision about joining TM or MA. After this

point, switching into MA not only requires a beneficiary to compare the option of MA versus TM

but also to overcome the default of remaining in TM. Our analysis suggests that turning 65 is

the key transition point for MA, as we find that being in one’s incident year of eligibility for

Medicare is very important to take-up of MA. Patterns of transitions into MA from TM (and vice

versa) following this point suggest significant status quo bias in take-up of MA, and that this

‘stickiness’ increases with a beneficiary’s tenure in Medicare. Because of the timing of when

they aged into Medicare, the consequence of these patterns in demand is that those


12 Average annual out-of-pocket cost in any MA plan in one year is the average expected out of pocket
cost in all MA plans across all ages that year, multiplied by twelve. The average annual out-of-pocket
cost in an MA-HMO (MA-PFFS) plan in one year is the equivalent calculation for MA-HMO (MA-PFFS)
plans only. The average annual out-of-pocket cost in TM plus Medigap Plan C is the average expected
out-of-pocket costs in TM plus Plan C across all ages, multiplied by twelve.

beneficiaries turning 65 in 2003-08 disproportionately benefited from entering MA, while those

already in Medicare were most likely to be the ones “leaving money on the table.”

        The reasons for this pattern of behavior are not completely understood. For the incident

cohort, elements of the Medicare entry process (e.g. filling out paperwork, engaging with the

Social Security office, choosing a Part C plan or, if in TM, a Part D and/or Medigap plan) make

Medicare entry an active choice regardless of the Medicare policy environment or the

complexity of the Medicare plan choice set. For the non-incident cohort however, in any year a

decision to switch into MA requires overcoming a “default” option of staying in TM, evaluating

MA options and deciding to switch plans. The differences between making an active and a

passive choice is likely driving the strong incident effect that we observe in our data. Other

studies of health insurance choice have found that as choice sets become larger and more

complex not only are the search costs that are required to select the right plan higher, but the

complexity itself may make beneficiaries more susceptible to inertia and defaults (Frank and

Lamiraud 2009). Indeed, throughout our study period, the MA choice set in Miami-Dade county

becomes larger and more complex and we find that being a member of the incident cohort is

increasingly important to take-up of MA, suggesting that as the choice environment becomes

more complex beneficiaries who have to overcome a passive choice to enroll in MA are less

likely to do so.

        Health plans also have an incentive to attract younger enrollees and take active steps to

discourage older and sicker enrollees from switching into MA so as to avoid adverse selection.

This plan-level incentive may also account for some of the patterns of demand for MA and the

incident effect that we observe in Miami-Dade, and we are unable to disentangle these effects in

our data. However, studies of the impact on changes in Medicare plan payment (i.e., the

implementation of risk-adjustment) aimed and reducing risk selection over this same time period

find evidence of reductions in favorable selection into MA (McWilliams et al 2012), suggesting




                                                19
that plan-level efforts to achieve favorable selection are not solely responsible for our observed

incident effect.

        The incident effect and the status quo bias among beneficiaries could also undermine

the efficiency of the MA market overall. Plans observe patterns of beneficiary enrollment and

demand, and these enrollment patterns give plans the incentive to compete only for the

youngest elderly. They can do so by offering services and access to providers in which that the

younger elderly are most interested. In contrast, plans have a type of market power over older

adults; plans can offer less attractive combinations of premiums, coverage and services quality

and still retain the oldest enrollees due to the inertia. To the extent that these unfavorable

combinations of premiums and benefits are least acceptable to those beneficiaries who are

sicker and expect to use more care and serve to push them to switch back into TM, these

market conditions may also exacerbate the adverse selection that has already been observed in

MA markets (Riley and Zarabozo 2006-2007; Newhouse et al 2012).

        This paper has a few important limitations. First, because the analysis is focused only

on Miami-Dade county these findings may not generalize fully to other parts of the US that are

different from Miami along characteristics not included in our data (and therefore unable to be

controlled for in our models), in particular to areas where the market for MA is significantly

different or where beneficiaries have less experience with and “taste” for managed care.

However, to the extent that the MA program continues its current growth in terms of the number

of plans offered and the number of beneficiaries enrolled in the program, more markets may

begin to resemble Miami-Dade and these findings may become more relevant. Second, data

limitations prevent us from including several individual-level controls in the models, including

health status and ethnicity. Health status is known to be correlated with demand for insurance,

in particular managed care, and, aside from other evidence that favorable selection into MA is

decreasing over this period, we are unable to assess the impact of health status on MA take-up

in this study. In Miami-Dade, the implication of omitting ethnicity is that we are unable to assess


                                                 20
whether the patterns in demand for MA that we observe varied for beneficiaries who identify as

Hispanic and white versus non-Hispanic and white.

       Finally, because of the collinearity between age and cohort we cannot control separately

for age in the models. The implication of being unable to separately measure age is that our

estimates of the effect of cohort may include any separate effect of declining enrollment in MA

with age, and represent an upper bound (in absolute value). Ideally further research can work

to disentangle the contributions of cohort and age on beneficiary enrollment in MA.

       Over the period from 2006-2009, Medicare is estimated to have over-paid plans (relative

to what it would have cost to insure MA enrollees in TM) by 12-14% annually (MedPAC 2009b).

However, passage of the Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA) includes several provisions that will

decrease MA plan payments going forward. Understanding beneficiary choice of MA becomes

increasingly important in an environment of tighter public budgets. With better information

about the drivers of beneficiary choice, including the effects of health plan search frictions such

as inertia and defaults, policymakers can better assess the impact of different payment

environments and implement policy that improves the efficiency of the MA market whereby MA

plans have incentives to compete for all beneficiaries and not just the newest. For example,

policy interventions and communication strategies that reduce complexity in the choice

environment so as to address choice overload and the ability to comparison shop could lead to

greater take-up of MA by incumbent beneficiaries. Our results suggest however that these

policies could be more effective if paired with interventions that make beneficiaries more

engaged in the annual plan renewal and open enrollment process, for example through policy

“nudges” that make a beneficiary’s continued enrollment in Medicare an active as opposed to

passive process. Such policy has the potential to make non-incident beneficiaries better off, if

by transitioning into MA they are able to take advantage of a generous benefit at lower out-of-

pocket cost, such as that offered in Miami-Dade in 2007 and 2008.
