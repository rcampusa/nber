                     Corporate Supply of Index Bonds


                                 SUMMARY

       This paper develops a simple theory of the supply of index bonds

by a firm,   and uses that model to examine in some detail possible
reasons for the non—existence of privately issued index bonds in the

United States.

       The major elements of the theory involve the trade—off between

the tax advantages of using debt finance and the increasing risk of

bankruptcy debt finance involves. The theory is first used to examine

the   supply of nominal bonds——it is thus a theory of the debt—equity
ratio. Then the firm's optimal supply of index bonds is examined, and
the values of the firmusing the alternative debt instruments i$ compared.
In general, there is no reason to think that nominal bonds dominate
index bonds——i.e. the theory cannot explain why firms have not issued
index bonds.
        The paper then turns to a number of other reasons that have been
advanced   for the non—issue of indexed bonds in the United States, such

as the tax treatment of such instruments and the argument that their

issue would saddle the firm with open—ended obligations.

     This paper develops a simple theory of the supply of index bonds by

a firm, and uses that model to examine in some deti1 possible reasons

for the non—existence of privately issued index bonds in the United States.1

     In an earlier paper, I used portfolio theory and the capital asset

pricing model to study the demand for index bonds and some properties of

equilibrium in a capital market with equity assets as well as indexed and

nominal    bonds,2 and in which individuals may also own   (but nor sell) han
capital.     The major conclusions of that paper are that the equilibriur

relationship between the real yields on indexed and nominal bonds depends

on the extent to which equity and human capital are hedges against inflation3

—   the real yield on index bonds tends to be below that on nominal bonds to
the extent that real returns on equity and human capital are negatively

correlated with inflation; that, in the absence of human capital and with

no relative price uncertainty, all private lending and borrowing would

take place through indexed bonds; and that, with human capital, both types

of bonds would in general be expected to exist. I noted that the analysis

did not throw much light on the non—existence of indexed bonds in most

major capital markets.

     The non—existence of privately issued indexed bonds is a phenomenon

requiring explanation for two r.ain reasons. First, the tying of contracts

to the price level is not unknown nor even especially unusual in the

United States: labor contracts, rent contracts, certain aspects çf

insurance contracts and even the prices to be paid for future delivery

of manufactured products have all been tied to the price level.4 Second,

there has been no dearth of innovation in the financial area over the years,

although those innovations taking the form of the issue of new types of

securities by existing firms —— such as the certificate of deposit and

the floating rate note —— have been undertaken mainly by banks.

     The previous paper concentrated on the demand for inx bonds and

equilibrium in a market composed of lifetime —   utility—maximizing   households.

However, the most likely private issuers of index bonds are corporations.

Accordingly the emphasis in this paper is on the supply of index bonds by

firms whose assumed notivation is the maximization of their stock market value.

     It is well known that in the absence of bankruptcy and the differential

tax treatment of equity returns and interest, the Nodigliani—Miller theorem5

establishes that the value of the firm is independent of its debt structure.

A simple theory of the supply of bonds, based on the existence of bankruptcy

 and the tax treatment of interest as a business expense is developed in this

 paper6 and used to evaluate some of the arguments typically advanced to
 -                                                                      3



explain the non—existence of indexed bonds.7

     The elements of the theory of the supply of index bonds are outlined

in Section I. The theory is used in Section II to examine the view that

firms should be more willing to issue index bonds the more their profits

are (positively) correlated with the price level; Section II also

presents evidence on the correlation of the profits of some American
                                                                            -


corporations with the price level. Because the theory makes clear the

crucial   role of the tax treatment of indexed payments, Section III reviews

the ambiguous tax status of such payments in the United States. Section IV

considers the argument that systematic underestimation of inflation is

responsible for the non—appearance of indexed bonds. Section V briefly

reviews the argument that index bonds have not been issued because such

bonds would 3addle firms with open—ended obligations which nominal bonds

with call—clau3e protection do not. Two further explanations for non—

issuance of ..ndex bonds are considered: Section VI examines the variability

of the rate of inflation over the past twenty years; Section VII discusses

the costs of innovation and the possibility that a large—scale change in

 the form of debt issues would be easier to accomplish than piecemeal

 changes. Conclusions are contained in Section VIII. An appendix compares

 the variability of hypothetical profit streams for sixteen U.S. firms,

 constructed on the assumption that all their long term debt issues

 over the period were indexed, with the variability of their actual profit

 streams.


 I. The Supply of Index Bonds

      This section develops a theory of the supply of bonds in the context of

 the capital asset pricing model,8 using a number of other simplifying assump—
                                                                        4




tions. The major result of the section is that neither nominal nor

indexed bonds dominates the other; depending on the stochastic character-

istics of profit streams, certain firms will have a higher stock market

value if they issue indexed bonds than if they issue nominal bonds, and

vice versa.

     Assume there are only two periods, and consider a firm that has made

its investment decision in period one which will produce (uncertain) real

profits, Tr, in period two. Real profits are assumed to be distributed as:


     (1) 1T=x+a(q—l)

where x is a random variable uniformly distributed on (c,d) and q is the

purchasing pcer of money (the inverse of the general price level) in period

two.9 The purchasing power of money has the simple symmetric distribution:


                                                          0 <    <1
      (2) q = 1 +         with probability 1/2

              = 1 — c     with probability 1/2


 The variance of q is    and the purchasing po':er of money in period two

                                                                < 0 implies
 is expected to be the same as in period one.'° ote that
                                          with the price level, since q is the
 that profits are positively correlated

 inverse of the price level.

      The firm is assumed to sell claims on its second period profits.

  Initially we examine a situation in which it can sell indexed bonds and

  euity. it promises to pay an amount W in real terms to holders of index

  bonds, provided its profits are at least W. Such payments are

  treated as business expenses.     Any amount of profits not paid out to

  index bond holdars is distributed to equity holders, after payment of taxes
                                                                                  5



at rate t.11 If the firmts profits are less than W, it is bankrupt.

In such a cake, equity holders receive no payments. Certain fixed real

bankruptcy costs, b, are assumed to be incurred and bondholders received

either zero or Tt —        b,      whichever is greater, in the event of bankruptcy.

        To summarize this discussion, let W be the real anount promised to

index bond holders. Let S be the set of x and q on which the firm is

solvent:


        (3) S={r;x+c(q—1)>w}

The set of x and q on which the firn is bankrupt but profits exceed the

fixed cost of bankruptcy


        (4)      I   C1T; b .5     x + (q — 1) < w}


        Payments to index bond holders are:

Payments to equity holders are:


        (6)     (2. —   r)(n   —   !)   for r c S

                         0 otherwise.


        The elements of the theory of the supply of index bonds can now be

seen. The issue of bonds produces a tax advantage, but the core bonds are

issued, the greater the probability of bankruptcy. Thus bonds will be

issued to the point at which the tax benefit balances the expected

bankruptcy costs.13 It should be noted that in the absence of differential
                                                                                          6



tax   treatment of interest and profit distributions no bonds would be
issued by this firm.

        In the capital asset pricing model assets issued by the firm                are   valued

by the market on the basis of their expected return and the covariance of

their returns with the market return. Let                   be the rate of return on

the market:


        (7)       =   (q   —
                               1) +


where Ti is a random variable with expectation

covariance with x. Thus it is assumed that the only covariance between

the firm's profits 11, and the return on the market portfolio, R, occurs

through the relationship of each variable to the price level)' Empirical

evidence suests that                 is positive, i.e. that the real return of the market

is negatively correlated with the price level, end we shall henceforth generally

treat                                   15'
              as positive or zero.

        The expected payment on the firm's issue of securities is

where   the first term in the right hand side of (8) is the expected payment
on equity, and the remaining terms represent the expected                   payment on index bonds.
Some calculation results in:

      The market is also assed to value (negatively) the covariance of

asset returns with the market's return. This covariance is

The    solution (12) holds only if c —                    ctc <     W   < d +   ac;   if (12) inplies
W <    c-ac > 0, then ;J is set at c —                    ac
                                                 If e — ac, which is the minimum profits              the firm
can    earn, exceeds zero, then the tax benefit of issuing index bonds will

 clearly be used. The constraint W <                          d+a        follows from the requirement

  there be some equity financing.
    Concerning ourselves now with the interior maximum, the supply of

index bonds is positively related to the maximum profits the firm expects

to earn (d) and to the tax rate on corporate profits (T), and negatively related

to the cos of bankruptcy (b). The effects of price level uncertainty on the

issue of index bonds depend on the product cL; if the firm's profits are

related to the price level in the opposite direction to which the market's

return is telated to the price level (ct<O), price uncertainty increases the

firm's issue of index bonds. If c is positive, then the firm's issue of

index bonds is reduced by price level uncertainty. Thus, it is not the sign

of the correlation of the firm's profits with inflation which affects

the amount of index bonds supplied, but rather the relationship between

the behavior of the firm's profits with inflation and the market's

return with inflation.

     The supply function for index bonds (12), does nct establish whether

the firm will hava a higher value by issuin4 index bonds than by issuing no

bonds at all or by issuing (an optimal ax.ount of) nominal bonds. Clearly,

if the firm's minimum profits are positive, it will always profit by

.issuing bonds up to that minimum. Assume therefore that the firm's

minimum profits, c — nc are zero, and calculate the value of the firm

when it is purely equity financed:


      (13), VE =   (1 -   t)   [P(d+ c) -   ex2i

     Assuming the optimum W is interior, and substituting from (12)    into   (11)

we obtain the optimized value of the firm when it Issues Indexed bonds:

Thus   it is clear that          if aS < 0, then the value of the firm is greater when
it   issues    index bonds than when it            is purely   equity financed. Similarly,
for   aS small, or for high tax rates, or for snail c (an eventuality which is

more than plausible), it is clear that the issue of index bonds will

increase the value of the firm. There is accordingly a presuiption

that the firm will issue some index bonds                 rather than be purely equity
financed      in any case, and, under the assumptions cf the theory, there is

certainty that it will do so if c <                  , i.e.    if the relationship between its

profits and the price level is in the opposite directicn to that of the

market return with inflation.                                  -

       There remains the question of indexed versus nominal bonäs. Suppose

that the fIrm offered to pay nominal bond holders a fixed nominal amount

B in the event that its nominal profits exceed. B, and that in that event,

equity holders receive (1 —            r)(ir   — Bq) in real terms. In the event of

bankruptcy, bond holders receive the real amount ( — b) or zero, whichever

is greater, and equity holders receive nothing.

       Define now the solvency set S' by


       (16)      S' —        x   + a(q - 1)    >
                                                   Bq}


and    the    set :'   of   x and q on which the firm is bankrupt but profits

exceed the fixed cost of bankruptcy:

      Note first from (23') the obvious: the value of the firm                                             is   the same

Since the term (R, —             .i), which                is the excess return on the market, is, for a

period of a year, considerably below unity,18 and since 2 is large

relative to €2 (see Section VI below), it is reasonable to treat

        In   Figure 1, the shaded area represents those parameter values for which

the fiin has a higher value by issuing indexed than nominal bonds.19 Also

included in Figure 1 are the loci on which W = 0 and B = 0 respectively;

interior solutions for W and B lie in each case towards the origin.20

        Figure 1 makes it clear that there are situations in which the value of

the firm         is   higher if it issues Indexed bonds than if it issues nominal

bonds, and also that the reverse may occur ——                                      i.e.       that neither type of bond

should be expected to dominate the other inthe market. If the nominal bond

Is to be issued,    then the firm        will have to be located above the upper

V1 V locus. Taking                 > 0, the firm which finds it profitable to issue

nominal bonds will have profits negatively correlated, with the price level.

Similarly, for      >   0, a firm is more likely to increase its stock market
value by issuing index bond the smaller is a ——                   the more highly its profits
are correlated with the price level.

      We want next to consider the effects of a change in the variance of the

price level on the difference V1 —
                                              V.      We take derivations on two loci:

first, on the upper V1 —                locus, at which both W and B are interior,
                                   VN

and the firm is indifferent between the two issues, and second on the locus

B =   0,   where the firm prefers to issue indexed bonds but where the direction

of change of V1 —             is   still of interest.

Equation (26) tells us that when a >           0,   and also the firm is indifferent

between issuing the two types of bonds, then an increase in the variance of

the price level leads it to issue nominal bonds, so long as                        is not too

large. In turn, (27) suggests that if                 >    0,    and a <   0, then an increase
in the variance of the price level does not lead the firm towards the issue

of nominal bonds. The conclusion is that the effects of an increase in

uncertainty about the price level on th2 desire to issue index bonds
                                                                         14




depends on the covariance of profits with the price level; if profits are

positively correlated with the price level, then an increase in the

variance of the price level tends to make a firm more likely to issue

Index bonds.

     In this section we derived supply functions for indexed and nominal

bonds and showed that neither type of bond dominates the other from the

viewpoint of the maximization of the firm's stock market value. There

are situations in which a firm issuing nominal bonds will command a

greater stock market value than one issuing indexed bonds — such situations

require, given the inverse correlation between the market and the price

level, an inverse correlation between the firm's profits and the price

level —— and there are also situations in which stock market value is

higher if the firm issues indexed rather than nominal bonds. In addition,

we established, given the empiriclly negative relationship between the

market rate of return and the price level, that the greater the correlation

of a firm's profits with the price level, the more lively its stock market

value will be higher if it issues indexed ratherthan nominal bonds.

Further, the effect of increases in the variartè of the price level on

the relative attractiveness of issuing index, bonds depends on the correla—

tion between the firm's profits and the price level.


II. The Correlation of Profits with the Price Level

     The analysis above established that firms are more likely to have

a higher stock market value by issuing indexed rather than nominal bonds

if their profits are positively correlated with    the   price level.

     In   Table   I, we present correlation coefficients between after tax

profits   with an adjustment (described below) for interest payments and the
consumer price index for sixteen firms. These firms were chosen from the
industrial, public utilities, transportation and merchandising cateorics

of the Fortune 500 firms for 1964. The criterion of selection was

originally to be the largest five firms on the basis of long term debt

outstanding in 1964 in each category, subject to the firms existing in both

1954 and 1973. There are only three transportation firms because debt

issues of many        of   the largest transportation firms were so numecous that the

analysis of Section IV below became too costly, and                     there     are only   three
merchandising firms because these firms tended to have very little debt outstanding.

     Profits for each firm          were adjusted by adding back to reported net

prof its the computed         amount of    interest paid on long term             debt   multiplied

by one minus the corporate tax             rate     (State plus federal) in each year.

Thus we obtained a series for each firm


      (1)             =       + (1 —
                                       tt)Ri           ,   i   =   1,...,   16;     t     1954,...,   1973



,jhere T.
          it
               will   henceforth be called after tax               profits, it     is retorted net

income,     and       is reported interest payments on long term debt. We chose

to work with after tax profits because it was simpler to make the tax

adjustment        to interest than to compute comparable pre—tax profits for

each firm.

     ominal        after tax profits,               were   then deflated by the consumer

price index for each year, a linear time trend21 was fitted to the real

profit series, and the deviations of real profits from the trend values

were calculated. Similarly, an exponentiar time trend was fitted to the

 annual average of the CPI         for     each of the twenty years, with a dunmy being

 included for the low inflation years, 1959—65,                     and the residuals from       that
 regression were calculated. The price level regression was


      (29) log (CPI) =                 +        +
                                           1t
                                                                                     16




where D = 1 for t        1959,..., 1965

               0 otherwise.


Equation
               (28) represents a crude estinate of the predicted path of the
price level. The       regression,   with standard errors in parentheses, was:

        (29) log (CPIt) = 4.3330 +        .0242t    —   .OO5lDt
                               (.0185)    (.0014)       (.0018)

In    addition, the regressidn was run without the dunmy             variable, yielding


        (30)    log (CPIt) = 4.3116 +     .0247t
                         (.0197) (.0016)
    Table I presents the correlations of the deviations of real after—tax
profits from their trend values with the deviations of the price level
 froci its tread value, fof equations (29) and (30)               respectie1v•

 In   each case most of the correlations are negative. The

correlations for the largest debt issuing category —                the urilities — arc
all either negative or close to zero, with the correlation for                      the

 largest individual borrower, being strongly negative. Table I suggests that

 the most likely issuers of index bonds would be Mobil Oil. IBM and Sears.

         While the most obvious feature of Table I may be that the correlation

 of deviations of real profits with deviations of the price level from their
                                                              22
 respective trends is negative for so many firms,                   the major lesson of the

  table is that there is a wide diversity of behavior of profits with respect

  to the price level and that there are indeed firms that have a positive

  correlation of detrended profits with the detrended price level and that,

  according to the theory, might have been expected to issue index bonds.

  We conclude th2t the failure of indexed bonds to appear is not due to the

  fact that there are no firms whose profits are positively correlated with

  t e price level.

III.   The Tax Treatment of Index bonds

       The analysis of Section I points to the tax treatment of interest

as a major determinant of the type of security issued.24 Consider two

types of long term bond that can be called "indexed interest" and "indexed

principal" bonds respectively. The indexed interest bond is redeeied at

a nominal par value known at the tire ofissue, say $1000.        It promises to

pay a fixed real rate, say 2, plus the realized rate of inflation over

the previous period at each payment date. The indexed princital bond

Is issued with a nominal par value of, say $1000, which nominal value is

 increased at each payment date by the realized rate of inflation over the

 preceding period and interest is paid equal to, say again, 2 of the out-

 standing principal. Redeption occurs at the nominal value of the out-

 standing principal which has been cumulated as the price level changes,

 and is for the same real value as the initial par value.
                                                                             that
        Take first the indexed interest bond. There seems little doubt
 the   annual interest payment would   be   treated as interest incoe for the
 recipient. There is some doubt, however, as to whether the       payment   by the
 firm in excess of the stated real rate (2 in the exarple       above)   would be

 treated as a business expense. The following cuotation from the Standard
                      25
 Federal Tax Reporter makes the source of the ambiguity clear:

                 In reaching its determination as to.the existence of a bona
          fide debtor—creditor relationsLiip upon which the payment and
          deductibility of interest could be predicated, the courts have
          considered such factors as: whether there was a written in-
          strument of the debt; whether the instrument was negotiable,
          had a fixed maturity date, and bore a fixed rate of interest;
           •,..; and whether there was any valid business reason for the
          debt.
                                                                             19




The only source of ambiguity is the nention of a fixed rate of interest;

on all other ;rounds, the indexed interest qualifies as interest. Since

interest paid on floating rate notes is deductible, it would now appear

that in fact a very strong case could be made that indexed interest

should be treated as deductible, and that there is probably no t&x

obstacle to the issue of indexed interest bonds.26 However, it should be

noted that there does not appear to be any precedent precisely covering

the indexed interest case, and that the issue could only be finally

resolved by rulings applied to a proposed and not a hypothetical bond issue,

so that some uncertainty rerains.

     In the case of an indexed principal bond, the tax questions concern

the treatment of the increases in principal to the lender, and also to

the borrower. It is not clear whether only the actual intercst payment

each year would be treated as interest income and the   excess   of the

repayment of r.omir.al principal at rec:rnpcion over the purchase price

would be treated as a capital gain, or -:hecher interest plus nominal

increase in principal would be treated as interest income in each year.

The general use of the realization principle would tend to favor the former

approach. If that were the case, such bonds would generally be nore

attractive to lencers than the typical nominal bond. however, if the

borrower could deduct only the interest paid in each year as a business

expense, it would find indexed principal bonds relatively unattractive.

     It is also appropriate here to consider a suggestion which has       been
made that firms would be more willing to issue bonds indexed to their

own output price than bonds linked to the general price level. If their

own output price were perfectly correlated with their profits (which is the
                                                                                     20




reasoning     behind the suggestion) it is easy to see that the model of

Section      I would   support this argument. however, it would seen that the

indexed payment on such bonds would be treated as a profit distribution.

It   should also be      noted that in the case of the issues of such bonds by

French    firms   in the 1950's, indexing to the own price was a device used

by   firms to circvent the monetary        law against indexation to the general

price    level28 and     should accordingly not be treated as evidence confirming

the   view that    firms would prefer to issue bonds tied to their own output

price.

        In   brief, then, it is not obvious that the tax     treatment   of indexed

bonds should deter their issue. It appears likely that indexed interest

bonds would be treated similarly to existing nominal bonds, and it is

even possible that indexed principal bonds would provide some tax

advantages to lenders. The general uncertainty concerning the tax treatment

of indexed bonds suggests that there has been little effcrt made to

clarify their tax status, which in turn suggests that it is unlikely that

the tax treatment o index bonds has held back potential issues.



IV.     Expectations     and Index Bonds

        The   experience of the   last decade has been of increasing     inflation.
The experience of the last two decades has also          been of low real yields on
bonds.        It is becoming well known that the average real rate of return, ignoring taxes
                                                                                29
 to the holding of U.S. treasury bills       for the 1954—73 period was l..

        The    average real yield on   long—term corporate debt for 1954—73 was

 less than 2.. Table II presents the results of a calculation in which

 hypothetical indexed bonds were        issued   by the sixteen firms of the sample
                                                                                        2i




described      Ift Section II. The long—term debt outstanding at the end of

each half—year for each firm was calculated, and it was then assed that

each firm      paid   interest on outstanding debt equal to, in one case, l, at

an    annual   rate and in the other 2 annual, plus the realized rate of

inflation over the preceding six months. Profits ware calculated for

each firm for each year on the basis of the hypothetical interest payments,

and than deflated by the CPI to yield a hypothetical real profit series.

Table II shows the ratio of the mean of the calculated real profit series

to the mean of actual real profits over the period 1954—73. The ratios arc

not identical for all firms both because the share of interest payments in

profits    varies among     firms and because   dates of debt issues vary among
firms. Table II demonstrates that every firm           effectively    obtained bond
financing at less than a 2 real rate over the period, and that some,
including A.T.&T., paid less than l real.

     It is tempting to conclude that the low real rate is a result of
 rising   and therefore unexpected inflation, and that if inflation          had   been

 accurately foreseen,. the real rate of         interest on   bonds would have exceeded..

 2%. Thus,       it is   argued, firms have had little incentive to     issue   index
 bonds because real rates on nominal bonds have been low.30 This argument
 obviously requires borrowers to have had systematically higher expectations
 of inflation than lenders and is difficult to confirm or refute.
 It   should, however, be recognized that expectations of inflation among lenders
 are not homogeneous: it         is   possible that there are enough lenders in the
 American economy who are sufficiently pessimistic about inflation to make it

worthwhile for some corporation to issue an indexed bond at a low         real rate.

Thus   the exoectations explanation, too, should be treated with suspicion.

V. The Call Provision
        Corporate   bonds issued in   the United States typically carry a call
provision    by which   the corporation   can repay the debt on specified terms

before maturity but after five years (in general) or ten years (for

utilities) of its existence. Thus corporations appear to be covered

 against the possibility that the nominal, interest rate will fall after

 their   debt is issued, and they are, of course, covered against increases
 in the nominal rate. Accordingly, the call clause protects the corpora-
 tion from the risk that the Interest rate and rate       of inflation will fall.

        There are three points to be made in connection with the argument

 that the call provisions has precluded the issuance of index bonds because
 the corporation is covered against increases in nominal       interest rates

 by    the fact that it has a fixed nominal rate    on its debt and   decreases
 in nominal rates by the call clause.         First, the .calI clause is not

 free.32 It could be, though, that the issu of ca-11        protected   nominal

 bonds    dominates index bonds from the viewpoint of the firm; the model
 of Section I Is not ec'uipped to analyze that issue. Second, the call
 clause provides protection only after five or tea years, and interest
 rates can change a great deal in that period. Third, there is no reason
 why index bonds should not have similar clauses creating minimut and
 maximum nominal payments.
         The last two points suggest strongly that the call provision is
 not the explanation for the non—existence of indexed bonds.
                                                                                  24


VI.    The Variance of the Rate of Inflation

       The analysis of Section I, in particular equation (23'), showed that

the benefit to the firm of issuing indexed rather than nominal bonds

would be small if the variance of the price level were small.

Figure I shows the time path of the CPI in the U.s. 1954—74 (for

quarterly observations) and also the inflation rate, defined as


                             — 1   where t      1953 II to 1974 IV

it    is difficult to establish an absolute measure        of variability,
the    second column of Table III provides some notion of absolute variation:

it presents the variance of the rate of inflation calculated at an annual

percentage rate, and is generally of the same           order   of magnitude as the

mean rates of inflation for the subperiods, except for 1954—58. This

variance   itself falls as the time interval   over which the inflation rate
is   calculated is increased. However it is lower by an order of magnitude

than the variance of, say, the stock market rate of return,33 and it should

probably be regarded as small. In a system in which nominal bonds are,

for whatever reason, the predominant form of bond financing, and in which

innovation is not costless (see Section VII below), the inducement to

issue index bonds is small so long as the variance of the price level

is small.

       Whatever the absolute magnitude of the variance of inflation, it

is clear that the periods most favorable to the issue of index bonds were

1954—58 and 1969—73. These are also of course the periods in which econ-

omists were most actively discussing indexing. Further, the variance for

 1970—74 (11.792) considerably exceeds that for 1969—73 (4.2672). Thus the

 recent instability of the inflation rate has created conditions siLbstantialiy

more favorable to the issue of index bonds than existed in the revious ten

 years.


 VII. The Costs of Innovation

        The introduction of the floating rate note34 involved the issuer of the

 first such note in discussion and negotiation with the Federal Reserve System

 that resulted in modification of the terms of the note.35 Such negotiation

 is an obvious cost of financial innovation, as are the costs involved in

 listing applications. There are other costs of innovation such as the edu—

 cation of the public to the advantages and disadvantages of the new instrument.36

 Most of these costs are borne by the innovator and not by subsequent issuers.
                                                                           27

     The fact is, however, that the innovation
                                               was carried out in the case
ofthe floating rate note. The note was aimed at the small borrower
and thus the educational costs could be expected to be relatively high.
Further, the difficulties Citicorp encowitered with the Federal Reserve
System steed largely from the fact that the issue was regarded by
financial intermediaries such as savings banks as aimed directly at
their depositors,37 and it is not certain that similar interests would
be affected if an indexed bond were to be issued.
        In discussing innovation, it   is worthwhile distinguishjn. financial
institutions   from other corporations.
                                           Financial insitut1ons tend to
carry hedged portfolios and it is probable that tney. '..'ould want   to

                                        sheet if they innovated       by
issuing an indexed    bond.38 Citicorp
                                         presiably found the floatin rate
note more attractj    than an indexed bond because its liabilities

are nominal. The desire of financial
                                          interedjaries for hedging even
makes it possible tr.at   a large scale transit to indexation
                                                                 is as
feasible as the piecemeal
                            introductjc,n of indexatjo by finaccial
intermediaries

      Non—financial   corporations have, not been particularly innovative in

the types of securities they issue and it may be that the costs of

innovation for them are high. However, it is difficult to believe th't

the costs of educating a public, by now well aware of inflation, to

understand the features of an indexed bond
                                               can be very high. .ccording—
].y continuance of the current levels
                                         and variability of inflation could well
make the costs of innovation for some non—financial corporation low

enough to result in the issue of an indexed
                                            bond. Similarly, if
proposals for reform of the mortgage system39 lead to the introduction of

indexed mortgages, the spread of indexation could thereafter be
                                                                rapid.
VIII. Conclusions

       ost of the explanations usually advanced for the non—issuance of

private indexed bonds do not appear to explain the phenomenon. There

are firms    whose profits are positively correlated with the price level;

the tax    treatment   of indexed interest would probably not be adverse; the

call clause provides protection to the borrower only after a lengthy

period and a similar provision could in any case be applied in the case

of index bonds; the costs of innovations have not prevented sophisticated

innovation aimed at small lenders. There are two argents that may have

some merit. The first is that expectations of inflation by borrowers

have been systematically higher than those of lenders, however, it is

difficult to belie':e that     borrowers   will aE.-ays expect   more inflation

 than   lender, or for that matter, that there are not now lenders whO
would    acept   a low real rate of interest in exchange fcr protection

 against inflation. Thus, although evidence on this issue is difficult

 come by, it is hard     to believe that this factor would prevent the future
 emergence of index bonds. The second is that the variance           of inflation

 has    been low, partivularly relative to the other risks       incurred in the

 capital markets. Given this low variance, and the existence of some              costs
 of    innovation, the incentive for firms to issue indexed bonds has been

 small. However, the variance of inflation has recently been higher than

 it was in the sixties, and increased instability of the inflation rate,

 if maintained, could lead to the emergence of privately issued index

 bonds.

Appendix: The Variability of Hypothetical Profit Series for Sixteen
             Firms Issuing indexed Bonds


      Closely related to the question exai:iined in Zection II of the

 correlation of a firm's detrended profits with the detrended price level,

 is an issue of independent interest ——   the stability of after—interest
 profits if firms were to issue indexed rather than nocinal bonds.

 Table Al presents the results cf co=parisons of the variability of

 hypothetical real profit streams where firms issued index bonds with the

 variability of their actual real profit streams. The construction of the

 hypothetical profit series is described in Section IV (the real interest

 rate was 1%). Each nmina1 profit series was deflated by the CPI to give

 a real profit series.

      A linear trend was then fitted to each hypothetical teal profit

  series and the sum of squared residuals from that series was calculated

  and divided by the square of the mean of the series to give a "coefficient

  of variation" of hypothetical real profits around its trend line.

  identical procedure was applied to the time series for actual real

  profits and the corresponding "coefficient of variation" calculated.

       Table II presents tne ratio of the "coefficient of variation" for

  the hypothetical real profit series to that for the actual real profit

  series. It is seen from Table Al that, given the actual debt issues of

  firms, the profits of the industrial firms would on the whole have

  been more stable had they issued indexed debt rather than nominal debt,

  while profits for the utilities would on the whole have beer. less stable.

  The reasons the ratios in Table Al are not uniformly greater (less) than

  unity if the corresoonding correlation of Table I is negative (positive)

is   that the variability measure is affected by the dates of issue of

securities. Table A.I shows that a number of firms, including Mobil,

I.B.M. and   Sears,   would have had slightly nore stable after-tax profit

streams over the last twenty years had they issued index bonds rather

than   nominal bonds   on every occasion on which they issued debt. Figures

A.].   and A.2 shows hypothetical and actual real profits for Sears and
Consolidated Edison for the twenty year period.

1. Much of the literature on index bonds has attempted —— but with little
    success —— to explain the non—existence of privately issued index bonds
    in developed capital markets. See, for instance, Arvidsscn (1962),
    Fischer (1975), Levhari and Liviatan (1975).             -


2.   Fischer (1975a).

3. In the sense that their real returns are positively correlated with
     inflation.

4. The indexation of labor contracts is well-documented; see, e.g.
    Sparrough and Bolton (1972). The existence of inde::ation in other
    types of contracts is known from anecdote and rersonal :nowlede,
    but the extent of such indaxation has apparently not been documented.

                                                                -



6.   Kraus and Litzenberer (1973) use these two   elements   to develop a
     theory of optimal financial leverage in a model :iere there is a
     full set of continent co'modities. The model of this paper uses the
     mean variance version of the capital asset pricing mcdel to
     avoid assuming a full set of contingent ccmmoditics, in uhich case
     the consumer or a mutual fur.d could construct an index bond.

7.   Some of these arguments are contained in Arvissom     (1962)   and
     Friedman (1974).

8. See, for instance, Jensen (1972).

9. We shall assume throughout that c is sufficiently large that           >   0;
     this is a matter of convenience.

10. Jensen's inequality therefore implies that the expected price level
     in period two exceeds that of period one —— the expected price
     level is l/(1_2). Since it is only uncertainty about the price
     level that matters for the analysis, no substantive results dpnd
     on the assumption that the average purchasing power of money is
     not expected to change.
11. The actual tax reu1ations are sumewhat more com-lex in that no tax is
     paid on that portion of the distribution to equity holders regarded as
     repayment of principal.

12. It is possible that W be chosen such that the set N is empty. We shall
     assume that N is in fact non—empty; the reader may want to verify that
     the results are little different if N is empty, i.e. if W       is
                                                                  chosen
     such that W < b.

13.   This is the essence of the view advanced by Kraus and Litzenberger,
      op. cit. This theory fails to explain the existence of bonds before
      the corporate income tax. Interesting papers by Jensen and Neckling
      (1975) and Myers (1975) explore the determinants of debt capacity in
      a longer—run perspective.

14. In a more general version, 1 have worked with the specification
              — 1) + A(x — x) + n and obtained no more insight from this
      RM
      case than the one in the text.

15. See Body (1975).

16. Henceforth we shall refer to W as "the supply of index bonds" or "the
     amount of index bonds." It should be noted that V is in fact the pay-
     ment promised to index bond holders and that while increases in W would
     be positively related to increases in sales of index bonds, the rela-
     tionship is not linear.

17. See footnote 16.

18. See Black, Jensen and Scholes (1972).

19. It should be noted that we are not here allowing the firm to issue both
     types of bonds simultaneously, though it is quite likely that such an
     option would generate a greater stock market value for the firm than
     the issue of only one type of bond. Our major concern, however, is to
     show that neither type of bond dominates the other.

20. The locus B = 0 is not extended as far a- the values    =        because
     we were not able to establish whether the B = 0 locus intersects the
           *
               =
                        *
                            locus.

21. An exponential could not be used because profits were negative for some
     firms in some years.

 22. It is beyond the scope of this paper to speculate on reasons for this
      negative correlation. One obvious "explanation" which may be forthcoming
      is that all the results tell us is that profits fell over the late sixties
      and early seventies when the rate of inflation was high. Since both
      regressions treat the inflation rate as essentially constant over specified
      periods, residuals will be positive in the late 60's and early 70's. This
      explanation is probably statistically correct for the cases it fits but
      leaves open the question of why profits fell as the rate of inflation rose.

 23. Of course it is possible that the financial officers of all firms believe,
      despite the evidence, that their real profits are negatively correlated
      with the price level. Presumably, though, the evidence, if it stays firm,
      will eventually change such beliefs.
24. We shall not discuss the important issue of how the tax system
     should be adjusted for inflation but rather remain within the
     confines of the present U.S. tax structure.

26. In my previous paper on index bonds, I stated that indexed payments
     would be treated as dividends, this on the basis of verbal discussion
     with students of the question who were certain of the fact. On
     further examination, outlined above, I now believe that indexed
     interest payments would be treated as interest.

27.   The only statement other than that quoted in the text which I have
      been able to find that appears to make the tax status of indexed
      interest unclear is 'Thus, interest paid ... at an increased rate
      for which there is no consideration, is not deductible (.162 belOw)"
      Standard Federal Tax Reporter, 1974, Vol. 2, p. 19,009). Examinatiofl
      of .162 (on p. 19,044) suggests that indexed interest would not be
      regarded as a "gratuitous payment" (i.e. one for which there is no
      consideration) and would be deductible.
