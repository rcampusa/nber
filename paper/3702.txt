                  GROWTH • MACROECONOMICS • AND DEVELOPMENT


                                     ABSTRACT


       The 1980s were both     the   lost decade of growth for much of
Latin America and Africa, and the period in which --              through   the
new growth theory -- macroeconomists returned to the study of
growth and development. The new growth theory is production
function driven and concerned primarily with steady states, and
has   paid little attention to the role of macroeconomic policy --
as reflected for instance in the rate of inflation and the
                                                           budget
deficit --   in   determining growth. This paper presents a variety
of evidence that macroeconomic policies matter for long-run
growth. First, macroeconomic variables enter the typical new
growth   theory cross-country regressions with statistical
significance and the expected signs. Second, evidence from large
multi—country case studies, and from case-studies of Chile and
Cote d'Ivoire presented in the paper, shows that macroeconomic
policy choices have     had   a significant impact on growth over
periods of more than a decade. The conclusion is that

macroeconomic policy choices, including the budget deficit, the
exchange rate system, and those choices that determine the
inflation rate, matter for long-term economic growth.

              "When Keynes solved 'the great puzzle of Effective
              made it possible for economists once more to study Demand',
                                                                 the

              progress of society in long-run classical terms--with a clear
              conscience..." (Swan, 1956, p334)


       For most developing countries, in Africa and Latin America, the
                                                                                eighties
 are known as the lost decade; for many it was a decade of negative growth.

 Developing   country economic   policy in the eighties focussed on structural

 adjust,ent, a combination of macroeconomic stabilization measures to
                                                                      restore
domestic and external equilibriun, and structural changes        in policies    and

institutions designed to make the economy more efficient and flexible            and

thereby increase growth (World Bank, 1988, 1990a).

      As the decade progressed, and the consequences of macroeconomic

disequilibria became clearer, development economists and practitioners

increasingly accepted the view that broad macroeconomic stability is
                                                                              necessary
for sustained growth.2 For instance, at the start of the new decade, heavy

weight has to be placed on likely macroeconomic --

Soviet Union, India, Turkey, tote d'Ivoire, and Brazil.

          The eighties were also the decade in which macroeconomists returned
                                                                              to
  growth theory and turned to development
                                                The new growth theory, starting with
  Romer (1986) and Lucas (1988), deals
                                           explicitly with development, seeking to
  account for the apparent non-convergence of
                                                  per capita income levels between

  developing and industrialized countries.3 A hallmark of much of the new

  literature is the demonstration that distortions and
                                                             policy interventions that
  can be shoitn to affect the level of income in
                                                    conventional models, can affect
  the steady state growth rate in the new models     -   - thereby   providing analytical
 backing for assertions that had routinely been made
                                                            by development economists.
 Although existing models, such as the Harrod-Domar model4 or its multi-sector

 fixed coefficient extensions, or the Solow model without the Inada condition,5

 also produce such results, it is clear that
                                                  the new growth theory is
 responsible for the recent interest in the determinants of
                                                                     long-run growth
 among macroeconomjsts.

        The new growth theory has also returned to some of the classic themes of

 the development literature,     among them the roles of technology, international
 trade, human   capital,   economies of scale, and the possible need for a co-
ordinated   big investment push to break out of a low income equilibrium.6
       The empirical work associated with the new growth theory consists largely
of   cross-country regressions, typically using the Sujiimers-Heston       (1988) ICr

 3While it is a convenient
                           problem on which to deploy the new theories, their
aim is more ambitious than to account for
                                            non-convergence, which can in any
case be explained in the Solow framework. (Mankiw. D. Romer and D. Well
p990)). See also the references in the next footnote.
  Since a version of this model has been used
                                               as the standard model in World
Bank country analyses, many development economists had routinely been assuming
that the saving rate affects the growth rate.

Srinjvasan (1991).
                                                                      and

 extremely useful paper by Levine and Renelt (1990W; the strongest results are

 that investment in physical capital, and either the level or the rate of
                                                                                   change
 of human capital, increase the rate of growth.

       The new growth theory is production function driven and       primarily
 concerned   with steady states. There has been remarkably little focus on the
 influence   of riacroeconomic policies on growth: for instance, it is striking

 that measures of political stability, but not macroeconomic policy, have been

 included in new growth theory-based regressions.8 Swan's (1956)        excuse for
 concentrating on the long run -   - that   with the help of Keynes we know how to
control short run macro problems -   - is    less plausible now than it was in the

fifties and sixties, especially for the developing countries.

      The aim of this paper is firmly to establish --      or   re-establish -   -that
macroeconomic policies matter for economic growth and development.                In

Section I discuss the relationships between macroeconomic policies and growth.

In Section II I present several types of evidence suggesting that macroeconomic

policies do matter for growth: that countries that manage short-run

macroeconomic policies better, tend to grow faster. In addition to extending

the conventional cross-country regressions to include macroeconomic       indicators.

Romer (1989).
8crier and TulJ.ock (1989) do include macroeconobic variables in cross-country
growth regressions, but their work is not inspired by the new growth theory,
taking off rather from an earlier paper by Zormendi and Heguire (1985). Levine
and Renele (1990b) also include macroeconomic variables in their

regressions; so does De Gregorio (1991) in a study of Latin Anerica. A
valuable start in analyzing the links between short-run macroeconomic
management and growth, and in attempting to draw policy implications from the
new growth theory, has been made by Vittorio Corbo and his associates at the
World Bank; see for instance World Bank (1990).

 the mechanisms through which macroeconomic policies matter, examining whether

 they have any independent influence on growth, or whethar rather they       operate
 almost entirely by affecting investment. In Section IV I draw on the evidence

 from major case studies to examine and amplify the conclusions       on macroeconomic
 policy drawn   from the previous sections. Conclusions and issues for future
 research are presented in Section V.


 I. Macroeconomic Policies


      By macroeconomic policies I mean monetary, fiscal, and exchange rate

policies that help determine the rate of inflation, the budget deficit, and the

balance of payments. In particular, I will be examining partial correlations

between growth and inflation and growth and the budget deficit. I expect that

countries that permit high inflation rates and large budget deficits grow more

slowly.

      The potential links between inflation and     growth are discussed and
developed in Fischer (1983) and   by   implication in Fischer and   l4odigliani
(19Th). While the Mundell-Tobin effect'° implies that an increase in expected

inflation increases capital accumulation, a variety of other mechanisms

produces the opposite correlation. The negative effect of inflation on the

not address in any detail questions of alternativ, development strategies - -

                                                       are frequently analyzed
ing cross-country regressions of the type that are presented in this paper.
  As noted in Fischer (1988), the mechanisms producing the Mundell and Tobin
effects actually differ, though both imply that an increase in expected
inflation increases capital accumulation.

 efficiency of the exchange mechanism suggests that higher inflation reduces tile

 level   of income; by extension through the new growth theory mechanisms, this

 interaction would produce a negative relation between inflation and         growth.

 Similarly, all the costs of inflation detailed in Fischer and Hodigliani
                                                                                  (1978)
 --
      including   the impact of inflation on the taxation of capital
                                                                        would imply
 a negative association between the level of income and inflation, and
                                                                               through
 the new growth theory mechanisms between inflation and growth. This
                                                                              paper
 also discusses the positive Association between the level and     variability of
 the inflation rate, and the likely positive association between inflation and

 uncertainty about future price levels. This uncertainty too is likely to

 reduce Inflation.

         Probably as important as the above mechanisms is the role of inflation as

 an indicator of the overall ability of the government to manage the economy.

Since there are no good arguments for very high rates of      inflation, a

government that is producing high inflation is a government that has lost

control. Economic growth is likely to be low In such an economy.

       This same argument is the main reason to expect a negative association

between budget deficits and growth. Governments that run large budget deficits

are governments out of control. In addition, in many models budget deficits

crowd out private investment.

       In the short run, neither the inflation rate nor the budget deficit are

unaffected by the growth rate. A supply shock will both reduce the growth rate

and raise the inflation rate; and given government spending a reduction in

growth will increase the deficit. The length of tine period in the regressions

in this paper is fifteen years. The government can certainly set the inflation

rate and   the   deficit independently of the growth rate over such a long period.

       Nonetheless, the possible endogeneity of monetary and fiscal policies has

 to be dealt with. That is done both through instrumental variable estimation

 and through the case studies presented in Section IV,


 II. Cross-sectional Evidence


       Forty cross-sectional growth studies published since 1980 are listed by

 Levine and Renelt (l99Oa).1' Each study regresses the growth rate       over a given

 period against a variety of variables; well over 50 regressors have been used

 in these studies (Levine and Renelt (199Gb)). AJong the regressors are

variables relating to trade and trade policy, and exchange rates; fiscal

policy; political and social stability and rights; human capital; and

macroeconomic policy and outcomes. Early studies tended to focus on trade

policy and investment; studies associated with the new growth theory
                                                                          typically
include initial real income And some measure of human capital as well as

investment.

      For a sample of 101 countries, over the period 1960-89, Levine and Renelt

(3S9Ob) present a basic regression

Their list is necessarily incomplete; in particular, it does not include the
comparative cross-country analysis by Morris and Adelman (1988), which is based
on work dating back to the 1960s. Several other earlier cross-country studies
are listed by Chenery, (Chapter 2 in Chenery, Robinson and Syrquin (1986),
(p.27)). Reynolds (1986, p.lOl) also presents a cross-sectional growth
regression, despite his general preference for time-series studies.

 is the share of investment in CDI'. Applying Learners extreme bounds
                                                                                 analysis
 to equation (1), the robust relationships are shown to be those between
                                                                                   growth
 and initial income, and between growth and inyescnlentj2

       They then extend the analysis to include a variety of other variables.

 Their two broad findings are, first, that several Pleasures of economic policy

 are related to long-run growth; and second, that the relationship between

 growth and almost every particular macroeconomic indicator other than the

 investment ratio is fragile.

       There are two standard interpretations of such regressions.
                                                                              First, they
can be interpreted as attempts to estimate a time differenced production

function of the general form


(2) t    — F(At. a( ) b( )H)


where At is an overall efficiency factor, including not            only the level of

technology,   but   also for example representing the quality of goverment

management    of   the economy, or institutional factors; K and H are physical and

human capital respectively; and a( ) and b( )          are   efficiency factors. Except
for some initial conditions, the regressions deal with averages of the

variables over long periods, treating countries as the population from which

the observations are drawn.

      Differentiating equation (2). we can interpret the coefficients in (1):

             q1 A/A +   2   (a/a +   K/k)   + 73 (b/b + H/B)



l2De Long and Suimners (1990) present evidence that growth is linked primarily
to the share of manufacturing investnent in CNP.
 where        is the elasticity with respect to argument i in equation (1), and C?

 is the growth rate of aggregate output. The coefficient on investment in (1)

 should be related to the average marginal product of capital over the nearly

 three decades represented by each observation; this coefficient -     - which      is

very robust •-      is   typically in the range of 10-20 percent.13 The negative

coefficient on population growth in (1) is (noisily) related to the growth rate

of the unaugmented stock of human capital. H if population growth were equal

to labor force growth, then the coefficient on labor in an equation for

aggregate growth would be 0.62. In any case, equation (1) suggests that per

capita income grows less rapidly the more rapidly population grows.

         An   alternative interpretation starts from the assumption that the       economy
is tending towards a steady state income level, Y. The steady state income

level    is determined    by the rate of saving (or investment). investment in human

capital, and the rate of population growth. Thus

where # > 0 is related to the returns to scale properties of the underlying

production function with respect to the variable factors. If # C        I,   the

coefficient on Y0 in a regression like (1) will be negative, indicating

convergence of income levels among economies with the same rates of investment,

human capital, and population growth.


1However, the investment coefficient falls to 6 percent in some regressions in
Zarro (1989b) that also include measures of political instability.

         Equation (4) makes clear the role of initial income in equation (1). An

 interpretacion of cross-country regressions based on equation (3) has the

 benefit of not requiring that the economy be approaching a steady state   -.   and

 developing countries in the period since 1970. it is hard to take the steady

 level of real income provides evidence of convergence; it indicates   some type

of diminishing returns for the production function expressed in terms of per

capita output.15 The variable SEC in (1) is included as a proxy for the

country's ability to implement technical change; however, the 1960 secondary

school enrollment rate must be a noisy measure of a country's ability to

implement technical change over the period 1960-89.     Note further that since

it is the rate of technical progress rather than the level of technical

sophistication that matters for growth we would under the equation (3)

interpretation expect some measure of the change in human capital to affect

growth. 16



4Despite some theoretical papers dealing with growth among open economies,
e.g. Grossman and Helpman (1990), new growth theory regressions typically treat
each country as a single closed economy tending towards its steady state income
level.
15As argued by P. Romer (1989), measurement error in initial income will bias
its coefficient to be negative (since positive measurement error in RGDPGO
reduces the level of the dependent variable); he also presents some evidence
yggesting this problem may be present.
  The change in enrollment is typically not included in growth regressions
because of mutual causation between it and the growth of income, and the
unavailability of instruments to deal with that problem. However Rower (1989)
shows that the coefficients on both literacy and the change in literacy are
significant when instruniented using the consumption of newsprint and the number
of radios per capita. In this case initial income becomes insignificant.

        The range of RGDP6O is from 0.21 ($208) to 7.38 (57380).              The iniplication
  is that the poorest country In the group would catch              up In 142 years if It had

  the same secondary school enrollment ratio (and other variables in (1)) as the

  richest country)7 A country starting at $1000 in 1960 would catch up in 90

 years, ceteris naribus. Initial real. income and secondary school enrollment

 would be strongly negatively correlated if social and religious factors did not

 intervene; probably these two large coefficients between them isolate a

 particular group of countries, for example countries where females
                                                                                 typically
 did not receive a secondary education, whose
                                                         growth experience differs from the
 average.18

       The significant divergences in economic performance across countries that

 underlie regression (1) are summarized in Table 1.19                The growth rates are for

 OP, with countries weighted by their relative CDP's measured in dollars in

 1980. Over the period since 1960, economic growth has accelerated in Asia

 while slowing in Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA); the slowdown in

 the l9SOs was greater in Latin America than in Africa, even when measured on

 the basis of the growth of per capita CD?.

      The association between growth and investment in Table 1 is
                                                                               broadly

   The similarities of experiences across countries within regions call for
explanations; among them must be the common influence of particular
industrialized country partners (e.g. Japan in Asia, the United States for
Latin America), similarities of historical experiences, and learning from
neighbors. There are of course also real differences
                                                       among countries within a
region, for instance, the development strategies and growth performance of
Kenya and Tanzania, or Korea and India, differ greatly.

 sharp increase in the rate of investment between the first two periods without

 an increase in the   growth rate. 20   Inflation   increased   between periods in each
 region, but the increases were much greater in SSA and         particularly in Latin
 America than in Asia; there is a predominantly negative relationship between

 inflation and growth in Table 1. However low growth Africa has generally          not
had the very high inflation rates of Latin America; in part this is because the

 fixed exchange rate of the Francophone CFA zone has been maintained
                                                                            throughout.

The negative relationship between growth and inflation is pri ma fade evidence

that the quality of macroeconomic management affects growth.          Supporting

evidence comes from the apparently negative relationship between growth and the

increase in the size of the budget deficit, although here data for SSA are

incomplete.

      The data suggest, but only weakly, that countries that grow faster do

better on the current account of the balance of payments; the weakness of the

association derives in part from variations in the tightness of constraints on

borrowing. The association between the growth of exports and GD? growth is

striking: rapid growth in Asia in the 1980s is associated with an extremely

rapid rate of expørt growth, which can with further disaggregation be tracked

down not only to the tilEs, but also to the increase in exports fron, China

during its growth spurt in the l9SOs. The relationship between export and GD?


20The inverse of ICOR is frequently used as a measure of the efficiency of
investment, but because of depreciation is seriously biased for this purpose.
Conventionally measured ICOR is (I/Y)/(AYfY).    true" Icon, designated ICOR* is
equal to (aKfY)/(AY/y)    Let   be the rate of depreciation, and g — aYfY the
growth rate. Then Icon — ICOR* + (&/g)(K/Y). Measured ICOR exceeds ICOR* by
an amount that is inversely related to the rate of growth. Accordingly the
inverse of measured ICOE. tends to be higher the more rapid the growth rate.
This argwent   would have to be modified to take account of the non-homogeneity
of capital.

 growth supports the argument that outward orientation is a route to growth.21

 Each region shows depreciation of the exchange rate in the 1980s relative to

 the seventies; but it is striking that the depreciation was greatest in Asia.

 Nominal devaluations were greater in other regions, but their real impact was
 not   maintained   as well as in Asia.

        Table I is suggestive of the role that madoeconomic factors and policy

 may   play in determining aggregate performance. Further evidence comes from
 Table 2, reproduced from Levine and Renelt (1990b). The black market exchange

 rate premium is the average premium over the official exchange rate, as

 measured from Picks Currency Yearbook. The black market premium is an

 indicator of the extent of capital controls and expectations of devaluation.

and must be correlated with      the   degree of overvaluation of the currency.

        Dervis and Petri (1987) obtain similar results, based on the growth

performance of twenty middle-income developing countries. They show that

countries that grow faster than average tend to: invest more than average; have

smaller current account deficits; have lower shares of government spending; And

had more rapid export growth than other countries. The rapid growers did not

have particularly small budget deficits, and the extent of their real

depreciations and terms of trade changes were average.

Levine and Renelt's (1990b) data, provided by Ross Levine. No major
ifferences in conclusions emerge using the Levine-Renelt data.
 It can be argued that the developing countries are sufficiently and
systematically different from the industrialized countries that the latter
should be excluded from the regressions. While it is easy to agree with this
view at the extremes, it is hard to know where to draw the line, and I
therefore worked mostly with all countries for which there were data. For some
regressions (not reported here). I excluded all countries that in 1970 had an
income level above Italys; if anything, this gave stronger results with
espect to macroeconomic variables, particularly the debt.

some versions, the variance of inflation was entered along with the rate of
inflation; it was not significant and was excluded because it is highly
correlated with the rate of inflation (R—O.94). The SEC7O variable was
initially included but was dropped since its exclusion made little difference
and since PRIM7O was generally more significant. The budget surplus variable
is available for the period 1975-85 for a smaller sample of (56) countries; the
t-statistic on the budget surplus is siiialler in that sample, but the
coefficient is still significant at the 5% level. However in those regressions
the significance level on the inflation rate drops below 5%, while that on the

growth that were discussed in Section 1 operate by affecting investment, it
should be noted that the coefficients on both inflation and investment in

equation (5) are statistically significant. This Implies that inflation has

effects other than those that operate through investment. For instance,

inflation could affect the efficiency of operation of the given factor inputs.

Regression (5) strengthens the argument that macroeconomic indicators are

correlated with growth, at least over the period 197O8S.27

      As discussed in Section I, the macroeconomic indicators included in (5)

cannot be regarded as truly exogenous. In this respect their status is no

different than that of investment. Instruments are difficult to find; for

instance, such natural candidates as measures of political instability not only

cause but also are caused by inflation. Instrumental variable estimation of

equation (5) using as instruments initial GDP and primary enrollment, the

frequency of crises and riots, military spending, foreign aid, and the debt in

1980, resulted in a regression in which no coefficient was significantly

different from zero. Instrumental variable regression using the above

instruments plus the variance of inflation, the frequency of constitutional

changes, and government consumption spending, produced results very sirailar to

(5). except that primary education lost its statistical significance.

debt rises. The inclusion of the black market foreign exchange premium is
3scussed below.
  Regressions in Dervis and Petri (1987) show that the macroeconomic variables
are less significant in cross-country regressions for the period 1960-73 than
subsequently. As suggested by the discussant of that paper. Arnold Harberger,
this may be be a result of their smaller variability in the earlier period.

Given   both the si..ilarity between equations (5) and (6). and the difficulties

of choosing instruments, I will focus in the remainder of this section on

equation (5).

        Relatively little of the cross-sectional variance in growth rates is

accounted for by the macroeconomic variables alone. When only the inflation

rate, debt, and the deficit are included, the (corrected) squared correlation

coefficient is only 0.16. When the continent dummies are added, 32% of the

variance is accounted for.

        Table 3 presents the correlation matrix of the variables in (5), as well

as their means and ranges. Several of the simple correlations are of interest:

the   simple correlation between investment and growth is high; the correlation
between the primary school enrollment rate and the share of investment in CDI'
is high;      the correlation between the budget surplus and inflation is non-

negative; the correlation between investment and inflation is negative; that

between external debt and the budget surplus is negative. Because investment

levels in Latin America are relatively high, the debt-investment correlation is



        The   external debt to 014P ratio serves in (5) as an indicator of the
exchange rate overvaluations of the late 1970s. The average black market

28The simple correlations among          the   non-dummy variables in Table 3 are
sensitive to the inclusion of the high-income countries. For instance, debt
and income are more negatively correlated in table 3 than they are in the same
sample excluding industrialized countries.
                                        - 16   -




 foreign exchange premium could serve as   another   such indicator: and Table 2
 suggests it   might be strongly related to growth. The simple correlation

 between the average growth rate over the period 1970-85 and the average black

 market premium for the same period, for a group     of forty countries for which
 the   data are available, is -0.24. The simple correlation between the premium

 and investment is -036, and between the premium and the budget surplus -

 03429      However, the coefficient on the average black market premium is never

significant in any regression that includes the other macroeconomic variables,

and this applies also to various non-linear transformations of the premium.

Its major impact seems to be to reduce the coefficient on the external debt,

but because its inclusion also changes the sample size, not much can be deduced

from any such effect. We return to the role of the black market premium in

Section III.

        Cross-sectional regressions such as (5) ignore information that might be

available in the time series of data within each country. Running a pooled

cross-section time-series regression of the general form of (5), for the period

1972.S5, and including lagged as well, as current values of the rates of

investment and inflation, we obtain:


29The premium is available for 67 countries for the period 1970-85, but there
are only forty countries for which the variables in equation (5) plus the
premium are all available. The weakness of the simple correlation between
growth and the black market premium may be a result of the wide range of the
premium, from zero to an average of 717% (for Nicaragua). The premium is high
for African countries, excluding those in the CFA zone, and for Latin Anerica.
Nicaragua aside, the highest premia, frequently exceeding 100%, are found in
North and Sub-Saharan Africa.

Investment variables retain their strong statistical significance in the pooled

regression, which also gives some evidence on the dynamics of the relation

between output and investment. The large contemporaneous coefficient, 36.5

(percent). must represent primarily the demand effect in which an increase in

investment demand causes a more rapid increase in output. The coefficients on

the investment rates can also be expressed in the form (12.8 INVit +                    23.7
AINVit + 19.9 AIi(tl)). suggesting that increases in the investment ratio

have a large temporary effect on growth, which can be associated with the

demand effect, leaving 12.8 percent as the estimate of the longer-term impact

of investment on growth.

         Both the regression evidence presented in this section and the data

presented in Tables 1 and 2 demonstrate the existence of suggestive

correlations between macroeconomic-policy related variables and growth over

periods as long as fifteen years. The evidence supports the view that the

quality of macroeconomic management, reflected in these regressions in the

inflation rate, the external debt ratio, and the budget surplus, matters for

growth

         It would be logical at this point to try to tie down               precisely   which

macroeconomic indicators are most robustly associated with growth in—the cross-
                                          - 18 -

 country regressions. However, that exercise is unlikely to be instructive, as
 the results of Levine and Renelt (199Gb) show. There are at least two reasons

 for this. First, none of the standard indicators -.        the budget surplus, the
 current account, the inflation rate, the real exchange rate -      - is   truly

 exogenous with respect to growth. Nor is the instrument problem readinly

 soluble. Second, cross-country egressions such as (5) have no clear

 structural interpretation. While      they   are very useful ways of summarizing the

correlations in the data, and they suggest that countries that manage the

macroeconomy   well   grow faster, they do not explain how.


III. Why Do Macroeconomic Variables Matter


       Suppose we accept the argument that inflation and other factors related

to short-run macroeconomic management affect economic growth. In terms of the

production function (1). there are two possible routes of influence. First,

hlacroeconomic management may affect the rate of investment, and thus the rate

of change of IC3° For example, large budget deficits may crowd out physical

investment; or high and uncertain inflation may both reduce investment and

induce capital flight. In addition, macroeconomic factors may affect the

efficiency with which factors are used, i.e. by affecting AC ).       a(   )   and b(
in equation (].):   for   instance, by distorting price signals, inflation may

reduce the rate of return on physical investment; or inflation may produce

distortions that reduce the real wage.

      New growth theory based cross country investment regressions are

presented in larro (1989a, 1989b) and Romer (1989), and their robustness

periods.

 examined in Levine and Renelt (1990h). These regressions generally show that

 some measure of initial human capital has a positive impact on investment, that

 measures of political instability have negative impacts, that investment is

 higher the lower the relative price of investment goods, and the mare the price

 of investment goods diverges from the world level. Zn addition, government

 investment appears to be complementary with private investment. The robustness

 tests by Levine and Renelt (199Db) show that none of the relationships in the

basic regression equation - -     which   does not include the relative price of

investment goods -    - is   robust: the cross-sectional results provide little

guidance on the determinants of investment.

       Table 6 presents estimates of a number of cross-sectional investment

regressions, all for the average share of investment in CNP over the period

1970-85.

       Equation (8) in Table 4 is both simple and has the highest explanatory

power for cross-country variation in investment, There are no clear causal

reasons that the initial level of per capita GOP and school enrollment enter

the equation. The significant coefficient on the growth rate is consistent

with the typical finding that accelerator type investment functions perform
well (Clark (1979)). However the direction of causation in this equation is
difficult     to establish.31

       When   the macroeconomic   variables are added and the growth rate of output

removed,   inflation and the budget surolus are signficantly negatively related
to investment. The negative relationship between inflation and the share of
investment is robust. Equations (10) and (11) suggest important interactions

310f course, the same can be said for the cross-country growth regressions that
include investment as an explanatory variable.
                                          - 20   -




 between the initial level of income and primary enrollment, and the continent

 dujimiies.32 Finally, in equation (12). ye see strongly statistically

 significant coefficients on the black market premium (SLAV)        and   the relative

 price of investment goods; the inclusion of these variables leaves the budget

 surplus as the other macroeconomic variable that is significant at the 5%

 level, but in the a priori wrong direction, if the surplus is interpreted as a

 measure of the quality of macroeconomic measurement, or if deficits are thought

 to crowd out investment33

         The relationship between the investment share and the black market

premium is reasonably robust, in the sense that the black market premium

 remainslarge and statistically significant in most penmitations of investment
equations that are based on the forty-country sample.34 The coefficients on

the other macroeconomic variable are not stable. The coefficient on the debt

is typically not significant, and it is frequently (though not significantly)

positive, implying that countries that borrowed bore in the seventies generally

invested more, ceteris paribus.

         The black market premium can be interpreted both as a measure of

expectations of depreciation of the currency, and as a crude index of

distortions. Expectations of depreciation may        affect   investment through

several channels: first, it is more attractive to hold foreign assets when


        can be seen from Table 3 that the simple correlations between the SSA
        and PRIM7O and RGDP7O are high.
drimy
  Sweder van Wijnbergen has suggested that the positive coefficient on the
budget deficit may reflect the role of government investment, which increases
both the overall rate of investment and the budget deficit. The coefficient on
the surplus is reduced when the dependent variable becomes private rather than
aggregate investment, but it does not become positive.
  Solimano (1989) finds, using quarterly data from 1977:1 to 1987:IV, that the
black market premium is strongly negatively associated with investment in
Chile.
                                             21


depreciation is expected3; second, economic uncertainty is higher under such

conditions; but third, for those who can obtain foreign exchange at the

official rate, foreign capital goods are cheap to import. While the first two

factors suggest a negative relationship between the black market premium and

investment, the third suggests the opposite. To the extent that the black

market premium serves as a general index of distortions and therefore of an

unsustainable situation, it is likely to be negatively correlated with

investment.

        The black market premium is both strongly negatively correlated with

investment, and in Section II did not appear to affect the rate of growth

significantly. The   explanation   would seem to be simple: that the black market

premium affects the rate of investment directly and thereby the rate of growth

indirectly. In terms of equation (5), the black market premium can be

interpreted as affecting the rate of investment but not the efficiency of

investment.

        Unfortunately, this argument does not stand up to further examination. A
priori, it is difficult to see why an index of distortions would            affect the

rate   of investment but not the rate   of   return   on   investment.   More important,
there   is direct evidence that the black market premium is correlated with the

efficiency of investment. Table 5 presents ax post estimated rates of return

on investment projects in developing countries, cross-categorized against

measures of distortions and macroeconomic variables including the real interest

rate, the black market premium, and the inflation rate.36


35This assumes domestic interest rates have not adjusted, which is implied by
the presence of a black market premium.
36The data are from Kaufnann (1990); Kaufmann's preliminary regressions suggest
that the black market premium is the main macroeconomic variable that affects
project rates of return. This presumably means that it is the best summary
indicator of macroeconomic distortions.

          The interpretation of the role of the black market premium must therefore

be Left as something of a mystery: it is negatively associated with the rate of

 investment; it is not clearly associated with the growth rate, except perhaps

 in extreme cases;3 but there is direct evidence that it appear5 to affect the

rate of return on investment. Whether these results can be explained by the

relationship    between the black market premium and other measures of

macroeconomic policy remains to be seen.

      Although none of the regressions in Table 4 presents a satisfactory

account of the determination of investment, this evidence as well as that in

Levine And Renelt (l990b), again shows that macroeconomic variables --

particularly    the black market premium and inflation --    affect   investment. Zut

because the relationships between investment and macroeconomic indicators,

except the black market premium and, to a lesser extent, inflation, are not

robust, it is unlikely that further cross-sectional regressions of this type

will pin down the transmission mechanism between macroeconomic variables and

growth.

      Time series evidence for individual countries may help do so. For the

industrialized economies, investment equations generally show investment being

affected by the cost of capital and by demand variables. The theoretical

literature has emphasized the option value     of waiting   as a factor that makes


37The qualifier is based on results    reported in Chapter 2 of the 1991 World
Development Report (forthcoming).      In that study rates of total factor
productivity growth for 68 countries are regressed against several variables,
including the black market premium, which is interpreted as a measure of
macroeconomic instability. The authors find that TFP growth is significantly

but that total factor productivity growth was otherwise unaffected by the
premium.

investment especially sensitive to uncertainty; quantity of credit impacts have

also been identified.38

          The same variables that affect investment in industrialized countries

should also affect investment in developing countries39 In addition, foreign

exchange and credit rationing may be more prevalant in developing countries.

Investment equations for developing countries have also paid considerable

attention to possible complemencaricies between public and private sector

investinenc.0 Rama (1990) sunmiarizes the results of separate investment

regressions for thirty nine developing countries, nineteen of them Latin

Mberican. Aggregate demand variables are almost always positively associated

with investment, as are measures of the availability of credit; measures of

uncertainty or instability are negatively associated with investment. Cost of

capital variables usually enter investment equations with the right sign, but

are typically not statistically significant. Public investment mare often

appears as a substitute for private investment than a complement in the studies

be reports, though this result in not typical of the investment literature.

          Cardoso   (1990) presents regressions on panel data for six Latin Anerican
countries. Changes in the tens of trade, the growth rate of CD?. and the
share of public investment in GOP are all significantly correlated with
investment. Public and private investment are positively associated. Other
variables that might be expected to affect investment, including a measure of

380n irreversible investment and the value of waiting, see Bernanke (1983) and
Pindyck    (1988); on finance and investment, see for example Fazzari, Hubbard and

 economic instability, the stock of internal government debt, and exchange rate

 depreciation, do not enter investment equations significantly; only the debt to

 exports ratio makes a significant entry in one equation.

       Solimano (1989). in a careful study of the determinants of Chilean

 investment, finds strong evidence that uncertainty or instability -    - of   output,

 the real exchange rate, and the real interest rate -- reduce investment. His

evidence also shows a complex relationship between the level of the real

exchange rate and investment: an overvalued exchange rate tends to encourage

investment, but the higher investment is non-sustainable.41

       The   time series studies of investment point to several macroeconomic-

policy related variables as affecting the rate of investment: increased

stability of output, the exchange rate, and the cost of capital increase

investment; so does the availability of credit; and in several studies, the

external debt has a negative impact on investment.42 The impact of public

investment on the overall rate of investment has not been firmly tied down in

investment   studies. The black market premium reduces investment,    as shown in

equation (10); and a reduction in the price of investment goods increases the

quantity of investment. Thus    the   bulk of the evidence suggests an important

role for macroeconomic policy in determining the rate of investment -    - even
treating the role of income in investment equations with due circumspection.

      The new growth theory has focussed on the determinants of physical

investment, even though the theory frequently relies on the accumulation of

btween the exchange rate and investment found in Cardoso's study.
  Schmidt-Rebbel and Muller (1990) find the debt to GNP ratio has a significant
impact on investment in Morocco; they treat the debt as an indicator of

human capital to generate endogenous long-run growth. T. Paul Schultz (1988,

p.569) examines    the   determinants of schooling for an 89 country sample. The

 income   elasticity of primary school enrollment is 0.31, while that for
secondary   school is 0.63. The relative price of teachers has a strong negative

impact on enrollments. Schultz's estimates show urbanization increasing

primary   school enrollment but reducing that for secondary school. The teacher-
student ratio also increases with income, more so for primary than for
secondary school. The positive association between        income and school

enrollment suggests a feedback effect between growth and its determinants --

including   macroeconomic policy -- and schooling.3

        It would be interesting as well to examine the policy-related

determinants of the efficiency with which human capital operates, and therefore

how much it contributes to output and growth. Schultz (1988, pS?5) provides

estimates of these returns by continent and level of schooling, which generally

show the highest returns to primary education, and higher returns in Latin

America and Africa than elsewhere. Taken at face value, the tatter findings

are   hard to reconcile with the typically negative coefficients on dummy
variables for those regions.      Part of the   explanation may be that the estimated
rates   of return are based on data from before the 1980s. Both the puzzle of

the rate of return results, and the relationship between the return to human

capital and macroeconomic performance, must be subjects of further study.


IV. Case Studies




43Although the regressions in Section II show the level of enrollment as
affecting growth, as noted there, other regressions in the literature, as well
as the production function (3), suggest that the increase in enrollment should
affect growth.
                                         - 26

      While the cross-sectional results on the determinants of both growth and

investment rates suggest that macroeconomic factors have important effects,

they do not tie down the channels of influence, nor the precise macroeconomic

factors that matter most. Nor do they give any real sense of the macroeconomic

policy decisions that have to be faced in practice.

      An interesting alternative is presented by Scholing and Tinaermann

(1988). who use a path model in which the growth rate is affected by "inner"

(latent) variables --   physical   capital, human capital, the growth of labor.

international competitiveness and political instability -    - that   are estimated

as linear combinations of measureable outer" variables.46 Essentially, the

approach allows for the creation of an index of. for example. macroeconomic

instability. Both the robustness of this approach, which is closely related to

the work by Adelnan and Morris (1988). and the clarity of the interpretations

it provides, remains to be seen.45 But by potentially putting structure on the

reasons variables enter a model, it does present one possible way out of the

difficulty that a never-ending array of alternative plausible variables can be

entered in cross-country regressions.

      The case study approach presents another, less formal,    method   of dral4f.ng

conclusions about the role of macroeconomic factors. Corden (1991) summarizes

the results of a World Bank study of macroeconomic policies, crisis, and growth


44The Analysis allows for degrees of latency, with some latent variables being
affected by other latent variables.
      example, Scholing and Timm.rIEAnn include the rate of inflation as an
outer variable determining international competitiveness; in this paper it has
been taken as an indicator of macroeconomic performance.

 in   seventeen developing countries, including nine of the twelve developing

 economies whose 1987 CNP exceeded $30 billion.46

        Fifteen of the countries studied by Corden experienced a public
                                                                           spending

                                                                           timing
 and extent of the spending booms varied across countries, the cause appears to

have been either a rapid increase in export receipts, or the increased

availability of foreign financing. Many of the countries built up their

foreign debt rapidly. Growth in the countries with public spending booms was

high up to the end of the seventies. For many of them, the investment ratio

and growth fell in the 1980's. Corden points to three lessons from the

experiences of the boom period: smooth spending relative to income48; appraise

investments carefully (this advice is offered to creditors as well); and beware

of euphoria -- be cautious.69

        Almost all the countries in the sample went into a recession or crisis at

the end of the seventies or In the first years of the eighties; Pakistan is the

exception. The macroeconomic story of the eighties is the story of the policy

successes and failures in dealing with the shocks that took place at the turn

of the decade. There is no uniform pattern of success: Korea
                                                                adjusted


46corden discusses Korea, which was not in the original study, and omits
discussion of Argentina, which was. The larger developing economies included
in the World Sank study are Argentina. Brazil, Coloibia, India, Indonesia,
Mexico, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Turkey. Egypt, Korea, and Venezuela
are the remaining three. (China is excluded because the study was confined to
non-socialist economies.)
47corden states that there is a negative cross-country correlation between
vestment booms in 1974-80 and growth from 1982 on.
 °Corden expresses this advice in different language.   It has to be recognized
though that commodity exporters in the late l9?Os, especially oil exporters,
were in good company in believing the good times were forever.
49Aaong the euphoric cases mentioned by Corden, Cote dIvoire, which is
examined below, raised public sector investment from Ill of GN? to 21% in the
four years following 1974.

 immediately and hard: Chile and Indonesia adjusted later and hard; Mexico
 adjusted later yet. Colombia and Thailand adjusted gradually and successfully.

 Turkey appeared to have adjusted veil in the mid-eighties but has still not

 dealt with its budget deficit, and suffers from rising inflation, Other

 countries in the group are still struggling. The general lesson from these

episodes is that growth does not return until the adjustments -       - especially   the

fiscal adjustments --     are   made.5°

        A complex relationship between inflation and growth emerges from the

cross-country study. The simple correlation between inflation and growth in

the sample in the eighties is weak, because the three low-growth African

countries have low inflation, and because high-growth turkey had high

inflation. Brazil during the period up to the l980s (and Israel up to 1973) is

the main exhibit for the case that high inflation is not inconsistent with
                                                                                    high

growth; however there is no case of high growth being consistent for any length

of tine with triple digit inflation, Several       of   the high growth countries

suffered from inflation in excess of twenty percent for a few years during the

early eighties, but the inflation tended to come down quickly -- as Corden

argues, it is important that inflationary expectations not become entrenched

and   that   the government's commitment to low inflation be established.

       Exchange rate systems among the seventeen countries in the study and over

time within the countries vary widely. Periods of overvaluation associated

with capital inflows were a common feature of the macroecDnomic instability at

the turn of the decade. Corden draws the lesson that nominal exchange rates


50corden does not specify the conclusions on the timing of adjustment that
should be drawn from the study; the conclusion in the text is consistent with
the examples he presents.

 should be adjusted frequently, and that non-inflationary
                                                               monetary policy should
 generally be attained through a commitment to fiscal discipline rather than a

 nominal exchange rate. He also notes that there hav, been many instances of

 ineffective inflationary, nominal devaluations: nominal devaluations          should

 generally be accompanied by a policy package that includes monetary and fiscal

 adjustments.

          Most of the lessons of the comparative study are
                                                             completely obvious, but

 supposedly hard-nosed bankers in the lace seventies. Others, for instance the

effective, are less obvious, and nay also be less certain.31 To provide

examples illustrating both that the lessons are nonetheless of value and the

largely political economy issues they raise, I turn to two of the countries

examined in the study.52

Cote d'Ivoire.

          For the first fifteen years of its independence, until 1975, Cote

dlvoire was an outstanding performer

growth averaged 7.7 percent per annum, with no major macroeconomic imbalances.

As a member of the CPA zone, with a fixed exchange rate against the French

franc and its Francophone neighbors, it    had   low inflation throughout the

 result of immigration from lower income neighbors.

         Over the period 1980 to 1989, CDP rose by less than 1 percent per year.

 and per capita CUP fall more than 25%. etween 1975 and 1960 the economy was

 derailed by a massive public investment program, whose fiscal implications were

 for a time     covered by a sharp but temporary improvement in the terms of trade.

 It has not yet recovered from that and subsequent shocks and policy mistakes.

        Some of the developments seen in Table 6 and in Charts 1-3 are similar to

 those that took place in Latin Ajuerica at the same time. A massive improvement

 in the terms of trade in 1977 combined with rapidly increasing
                                                                        governoent

spending and borrowing resulted in a fourteen percent increase in CNP in 1976.

The currency      appreciated as domestic prices rose more rapidly than abroad,
while   the    exchange rate remained fixed -- as it    has   been since 1946. Despite
the improvement in the tenis of trade, and a more than doubling of           the dollar
value   of    exports between 1974 and 1980, the current account went into large

deficit. Zy the end of the decade, the foreign debt to GDP ratio was above

fifty percent, making the country vulnerable to         the real interest   rate shock of

the early eighties.

        Cot.   d'Ivoire was also hit very   hard   by the decline in commodity prices
in the early eighties, with the terms of trade in 1982 being less than half the
1976 level. Public sector investment was cut fast, but government revenues
declined pan passu, leaving a double digit budget deficit. Although the
appreciation     of the dollar in the early eighties produced a real     depreciation
of   the CFA franc, the current account deficit remained in double digits in the

early eighties.
                                          - 31

        Further public investment cuts and revenue measures reduced the
                                                                              budget
 deficit after 1984; together with a temporary improvement in the        terms of

 trade this led to a turnaround in the current account after 1984.         Growth

 however remained slow, failing to keep up with population growth of 4.1

 percent. In 1988 and 1989 the terms of trade worsened, governaent
                                                                          spending
 rose and revenues fell, and the budget deficit returned to double digits.           The

 currency continued to depreciate slowly, as tight domestic policy and massive

 unemployment reduced domestic prices. But the current account deficit

 worsened,   leading to payments arrears and     the suspension of debt servicing.

Aggregate    growth   turned negative, while per capita income declined by more than

 5 percent a year. Declining incomes and rising unemployment led to political

difficulties, and the appointment of a new government in 1990.

       One   source   of Cot. d'Xvoire's budget difficulties was a government

coIitaent to fixed CFA franc prices      for the main   export crops, coffee and

cocoa, that by 1989 were nearly double the world level. These prices         were cut
in the second half of 1989. Civil service salaries are
                                                              a major budgetary

expenditure, amounting to twelve percent of CDP, which has been difficult to

cut despite the need to adjust internal prices to the fixed exchange        rate.

      The exchange rate system is a key issue for tote d'Ivoire and other

countries in the franc zone. The      fourteen countries of the zone have   had free

capital movements within the zone and with France for over forty       years, have

had relatively Low inflation, and until the late seventies,       grew rapidly. For
most of its existence, the franc zone has benefitted its members, who       are

reluctant to give it up. Devaluation of the CFA franc against the French franc

would be difficult, not only because of the inevitable loss of credibility of
                                            - 32 -

 the exchange rate commitment • but also because the countries of the zone are
overvalued to differing extents.
        The new Ivoirian government is committed to pursuing a rigorous

adjustment   program. It will attempt to restore macroeconomic balance by

cutting current government expenditures, including wages, and by reforming the

tax system. Cutting current government expenditures is urgent, since the rate

of public    investment   is incompatible   with   sustained growth. The government

also intends to increase the efficiency of public enterprises, in part through

privatization. It will also have to make a variety of regulatory And incentive

reforms, using non-exchang, rate measures to provide incentives to export.

        Cote d'lvoire provides an example of a country where macroeconomic

policies and   mistakes,   especially the   euphoria    during 1976-80,   have had a major
impact on growth   over a sustained period.          The decision to stay with the fixed

exchange rate has been extremely important, and may not be sustainable. The

inability of the government to cut current government spending, especially

civil service salaries, has been an important macroeconomic factor, with roots

that lie in the political economy of tbe country. Of course, macroeconomics is

far from being all that matters: the countrys growth suffered in the first

instance   from, tens of trade shocks, and suffers also from most of the familiar

microeconomic distortions and inefficiencies, including inefficient public

enterprises.

Chile

        The story of Chile's economic recovery is worth retelling, for both its

negative and positive lessons.56 Chile has been through two extremely tough

adjustment periods. The first came after the i1itary government took power in
1973.   confronting an   economy in near-total       disarray.   The government   removed
price   controls, devalued, and   moved the budget from a deficit of       thirty    percent
in   1973 to a surplus by 1976. An import liberalization program reduced tariffs

to a uniform 10 percent by 1979. Companies and banks that had been

nationalized under the Allende government were privatized. The fiscal squeeze,

accompanied by a nearly forty percent decline in the terms of trade between

1974 and 197S, created a massive recession. Due partly to monetary tightening.

the real interest rate exceeded 60 percent in 1976.

        The inflation rate was however slow      to come   down, remaining in triple

digits through 1977. Regarding the inflation as largely inertial, particularly

because of the budget surplus, the governaent instituted a pre-announced

schedule of devaluations at less than the current inflation rate, in the hope

of causing expectations to stabilize around the nominal exchange rate Anchor.

With imports liberalized, foreign competition was expected to assert a

disinflationary impact, reinforcing the expectations effect of the nominal

exchange rate anchor. In June 1979 the exchange rate was fixed to the dollar.

While inflation came down, it did not come down fast enough; as can be seen in

Chart   6. the real exchange rate appreciated rapidly from 1978. The tern of
trade began declining after 1979. The current account worsened rapidly.
reaching    14.5 percent of COP in 1981, the external debt increased, and Chile

had once again to adjust, even before the debt crisis struck at the end of

1982.

policy in   1975, concluding that monetary policy was restrictive.

      Chile   devalued in 1982. helping precipitate a financial crisis for banks

and firms that had borrowed abroad. In 1981 and 1982 the domestic real

interest rate exceeded 30 percent. The fiscal deficit (including the quasi-

fiscal deficit of the central bank) rose to near 9 percent of CDP in 19B256

The cutting off of external lending, the adverse changes in the terms of trade,

and the domestic financial crisis, resulted in a 14 percent decline in GD? and

an increase in the unemploynenc rate to 33 percent. For a time the governiiient

raised tariffs, to 35 percent. for revenue reasons. A generally tight fiscal

policy was accompanied by targeted employment programs.

      It took two years for the recoYery to begin. Between 1981 and 1986 the

government succeeded in producing a real devaluation of nearly 40 percent.

Inflation rose temporarily to more than 30 percent in 1985, but then came down

to the low 20 percent range, where it has stayed since; the real interest rate

has also declined to near 10 percent. In 1985 the government adopted an

adjustment progrm.. which not only privatized. liberalized, and began to cut

tariffs again, but also provided targeted assistance to alleviate poverty. The

program was designed to diversify exports and make the econony less vulnerable

to external shocks, in part by instituting a copper stabilization fund which

smooths government use of funds from copper export revenues. The current

account improved as exports boomed, helped in 1988 and 1989 by improving terms

of trade. GOP growth increased from 1985 to 1989, reaching a probably

unsustainable 10 percent in 1989; by 1987 GDP had returned to its 198]. level

and by 1988 unemployment was below 7 percent.

total deficit peaked at 9.8 percent of COP in 1985; there was a surplus by
1981. The data shown in Table 7 and Chart S do not include the quasi-fiscal
deficit.

      The Chilean      experience has been mined for more than its macroeconomic
policy   lessons. But there is little doubt that macroeconomic policy mistakes,

especially in the late seventies and early eighties, had a major impact on

Chilean growth during the last two decades. The attempt to deal with inflation

through the exchange rate turned into a disaster, which was amplified by the

international debt crisis. The rigorous macroeconomic policies pursued since

provide a stable background against which iuicroeconomic distortions have been

effectively removed. The empirical work by Solimano (1989) suggests also that

macroeconomic stability has been an essential ingredient in the zecovery of

investment. The continuing double digit inflation remains a problon, one which

is common    to   many other countries that have stabilized fran very high

inflation.

      Lessons can be learned also by contrasting Chilean experience with that

of Argentina And Brazil. Those countries failed to deal with their

macroeconomic imbalances during the eighties, growth has not resumed, and

attempts   at efficiency-enhancing adjustment programs have for the most part
failed as macroeconomic instability leads to frequent policy reversals.
      It   remains   in this section to comment    on Charts I. and   4,   for Cote

d'lvoire and Chile     respectively.     These confirui in a tine series context the

very strong relationship between growth and the share of investment seen in

Sections 1 and II. However, it is difficult to see these relationships as

reflecting purely the supply side impact of increased capital on output, rather
than -- as in equation (1)     -- both   a supply side effect and an accelerator

effect in which increased demand leads to higher investment.

     The restoration of growth in many countries requires an increase in

investment. Chile is one of the few non-Asian countries badly hit by the
                                         - 36   -




crisis   of the early 1980s in which investment has increased significantly and

growth has returned. But the recovery of investment takes time, evidence of

increased returns to capital, and £     period      of economic stability. Here too

macroeconomic policy matters.


V.   Concludine Co,ents

         The primary aim of this paper was to establish that a country's
macroeconomic policies matter for long run growth. Provided the inflation
rate,    external debt, and the goverrent deficit are accepted as macroeconomic

policy    indicators both the cross-sectional regressions and the case studies

support that contention. The results are less clear on the mechanisms through

which macroeconomic policy affects growth, but the case studies and much other

evidence suggests they have a powerful impact on investment. The separate role

of macroeconomic policy variables in the growth regressions imply the existence

of other channels, which need further investigation.

         It could be argued that the case studies show only that macroeconomic

policy affects growth in the short run, and that the effects of such policies

are transitory. It is difficult to deal with this contention over very lung

periods --    for   instance, the rapid growth of the post-world War II period can

be seen as a catch-up from the absence of growth in the Great Depression, so

that by 1973 the world was back where it would have been had growth proceeded

smoothly since 1929. This is a unit root issue. But it would be a mistake to

focus exclusively on the very long run: it was only in 1989 that Chilean per

capita income recovered its 1970 level. That long period of unnecessarily low

income certainly had welfare consequences for many, even if by 2010 Chile is

back where it would have been.

        The simplicity of the iuactoeconomtc policy lessons that can be drawn from

country studies raises the question of why those lessons Are so frequently not

implemented. Here is the role for political economy, both in recognizing the

particular circumstances of individual countries, and in seeking to develop

more general theories.57 The theories may contribute understanding, even if

they do not suggest how to change the policies.

        This paper contends that macroeconomic policy matters for growth, but not

that only macroeconomic policy matters. Reasonable macroeconomic stability is

probably necessary for sustained growth, but beyond that the overall economic

strategy pursued by the country --     market and outward orientation, the size and

role of government both in providing physical and social infrastructure,

especially for human capital, and in limiting its role in other areas --          is
crucial

        The new growth theory and the associated empirical work has focussed on

these more structural factors. The empirical work characterizes high-growth

countries: for instance, they invest a lot, they have higher school enrollment,

they are more open. But it has not explored with any care the mechanisms that

are central to endogenous growth theory -       - for   instance, whether the process of

human   capital   accumulation bears any similarity to the production functions for

human   capital   typical in that literature. Nor has it yet succeeded in

identifying the underlying deteninants of investment, though the relative

price effect emphasized by de Long and Sumners (1990) must be an important part

of the story.

        Identifying the determinants of investment, and the other factors

contributing to growth, will probably require a switch away from simple cross-


575ee for example Alesina and Drazen (1989).

sectional regressions to time series studies of individual countries, of the

type discussed in Section III.

      Solow (1989) discusses the difficulties of integrating short-run

macroeconomics with growth theory.58 There are indeed formidable problems in

constructing a tractable theoretical model of this type. Eut any model that

includes a production function and that accounts for the accumulation of

factors of production and the efficiency of their use can be used to analyze

long-run growth. Each of these elements has been modelled And estimated; they

can be brought together to provide a coherent empirical account of growth.

development context by Arida and Taylor (1989).
