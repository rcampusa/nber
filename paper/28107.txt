Top-up Design and Health Care Expenditure: Evidence from Cardiac Stents

                                         ABSTRACT

Since 2006, Taiwan's National Health Insurance (NHI) covers the full cost of baseline treatment
in cardiac stents (bare-metal stents, BMS), but requires patients to pay the incremental cost of
more expensive treatments (drug-eluting stents, DES). Within this "top-up" design, we study how
hospitals respond to a 26% cut of the NHI reimbursement rate in 2009. We find hospitals do not
raise the DES prices from patients, but increase BMS usage per admission by 18%, recouping up
to 30% of the revenue loss in 2009-2010. Overall, the rate cut is effective in reducing NHI
expenditure despite hospitals' moral hazard adjustment.

                                         I.   Introduction


    One major challenge faced by many countries is how to constrain the rising
health care cost while providing enough medical coverage and treatment choices.
In practice, one option is to cover all types of treatment ("full coverage"), which
fits patients' various medical needs but induces high medical expenditure. Some
"full coverage" programs (e.g. Medicare in the US) attempt to limit expenditure
by co-pay and co-insurance, but the realized medical claims still grow fast.1 A
second option, more common in Europe, only covers the baseline treatment ("no
top-up coverage"), which alleviates the moral hazard problem, but excludes more
advanced treatment choices.2
    To overcome these shortcomings, a third "top-up design" is proposed to cover
the cost of baseline treatment, but it requires patients to pay for the incremental
costs of more expensive treatment. Ideally, the top-up design could help patients
with basic coverage regardless of the treatment they choose, and attenuates the
moral hazard problem since patients pay the price difference if they opt for a more
expensive treatment. Academics have discussed its welfare implications (Einav,
Finkelstein and Williams, 2016; Shepard, Baicker, and Skinner, 2019; Marone
and Sabety, 2019), but more evidence is needed for provider practices under this
design. For instance, health providers could raise the price difference to exploit
patients willing to opt for a more expensive treatment. If this happens, it could
limit patient access to more expensive treatments and reduce consumer welfare.
It is also unclear whether the top-up design indeed attenuates moral hazard.3
Without knowing the provider's response to the top-up design, it is difficult to
fully evaluate the welfare consequences of this reimbursement scheme.
     1 In particular, the total Medicare spending has nearly doubled in the last decade, with 22% devoted
to fee-for-service (FFS) inpatient care (MEDPAC 2017). Medicare spending is projected to reach $1
trillion in 2021, and the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund is projected to be insolvent by 2028.
     2 For instance, England limits access to new treatments and technologies which require the National
Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) to provide empirical evidence on the cost-effectiveness
(Thorlby and Arora, 2019).
     3 Einav, Liran and Amy Finkelstein (2018) point out that "the impact of provider incentives in health
insurance has, to date, received comparatively less attention than consumer incentives." To our best
knowledge, no studies have discussed provider's mortal hazard under the top-up design.
                                                                                                      3


  In this paper, we evaluate hospitals' treatment practices from 2007 to 2010
under a top-up design based on information collected from the Taiwan stent
market. We choose this market for three reasons. First, it has implemented the
top-up design since October 2006. There are two major vascular stent types in
our observation period:4 bare metal stent (BMS) is the baseline, while drug-
eluting stent (DES) adds a drug layer over the metal to further slow down the
reclogging of blood vessels. Both stent types are applicable for most patients, but
DES is more expensive than BMS, leading to the debate of DES cost-effectiveness
(Bagust, 2006).5 Under the top-up design, patients are fully covered for BMS,
but they need to pay the incremental cost for any DES use, and such costs are
administered independently by each hospital.6

  Second, vascular stent is the fastest growing and highest paid medical device
with a top-up pricing in Taiwan. The number of stents implanted has increased
by 56.6% in 6 years, from 20,243 in 2007 to 36,834 in 2010 and 49,501 in 2014. In
addition, total PTCA payment, including National Health Insurance (NHI here-
after) reimbursement for stents, NHI reimbursement for PTCA surgeries (which is
necessary for stent implant), and patients' out-of-pocket payment for stents, was
up to 3.5 billion NTD in 2010 and exceeded 5 billion NTD in 2014.7 This total
is close to 1% of the total NHI spending in 2014 (520 billions NTD). The rapid
adoption and massive scale of reimbursement increase make the stent market well
suited to evaluate hospital practices in a top-up reimbursement system.

  Third, our data period (from January 2007 to December 2010) covers one ma-
jor decline of reimbursement rate per stent, which dropped from 27,000 to 19,940

   4 The bio-absorbable stent was introduced and applied after our observation period, and it is not
considered in this paper.
   5 Bagust (2006) assesses the cost effectiveness of DES compared with BMS for treatment of symp-
tomatic coronary artery disease in the UK. They conclude that DES are not cost effective except for a
small minority of patients, unless the price of DES falls substantially.
   6 On average, a DES costs the patients about 60,000 NTD. (1 USD = 31 NTD) approximately
   7 For the number of BMS and DES used between 2007 and 2014, see the report of top-up design medical
devices by National Insurance Agency (https://www.mohw.gov.tw/dl-15125-501102ca-d9d2-45d2-a1d6-
01d802c0ded3.html). In addition to the expenditure for vascular stents, the NHI reimbursement for
percutaneous coronary dilatation (the surgery that help installing vascular stents) is NTD 44k, 60k, and
76k for one, two, and three vessels respectively.

NTD (-26%) in January 2009.8 Hospitals anticipate the timing but not the ex-
act scale before the adjustment, so we treat the rate cut as exogenous. This
rate cut reduces hospital's revenue from each stent unit implanted, which could
trigger hospitals to adjust DES pricing and stent usage for revenue recovery, or
induce hospitals to further lower the costs of delivering related medical services
(Yip, 1998; Gruber and Owings,1996). By estimating hospitals' responses to this
rate cut, we can have a better sense of how hospitals manage various margins
simultaneously.
    Our data is constructed by combining three components from Taiwan NHI.
We first collect patient-admission-level claim records that consist of every patient
who has undergone the percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA)
between 2007 and 2010 in Taiwan. For each patient in the record, we observe
his demographics and treatment procedures, including any medical device used:
for each stent implanted, we observe its brand, manufacturer, quantity used in
each surgery admission. We further supplement this medical record data with
patient-paid price data for DES models from hospitals' periodic public reports,
which is required by NHI regulations. We construct the hospital-model level price
spectrum by assuming invariant prices between consecutive reports from the same
hospital and stent model combination. In our sample, we observe 129,251 patients
receiving PTCA surgery, of which around two thirds (79,054) used at least one
stent, and among those stent patients, 39.6% of the surgeries used at least one
DES, and 64.0% used BMS.9
    We utilize the 2009 reimbursement reduction shock to identify hospitals' ad-
justment incentives. To accommodate hospitals' heterogeneous and non-instant
responses, we follow Finkelstein (2007) and use the ratio of stent patients over
PTCA patients in each hospital in 2008 (Ratio08) as a proxy to hospitals' sen-
   8 Another price adjustment further lowered the payment from 19940 to 16293 NTD in Jan 2012. This
adjustment looks large in percentage (-18%), but much smaller in the absolute size as compared with
the 2009 adjustment (about half). This is beyond our data period, and likely results in a much smaller
impact on the stent revenue for hospitals.
   9 These two percentages are not exclusive because around 3% of patients use both DES and BMS in
their surgeries.
                                                                                    5


sitivity to the rate cut. Our intuition is that hospitals with more stent patients
are subject to larger revenue losses from the rate cut, and therefore have stronger
incentives to recoup the revenue loss. We correlate each hospital's Ratio08 with
two potential margins of adjustment: the average number of stents used per stent
patient, and the patient-paid price for each DES model.

  Our analysis yields several key findings. First, hospitals increased their patient-
level stent usage significantly, mostly on BMS, after the 2009 rate cut. On average,
a hospital with the average stent ratio (65%) in 2008 increased its BMS use by
0.14 (18%) per stent patient admission. By contrast, DES usage did not see any
significant increase. One explanation is that only BMS are fully reimbursed by
the NHI and do not require patients' out-of-pocket payment. This suggests that,
despite the overuse after the rate cut, the top-up design attenuates the rising
medical spending by encouraging patients to choose the baseline treatment.

  Second, the increased use of BMS is concentrated in minor teaching hospitals,
rather than major teaching hospitals. One potential explanation is that more and
more patients choose major teaching hospitals over time. This trend occurred
before the rate cut, but because of the trend, minor teaching hospitals have less
flexibility to counter the revenue loss after the rate cut.

  Third, one mechanism to increase BMS use is to conduct PTCA surgery on
a larger number of blood vessels, which generates extra NHI reimbursement for
the PTCA procedure in addition to NHI payment for stents. This effect is con-
centrated in minor teaching hospitals, in the form of an increased likelihood of
2-vessel PTCA treatment (as compared to 1-vessel) on patients with acute and
urgent heart conditions.

  Fourth, hospitals do not significantly adjust the price of DES to compensate for
the rate cut, once we control for stent model fixed effect. It is hard to tell whether
the rate cut has caused hospitals to adjust new model adoption, but hospitals are
reluctant to hike the DES price within the same stent model, probably because
the NHI requires public reporting of DES price and all the price hike must be
6


absorbed by patient payment.
    Finally, although hospitals do not increase the price of DES and restrict the
increased stent usage to BMS, our estimates still suggest a sizable response to the
rate cut ­ the increased BMS use helps hospitals to recoup up to 30% of revenue
loss in 2009-2010. Given that hospital revenue per stent is four times higher in
DES than in BMS, our results suggest that hospitals would recoup an even larger
share of revenue loss if a "full coverage" insurer implements a rate cut and both
DES and BMS are covered in the insurance.
    Our study contributes to two literatures. The first is the empirical literature
that examines providers' responses to financial incentives (See McGuire (2000) for
a review). Numerous studies have exploited reimbursement variations to identify
the impact of rate change on health care utilization (Yip, 1998; Gruber and
Owings,1996; Dafny, 2005; Ho and Pakes, 2014; Clemens and Gottlieb, 2014;
Xiang, 2019) and the coding of diagnosis related groups (Silverman and Skinner
2004; Geruso and Layton 2019). One direct study on stent price is Deo et al.
(2020), which shows that private hospitals increase the use of PTCA procedures
after India put price caps on cardiac stent in 2017 (both BMS and DES). Not
only do we provide another example in this regard, we also explore how hospitals
might adjust the price and quantity of medical device to recover revenue loss due
to the insurer's rate cut.10
    More importantly, we contribute to a second strand of literature that discusses
the welfare implications of a top-up design. Chernew, Encinosa and Hirth (2000)
and Einav, Finkelstein and Williams (2016) explore the optimal insurance cover-
age of a top-up design for different treatments of a given disease, and quantita-
tively calibrate the social welfare under different insurance designs. Based on a
simple model of health demand, Shepard, Baicker, and Skinner (2019) investigate
the impact of various insurance designs on income inequality, medical technology
   10 Einav, Finkelstein and Williams (2016) evaluates the top-up design in breast cancer treatment in
California. Nonetheless, they use the distance between patients' residence and the nearest treatment
facility as a proxy for treatment price, since they are unable to obtain the actual price paid by the
patient.

growth, and distortionary taxes. These studies highlight the advantage of the
top-up design, but ignore the possibility that health providers may have differ-
ent incentives to adjust under a top-up design. To fill this gap, we provide the
empirical evidence of hospital moral hazard under a specific top-up design.
  The rest of this paper is arranged as follows. Section 2 describes the industry
background of vascular stents and the health system in Taiwan. Section 3 de-
scribes our data and sample. Section 4 presents the estimation model and the
estimated results. We conclude in Section 5.


                            II.   Industry Background


                                  A.   Cardiac Stent


  When patients suffer from coronary atherosclerosis, the artery loses its origi-
nal elasticity and starts to clot, causing hypoxia in the heart. Left untreated,
the stenosis will be completely blocked, resulting in life-threatening myocardial
infarction or cardiac arrest. The treatment of coronary heart disease ranges from
a simple drug therapy, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA),
to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in the worst case. Bypass surgery
improves the obstruction site by re-implanting the patient's own blood vessels,
but the risk is relatively high. In contrast, cardiac catheterization is less invasive,
more responsive, and involves a shorter hospital stay. Thus, since the first suc-
cessful coronary artery angioplasty in 1977, PTCA has gradually replaced CABG
in treatment priority (Cutler and Huckman, 2003).
  Cardiac catheter therapy was originally a simple balloon dilation, with a suc-
cess rate of around 80%. Nonetheless, the chance of restenosis due to retraction
and tissue hyperplasia is as high as 30-50%. A coronary stent can be implanted
to support the stenotic coronary artery, reducing the rate of restenosis to 10-20%
(Dihu, 2011). The earliest model of stents is BMS that is typically made of stain-
less steel or cobalt-chromium alloy. Stent implantation can damage endothelial
8


cells of blood vessels, DES is invented to slowly release a drug that can inhibit
cell proliferation. Though long-term results are not yet available, it is reported
that DES, compared with BMS, lowers the rate of restenosis by up to 5 to 10%
in five years (Morice et al, 2007; Dangas, et al, 2010; Dihu, 2011). As a result,
there has been a steady increase of DES use over time.11 In Taiwan, the use of
DES reached almost 50% since 2012.12 At present, the global stent market has a
production value up to 6 billion US dollars.

                                   B.    Taiwan Top-Up Design


    Taiwan implemented NHI in 1995 with two primary goals: to provide equal ac-
cess to healthcare for all citizens and to control total health spending at a reason-
able level (Council of Economic Planning and Development, 1990). To achieve the
goal of equal access, the NHI provides a comprehensive benefit package, ranging
from conventional outpatient and inpatient services, preventive medicine, pre-
scription drugs, dental services, as well as Chinese medicine. In addition, the
NHI charges a very modest cost sharing: $5 for clinic visit, $8-$15 for hospital
visit, and 10% coinsurance rate for inpatient care (capped at 10% of the average
national income per person).13
    The NHI takes two measures to control the expenditures of medical devices.
Since 2006, a top-up design is employed to cover 11 categories of expensive med-
ical devices (stent implantation is fully covered and not included in these 11
categories). For cardiac stents, the NHI reimburses hospitals the payments of
BMS, and patients pay for the incremental costs to employ DES. To prevent hos-
pitals from charging excessive prices from patients, each hospital is required to

publicly report their charged prices for DES. On average, the additional charge
for a DES is approximately 60,000 NTD ($1=31NTD). Despite the notable price
difference, there is still a growing popularity of DES over time: the fraction of
stent patients using DES has increased from 37% in 2007 to 58% in 2016.

  In addition, the NHI sets up a payment scheme in which reimbursement for
medical devices is based on average input cost plus a fixed markup (usually 20%).
In Taiwan, each hospital can negotiate the input price of medical devices with
medical suppliers. To incentivize hospitals, the NHI allows hospitals to reserve the
markup between reimbursed payment and the input cost. In return, each hospital
has to submit their input costs and the NHI uses the submitted costs to calculate
the reimbursed payment of medical devices in the next two or three years. Notice
that the payment is based on the average input costs of "all" hospitals, not a
specific one. Therefore, the average is unlikely to be influenced by the pricing
decision of an individual hospital. In the case of cardiac stents, the NHI sets up
the reimbursement rate based on the average costs of BMS.

  Table 1 lists the reimbursed rate for cardiac stents between 2007 and 2012.
Notice that NHI payment is much lower than the price of DES because NHI's
stent payment is based on the input prices of BMS only in the top-up pricing. The
NHI lowers the payment almost every three years. While those price adjustments
are regular and can be expected, no hospital knows the exact size of payment
reduction because it is calculated according to the input costs of bare-metal stents
at all hospitals in Taiwan. Thus, we assume price adjustments are exogenous to
individual hospitals. We later test this assumption in the analysis.
10


     From 2006 to 2013, we observe two rate cuts by the NHI: a 26% reduction from
27,000 to 19,940 NTD in Jan 2009, and an 18% reduction from 19,940 to 16,293
NTD in Jan 2012. In absolute amount, the second rate cut is only half the size
of the first one (3,647 v.s. 7,060). Our data extends from 2007 to 2010, which
covers the first rate cut.


                                          III.    Data and Sample


                                            A.    Data Description


     Our data are constructed from two components. First, we collect hospital claim
records of all PTCA patients from the NHI between 2007 and 2010. These medi-
cal claims contain detailed information of inpatient admissions, including patient
demographics (gender, date of birth), hospital characteristics (bed size, teach-
ing status, and profit status), diagnoses, performed surgeries, installed medical
devices (e.g. stents), as well as the reimbursements NHI paid to hospitals. We
also observe unique identifiers for the doctor and the hospital in each inpatient
admission record. Based on these medical records, we first construct our main
data sample with all patients receiving at least one PTCA surgery from 2007 to
2010. For each patient using at least one stent, we obtain the information about
all stents used, including their manufacturers, stent model ID, stent model type
(bare metal model or drug eluting stent model). If a patient uses more than three
stent models, we observe her three most used models.14
     The medical claim data provides abundant details on patient-level treatment
records. Nonetheless, one key missing information is the "actual" price patient
paid for DES. Given that NHI record only includes the reimbursed amount, we
use a second data source to supplement the price difference patients paid for
DES. As indicated earlier, the NHI requires all hospitals to disclose patients' out-
of-pocket expenses charged for DES and publishes this information periodically.

     14 Of   all stent surgeries, only 1.23% use 3 or more stent models so this truncation has limited effect.
                                                                                11


Based on NHI publications, we infer the patient-paid price for each DES model
at each hospital in each month. For example, if we observe that hospital A
announced model X's price as 60,000 in Jan 2010 and 70,000 in Sep 2010, we
assume A's price for model X is 60,000 any time between Jan 2010 and Sep
2010. We then match the inferred price with the models of stents installed at
each hospital admission, which achieves a 90% matching rate. With the two data
sources combined, we construct a comprehensive patient-level stent usage data
linking patients, hospitals, as well as the prices paid for both BMS and DES.


                             B.   Summary Statistics


  We refer to two samples in data analysis: the "PTCA patients" sample in-
cludes all PTCA patients admitted to hospitals that have conducted at least one
stent surgery in the sample period, excluding those admitted in hospitals that
never perform any stent surgery. This sample includes every PTCA patient that
could receive a stent surgery, no matter whether he eventually underwent a stent
surgery. In contrast, the "stent patients" sample focuses on the subset of the
PTCA patients that have received any stent treatment during the sample period.
We use the PTCA patient sample to construct the stent ratio for every hospital,
and the stent patient sample to examine the impact of the rate cut.
  To better understand the number of PTCA and stent patients over time, Figure
1 plots the monthly count of PTCA and stent patients from 2007 to 2010. Both
populations grow steadily over time, reflecting the growing popularity of PTCA
and stent treatments. Both counts fall at the beginning of each year due to lunar
Chinese New Year (which is usually in February or late January). Figure 2 plots
the monthly ratio of stent patients among PTCA patients. This figure does not
suggest any significant change around January 2009 when the NHI started to
reduce its reimbursement for cardiac stents. It is rather difficult to convert a
PTCA patient into a stent patient simply because of the NHI rate cut, as all
cardiac doctors we talked to confirm that they need to justify stent use based on

Note: The PTCA sample is constructed from NHI inpatient files, including all patients admitted for
PTCA between 2007 and 2010. Major and minor teaching hospitals are defined by hospital accreditations
conducted every three years.




for patients, the percentage of DES patients fluctuates between 20% and 25% in
2007 and 2008, then gradually approaches 30% in 2010.
  Table 2 lists the number of PTCA patients in our analytic sample. In total,
there are 129,251 PTCA patients between 2007 and 2010, of which approximately
60% received at least one cardiac stent during the admission. As shown in Table
2, the ratio of stent patients ­ defined as the count of stent patients divided by
the count of PTCA patients in each year­ has increased over time from 56.3% in
2007 to 68.6% in 2010. Likewise, percentage of DES patients among all PTCA
patients increases from 19.4% in 2007 to 28.5% in 2010; and percentage of DES
patients within stent patients increases from 34.4% in 2007 to 41.6% in 2010.
  Table 2 also displays the percentage of stent patients and DES patients by the
teaching status of the admitting hospitals. In Taiwan, only major and minor
teaching hospitals are capable of PTCA surgeries and cardiac stent implanta-
tion.15 On average, a major teaching hospital, as compared to a minor teaching
hospital, recruits approximately twice more PTCA patients and three times more
stent patients. Patients who receive PTCA surgeries in a major teaching hospital

  15 In Taiwan, major teaching hospitals are mostly medical centers with more than 600 beds. By
contrast, a typical minor teaching hospital has a smaller bed size, roughly between 300 and 600.
14


have more complicated health conditions (e.g. involving more cardiac vessels),
and therefore are more likely to install stents; the probability of DES use is also
higher for patients admitted by major teaching hospitals. Among stent patients, a
little more than 40% have DES implants, of which 59.5% are conducted at major
teaching hospitals in 2010.

     Table 3 summarizes the characteristics of stent patients by the type of admitting
hospitals. A little less than 60% of stent patients were admitted to major teaching
hospitals at the beginning, and then steadily declines to 54.6% in 2010. More
than 60% of hospitals are non-profit hospitals and less than 8% of patients are
admitted to for-profits hospitals. About 75% of stent patients are males. In
terms of diseases, more than 60% were admitted for minor cardiac problems
(ischemic heart disease, IHD), 30% for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and
less than 2% suffer from congestive heart failures (CHF). Although patient age
slightly increases over years, the Charlson Comorbidity Index remains unchanged.
Moreover, there is no increase in the percentage of patients admitted for more
than three cardiac vessels.

     Table 3 also shows the average use of BMS and DES for stent patients. The
average number of cardiac stents per stent patient was close to 1.33 in 2007 and
2008, jumped to 1.42 in 2009, and remained 1.41 in 2010. By comparison, the
average number of DES per stent patient rises steadily from 0.45 in 2007 to 0.56
in 2010.

     Figure 3 plots the average number of stents used per stent patient admission.
It is striking that the average stent quantity jumped from 1.32 to 1.4 right after
the NHI rate cut in January 2009.

     Figure 4 further displays the jump of stent number before and after the rate cut,
separated by different stent types. As shown in the Figure 4, the jump in stent
usage is mainly due to the increase in BMS, which jumped from 1.3 per patient
before 2009 to 1.38 after 2009. By comparison, the number of DES used per
DES-patient increases more modestly from 1.3 to 1.35. One possible explanation

easier to increase BMS use than DES use.
  So far we have shown that the number of stents jumps after the rate cut. It
is unclear, however, whether the jump is associated with the hospital's response.
To illustrate if hospitals do respond to the 2009 rate cut, Figure 5 displays the
average number of stents by three hospital groups: the top group has Ratio08
above the 66th percentile of all hospitals,where Ratio08 is defined as percent of
stent patients in the hospital as of 2008. The medium group has Ratio08 between
the 33rd and 66th percentiles, and the low group has Ratio08 below the 33rd
percentile. From the figure, it is clear that the size of the jump in average stents
is the largest for patients admitted to the top group, from 1.4 in the third quarter
of 2008 to 1.54 in the first quarter of 2009 and continues to stay above that level
for almost two years. By comparisons, the difference is much smaller for hospitals
in the medium and low groups. It appears that the response is larger for hospitals
that expect a larger amount of revenue loss from the rate cut.
  It is also possible that hospitals may adjust DES price as well after the rate
cut in 2009 to increase its revenue, but the higher price born by patients may

discourage patient adoption of DES. Therefore, it is unclear in theory how this
margin will be adjusted by hospitals. From the data, we see that the average
price of DES rises from 52,568 NTD in 2007, to 57,448 NTD in 2008, and peaked
at 61,567 in 2009. While this price increase is significant in scale, we find no evi-
dence in the correlation between actual price adjustment and hospitals' potential
revenue loss, with more details discussed in the next section.



                                              IV.     Empirical Specification and Results




     We assume that hospitals' revenue from PTCA surgeries are separately admin-
istered from other departments. Therefore, when faced with the rate cut in 2009,
each hospital can only adjust the margin related to PTCA patients to recoup the
revenue loss. Our analysis focuses on how the rate cut affects two margins: (i)
the number of BMS and DES used per stent patient, and (ii) the price of DES
charged for patients.
                                                                                                    19


                                   A.   Empirical Specification


  The NHI's rate cut in 2009 applies to stent reimbursement in all hospitals.
We cannot adopt the difference-in-difference (DID) analysis because it is difficult
to find a control group that is completely immune from the policy. Regression
discontinuity (RD) is a second possibility, but it assumes that all hospitals react
instantly to the rate cut, which seems unrealistic given that PTCA surgeries are
selective and could be scheduled weeks ahead of time.
  Following Finkelstein (2007), we assume that a hospital with a higher ratio of
stent patients before 2009 was more adversely affected by the 2009 rate cut. This
assumption is reasonable, because the 2009 rate cut only applies to cardiac stents,
not to the PTCA procedure itself. Hospitals that earn most revenue from the
PTCA procedure are less affected than hospitals that count on stents for revenue.
To capture this feature, we construct the ratio of stent patients at hospital j in
year 2008 (Ratio08j ), as a proxy for the extent of the policy shock. The empirical
specification is:


(1)             yijt = 0 + Ratio08j × Af t09t + Xi  + j + t + ijt .


where yijt denotes the outcome measure of patient i admitted to hospital j at time
t. The variable Af t09t is the dummy which equals one for observations in 2009
and 2010, and 0 otherwise. Xi denotes patient characteristics including patient
age, sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index, as well as the type of diseases at admission
(AMI, IHD, CHF). j captures unobserved hospital-specific characteristics, which
can be accounted for by area fixed effects or hospital fixed effects. t captures
the year fixed effects.16 Finally, ijt is the idiosyncratic error.
  The key parameter of interest  indicates how hospitals with a higher Ratio08
respond to the NHI rate cut. In the stent market, a hospital's stent revenue can

estimates are robust to these alternative time effect choices.

be decomposed as follows:

                                                                    Rj        d d
                                                                       = Pjd qj Nj


where Rb , Rd are hospital revenue from BMS and DES usage respectively; P b , P d
are the average price that hospitals earn for each BMS or DES (including NHI
reimbursement and patient's out-of-pocket payment); q b , q d are the quantities of
stents used, and N b , N d are the numbers of patients that receive implant of the
corresponding stent type. While in theory a health provider can adjust all three
margins, in practice it is less plausible for hospitals to influence the number of
stent patients, given that installing stents requires proper indications.17 We thus
focus on the other two components as the outcome variables (yijt ):

       · Margin 1: patient-level stent usage, namely, q b , q d . The hospital may in-
          crease the number of stents used in each patient to increase the total revenue.

       · Margin 2: price of DES (Pjd ). Note that price includes both government
          reimbursement (for BMS and DES models), and patients' payment (for DES
          model only). When the reimbursement rate decreases, hospitals' revenue
          from a BMS decreases, but it is possible for health providers to increase the
          DES price to counter the impact from the rate cut.

     Given that the number of BMS and DES are non-negative integers, we estimate
the first margin using the Poisson regression and the second margin using the OLS
regression. Standard errors are clustered at the hospital level to account for the
serial correlation among admissions at the same hospital.

                                           B.   Estimation results


     The first margin examines whether hospitals adjust the number of stents used
by each stent patient. Table 4 reports the estimation result based on various
     17 This   observation is confirmed by our conversation with numerous cardiac doctors.

measures of stent use per stent patient. For the ease of expressions, all the coeffi-
cients of Poisson regressions (e.g. number of stents) are displayed with marginal
effects. The first two columns report estimated  for the number of total DES
and BMS, respectively, controlling for area fixed effects, patient demographics,
diagnosis of admission (AMI, IHD, and CHF), as well as the Charlson index to
capture patient's severity. The third and fourth columns replace area fixed effects
with hospital fixed effects. These columns highlight the importance of hospital
fixed effects: when we control for hospital fixed effects, the coefficient  for the
number of DES per stent patient drops from 0.16 in the first column to -0.05 in
the third column (both insignificant); while  for the number of BMS per stent
patient drops from 0.47 to 0.21 (both significant).

  Our results indicate that, in light of the rate cut, BMS use is more responsive
to the rate cut than DES use. This is consistent with the belief that the top-up
22


design could contain moral hazard by persuading patients towards more "free"
BMS rather than paying for expensive DES. According to our estimates, the
average marginal effect from Poisson estimation (0.21) of a hospital with the
average stent ratio (0.65 percentage points in Ratio08j ) will increase BMS use by
approximately 0.14 (=0.21*0.65).
     In the second and third panels of Table 4, we separate the sample into major
and minor teaching hospitals. Results suggest that the positive effect of the rate
cut on the number of BMS per stent patient, is concentrated in minor teaching
hospitals. On average, a minor teaching hospital with the average stent ratio
(65 percentage points in 2008) will increase its BMS use per stent patient by
0.19 (0.29*0.65). By contrast, major hospitals do not demonstrate a significant
increase in its stent use or BMS use once we control for hospital fixed effects.
Within minor teaching hospitals, the increased use of BMS is driven by both the
extensive margin (percent of BMS patients) and the intensive margin (average
number of BMS conditional on BMS patients), though only the latter is significant
at 5%.18
     So far, our specification assumes that the stent ratio posits a linear impact on
the stent use. To accommodate the possibility that the impact of stent ratio is
non-linear, we categorize the stent ratio of 2008 into tercile groups (high, medium
and low), and re-estimate equation (1) by replacing Ratio08j with dummies of
tercile groups. The three panels of Table A1 (in the appendix) presents the
estimated marginal effects of the interactions between high and medium group
dummy (Ratio08H and Ratio08M ) and the post-2009 dummy based on the full
sample, the major teaching hospital sample, and the minor teaching hospital
sample respectively. The bottom group (with the lowest third of Ratio08) is
served as the baseline. Comparing results of Table A1 and Table 4, it is clear
that results from tercile group dummies yield similar findings ­ the rate cut results

  18 Because the effect of the rate cut on stent use is concentrated on minor teaching hospitals, the full
sample is too noisy to identify a significant effect on either the percent of BMS patients or the average
number of BMS conditional on BMS patients (Columns 5 and 6 of Table 4 Panel A).

in a larger impact on BMS than DES use. In addition, its impact concentrates
on minor teaching hospitals rather than major teaching hospitals. Nonetheless,
results of tercile groups suggest that the impact of rate cut on stent use is non-
linear--the impact is much larger for patients admitted to top ratio group than
those in medium ratio group.19
  Another way to recover from the revenue loss due to the rate cut is to increase
the price charged for DES (Margin 2). However, this strategy entails a tradeoff:
raising DES price (for patient payment) will discourage patients from adopting
DES. To understand how hospitals deal with this tradeoff, we regress the average
price of DES charged for each stent patient on Ratio08j and its interactions with
the post-2009 dummy and present results of Margin 2 in Table 5. Since one patient
may use different brands and different models of DES in a hospital admission, we
use the stent as the unit in the estimation of Margin 2.
  The first three columns of Table 5 present the estimated  for the full sam-
ple, the sample of major teaching hospitals, and the sample of minor teaching
hospitals, all controlling for hospital fixed effects. Roughly 10% of DES models
cannot be matched with the price constructed from hospital reports to the NHI,
  19 Another explanation is that the bottom group served as the baseline group which cancels out some
impact of rate cut. As a result, the impact of the NHI rate cut appears only in patients admitted to
minor teaching hospitals with high stent ratio.

and thus the observation number is lower than the total number of DES stents in
the sample (see Appendix for details). While there seems to be no change on the
average price of DES in the full sample,  is estimated to be negative (-0.46) in
the sample of major teaching hospitals and positive (0.43) in the sample of mi-
nor teaching hospitals, suggesting rather different pricing strategies between the
two types of hospitals. However, all three estimates become insignificant once we
control for stent-model fixed effects. Therefore, the different price reaction to the
rate cut between major and minor teaching hospitals is probably confounded by
their adoption of different stent models. In other words, hospitals do not raise the
price of DES within the existing DES models. Rather, major and minor teaching
hospitals may follow different strategies in new model adoption.

     Again, we present the estimated coefficients of top and medium group and
its interactions with the post-2009 dummy on the DES price for three different
samples in the second panel of Table 5. Similar to the above, major and minor
teaching hospitals have different pricing strategies, but when we control for model
fixed effects, the coefficients either lose statistical significance or become negative.

     To further understand new DES model adoption, we look at each hospital's
aggregate DES stent usage in 2009-2010, and calculate what fraction of this ag-
gregate is on new DES models that the hospital adopted on or after 2009.20 We
then regress this fraction on the hospital's Ratio08. As shown in Table 8, a hos-
pital of higher Ratio08 is less likely to apply new DES models on stent patients,
and this result is solely driven by minor teaching hospitals. Because this is a
hospital-level regression with minimal controls, it is hard to tell whether this ef-
fect reflects a causal effect of the rate cut or other reasons that drive major and
minor teaching hospitals to differ in DES model adoption. It is more plausible
that hospitals are reluctant to raise price within a DES model because the NHI
requires public posting of DES price and all price hike on DES must be absorbed

  20 Note that a hospital may adopt a DES model in 2009, even if that model has been available for
adoption in 2008. We still count this case as the hospital's new DES adoption in 2009.

by patient payment. The salience of DES price change could make price hike a
publicity crisis for any hospital.

  While the rate cut may or may not drive the difference in new DES model
adoption, our earlier estimates do suggest that minor teaching hospitals respond
to the rate cut by installing more BMS per patient but major teaching hospitals
do not do so. One possible explanation is that major teaching hospitals are more
capable of attracting new patients, and therefore less financially pressured by
the rate cut. To explore this, Figure 7 presents the average number of PTCA
patients per hospital over time, separated by major and minor teaching hospitals.
The slope of major teaching hospitals is steeper than that of minor teaching
hospitals, indicating that the patient share of major teaching hospitals continues
to expand. A large base of stent patients might enhance the bargaining power
for major teaching hospitals when negotiating input prices and newer models
with stent manufacturers. By contrast, minor teaching hospitals have difficulty
growing new patients, and hence have a greater incentive to exploit patients by
inducing more stents per patient.

                                         C.    Robustness checks


     One potential concern of using Ratio08j as a proxy for treatment intensity is
that it might be correlated with other unobserved hospital-specific factors. To
rule out this possibility, we conduct a placebo test using the pre-2009 sample.
Focusing on 2007 and 2008, we include the interaction between a hospital's stent
patient ratio in 2007 (Ratio07j ) and a post-2008 dummy in all regressions. Table
6 presents the placebo test results for the sample of all hospitals, major teaching
hospitals, and minor teaching hospitals, respectively. The interaction of Ratio07j
and the post-2008 dummy is statistically zero for the first and second margins,
suggesting that the previously identified effects on the number of stents used per
stent patient and the price of DES are likely driven by the 2009 rate cut.
                                                                                                       27


  Another way to justify the use of Ratio08j is checking whether the tercile groups
of hospitals (in low, medium, and high Ratio08) follow similar time trends in key
outcome variables before the treatment time (January 2009). We perform the
pre-treatment trend test by quarter, using the bottom group as the baseline. For
both the medium and high groups, we are able to pass the pre-treatment tests for
the number of BMS per stent patient and whether a stent patient uses any BMS.21
This suggests that our main results on the moral hazard response (in BMS use
per stent patient) are likely attributable to the 2009 rate cut. In comparison, our
pretreatment trend test fails for the price of DES, which reinforces the conclusion
that we cannot relate the 2009 rate cut to discernible changes in DES price.

  In another robustness check, we examine if our results vary by different sampling
frames. In the first alternative sample, we exclude the third and fourth quarters
of 2008; this could reduce the possible endogeneity in case hospitals anticipated
the NHI rate cut before its formal implementation in January 2009. Next, the
NHI also relaxed some restrictions of stent implant in 2009, and the most notable
change is that NHI increased the maximum allowable number of stents per patient
from 2 to 3 within a year.22 To gauge if our results are affected by this policy
change, we top-code the number of stents per patient as two after 2009, and rerun
the regressions, which is our second alternative sample. In the third alternative
sample, we drop hospitals with fewer than 50 stent admissions in a year, in case
small hospitals with infrequent stent use are different from other hospitals.

  Recall that for Margin 1 (number of stents used per stent patient) we only
observe a significant effect of the rate cut for minor teaching hospitals. To save
space, we show only the robustness results for minor teaching hospitals in Table
7. In all three alternative samples, we continue to find a positive effect of the
rate cut on the number of BMS used per stent patient. The effect has a similar

   21 The p-value for the joint test of the medium group being similar to the bottom group is 0.11 for the
number of BMS per stent patient and 0.65 for whether a stent patient uses any BMS. The corresponding
p-values between the high group and low group are 0.33 and 0.88.
   22 There are some exceptions (urgent cases) for the maximum number of stents to be implanted, such
as the inner membrane peeling length is greater than 50 mm.

number of stents installed in a hospital admission after 2009 to two. Nonetheless,
the marginal effect of BMS of the second row still has 66% of the size of the full
sample of minor teaching hospitals, indicating the presence of inducement even
accounting for the relaxed maximum number of stents installed by NHI in 2009.
In all specifications, Margin 2 ­ the price of DES ­ is not responsive to the rate
cut once we control for hospital and model fixed effects when we exclude hospitals

               V.    Mechanism and Implication of Hospital Response


                              A.    Mechanism of hospital response


  Though we observe a surge of BMS use after the rate cut, it remains unclear
how the surge is achieved. In our context, stents are implanted during a PTCA
surgery, thus one can increase a patient's stent use by performing PTCA on more
blood vessels, or applying more stents to each vessel treated in the PTCA. A
distinction between the two may help us understand the underlying mechanism
of stent use and shed light on the potential over-use of PTCA surgery. On the one
hand, the marginal benefit of implanting more stents on the same blood vessel is
probably lower than that of implanting a stent in a different vessel. On the other
hand, PTCA surgery is reimbursed by the number of treated vessels (separately
from stent reimbursement). It is possible that some of the PTCA treatment could
be unnecessary if it is only added to justify unnecessary stent use.
  To illustrate the distinction between the number of stents and the number of
vessels, Figure 8 presents the average number of stents used per stent patients,
separately by their number of treated vessels. Notice that the average number of
stents is lower than the number of treated vessels, as some vessels receive PTCA
treatment without implanting stents. From the figure, it is clear that the increase
is small for patients with one vessel, moderate for 2 vessels patients, and the
largest for patients with three vessels or above. This suggests that some of the
increase in stent use following the NHI rate cut may be driven by an increase
in stents per vessel, especially for those that received PTCA treatment for more

than one vessel.
     Turning to potential change in the number of treated vessels, we now focus on
stent patients and examine the relationship between the number of vessels treated
in a PTCA surgery and the stent ratio interaction term (Ratio08j × Af t09t ). By
definition, a stent patient must have at least one vessel treated by PTCA. Hence,
we construct two dependent variables on vessel volume ­ a dummy of whether a
stent patient has PTCA on two or more (2+) vessels, and a dummy of whether
a stent patient has PTCA on three or more (3+). We then regress them on
Ratio08j × Af t09t respectively, according to equation (1).
     The regression results are presented in the first two columns of Table 9. It is
clear that, controlling for patient characteristics, year fixed effects and hospital
fixed effects, a stent patient is more likely to report 2+ PTCA vessels after the
rate cut. Consistent with our previous findings, such an increase appears mostly
in minor teaching hospitals, rather than major teaching hospitals. However, we
could not find any significant result when we use the dummy of 3+ vessels as the
dependent variable. This suggests that the increase of PTCA vessels is driven by
                                                                                                  31

the change from one to two vessels, not from two to 3+ vessels. In other words,
most increase in PTCA vessels come from the marginal patients that would have
PTCA (and stent implant) on only one vessel before the rate cut.
  In the third and fourth columns of Table 9, we present the relationship between
the average number of stents per vessel, and the stent ratio interaction term
(Ratio08j × Af t09t ). Controlling for all other factors, we observe the coefficient
of the interaction term is not different from zero among major teaching hospitals
but there is a positive effect among minor teaching hospitals. In short, the rate
cut results in both an increased likelihood of 2-vessel PTCA treatment and an
increase of BMS stents per vessel.
  To what extent can we attribute the additional stent use to the increase of
vessels treated in PTCA surgery? Based on our estimates, only minor teaching
hospitals demonstrate this response and the effect corresponds to a 7.5 percent
point increase in a stent patient reporting 2+ vessel treatment. Therefore, on
32


average, a minor teaching hospital with the average stent ratio (65%) would
observe a 4.88% (=0.075*0.65) increase for patients reporting 2+ PTCA vessels.23
Given that 45% of hospitals are minor teaching hospitals, and 2-vessel patients on
average use 0.28 more BMS than one-vessel patients,24 an increase in reporting
2+ vessels adds about 9% of the total induced BMS (1568) in 2009.

     Who, among the stent patients, are more likely to experience an increase in the
   23 Notice that the percentage of 2+ vessels patients is approximately 28.3% in 2008, this corresponds
to a 2.2 increase in absolute percentage points (from 28.3% to 30.5%) or a 7.7% jump in the relative
term.
   24 Our results suggest the effect is significant for patients reporting from 1 vessel to 2 vessels, not from
2 to 3 vessels, since the coefficient of vessel (3+) is insignificant (column (2)). Therefore, we compare
the stent number between patients reporting 2 vessels with 1 vessel.
                                                                                 33


number of PTCA vessels post the rate cut? To answer this question, in addition
to having Ratio08j × Af t09t on the right hand, we further interact it with patient
characteristics (e.g. age, sex, health condition), and present the results in Table
10. Each panel represents one regression, while each entry in the second row of
the panel is the coefficient corresponding to the interaction of Ratio08j × Af t09t
and the demographic variable in the column name. Results suggest that the
increase in 2+ vessels does not vary by patient age and sex but is closely related
to the urgency of patient's health. Relative to IHD and CHF, patients diagnosed
with AMI are more likely to have an increase in PTCA vessels, and this effect
is only significant for minor teaching hospitals. It looks like that the rate cut
has motivated minor teaching hospitals to persuade patients to receive PTCA
treatment on more vessels (and therefore install more stents) when they have
acute and urgent heart conditions.


                    B.   Revenue implication of hospital response


  How much does the moral hazard behavior help hospitals recoup the revenue
loss? In 2009, the government reduces the reimbursement rate of cardiac stents
by approximately 7,000 NTD or 26%. Our results show that hospitals increase
the use of BMS, but not that of DES. In addition, no evidence indicates that
hospitals raise the DES price. Therefore, we focus on the induced use of BMS.
  The upper panel of Table 11 shows our estimates based on the full sample
(Scenario I). The rate cut results in an increase of 0.14 BMS per stent patient
(0.21*0.65; marginal effect times the average stent ratio). Given that the total
number of stent admissions in 2009 is 21,801 (Table 3), the number of induced
BMS is 2,976, which is worth of 59.3 million NTD.
  To understand how much stent revenue hospitals actually recoup, we need to
first calculate hospitals' stent usage absent their motivation of boosting their BMS
usage due to the policy. The actual number of BMS in 2009 (19,579) is inflated
because it includes the induced demand, and subtracting the induced demand
34


directly from the actual 2009 BMS number is not correct either. As one can see
from Table 3, despite the jump in 2009, there is a steady decline in BMS per stent
patient over time, since more and more patients opt for DES.
     We take two steps to obtain the counterfactual revenue loss from stent. First, we
obtain the coefficients of 2008 and 2009 year dummies in estimating the stent use
equation (column 4, Table 4) to calculate the counterfactual BMS use per stent
patient. The counterfactual figure equals to the number of BMS per stent patient
in 2008, plus 2009 fixed effect minus 2008 fixed effect, while the difference of two
year coefficients accounts for the change of other outside factors between 2008 and
2009 unrelated to the rate change. Our estimates show that the counterfactual
BMS per patient in 2009 is 0.76 (0.87-0.13+0.02). Multiplying this number by the
number of stent admissions in 2009, the total number of BMS without induced
demand is 16,569.
     In other words, the rate cut induces 18.0% (2,976 out of 16,569) more BMS in
2009. Likewise, the total number of BMS (without inducement) is 16,336 while
the induced BMS is 3,141 or 19.2% in 2010. Once we have the counterfactual
BMS number, we can calculate the revenue loss by adding up the number of BMS
and DES stents times the NHI rate cut. Relative to the revenue loss, providers
are able to recoup 30.5% and 30.6% of revenue loss from induced use of BMS in
2009 and 2010 respectively.25 This estimate is conservative because it does not
include the extra vessel treatment of PTCA in response to the rate cut, which
seems to happen systematically in minor teaching hospitals.




  25 Our estimates show that the counterfactual BMS per patient in 2010 is 0.71 (0.87+0.02 -0.18).
Multiplying this number by the number of stent admissions in 2010 (23008), the total number of BMS
without induced demand is 16336.

     The lower panel of Table 11 shows the estimates that separate the impact by
major and minor teaching hospitals. Recall from Table 4 that the impact of
rate cuts concentrates in minor teaching hospitals: the rate cut results in an
induced use of BMS by 0.19 per patient (0.29*0.65; marginal effect times the
average stent ratio). Multiplying by the number of admission in minor teaching
hospitals, the induced BMS is 1,568, worth of 31.3 million NTD. Additionally,
the rate cut induces 2.2% more patients reporting 2+ vessels in PCTA surgery.
Since the reimbursement gap between two vessels and one vessel is 16k NTD, our
results indicate that minor teaching hospitals can recoup about 12 million from
the PTCA Surgery.26
     Following the same method, we calculate the counterfactual BMS use as 8,345
and the total revenue loss as 207.6 million in 2009. Relative to the revenue loss
due to the NHI rate cut, providers are able to recoup 18.8% of the revenue loss
through induced use of BMS and more vessels treated by PTCA in 2009. Likewise,
in 2010, minor teaching hospitals induced BMS use by 18.1% (1589 out of 8456)
and recouped 20.2% of revenue loss from the induced BMS and PTCA surgery.


                                      VI.    Conclusion


     We examine how hospitals respond to a 2009 rate cut in Taiwan's government
reimbursement for cardiac stent. Because the rate cut is within a top-up design of
government-provided health insurance, it provides a rare opportunity to demon-
strate the key tradeoff between curbing health care spending and hospital moral
hazard. We look at two margins: the number of stents used per stent patient,
and the patient-out-of-pocket price of DES. We only find evidence for hospital
moral hazard in the first margin: hospitals, especially minor teaching hospitals,
increase the number of BMS stents used per stent patient right after the rate cut.
     According to our full sample estimates, on average, we find the rate cut results

   26 The NHI reimbursed rate of PTCA surgery are 44k, 60k and 76k for one, two and three vessels,
respectively, between 2007 and 2010.
                                                                                 37


in an induced use of BMS by 0.14 per stent patient (0.21*0.65; marginal effect
times the average stent ratio). In comparisons with no induced demand estimates,
the induced use results in 18-19% of additional BMS, amounting 59.3 and 62.6
millions NTD more NHI reimbursement in 2009 and 2010 respectively. Given that
NHI rate cut for cardiac stents reduces by 26% in 2009, hospitals' moral hazard
accounts for about 30% of the total stent revenue loss should the hospitals not
engage in such moral hazard. Results on subsamples generate more conservative
estimates, with hospitals recouping approximately 20% of total revenue loss, from
both the increase in BMS use and the increased vessel treatment under PTCA.
Regardless, all these estimates suggest that the 2009 rate cut is still effective in
reducing NHI claims for cardiac stents, although this effect is partly offset by
hospital moral hazard.
  Our study has a number of limitations. First, because the NHI rate cut applies
to all hospitals at once, we do not have a clean control group. Our results hinge
on the assumption that a hospital's ratio of stent patients before the rate cut is
a good proxy for the intensity of the policy treatment for that hospital. Second,
our study focuses on patient level decisions such as whether to use any stent,
how many and which type of stents to use. Our data also contains hospital level
decisions, for example, which stent model to adopt for the whole hospital. But
without information on the negotiation between stent suppliers and hospitals,
it is difficult to examine the timing of model drop, model adoption, and model
upgrades explicitly. This question is worth exploring in future research. Finally,
our empirical setting is universal health insurance of Taiwan, thus our results
may not be generalizable to other countries or to other non-government insurance
programs.

                           Price Matching Procedures


     Because the NHI covers partial payment of DES, hospitals are required to dis-
close the additional payments of DES charged to patients (e.g. on the hospital's
website). In addition, the NHI routinely collects price information of DES stents
at every hospital. In the first two years, the frequency of price collections is every
two months. Later it reduces to every six months given the prices of drug-eluting
stents do not change frequently. To facilitate price comparison across hospitals,
the NHI launched a website in 2012, where every hospitals is asked to report the
prices of DES stents once there are price changes.
     We obtain DES price by stent type and brand directly from the NHI. The data
contains 12,827 price report observations, including 44 DES models from 102
hospitals spanning from Dec, 2006 to Nov, 2013. On average, each hospital has
around 126 price reports, and each hospital-stent model combination has 8 price
reports. To overcome the missing data between adjascent report, we take three
steps to construct the hospital-model-quarter price data. First, we calculate the
average price reported in each quarter (if there is any) for each hospital-model
combination. In total we observe 7,771 such combination, with approximately
40% of duplicated price reports eliminated. Next, we fill in the gaps by assuming
that hospitals do not change their price between their consecutive price reports
for the same stent model. Finally, we observe that some stent usage occurred
even before the first price reporting date. We suspect that hospitals might be
late to submit their price reports. To match these observations, we assume that,
for each stent model, hospitals charge the same price as their first report up to
four quarters before their first reporting date. The price spectrum constructed
this way matches 89.99% of DES usage records in the NHI claim data.
     The matching rate is lower (77%) if we do not impute any price for DES usage
before the hospital's first price report, and higher (94.74%) if we impute all missing
                                                                            41


DES prices before the first report (it is not 100% because some DES models show
up in the claim data but never occur in the price report of the corresponding
hospital). Our results on DES price are not sensitive to how we impute the
missing prices.
