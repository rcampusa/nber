                     MONEY, CREDIT, AND BUSINESS FLUCTUATIONS


                                     ABSTRACT


     This paper provides a critique of standard theories of money, in

particular those based on money as a medium of exchange.      Money is impor-

tant hecause of the relationship between money and credit.      The process of

judging credit worthiness, in which banks play a central role, involves the

collection and processing of information.       Like many other economic activ-

ities involving information, these processes are not well described by means

of standard production functions.    Changes in economic circumstances can have

marked effects on the relevance of previously accumulated information and

accordingly on the supply of credit.    Changes in the availability of credit

may have marked effects on the level of economic activity, while changes in

real interest rates seem to play a relatively minor role in economic fluc-

tuations.

      This alternative view has a number of implications for policy, both at

the macro-economic    level (for instance, on the role of monetary policy for

stabilization purposes and the choice of targets) and at the micro-economic

level -

I. Introduction


        Money   has    long    played    a   central      role   in popular     conceptions    of

economics- -and life          more generally.         "Money makea    the world    go around."

"Money is the root of all evil."                These are but two aphorisms which come to

mind.

        Professional    economists       give    money    an equally    mixed    review.      The

monetarists--whose       enormous popularity of the early 80's seems subsequently

to have waned- -place money          as a central determinant of economic activity.

By   contrast,    when I was        a graduate        student    at MIT,   I was    taught    the

classical dichotomy, in which the money supply did nothing but determine the

price level.      Monetary economics, as          I   was taught it by Paul Samuelaon, was

a seemingly      curious      course, devoted         to explaining    why we should not be

     This paper is part of a larger research project, undertaken jointly
with Bruce Creenwald and Andrew Weiss, attempting to construct a macro-
economic   model baaed   on solid micro-economic foundations, in which
considerations of imperfect information play a central role.      This work,
sometimes referred to as New Keynesian economics, while it shares many
features with traditional Keynesian models, differs in several crucial
respects.    For a review of the central features of these models, and a
contrast between the New Keynesian and New Classical approaches, see
Creenwald and Stiglitz [1987b].   For a survey of the empirical evidence in
support of these theories, see Creenwald and Stiglitz [l988c].

studying       the subject.         Money had no real effects.         I was persuaded by the

theory. Since, as a young idealist, I thoughr economists should be concerned

with matters of importance, with real variables, I paid little attention in

the following years to monetary economics.2

        As    a    result,     I   missed    several   of the fads        in empirical    monetary

economics:           what mattered          was   unanticipated    money;    what mattered     was

anticipated money; money did not matter, once one had correctly                          controlled

for   short       term    interest     rates; velocity       (correctly    calculated,    with the

right        definition       of money,      a    definition   which   was    itself     constantly

changing) was or was not constant,



The Classical Dichotomy Strengthened.

        The theory,       too,     progressed, if in an uneven way.          Some economists who,

in other          respects,      insisted that models should not be ad hoc,              that they

should be based on principles of maximization, took the low road around the

difficulties posed by money by putting money                      into the utility function or

the production           function--a trick, which           repeated often    enough,    took on a

semblance of respectability!                Others took the high road,          creating a demand

for money by assuming that it was required for transactions, modelling it as

an old fashioned cash in advance constraint--criticisms that it was en ad




     2Monetary economics displayed the same schizophrenia between micro-
theory and macro-theory      that characterized    then  (and continues   to
characterize) the profession.    In macro-economics, we were taught that, at
least some of the time, money did matter. It had real effects. For reasons
which I shall explain later, I found the macro-economic analysis less than
compelling.

hoc assumption which was blatantly false being brushed aside with the remark

that these were topics for future research.3

      On the other side,   I   managed to strengthen considerably the theoretical

foundations    of the   classical     dichotomy,    incorporating    uncertainty,    and

showing that    the conclusions      did not depend either on the existence of a

complete Set of markets or even rational expectations.           Using the approach I

had   previously    employed    to   demonstrate    the    irrelevance    of   corporate

financial   policy (Stiglitz [1969, 1974)), I showed that public financial

policy had no effect (Stiglitz       [1983,   l988]).     Establishing a form of Say's

law for govertunent debt, I showed that if the government reduced taxes and

increased its debt, the demand for government bonds increased by an amount

exactly equal to the increase in supply.            Not only did such a change in

financial policy have no real effects, it had not effects on prices either.

Furthermore,    a change in the term structure            of government    debt   had no

effects.      This result seemed particularly surprising, given the widespread

acceptance of the Tobin portfolio approach to monetary              economics in which


     3Some recent research has attempted to address this criticism, but in
ways which I find unconvincing. Models are constructed where, for instance,
individuals only meet once, and hence it is impossible to establish credit-
worthiness.  But even in these circumstances, there would be incentives to
establish credit intermediaries.     The fact is that credit facilitates a
substantial fraction of all transactions, a fraction which itself is
presumably endogenously determined.      Constructing a model in which that
fraction is, of necessity, zero may provide limited insights into our economy.

     4Several other versions of the irrelevance theorem, paralleling the
various versions of the Modigliani-Miller theorem, were established, e.g. by
Wallace.   These required somewhat more stringent conditions, for instance,
the existence of a complete set of securities markets.
     Earlier, simpler versions of public irrelevance theorems, in which
there was no uncertainty, were popularized by Barro [1974] , though similar
results were proven several years earlier in an unpublished paper by Robert
Hall [1967], and Buchanan attributes the idea to Ricardo (hence the popular
characterization of the result as the Barro-Ricardo proposition.)


                                                3
changes     in the supplies       of bonds affect     the    level   of investment       as a

consequence    of the general equilibrium effects on the price                   of capital

(Tobin's "q").         The   "mistake"5 was that Tobin      (and others of that school)

forgot to include, as one element in individuals' portfolios,                   the variable

tax liabilities.         The probability distribution         of these tax liabilities

changes, of course, when the government            usdertakes    a change in,         say, the

maturity structure of its debt.          My analysis took those changes explicitly

into account.

      Of course, like any theorem, there were assumptions which went into the

analysis.      These    seemed   to be of two sorts:        some,    like    the absence of

distortionary    tax affects, while       they would alter      the qualitative result

that taxes had          effect, seemed an implausible basis for an argument about

why monetsry policy should be important:            surely its effectiveness did not

hinge on the     real effects arising from the difference in the change in the

dead weight losses from an increase in tsxes in one year compenssted by a

decrease in taxes in some later years!             Another assumption in the analysis

was   the absence       of intergenerational redistributive          effects.     While    one

might agree or disagree with Barro that the economy isbest modeled as a set

of dynastic families, with no intergenerational effects, surely                            run

monetary policy does not hinge on these intergenerational effects.

      The    other     set   of assumptions--concerning       perfect       capital    markets

(though the analysis did not require that there be a complete set of risk

and   futures markets)--wss        no different from that assumed in conventional


      i hesitate to call it a mistake, because I suspect, as a behavioral
model, his probably provided a more accurate depiction of the economy than
mine, which required, if not rational expectations, at least a certain form
of "consistent expectations," entailing a higher degree of rationality than,
I suspect, is commonly found.


                                               4
economic models.        If that assumption was struck down, with it would fall

much of the standard         theory.        Of course, practical men have long claimed

that the economists' models of the capital market were unrealistic, and a

host   of institutional        economists         (and     theoretical economists,         when they

found it to their convenience) have made use of the assumption of imperfect

capital markets.        But higher minded economists have looked derisively                         at

those who made reference            to imperfect capital markets, accusing them of,

among other sins, ad hocery.

       One of the most important developments in economic theory, however, of

the past fifteen years has been to explore the consequences of imperfect and

costly    information    for       the    functioning        of the capital          market.     These

studies6   have shown        that        those    models     which       assumed   imperfect   capital

markets may have been much closer to the mark than those which, on the

contrary, assumed perfect capital marketa.                      These studiea have shown          that

capital    markets   that    are     competitive--in          the    sense     which    that word is

commonly used- -may be characterized by credit and equity rationing.                             These

models not only provide explanations of institutional details of the capital

market,    details   which     are       either    inconsistent          with the perfect capital

market models or about which they have nothing to say; but they also provide

a basis of an explanation of macro-economic (aggregative) behavior which are

also inconsistent       with the conventional neoclassical                     model.     It is not,

however, my purpose here to provide a review of these results.

       I   have now come      to believe that monetary inatitutions and policy do

have important real effects, but for reasona quite different from those of

the standard theory.         My objective in this talk         is to explain both why it is


that    monetary policy           is--sometimes--effective      and    why the       conventional

explanations of the mechanism by which it works- -particularly those versions

based on the transactions demand for money7 --                are    inadequate, though there

may be some slight grains of truth in these conventional explanations.



       II.     A Critique of Transactions Based Traditional Monetary Theory

       There      are   several     reasons   why one       might     be    suspicious    of     the

traditional explanations.             The past fifteen years hss witnessed remarkable

chsnges      in transactions        technologies.        Computers    enable    the velocity     of

circulation to become virtually infinite, for instance, in the use of money

msrket accounts.          The relationship between conventionally messured money and

income, while it has not been stable in recent years, hss not moved in a way

that a trsnsactions-based theory would have predicted.

       More fundamentally, most transactions are exchanges of assets, snd are

not relsted directly to the production of income.                    And there is no a priori

reason to expect that              the relationship       between    the two,      the volume     of

exchanges      of assets and the level of income, should be stable.                       Indeed,

there is reason to believe that in periods of rapid change, such as when the

economy      is   going    into    a recession,     there will be          large   differences    in

opinions       concerning    future prospects       of the economy,           as well    as    large


        The theoretical and empirical objections to the real balance effects
are perhaps slightly better known and, I think, equally telling.
     The one approach which I find aomewhst persuasive is the Tobin
portfolio approach, but, as I noted above, that approach faces certain
difficulties. The theory we present below resolves some those difficulties.

                                                     6
changes in relative       net wealth positions, leading to corresponding      larger

than   normal exchanges     of assets.    Of course, many,     if not most,   asset

exchanges    may not   entail money   (or may   entail money   with a much higher

velocity than transactions involving labor services.)          But that is exactly

my point:    transactions do not require money, only credit.

       Furthermore, with the recent growth of interest bearing accounts,         the

poxtunitv     cost of holding money has, by and large, become the difference

between the interest rate paid on money market accounts and those paid on

other short term financial instruments--a difference which is, for economic

purposes,    minuscule.     It is this   interest rate differential which should

appear in the money demand equation (and in the LM curves of macro-economic

analysis.)     It stretches the credulity of even the most hardened Keynesian

to believe that monetary policy operates through changes in the        gg value
of this interest rate differential.         Of course, in a general equilibrium

system, any exogenous change will have affects throughout the system.           Were

the government to buy up peanuts and burn them, it would have real effects

on output, investment, and employment.       But though there is a long tradition

in macro-economics on focusing on third and fourth order effects- - dating at

least back to the real balance        effect- - there is a consensus that a peanut

theory of macro-economic policy will not do; so too should a theory based on

changes in the differential between money market accounts and short             term

government bills be looked upon with suspicion, though there may indeed be

links between this differential and the appropriate long term real interest

rates, and between those interest rates and the level of investment.
     But even that last link is suspect; or,             to put it more accurately, it

does not seem plausible        that variations       in long term real interest rates

have played an important role in fluctuations in investment.              It is hard to

know, of course, what the relevsnt real interest rates are.               We have time

series for nominal interest rates for loans of various msturities, but what

is relevant    for mn investor       (in the traditional theory), mt the time he

makes his decisions,        is the real interest rate, and to calculate this, he

must form a forecast of future prices.           (This would not be true, of course,

if all loans were appropriately indexed.)             As a first pass at this problem,

                                                             of interest.
Dwight Jaffee and I [1988] looked at the realized real rates

We constructed a time series for what the real rate of interest would have

been on five year indexed government bonds (so we can ignore variations in

rates of default), assuming the market acted            jf it had     perfect foresight

and was risk neutral.         Suth a hypothetical       rate would have been the rate

that would--in neoclassical models without equity and credit rationing--be

relevant for investment decisions in five year machines.               Though there has

been some secular changes in this real interest rate, rising in the 80's to

record               there     is   virtually   no    relationship   between   this,   the
         heights,

relevant real interest rate, and the level of investment.               (Similar results

bold for the ten year real interest rate.)             With a few exceptions--the Great

                                                                     rate as
Depression and the l980's--one might as well treat the real interest

 a constant.     And constants do not provide a basis of a good theory of

 fluctuations.

      This is not surprising, given businessmen's accounts of how they make

 investment    decisions.     Though interest rates enter the calculations,            they

                                                           or 25% before they
 conventionally require (expected) real returns of 15, 20,


                                                 8
undertake    a project; given the uncertainties associated with all aspects of

long term investment projects, a variation in the real interest rate from 3

to 4% is absorbed in rounding error.

        The skepticism that we have expressed here and elsewhere about the role

of interest rates has, of course, been implicitly or explicitly shared by

monetarists.       They have noted the regularity between the money supply and

the   level of output, with interest rates                  seemingly   playing a   relatively

minor    role.     Leaving      to theorists      the    task of explaining    this sometime

regularity,      they    have   been content to base policy prescriptions              on the

persistence      of this relationship,         to argue      that if only we increase        the

supply of money, output will go             up.     The failure of this prescription         to

work in the 80's should not detract us from the essential insight of the

monetarists- -the        seeming   unimportance      over    long periods   of time of the

interest rate.

        There are further objections to the transactions based theory of money:

when Ireland faced a strike which closed down the clearing mechanisms for

checks, while the transactions based theories might have suggested that the

economy would have come to a screeching halt, alternative arrangements were

easily worked out,           and    the   effects    were indeed limited.           Italy   hds

periodically      gone    through    periods      of shortages of small currency,           with

little    impediment in trade, the major                effect perhaps being   the increased

number of cavities resulting from the slightly larger number of pieces of

candy consumed, as candy became conventionally used for small change.

                        The Survival Power of a Bad Theory

     I have thought hard about the question of how could a theory with such

seeaing   little prospect       for explaining major macro-economic   events gained

such widespread     populsrity.      (If bad msnagers had sn ability     to survive

comparable    to thst of bad economic theories, the capitalist economic system

would     indeed   be   faced    with problems!)      There   are   three   possible

explanations.



1.   Money as an Accounting Device in Simple Games and Primitive Economies.

      One of the lessons we have learned from Freudian psychology            is the

                                                       we wish to understand
importance of going back to events of our childhood if

our neuroses, our obsessions, and the way we misperceive the world.          Most of

us when we were children played simple games, in which play money was used.

In playing monopoly, if we wanted to buy a house or hotel or a piece of

property, we had to have money- -we could not buy on credit.            There was a

cash-in-advance     constraint; money was the medium of exchange.

      Money   served s second function:       it was the method by which we kept

score.     The person with the most money sc the end of the gsme was declared

the winner.

      Later on, most of us pass on to more complicated games, such as bridge,

where there are alternstive ways of keeping score.

        Similarly, primitive economies need a simple accounting scheme.        Since

the expulsion      from Eden, all economies have needed some method of keeping

track of what esch individual contributes to and takes out of the economy.

Primitive economies use money (M0) as their accounting device.




                                              10
     But even in simple economies, there is s realization that there may not

be   an     intertemporal          coincidence       of     wants.       There   are     gains     from

intertemporal      trades.         Intertemporal trsdes require credit: one individual

gets more than he has
                               -   -   up to that point in time --         "earned"    the right to,

in return for s promise to pay back some of his future earnings.                                 Hence,

even primitive economiea drop the cash-in-advance constraint.

     In modern economies, the task of determining who is credit worthy, who

is likely to repay a loan, is both more important and more difficult than in

primitive economies.           It is not only that (to use Bohm Bawerk's term) round

about means of production                are more productive, but there is a separation

between entrepreneurship               and capital:       those with the best ideas for using

resources       are not necessarily          those who have control of reaourcea.                It is

not surprising then that institutions have developed to ascertain who is

credit worthy       (and indeed different              institutions specialize         in evaluating

different       kinds    of risk.)         Banks    are among      the moat important of these

institutions.

     Banks can thus be viewed as social accountants--keeping                        the records of

what individuals          contribute        to and        take   out   of society- - and screening

devices.        (See Stiglitz and Weiss, 1988a.)

     Though the "model" of money which is derived from childhood games and

primitive economies is not a good model of our credit economy, there is one

important       lesson    to   be       derived    from    it.       Even in our more      developed

economies, money is pgfl.of our system of accounts, of ascertaining who has

rights     to    reaourcea.            If the     government     should print    money   to finance

deficits,       this will interfere with our accounting                   ayatem.      The claims on

resources,       at existing prices, will exceed the supply of resources, and


                                                          11
inflation will result.8        On the other hand, if the government borrowa to

finance government deficita, there is no necessary increase in the supply of

current claims on resources;      individuals simply trade with the government

their             to current   resources    for rights     to future   resources.   Of
         rights

course, the increase supply of government           debt may provide the basis of a


general expansion     of credit (a monetary expansion) by the banking system,

but it need not do so.     The fact that the banking system may extend more or

less credit than is required to attain full employment at stable prices is a

more general problem, which we discuss below.




2.   Sunk Costs of General Equilibrium Theory.

        Let me now turn to the second possible explanation of the persistence

of the transactions-based view of money.             In spite of the sermon that we

                                                          end ignoring past
preach to our students about letting by-gones be bygones,

sunk costs in making future investments,             there is considerable     evidence

that businessmen       do not behave       this way--nor    do we academics.     Having

invested en enormous amount of intellectual capital in learning the general

                                                we can.             A simple change of
equilibrium model, we want to apply it wherever

notation from C for conaumption or x for output to M for money and we have s

theory of money.       Monetary economics becomes the study of the demand and

supply curves for money, just like agricultural economics is the study of

the demand and supply for the output of farms.             Of course, if we pursued the

                                                  would be more than just
analogy further, we might have thought that there


                                                  the accounting ayatem, an

increase in the supply of gold (as a reault of the discovery of new gold

deposits) constituted a disruption to the accounting ayatem.
"claims" on resources was increased, without a commensurate increase in the
supply of resources. Inflation again resulted.

the estimation      of demand and supply functions;              there would have been an

interest     in understanding     the    underlying         technology,    of examining      the

transactions technology and the relationship between that technology and the

demand     for   money.    Students     of money      and    finance   who   are   not    macro-

economists do study in detail the financial institutions, but they
                                                                   study the

instruments with which credit gets extended, not by which transactions get

recorded.



Credit as information.

     It is remarkably difficult to incorporate credit within the standard

general equilibrium model.         Credit can be created with almost no input of

conventional factors, and credit can equally easily be destroyed.                    There is

no easy way to represent the supply function for credit.

     The reason for        this   is   simple;        credit    is based on information.

Ascertaining      that an individual is credit worthy requires resources; and

standing by that judgment, providing or guaranteeing credit, entails risk-

bearing.     But there is no simple relationship between these economic costs

and the amount of credit extended.

    The physical capital with which we produce in our factories and fields

may be slightly affected by outside disturbances- -rain may lead to rust- -but

only major cataclysms, such as wars, can have a significant effect in the

short run.       But informational capital can be far more easily lost.                  Changes

in relative prices may require a drastic reevaluation                     of individuals and
firms' credit worthiness.

       The interest rate is not like a conventional price.                It is a promise to

there would be no issue in determining credit worthiness.

I    [1981} have shown,          raising the rate of interest         may not incresse the

expected     return to a loan; at higher interest rates one obtains a lower

quality set of applicants           (the adverse selection effect) and each of one's

                                                                                            These

An Analogy.      The fact chat the credit market is fundamentally different from

 a conventional         market    for    goods should be familiar       to us      from   another


 context.      None of the private universities in the US--even those, such as

                                                      and Northwestern,    where    first      race

    remind you of how we often talk about the auction for credit working:


                                                      14
who have the best projects are willing to pay the highest                       interest rstes,

and thus    the auction market ensures that the best projects- - and only the

best projects- -get funded,          Of course, we recognize the possibility of human

error.     But    then   we   say,    if the     individual     makes     a mistake      in over-

estimating the return, he bears the cost.

     Similar      language    could     apply    to    an    auction      for   places      in our

Universities.      Those with the highest return to a Stanford degree would bid

the highest,      thus ensuring      that the value         added of our scarce university

resources is maximized.         Of course, there is a possibility of someone over-

estimating the value of a Stanford degree, but if the individual makes such

a mistake, he bears the costs.            Lack of capital should be no problem:                the

University would simply take an IOU.

     Put     in this way,       we can     immediately        see   the    fallacies     in this

reasoning.       Students who bid too much will default on their IOU--just as

those who     bid too high an interest rate on their                  loan applications will

default.     Not only cannot we rely on individuals' judgments,                     there may be

reasons to believe that those who are willing to bid particularly high are

more likely to default.          The bank or the University--not                the borrower or

student--bears at least some of the costs of these misjudgments.                      The scarce

resources would not be used in a way which                    maximized     value   added.     The

auction system would result in the universities being flooded with                           those

overconfident and cocky students who             are so unpleasant to teach, combined
with those natural charlatans              and    cheaters,     who     feel no      more    moral

compunction      about defaulting      on their student loans than they would on

cheating on an exam.




                                                  15
        So too in credit markets:           in the face of uncertain prices, wages, and

interest rates, the return to a project depends as much on expectations of

those future prices as it does on the physical outputs.                   Those who are most

willing to bid high for a loan are those who are most optimistic about these

future prices and are least risk averse, and/or for whom the cost of default

is lowest.        But   there   is no reason to believe          that allocating    credit to

these individuals maximizes            either the private       return to the bsnk, or the

social return to society.

        Just ss universities        spend      resources    screening     applicmnts,    so too

banks    spend resources        screening     mpplicsnts.       The   screening   is far   from

perfect, yet some screening is far preferable                  to none.   Prices (or in this

case,    interest rates)--market         auctions--do not provide, by themselves, an

adequate screening mechanism.



Credit and Equity kationing

        The informational problems, about which I have just spoken, may easily

give rise        to credit rationing.         Recall,   sgsin, the conventional         stories:

when there       is   an excess demand for credit, an unsatisfied borrower offers

the bank m higher interest rate.               As interest rates thus rise, the demand

for     credit    decreases,     and    the   supply    incremses,     until   equilibrium    is

attained.    But      now,   consider what happens       if,    at the interest rate which

maximizes the bank's expected return, there is an excess demmnd for credit.

The bank would refuse a customer who offers to pay a higher interest race,

reasoning chat he is (on "average") a bad risk.                 The expected return to such

a loan would be lower than for loans the bank is currently making.




                                                   16
       Banks will, of course, change the interest rate which              they charge as

economic circumstances change.        But there is no simple relationship between

the interest rate charged- -or even the interest rate paid depositors- - and

the state of the economy.        As the economy goes into a boom, the returns to

all projects may increase,        and one might be tempted to argue that as a

consequence the real rate of interest ought to rise, presenting               a quandary,

since in      g   instances- -such    as the Great     Depression- -the real interest

rate moved counter cyclically        rather than pro-cyclically.          But Weiss and I

l988] have shown that there may be important instances, where the returns
to say risky projects     increase relative to safe projects in some booms, in

which    banks' optimal interest rate (and accordingly, the market equilibrium

interest rate charged borrowers)        actually falls.        And it is even possible

that    it falls by enough that       the real return to depositors          falls, even

though the expected default probability has fallen.              Though total expected

rates    of return have    increased,     that     fraction    of total    returns   which

lenders, with conventional debt contracts, can appropriate decreases so much

that their expected return is lowered.

        Not   only may   these    informational     problems    give rise      to    credit

rationing, they may also give rise to what Bruce Greenwald and I have called

equity rationing     (Greenwald    and Stiglitz, l987a,b, l988ab).            Because of

adverse selection9 and moral hazard'° effects, the cost of issuing equity


     9That is, the original owners-managers of firms are more informed about
their firm's expected return than potential purchasers of shares. At any
given price of equity, those with the lowest expected returns are most
willing to sell their shares. See Stiglitz [1982], Greenwald, Stiglitz, and
Weiss [1984], and Meyers and Majiuf [1984).

      '0Because the managers only receive a fraction of the returns to their
entrepreneurial efforts, their incentives are attenuated.       See Stiglitz
[1974] or Ross [1973].

When they are denied bank credit, they do not raiae capital by issuing new

                       rather       constrain     their    capital        expenditures      to    reteined

                12
                      Equity rationing          is particularly      important, because it means

                                  divest    themselves    of the risks which           they      face;   the

problems     associated            with the capital market, provide insights into two of

theoretical justification      for the traditional characterization         of monetary

policy at such times as pushing against a stting.



3.    A Seeming Empirical Regularity

      The third, and to my mind, most credible reason for the survival of the

conventional    monetary model   is the seeming regularity of the relationship

between money and income, a regularity        which called out for a theoretical

explanation.     The transactions based model seemed to provide an explanation

for   this   seeming   regularity,   though one which, we have argued,         is both

incomplete--it does not explain !qhy money        is required   for transactions, it

simply assumes    it- -and wrong,    since money is in fact not required.         It is
not a serious advance in economic theory simply to assume-
                                                           -counterfactually-
-that cash is required       in advance, rather than to assume a money demand

function takes on a particular       form.   The former seems no less ad hoc than

the   latter,   and the latter- -for an appropriately specified            function- -at

least has the possibility of being correct.

      The disadvantages     of using reduced form relations are, by now, well

known:   one cannot use such models to analyze "regime changes."           But can one

have much reliance      on the predictions of a theory based on the obviously
                                                                      13
unsatisfactory assumption of the cash-in-advance constraint?




     131 really do not want to single out a particular model.    Similar
objections can be raised against models in which, for instance, monetary
policy exercises its effects through real balance effects.

                       III.    A Closer Look at the Allocation of Credit

        Though we have provide a theoretical rationale for the widely observed

phenomena of credit and equity rationing, many of the consequences (which we

are     about to deacribe)          hold regardless of the explanation of credit and

equity rationing.

        Consequences          of credit rationing:      role of interest rates.      We have

already        noted   one     consequence:    that   investment may depend     less on the

interest        rate    charged    than on the availability of credit.                      in
                                                                                 Changes

availability          of credit may be much more marked than changes in interest

rates charged.           Indeed, there may be no simple relationship between credit

conditions (e.g. the riskiness of the environment), credit
                                                           availability, and
the interest rate charged.             (Stiglitz and Weiss, l987b)

        Consequences of credit rationing:             need for central bank.    We have also
noted a second consequence:               that because interest rates are not used to

equilibrate          the demand and supply for funds, the decentralized           system of
credit     allocation          of capitalist   economies14    may   result   in discrepancy
between    the two at full employment levela of output.               One can view central

banks     as    a    substitute    for prices (interest rates)        as an equilibrating

mechanism.

      1echanisms        by which central banks affect credit availability.            In the

theory we have put forward, the central bank affects the availability                       of
credit both through effects on the willinaness and
                                                   ability of banks to make

loans.         When banks have no free reserves, then monetary policy operates

through        its   effect     on banks' ability      to make   loans:      it changes    the


     14We should emphasize     that  there are good reasons     for                       this
decentralization, associated with the wide dispersal of information.                       See

constraint.     On the other hand, when banks have free reserves (as they did

in the Great Depression), monetary policy operates through banks willingness

to make loans.       One     important      aspect of this which        to date has received

insufficient attention is described below.

                                                      risk averse behavior.        A
     Consequences of equity rationing:                                                       major

              of equity rationing             is that firms may        act    in a risk averse
consequence
                                                           firms' risks can be
manner.    Equity rationing limits the extent to which the

shared.    The fact that future markets are incomplete and there are lags in

production means     that every production, employment, and investment decision

is a risk decision.15           Accordingly, changes in either the risks faced by

          or in firms                    to   absorb risks, will affect           all    of these
firms,                       ability

decisions of the firm.         Thus, an increase in the degree of uncertainty about

future    economic    prospects        may     lead    firms   to    reduce    their     level    of

production; and a worsening            in a firm's balance sheet (its net worth) will

lead it to undertake less investment and production.

     Interactions          between      equity        and   credit    rationing        and   their

                     There    are    some     important     interactions between        credit snd
consequences.

                           First, firm's most           serious fears    are associated          with
equity rationing.

bankruptcy.      Bankruptcy      is determined not just by cash flows.                   Firms     go

bankrupt when they aske losses                4   cannot    find lenders willing to lend to

them.     The fear of future credit rationing is one reason that firms act

conservatively today.




     '5There are other possible explanations for why firms might behave in a
risk averse manner; the principal agent literature has stressed the
                                                    incentive structure must

have managerial rewards depending significantly on firm performance; this

     Secondly, most firms sre not only engaged in production, but slso in

lending.     They sre mini-banks.          The reason that firms so frequently reject

Polonius' sdvice shout "neither a lender nor a borrower be--and become both

lenders and borrowers--is          simple:      information in our economy is diffuse.

Suppliers have information about their customers that others do not have,

and customers       have   information     about   their suppliers    that others      do not

have.'6    This lending activity is, however risky.              Thus, when a firm's net

equity position is worsened or when a firm's sources of funds are restricted

(it is credit rationed) or when a firm's perception of the risk of lending

is increasing, firm's will reduce their lending activities.

                 banks      are    like   firms:    their    production    activity    is the

screening of loan applicants.             And just as firms are risk averse, so too are

banks.     A reduction in their net worth               (equity) or an increase in their

perception     of    the    risk    associated     with     making loans     reduces    their

willingness to make loans.

     Multiplier      effects.       In our previous discussion         we have shown      the

market economies will be characterized by price (interest rate) rigidities'7

and credit interlinkages (both directly among firms, and between firma and

banks).       This     results     in     the   economic    system   exhibiting   at    times

instabilities; small disturbances are amplified through a multiplier process


     '6mere are other reasons for the interlinking of production and credit
activities, having to do with moral hazard (the chance of a defective
product.)  The credit provided by a supplier can be thought of, in part, as
a guarantee.   More generally, certain externalities associated with moral
hazard frequently give rise to interlinking of markets. See Braverman and
Stiglitz (1982) and Arnott and Stiglitz (1988).
     17 In
            related work, we have shown how the labor market will be
characterized by wage rigidities (the efficiency wage hypothesis) and the
product market may be characterized by price rigidities. See, e.g. Stiglitz
(1984, 1985a, 1986, 1987a,b) and Shapiro and Stiglitz (1984).

                                                   23
which    is quite distinct from the traditional Keynesian multiplier                   process

(or more accurstely, contains that process as only one element.)

        (The    distinction   of how the economy           is    envisaged    to   respond   to

disturbances      is another example of the marked dispsrity between macro and

micro     economics.       Traditional         micro-theory,    while    it   recognizes     the

difficulties      of proving stsbility, begins with a downward sloping demand

curve and an upward sloping supply curve, in which a disturbance to either

is dampened       through adjustments of prices.               The market economy does       not

amplify disturbances, but dampens them.)

        Perhaps the beat way to contrast our perspective with the traditional

one is to trace out the consequences of some disturbance- -an increase in the

uncertainty associated with the demand for some good that s country exports-

-both in our theory and in the trsditional theory.                      In the models of the

true believers, a mean preserving increase in uncertsinty, that is one which

does    not change       the expected      return, would have no          affect   on current

investment,      since   all firms       are   fully diversified.       (A reduction    in the

expected       return would   ,    of   course, lead to s decrease in the demand for

investment,       leading to a decline in real interest              rates; the subsequent

reduction in savings would quickly restore equilibrium.)

        In our theory, risk averse firms (recall, our theory explains why firms

should act in s risk averse manner) would be less willing to produce                         and

invest.         This   reduction    in investment then has further repercussions.

Prices     for the investment goods            the firm would otherwise have bought are

lower     (than they would otherwise have been, and lower than the firms had

expected.)        The consequent reduction in profits erodes the equity base of

these firms, who, in turn,              become less willing to invest.         Furthermore, a


                                                    24
fraction of these firms(if the original disturbance was large enough) will

go bankrupt.      The increased bankruptcy      leads   to petceptions of increased

uncertainty    associated with making loans (both on the part of banks and of

firma making loans to suppliers and customers).

     We now have third round effects.         These are of two forms.       The reduced

investment of the suppliers of firma has further effects,             mlong the same

lines as the original      disturbance.      In addition,   the (higher) bmnkruptcy

rate means than banks' net equity position is deteriorated.

     One can view banks like conventional firms.            The businesa of banks is

making   loans;     they   "invest"     in   cultivating    clients   and     screening

applications.     When their net equity position is reduced, they become less

willing to make loans.

     We now turn to the central role of the banks.            For simplicity, assume

that borrowers     can be classified into three categories, "good" "OK" and

"bad" riaka.      The bank knows      that it places    firms into these categories

imperfectly, with some good risks being classified as bad, and some bad as

good, etc.       All good loans are, nonetheless, granted, no bad loans, and--

depending    on the availability of credit--only some OK loans.             Again, for

simplicity, we aasume all borrowera apply for the same size loan.             (If truly

good borrowers    always applied to larger (or smaller) loans, that would be a

aignal, and the interest rate would be lower to reflect the higher quality.

But that could not be an equilibrium.'8)




     18We are focusing, in other words, on what is called a pooling
equilibrium. One can construct equilibria in which contracts with differing
terms, e.g.(loan size, intereat rate) can serve as the basis of a self-
selection (separating) equilibrium.

    How does the disturbance we have just described affect the bank

expected return.

        Firms     that are       classified    as   good   are   likely    to   reduce their

 investment, both because           of the increased risk and because of the higher

      Note that in this perspective, there are two different senses in which

firms     may view themselves        as   credit       constrained.          Some    firms- -those

classified as bad and some of those classified as OK- -simply do not receive

credit.     They cannot obtain credit at any terms.

      Others- -the good firms       rhat have been classified                as OK--cannot    get

credit at terms which they think is fair.               They   im     that   they are going to

repay.     Thus, they view the expected cost of a loan charging a very high

interest rate to be very high--far higher than does the OK borrower,                          who

knows that there is a higher probability of default.                   The irony is that the

cost to good borrowers           is higher    than     the    cost    (in terms      of expected

payments)    to lousy borrowers.          Good borrowers may choose not to borrow

anything     at    these   unfavorable    terms.         They think        of themselves       as

effectively shut out of the market.           This is similar to the feeling a small

business has when it has been turned down for a loan by its bank.                       There are

secondary sources to which it could turn.               There is a market specialized in

screening loan applicants that have been turned down by banks.                        When these

institutions grant a loan, they charge a high interest rate--exorbitant from

the   perspective     of   the   misclassified       customer,       but   perhaps     accurately

reflecting the true default probabilities.               (Some of these individuals are,

in fact, good risks.) The point, of course, is that the credit market is not

a pure-price market.         It classifies borrowers.            The classification        is the

central allocstive mechanism in this market.

        Finally,    the    recognition       of         the    increased        likelihood     of

misclassification means that good borrowers think it more likely that they

will be credit constrained (in either of the two senses in which we have

used the term) in the future, and this concern induces them to maintain

more liquid position (invest less.)

     These   are all reasons why,     even if the supply of credit today were

unaltered by increased uncertainty, investment would be reduced.

                                                        for reasons that we
Further, however, banks do reduce the supply of credit,

have already teferred     to.   The greater likelihood of misclassification    and

the higher probabilities of bankruptcy make loans riskier, even if the bank

is able to increase the interest rate charged to offset.          But the bank may

find it disadvantageous to increase the interest rate charged, because doing

so lowers the expected return.      (These effects are in addition to the one to

                                                                       to a
which we previously referred, the reduced equity base of banks leading

lower willingness to make loans.)

     The lower supply of credit means that more of those classified as "OK"

are denied credit, or have their loan size reduced.           And chis, in turn,

lowers investment.

     The reduction in           credit has   further multiplier   effects on credit

bank to make a loan--leads to a reluctance on the part of other lenders to

 extend credit.

      The increased risk, lower net equity levels, and greater likelihood of

 future credit rationing all lead firms to reduce their lending activity.

      We can then trsce out fourth round and subsequent effects:        the reduced

 credit availability leads to reduced investment, leading to

                                    IV.    Empirical Implications

        The    theory       we    have presented          has   a   large     number of        empirical

implications, which can be compared both with those of traditional Keynesian

theory,       including     the     fixed      price   and menu cost versions,          and the real

business cycles which have become fashionable in the US in recent years.                              In

a recent Brookings           paper, Bruce Greenwald and               I    (Greenwald and Stiglitz,

l988c)     identified       certain key properties              of labor, capital,         and product

markets which would enable us to distinguish among the alternative theories.

Many     of    the    key        empirical      observations      were either       inconsistent     or

unexplained by the other theories.                     Using this "crucial" tests approach to

choosing      among     alternative           theories,   our     conclusions    was    that    the New

Keynesian       theories,          in     particular      those     versions     focusing       on   the

consequences         of imperfect         information and         incomplete    markets,    won hands

down.

        Here I have only time to provide a couple of examples, to give a flavor

of the argument.

        (a)     Inventories.            The    cyclical behavior          of inventories have long

provided a puzzle for neoclassical and Keynesian                          economists.   With concave

production      functions, relative little variability                     in real interest rates,

and shadow wages2° falling markedly in recessions, inventories should be

used to smooth production.                    Yet they do not; if anything, they exhibit an

even more marked cyclical variability than output, and there is a general




     20Shadow wages reflect the underutilization of labor in recessions,
evidenced by cyclical movements in productivity.    The discrepancy between
marginal real (producer) wages in booms and recessions is particularly
pronounced if one takes into account over time pay prevalent at later stages
of economic recoveries.

                                                          29
consensus that they contribute            to economic volatility,     rather than aerving

as a buffer-stabilizing        force.

       Our analysis provides an explanation of this behavior.

       (b) Sectoral Patterns.           Traditional Keynesian theories, relying on the

                                                  that fluctuations should
iaportance of fixed prices, would seem to predict

be smaller in those sectors exhibiting flexible prices.                      Among   the most


competitive sectors of the economy is the home construction                   industry, yet

this is a sector which has experienced some of the most marked volatility.

Equity and credit rationing are particular               important in these sectora, and

thus the magnitude          of these fluctuations is perfectly consistent with our

views.

       (c)      Explanations of price and wage rigidities.           Traditional Keynesian

                                                                       have
theories, while stressing the importance of price and wage rigidities,

not come up with convincing explanations of these rigidities, or of why they

should be more        important    in some sectors than in others.             The   implicit

contract literature, for instance, while                explaining why wages paid may not

exhibit      much variability,        has been    unsuccessful     in explaining      why   the


particular form of wage rigidity associated with implicit contracts should

give     rise    to unemployment.         (See Newbery    and Stiglitz, 1987     or Stiglitz


1986.)       While menu cost models have stressed the importance of the costs of

adjusting       prices,     they have    failed to take into account the much larger

 coats associated with adjusting quantities, and the problem to be explained

 is why it is, when faced with certain disturbances, firms seem more willing

 to make quantity adjustments than price adjustments.                  An extension of our

                             on the      differential    risk   associated   with different
 analysis,       focusing
                                                                     be more
 adjustments, has provided an explanation not only of why prices may


                                                   30
rigid    than    quantities,    hut     also   why the extent of price            rigidities     may

differ in different sectors.                (See below and Greenwald and Stiglitz, l988b

for a more extensive discussion.)



                                     V. Covernment Policy

     The theory we have described provides both a rationale for government

policy and an explanation of the mechanisms through which it operates.

        Interest    rates    do not      work as an equilibrating               mechanism.       The

multiplier processes we have described in the previous                      section may lead to

instabilities.        If more credit is extended than would be in "equilibrium"

there     is    an excess      demand    for     goods;    prices   rise;       there   are    fewer

bankruptcies; equity positions are better than anticipated, leading to still

higher demands       for investment.           Though the higher than anticipated price

level means that banks' net equity positions, in real terms, may actually be

worse, in spite of the lower default rate, the seeming lower riskiness of

lending more       than    offsets    the    "wealth" effect 21,         leading to still       more

investment.

        The opposite      side- -an insufficient supply of credit cascading into a

credit crisis- -is perhaps an even more familiar story.

        We     emphasized earlier how the credit allocation decisions are made in

a   decentralized         manner.     We have      noted    that    in    the    absence      of the

coordinating function usually performed by interest rates, there appears                          to

be a role for a Central Bank, to ensure that the number of certifications




     21 Banks
              may be slow in calculating their real equity position;                            they
may be fooled by the higher than expected nominal wealth.

                                                    31
for credit worthiness        correspond   to che number      required to maintain    full


employment.

     The mechanisms by which policy works should be clear from the previous

discussion.         Again, we have noted that        monetary authorities may affect

either banks' willingness         or ability   to lend.      The latter effect     is,    of

course,    the one upon which       traditional monetary      theory has focused;        but

while Keynesian       analysis traces the effect through the indirect route--the

lower    supply     of loans leading to higher interest rates leading to less

investment- -   in periods    of credit rationing, we would argue for a more direct

channel.

        If our theory is correct, the long standing confusion about whether it

is money    or credit through which monetary policy functions becomes more

understandable.        For the traditional mechanism by which banks         issue credit

is intimately        associated with the creation      of money.     A    credit line     is

created.      The    firm draws upon the credit line when funds are needed; a

demand deposit--that         is money--is created precisely when the firm plans to

spend more, e.g. by undertaking a new investment.

        Our views also reconcile some of the controversies between monetarists,

Keynesians, and neoclassical economists.         We agree with the monetarists that

monetary policy may not primarily work through an interest rate mechanism--

and that interest rates msy not provide a good target for monetary policy

 (except to the extent          that interest rates    are   correlated   with   inflation

 rates, through Fisher's law.)        But we agree with the Keynesians that a major

 channel of monetary policy is through its effects on investment and firm's

 willingness      and ability    to produce.    Our view differs      from monetarists,

 Keynesisns, end neoclassical economists         in its view of the details of how


                                                32
monetary    policy   affects   the economy:    it is not through a     transactions

mechanism   (money burning a hole in people's pocket, driving them out to buy

goods or driving down the interest rate), but through the credit mechanism.




                                   Some Questions



     A long standing puzzle facing conventional monetary economics is that,

while it assumes that the government may control the nominal money supply,

it does not control the real money supply.          If the classical dichotomy were

correct, an increase in the money        supply would instantaneously lead to an

increase in prices, negating the effect of the monetary expansion.22

     The traditional Keynesian        way of resolving this    is simply to assume

price rigidities.       We have already noted that the recent work trying to

justify this in terms of menu costs- -the costs of changing prices- -seem moat

unpersuasive.    Again,   it seems an instance of macro-economists focusing on

third or fourth order      effects.     Surely, these adjustment costs are of an

order of magnitude      smaller   than the costs of adjustments associated     with

quantities.     If our objective is to explain why the economy adjusts more in

terms of quantities than prices, we have to look elsewhere.

     As we have observed, our theory provides an explanation of the relative

rigidity of prices as well.       For if firms are risk averse (as they will be,




     22Although again it is possible to argue that monetary policy- -defined
as a rule which specifies the magnitudes by which the nominal money supply
will be increased in indifferent circumstances--will have real effects,
because the probability distribution of returns to holding financial assets
will thereby change, this effect is generally viewed to be a second order
effect. See Stiglitz (1983).

                                              33

consequences of a change in any action, then the

will he adjusted will depend both on the degree of risk aversion and on the

uncertainty of its effect.

       The   risk associated         with    reducing production is relatively                 little,

                    if (as Bob Hall has                                   costa of production        are
particularly                                      argued) marginal

                                             coats.                         The sole risk is that
stipulated conditions, has relatively little

of a     stock-out      of    inventories,        and   given       the   availability    of excess

resources,     remedial actions can quickly be taken                      to avoid   that should it


prove imminent.           On the other hand, there is considerable risk associated

with                                and    wages,    partly        associated    with    how    others
         changing      prices

(competitora, employees) will reapond.

       Unleaa firma are perfectly informed concerning the money supply, and

unless                                    with                    confidence,    in the    classical
             they all    believe,                 coaplete

                                                                                 in response to an
 dichotomy, firma will not increase prices proportionately

 increase in money supply.                And, in this sense, their lack of confidence                in

 the claaaical dichotomy is self-confirming.

       Accordingly,      a monetary-credit expansion will have real effects, even

 if all      contracts       were             indexed.       For     so   long   as prices      do   not
                                    fully

 instantaneously       increase in proportion to the credit/money creation, access

 to resources will be altered by a change in nominal credit availability.

 In particular        monetary      policy       affects   different      sectors    of the    econoay

 differently.         If the government were to make credit more available, it is


                                                        34
not as if each firm in the economy immediately had its deposit accounts

increased    proportionately.           Some   sectors   are   more     credit    rationed     than

others.     The increased credit availability will accordingly affect relative

prices,    and this will lead to all the kinds of effects described                      in our

previous discussion.

        Of course,   there   is    not     full   indexing.       Our    theory     provides     an

explanation of why unanticipated inflation--or an unanticipated decrease in

the rate     of inflation--will      have      even stronger real effects, given that

there is not     complete    indexing.         Since, both at the time of the                Great

Depression as well as today, there is not complete indexing, one might argue

that this proviso     is not of much moment.              But purists might claim            that,

until    we have explained        the absence of indexing, we have an incomplete

theory.     But our theory even provides a suggestion of why indexing may not

occur.

        Assume there were some, say, oligopolistic industry in which all firms

believe    that other firms       do not adjust their prices fully in response to

inflation.     If each firm believes the others will not do               so,    it does not pay

for    it to do so:      one      can    show there      exists   a rational expectations

equilibrium with nominal rigidities.              (It would be excessively risky for any

firm    to depart from the seeming convention,                 to try    to establish        a new

convention.)      Such firms will be unwilling             to borrow or lend with fully

indexed bonds.       And other suppliers and purchasers would not want fully

indexed bonds, and would not change their prices proportionately                      to changes

in the money supply.23       This does not explain why there isn't more indexing-


     23Several other models, based on imperfect information, with nominal
wage and price rigidities, have been formulated. See Stiglitz (1984, 1987a,
1989)

high and variable, indexing does occur.          Indexing clearly does not resolve

all the relevant macro-economic       issues:    such economies still seem subject

to macro-economic fluctuations, and monetary policy may still be effective.

Again, our theory provides an explanation2           ,   an   explanation which is missing

from traditional Keynesian theories which rely on nominal price rigidities.




                        Further implications for Policy




       Let me conclude my talk by drawing attention to three of the policy

implications of our theory.



1. Social va. Private Returns    to Increasing Speed of Recording Transactions.

       One major change in recent decades, to which we have referred earlier,

 is the faster speed with which        transactions are recorded.            We emphasized

 earlier the importance of having a good accounting system-
                                                            -              this was   one of


 the   central roles   of banking institutions.               But it does not follow that

 there   is much of a social return to recording a transaction                  one   second

                                                                there may be
 faster, though given the conventions of our accounting system,

 a private return from doing    so.     Elsewhere (Stiglitz and Weiss           [19881), we




     24Lest we claim too much for our theory, it should be noted that we
 show that there exist Nash equilibrium exhibiting nominal price or wage
                                              are other equilibria which do
 rigidities (Stiglitz l985b, 1987a,b); there
 not exhibit these nominal rigidities, but show real rigidities.   We do not
                                                                 This may be
 explain how it is that a particular equilibrium is "aelected."
                                                         lie in history.
 asking too much of a theory: the explanation may simply

                                                36
have ahown that expenditures on such increases in speed in recording may be

welfare decreasing.



2.     Incidence of the Corporation Income Tax

       Our theory has emphasized           the importance of equity constraints and the

availability of funds.           Covernment policies affect not only the maerginal

return to,      say, investment, but also            the supply of funds within            a firm.

Accordingly, the incidence of the corporation tax may depend on average tax

rates as well as marginal tax rates.25




3.     Stabilization Policy

We have noted the importance of equity and credit rationing in business

fluctuations. An effective stabilization policy of the government should be

directed at overcoming the limitations of this rationing.                     We can think of

standard investment tax credits as grants to firms, grants which are cut off

as soon as firms profits become too low.                  But those are ptecisely the times

when    the   firm needs       funds    the most.      Covernment     policy exacerbates       the

limitations      of financial          markets,    rather   than    offsetting     them.       The

government's     ability to tax implies that loans made thtough the tax system

have somewhat different properties                than loans made by banks; moreover,          the

objectives of government          loans should be somewhat different               from those of

banks, which      are only concerned          with the      returns   they can obtain.         The

government is,      after all, a silent partner in all business enterprises, a

partner,      however   with    somewhat     different      terms   than   those   facing    other




        25See Creenwald and Stiglitz (l988a).

                                                     37
               I                 these    differences because    I wish to avoid          the
partners.           emphasize

objection:     won't government funds simply displace private funds?

        The importance of discrimination- -of ensuring that funds to go to good

investment    projects- -   is   sufficiently     great to make a government        program

without screening likely to be socially unprofitable.                The difficulties of

                   credit worthiness      are   sufficiently great    to make government
ascertaining

             either                      bureaucratic   or particularly      vulnerable    to
screening               excessively

corruption.     This is why one needs to look for self-selection schemes, where

those    who have good prospects            (as   evidenced,   for   instance,    by their

willingness to put up their own capital)
                                         seek funds.                   Though this is not

the occasion to provide s detailed proposal, a system whereby firms could

borrow limited amounts for new investment (say 10% of the capital cost), to

be repaid out of future earnings would ease the capital constraint and, if

the loans were made at sufficiently favorable terms, increase the returns so

as to encourage investment during slack times.




                                      Concluding Remarks



         I began this lecture somewhat in the spirit of 'the true confessions of

 a converted monetarist."         By now, it should be clear that my conversion has

 been far from complete.          I   remain skeptical of the relevance of the 'M" so

 loved both by Keynesian         and monetarist economists.          Money   as a medium of


 exchange is, if not irrelevant, close to being so.                  It is not money that

 makes    the world go around, but credit.              It is not easy to describe the

 supply and demand for credit, its creation and destruction.                     One can not


                                                   38
simply write down a production           function.        The process of judging           credit

worthiness involves the collection and processing of information; changes in

economic    circumstances     can    easily    destroy        the   relevance    of previously

accumulated information.

       The close links between the money               supply and credit         creation    have

naturally     caused   a confusion      between   the    two.       If money     creation    were

perfectly     linked   with credit      creation,       one    might   well     object    to the

traditional stories told about how money affects the economy; but the policy

implications might      not be far from the mark (so long as one used money

supply as the target variable,           not an intermediate variable,                such as the

rate   of interest.)        But   the   link   is far     from perfect,         and   changes   in

institutions,    technology, and policy can affect that link.                     Our monetary

institutions become one, important set of institution within a broader met

of institutions to provide credit, monitor loans, and, more broadly,                            to

facilitate    intertemporal       transactions.        I hope that I provided            here an

alternative    framework    within which we can begin to think systematically

about monetary policy and credit institutions from this broader perspective.
