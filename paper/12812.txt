                                              ABSTRACT

We report evidence indicating that Bitnet adoption facilitated increased research collaboration between
US universities. However, not all institutions benefited equally. Using panel data from seven top engineering
journals, Bitnet connection records, and a variety of institution ranking data, we find that medium-ranked
universities were the primary beneficiaries; they benefited largely by increasing their collaboration
with top-ranked schools. Furthermore, we find that the magnitude of this effect was greatest for co-located
pairs. These results suggest that the most salient effect of lowering communication costs may have
been to facilitate gains from trade through the specialization of research tasks. Thus, the advent of
Bitnet -- and likely subsequent versions, including the Internet -- seems to have increased the role
of second-tier universities in the national innovation system as producers of new, high-quality knowledge.

                                            I. Introduction

We examine the effect of a decrease in collaboration costs resulting from the adoption of Bitnet

(an early version of the Internet) on university research collaboration in engineering. Our interest

in this question stems not from a concern about either Bitnet or engineering research specifically

but rather the broader question of how changes in collaboration costs may affect the process of

knowledge production. Exploiting the variation in year of adoption and publication output over

time in the 270 universities that published in seven top electrical engineering journals from 1981

to 1991, we find that a Bitnet connection did seem to facilitate a general increase in multi-

institutional collaboration (by 40%, on average). At the same time, not all adopters benefited

equally. Overall, Bitnet seems to have facilitated a disproportionate increase in the role of

second-tier universities, particularly those co-located with top-tier institutions.

       The non-uniform effect of Bitnet across university pairs offers insight into the nature of

collaborative knowledge production. A researcher deciding whether to add a collaborator to a

project will do so if the benefit exceeds the cost such that the returns from collaboration are

positive for both parties. Due to the way in which knowledge is produced, a technology shock

such as the introduction of Bitnet might affect the returns to collaboration differently depending

on characteristics of collaborating pairs, such as the quality of the institutions and the geographic

distance between them. Indeed, our finding that certain university pair types benefited

disproportionately from Bitnet adoption enables us to make inferences about the relative benefits

and costs of collaboration across pair types.

       For instance, we examine whether the returns to Bitnet adoption were mediated by pair

quality. One might expect that pairs comprised of two top-tier universities would benefit most

since, individually, these institutions produced the highest volume of research and thus had the




                                                                                                   2
most on which to collaborate. However, we find that top-middle-tier pairs benefited most from

adoption. These results suggest that the most salient effect of Bitnet may have been to facilitate

gains from trade through the specialization of research tasks.1

        Why might this be? Consider universities of two research quality types: high and low.

The former has a stronger orientation towards research, which is reflected in larger resource

allocations to research activities and a broad range of doctoral programs. Researchers at high-

quality schools may focus on winning grants, supervising the use of specialized equipment

(lasers, robots, simulators, etc.), attending international conferences to present results, and other

such high-cost activities. Researchers at lower-quality institutions, who may not have the

resources necessary for running certain types of experiments entirely on their own, may have the

expertise and equipment necessary for certain steps in the research process. Using Bitnet, data

could be transferred to these researchers for data analysis and computing. Indeed, this pattern of

activity is consistent with prior descriptive findings that characterize early electronic networks as

facilitating a division of labor leading to a greater involvement of researchers at “peripheral”

institutions (Hesse et al, 1993; Walsh and Bayma, 1996).

        We also examine whether the returns to Bitnet adoption were mediated by the distance

between pairs. One might expect that since Bitnet substitutes for other communication

mechanisms (phone, fax, travel, etc.) and communication costs increase with distance, Bitnet

would have disproportionately benefited pairs that were further apart since such pairs would


1
  The intuition underlying how the effect of communication costs on collaboration is mediated by quality is similar
in spirit to models that examine trade between developed and developing countries (e.g., Dixit and Norman, 1980;
Helpman and Krugman, 1985). Many of these models show that the type of trade in equilibrium (i.e., developed-
developed or developed-developing) will depend on the nature of the specialization and on the size of the
economies. While we focus on specialization to explain our results, we acknowledge it is only one possible
mechanism for differences of the observed effect of Bitnet across qualities. Other possibilities include monitoring
(Baker and Hubbard, 2003) and heterogeneity in research interests (Rosenblat and Mobius, 2004). The aim of this
paper is not to identify the particular mechanism but to empirically measure the impact of Bitnet connection on
different types of collaborations.


                                                                                                                 3
have enjoyed the greatest cost reduction. However, for top-middle-tier collaborations in

particular, our results show that the benefits of Bitnet were greatest for pairs that were close

together.

        These results suggest that network communication complements other collaborative

tools. Since collaborations are predicated on shared ideas, which are often the unplanned output

of direct interaction,2 researchers may benefit significantly from face-to-face communication

when they collaborate.3 Although the cost reduction per collaboration is greater for pairs that are

further apart, pairs that are closer together may interact more. Furthermore, electronic

communication may be more valuable when paired with face-to-face meetings (Gaspar and

Glaeser, 1998).4

        Overall, we find that second-tier schools significantly increased their collaboration rates

with co-located top-tier schools after Bitnet connection. These findings imply that the reduction

in collaboration costs further accentuated tendencies for research activity to agglomerate rather

than disperse; they are also consistent with the notion that the drop in costs facilitated a more

efficiently functioning market for inputs into the production of knowledge, thereby broadening

the set of institutions that participated – and continue to participate – in the production of high-

quality electrical engineering research.

  See, for example, Merton (1973) and Mairesse and Turner (2005).
3
  This is one of the arguments advanced to explain empirical evidence of agglomeration, particularly in knowledge-
intensive industries (Audrestch and Feldman, 1996; Zucker et al, 1998).
4
   A rich theoretical literature has established the ambiguous effect of an improvement in communications
technologies on interaction and collaboration across distances (e.g., Gaspar and Glaeser, 1998; Rosenblat and
Mobius, 2004). We draw on this literature to interpret our results.


                                                                                                                4
                                        II. A Brief Description of Bitnet

Bitnet was an early leader in network communications for the research and education

community. It allowed communication via email, access to remote file archives, use of Listserv,

file transfer protocol (FTP), and compatibility with other operating systems such as UNIX.5 The

first Bitnet adopters were the City University of New York and Yale University in May 1981. By

the end of the 1980s, Bitnet had become the largest academic network in the world for computer-

based communications.6 Even still, Bitnet did not have all the capabilities of today’s Internet. For

example, familiar Internet features such as the World Wide Web and the browser were not

invented until the end of our study period.

           While other networks (e.g., ARPANET, EDUNET, USENET, CSNET) existed at the

same time, Bitnet is most suitable for the purposes of our study for a number of reasons. First,

rather than being narrowly focused in areas such as defense or computer science like some of the

other networks, Bitnet was made available to all scholars; it was consequently adopted more

widely than any other network at the time, allowing us to explore how adoption changed

collaboration patterns across a diverse set of institutions. Second, Bitnet adoption was carefully

documented; data exist on the exact date of adoption for every institution in the network through

1990. This is not the case for other networks. Third, the ability of Bitnet users to exchange data

through file transfer protocols as opposed to certain other networks that only allowed bulletin

board postings and text messages offers insight into collaboration in fields that particularly

benefit from data sharing, such as electrical engineering.

                                                     III. Data

We use a variety of data sources to examine collaboration between institution-pairs across

universities in top electrical engineering journals from 1981 to 1991. We describe each of our

main data sources below and provide descriptive statistics in Table 1.

Publication Data Since we are interested in identifying the effect of Bitnet on collaboration, we

use publication data from researchers in technical areas that were likely to be early adopters of

this communications technology and thus closely reflect the time variation in adoption.

Specifically, we collect publication data (16,495 papers) from seven electrical engineering

journals over the 11-year period 1981-1991.7 Each of these journals is considered among the top

outlets for research in the specified field. Since we focus only on these seven journals, the total

number of publications in our analysis does not change systematically over time.8 This means

that we capture an overall change in multi-institution collaborations relative to single-institution

collaborations rather than simply an overall increase in research output.

         We extract the unique author-affiliated institution information from each paper and

categorize each paper as either single- or multi-institution (i.e., collaborative).9 We identify 720

unique institutions, of which 270 are US universities – our institution type of interest. These




7
  The journals are: 1) IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems, 2) IEEE Transactions on Nuclear
Science, 3) IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, 4) IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics, 5) IEEE
Transactions on Electron Devices, 6) IEEE Transactions on Communications, and 7) IEEE Transactions on
Education.
8
  There were a total of 1989 papers published in the first year of observation (1981) and 1401 papers published in
the last year (1991). The total number of publications fluctuates from year to year due to the publication of special
issues and occasional conference proceedings. The distribution of article quantity across journals also varies.
9
  Papers with multiple authors are still classified as single-institution if all authors are from the same university.




                                                                                                                    6
form the basis of our unit of analysis.10 Thus, our primary data set consists of 36,315 institution-

pairs over 11 years, resulting in a balanced panel with 399,465 observations.11

Bitnet Connection Data We use an online reference, Cyber Geography Research, for a record of

Bitnet connections.12, 13 Importantly, there is significant variation in these data. Although only

three institutions were connected in 1981, there were 66, 183, and 225 connected by 1984, 1987,

and 1990, respectively.

Quality Data Since we are interested in the way in which university research orientation (or

“quality”) mediates the effect of Bitnet adoption on collaboration propensity, we categorize each

university as being Tier 1 (high research orientation), Tier 2 (medium research orientation), or

Tier 3 (low research orientation). We define institution quality based on ranking by total

university-level NSF funding over four years prior to our sample (1977-1980).14 Thus, we

classify the 270 universities in our data into three tiers, with 90 universities in each. We ensure

robustness using a number of alternative definitions of institution quality in the appendix.15


10
   We focus on US universities because many of the international institutions and US non-university research labs
used networks other than Bitnet. Less than 1% of the connected institutions were for-profit
 (http://computing.dcu.ie/~humphrys/net.80s.html, Mark Humphrys, The Internet in the 1980s, Sept. 15, 2006).
11
   For Table 4, we also construct a single-institution dataset that includes the same 11 years of publishing from the
specified journals by the 270 institutions of interest. Therefore, this is a balanced panel dataset of 2970 observations.
12
   http://www.cybergeography.org/atlas/bitnet_topology.txt (Sept. 15, 2006).
13
   We use the year following the technical connection as the first year Bitnet was available at the university. In the
journals examined here, six months is a typical publication lag from manuscript submission to publication. All
results are robust to using the same year of adoption.
14
   http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/tab.do?dispatch=4 (October 2, 2006). In the appendix, we show that the results
are robust to including this NSF funding data (from 1981-1991) as a covariate in the regressions.
15
   We use three other definitions: 1) The first uses the 1987 Carnegie Foundation classification report that ranked
universities based on their research orientation. Tier 1 is an aggregate of the Carnegie Foundation’s categories
“Research University 1 and 2.” These institutions offer a full range of baccalaureate programs, are committed to
graduate education through the doctorate degree, and give high priority to research. From 1983 to 1985, they
received at least $12.5 million annually in federal support and awarded at least 50 Ph.D. degrees each year. Tier 2 is
an aggregate of the Carnegie Foundation’s categories “Doctorate-Granting Universities 1 and 2.” These institutions
offer a full range of baccalaureate programs, and their missions include at least some commitment to graduate
education through the doctorate degree, such that they award annually 20 or more Ph.D. degrees in at least one
discipline or 10 or more Ph.D. degrees in three or more disciplines; however, they do not meet the requirements for
Tier 1. All other universities are classified as Tier 3. 2) The second definition is based on publications in our seven
IEEE journals in the years prior to our study (1972-1979). We split these by quartile and group the bottom two


                                                                                                                       7
Distance Data In order to understand how distance between universities mediates the effect of

Bitnet adoption on their propensity to collaborate, we calculate the straight-line distance between

all possible pairs. We establish the location of each university’s primary research campus from

its official website and collect latitude and longitude data from the US Geological Survey based

on city-state information.16 We determine the distance between each university pair by

employing the great circle method.17




                                    IV. Empirical Strategy and Results

                        A. Did Bitnet facilitate collaboration across institutions?

Our estimation strategy is based on difference-in-differences identification. Using the paired

institution data, we examine changes in collaboration between institution-pairs that both adopted

Bitnet relative to pairs in which one or both did not adopt. We label the first institution in the pair

i, the second j, and the year t.

        We run linear regressions on the data using the following equation:

(1)     Collaborationijt=αXijt+βBoth Have Bitnetijt+μt+φij+εijt

where the key explanatory variable, Both Have Bitnetijt is a dummy that equals one if both

institution i and j have connected to Bitnet by year t.18 In addition, φij measures institution-pair

fixed effects, μt measures year fixed effects, and Xijt is a vector of observable institution-pair-

year characteristics. For this linear equation to identify the average effect of Bitnet adoption on

quartiles together. Those in the top quartile have at least 15 publications over this period. Those in the second
quartile have 3 to 14 publications. Those in the remaining two quartiles have two or fewer publications. The bottom
two quartiles are grouped together because the total number of publications for these two quartiles over the entire
data period (1972 to 1991) is similar. 3) The third definition uses the 1980 Gourman Report, which ranked the top
50 engineering departments in the US. We define all schools with a top-50 ranking as Tier 1 and all others as Tier 2.

   We also examine time since Bitnet adoption, the effect of which is most clearly illustrated in Figure 1.

collaboration between two given institutions, we implicitly assume that unobserved institution-

pair quality can be decomposed into an additively separable fixed component and a time-varying

component that is constant across institution-pairs (Athey and Stern, 2002).

         We treat Collaborationijt as a dummy variable for whether institutions i and j had any

collaborations in year t. We estimate equation (1) using a fixed effects linear probability (OLS)

regression with the fixed effects differenced out using average values.19 We treat collaboration as

a dummy variable because 78% of all institution-pair-years with at least one collaboration had

only one collaboration. Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors are clustered by institution

pair-Bitnet adoption status.

         The first column of Table 2 shows our baseline specification. We regress collaboration on

both universities in the pair being connected to Bitnet (Both have Bitnet), institution-pair fixed

effects, and year fixed effects.20 Collaborations increased by approximately 50% after both

universities in the pair were connected. This represents a significant increase in the propensity to

collaborate. However, as we will show in the following sections, Bitnet adoption had an even




19
   We focus on the linear results for three reasons. First, OLS allows coefficients to be easily compared across
models and interpreted. Second, linear regression allows for differencing out the mean fixed effects and using the
full data set. Third, while fixed effects logit and poisson regressions also allow differencing of mean effects,
nonlinear methods are not necessarily consistent when there is a large number of zeros in the dependent variable
(King and Zeng, 2001). The linear probability model is consistent and the estimated errors (with a heteroskedasticity
correction) are correct. Wooldridge (2002) argues that the primary concerns about the linear probability model
involve extreme values of the independent variables. He further argues that the case for using the linear probability
model instead of a nonlinear model is strongest when the variables of interest are discrete, as is the case here. Tables
A1 through A8 show robustness to numerous other specifications in modeling (i.e., fixed effects (FE) probit, FE
negative binomial, FE zero-inflated poisson, conditional FE poisson, conditional FE logit, and random effects
poisson) and covariate choices. The coefficient on Both Have Bitnet in the main specification in column (1) is
positive and significant with at least 95% confidence in each of these models. Moreover, the additional controls in
the regression appear to have boosted the significance of the coefficient of interest.
20
   A potential concern is that error terms are correlated across universities. For instance, if University A collaborates
with University B and University B collaborates with University C, then A may be systematically more likely to
collaborate with C. This could inflate the standard errors. To address this possibility, we identified all pairs in the
data where A collaborates with B at least once and B collaborates with C at least once. This allows us to identify all
pairs {A, C} in which the preceding concern may be relevant. We then take the extreme action of dropping all 2916
such pairs from the analysis. Table A9 shows that, if anything, statistical significance increases.


                                                                                                                       9
greater effect (more than double) on collaboration between certain types of institutions, namely

top tier-middle tier pairs that were co-located.

        First though, we provide evidence that our main findings are not likely to be a result of

omitted variables or Bitnet adoption endogeneity. For example, perhaps certain universities

shifted policy to increase their performance, which resulted in both Bitnet adoption and increased

research output. Or maybe certain universities recruited young new faculty who had a taste for

both electronic networking and collaboration. Or universities may have adopted Bitnet because

their collaborations were increasing.

        To address these concerns, we first add four covariates that control for observable

changes in department quality over time: 1) number of single-authored publications, 2) number

of electrical engineering doctorates awarded,21 3) number of electrical engineering postdoctoral

students,22 and 4) R&D expenditure in electrical engineering.23 We lag the latter three covariates

by one year to reflect the time between their input into research and publication. The second

column of Table 2 shows the results. The coefficient on Both have Bitnet is smaller in this

regression, indicating that these controls are explaining some of the variation, but the

relationship of interest is still statistically significant and economically important; the rate of

collaboration increased by approximately 40% if both institutions were connected. We include

these four controls in all subsequent specifications.

        Second, we add a control to examine whether only one of the schools in the pair adopting

Bitnet increased collaboration (Table 2 column 3). If so, this would imply that Bitnet adoption

was correlated with some other factor that influenced collaboration since both institutions needed

to be connected to utilize the network as a communication device. However, the coefficient on

One or more has adopted is not significant and the coefficient on Both have Bitnet remains

virtually unchanged. This finding is consistent with the assertion that Bitnet facilitated

collaboration by lowering communications costs between connected institutions.

        We also verify that the measured impact of Bitnet did not begin prior to adoption. If the

increase in collaborations is related to Bitnet adoption because second-tier schools were

improving in research and also investing in communications technology, then we would expect

to observe an increase in collaboration in the years preceding adoption. To explore this

possibility, we substitute the Both have Bitnet variable for a sequence of dummy variables for the

years before and after adoption. Figure 1 shows the predicted collaboration rates by year before

and after adoption. There was no significant increase in collaborations in the years preceding

Bitnet adoption. Collaboration rates began to rise in the year following adoption and then rose

substantially two and three years after adoption. They then remained at a higher rate.

        To fully dispel endogeneity concerns underlying the relationship between adoption and

collaboration, we would need a strong instrument that is correlated with adoption but not with

the propensity to collaborate. Unfortunately, such an instrument is unavailable here. In its

absence, we rely on the analyses described above that, in combination, suggest that our results

are not driven by spurious correlation. Furthermore, the thrust of our argument is that Bitnet

facilitated (rather than caused) an increase in cross-university collaboration. Researchers only

collaborate if they want to. Even if the researchers studied here influenced their university’s

decision to adopt Bitnet so they could collaborate, the network succeeded in facilitating this

collaboration.24


24
   Besides endogeneity, another potential concern is the low values for (‘within’) R2 in the regressions. Given the
large number of observations, the small number of explanatory variables, the linear probability model, and,


                                                                                                                11
                          B. Does the Bitnet Effect Vary with Institution Quality?

In addition to an overall rise in collaboration, a drop in communication costs might have led to a

change in the relative roles of institutions of different qualities in research production. To

explore this, we divide the university-pairs in our sample into six quality-type groups as

categorized by ranking total NSF grants received by each university over the four years

preceding our study: Tier 1-Tier 1, Tier 1-Tier2, Tier 1-Tier 3, Tier 2-Tier 2, Tier 2-Tier 3, and

Tier 3-Tier 3. Interestingly, only the coefficients on Tier 1-Tier 2 and Tier 2-Tier 2 pairs are

significantly positive (Table 3). Tier 1-Tier 2 pairs in particular showed a substantial increase in

collaboration rate after connection. For this sub-sample, both universities in the pair being

connected increased the likelihood of collaboration by 133%.25

         We next seek to better understand who benefits from collaboration between high-medium

pairs. We analyze single-institution level data to provide suggestive evidence that it is the

medium-ranked institutions that benefited most from top-medium-tier collaboration. These are

OLS regressions of total publications on HasBitnet, institution-specific covariates, year fixed

effects, and institution fixed effects (differenced out).26 Table 4 shows that Bitnet adoption is



especially, the differencing out of institution-pair fixed effects, we do not feel this is surprising. As shown in the
tables, the pair fixed effects do explain a substantial part of the variation in the data. Despite the low R2 values, our
estimates are statistically significant and economically important. Furthermore, the low R2 does not mean that
researchers choose collaborators randomly. It simply means that it is difficult to predict exactly which year a given
pair of institutions will collaborate. In Table A10, we show that we can explain a substantial fraction of the total
number of collaborations between pairs in our data set.
25
   Tables A11, A12, and A13 show the robustness of the quality result using the three alternative definitions for
quality described above.
26
   The qualitative results of this table do not change if fixed effect poisson regressions are used instead (Table A14).
In fact, the significance of the Tier 2 results increases. A linear model is used to be consistent with the rest of the
paper. For the regressions in Table 4 to identify the relationship between adoption and research production, we
assume that unobserved institution quality can be decomposed into an additively separable fixed component and a
time varying component that is constant across institutions. This assumption is questionable if Bitnet adoption is
associated with an unobserved quality improvement. For this reason, we are especially cautious in our interpretation
of the Table 4 results.


                                                                                                                     12
associated with an increase in total research output by middle-tier schools. This is not true of

high- and lower-tier schools.

        Overall, our results suggest the benefits of Bitnet adoption, measured by an increase in

publications, likely accrued primarily to medium-ranked schools (Table 4) due to collaboration

with top-ranked schools (Table 3). The reduction in communication costs associated with Bitnet

seems to have led to a broadening of the institutions participating in the production of high-

quality research, perhaps due to the benefits of specialization and gains from trade through cross-

university collaboration.



                             C. Does the Bitnet Effect Vary with Distance?

If the drop in communication costs did not have a uniform effect over distance on propensity to

collaborate, then distance, like quality, may have mediated the effect of Bitnet leading to a

change in the spatial distribution of collaboration. To explore this, we employ a spline

regression, grouping university pairs by the distance between them. Our results using all

institution-pairs (Table 5 column 1) suggest that overall Bitnet adoption was associated with

increases in both local and distant collaborations.27

      Splitting the data by pair quality provides important detail on how distance was related to

Bitnet adoption and collaboration. Columns 2 through 7 show that the greatest effect on multi-

institutional paper production occurred for co-located high-medium pairs. Medium-tier

universities also increased their collaboration with non-co-located top-tier universities, but the




27
  The coefficient on under 100km is not significant, but it is substantially larger in magnitude than all other
coefficients. Defining “local” more broadly as 250km leads to a large and significant coefficient (Table A15).


                                                                                                            13
effect of Bitnet was several times greater for those that were co-located.28 These findings suggest

that low-cost electronic communication, while perhaps a substitute for face-to-face interactions

under certain conditions, is also an effective complement, reinforcing other factors that lead to

agglomeration, including thicker labor markets and equipment indivisibilities.



                                                   V. Conclusions

Overall, these findings enhance our understanding of knowledge production. A sharp decrease in

collaboration costs amplified the role of middle-tier universities in the production of high-quality

research.29 In effect, Bitnet widened the circle of institutions participating in the national

innovation system.30 These findings offer meaningful insight since knowledge production

(“innovation”) is central to economic growth (Romer, 1990) and universities are an important

component of the innovation system (Nelson and Rosenberg, 1993). Universities, of course, are

not all the same; they are endowed with different levels of resources and different specialized

expertise. Our results are indicative of a profound shift in the knowledge production system,

perhaps because Bitnet facilitated gains from trade through specialization and collaboration.

         Due to the nature of our data, however, we are unable to comment on whether Bitnet

delivered an overall productivity increase. We have no data on inputs, and our output measure –

publications from a fixed set of journals – remains reasonably constant over time. To be clear,

what we observe is that Bitnet facilitated a change in the relative roles of certain types of

universities with respect to the production of high-quality research.


28
   Examples of collaborating, co-located, high-medium tier pairs include the Massachusetts Institute of Technology-
Northeastern University in Boston/Cambridge and the University of Pennsylvania-Drexel University in
Philadelphia.
29
   Our findings are consistent with a vertical specialization of tasks, in contrast to the “O-Ring” theory of production
in which workers match with other workers of equal quality (Kremer, 1993).
30
   Ira Fuchs, the founder of Bitnet, responded to these findings by stating that part of the raison d’être of Bitnet was
to “democratize connectivity” beyond the defense research community (personal interview, May 25, 2006).


                                                                                                                    14
        Moreover, institutions other than universities, such as those from the private sector, also

became more involved in the collaborative production of knowledge. For example, in 1981,

private firms did not contribute to the collaborative research output in our set of journals,

whereas they contributed to 7% and 12% of the collaborative papers in 1986 and 1991,

respectively. Thus, our findings only provide a partial picture of the evolution of knowledge

production.

        In terms of the implications of these findings outside electrical engineering, our identified

effect is not likely an isolated artifact of the specific fields examined here. For instance, Kim et

al (2006) report that in economics, the research productivity effect of being affiliated with an

elite institution was significant in the 1970s, weakened in the 1980s, and disappeared in the

1990s; the timing of this research dispersion in economics is consistent with our engineering

results.31 Furthermore, sociologists studying oceanography, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and

experimental biology have found that the correlation between high network users and high

productivity is greater for “peripheral” scientists (Hesse et al, 1993; Walsh and Bayma, 1996).

        The introduction of Bitnet was only one piece of an evolving US research infrastructure

in the latter half of the twentieth century. Policy initiatives set in motion by Vannevar Bush

(1945) to capitalize on the important role played by collaboration of university scientists in

WWII were still evolving during the period of our study. Perhaps of greatest relevance, a report

prepared for President Eisenhower (Seaborg, 1960) explicitly called for an increase in research

funding, especially for middle-tier research universities. This resulted in a decrease in the

fraction of federal funding for the ten largest research institutions, from 37% in 1958 to 20% by


31
   Hamermesh and Oster (1998) and Gaspar and Glaeser (1998) also examine the field of economics and provide
more general results that are consistent with our findings. Hamermesh and Oster show an increase in collaborative
research in economics from the 1970s to the 1990s, while Gaspar and Glaeser find a rapid growth in local
collaboration in economics since the 1960s.


                                                                                                              15
1990, with the preponderant share going to medium-tier universities (Geiger and Feller, 1995).

Still, the specific timing of changes in collaboration patterns identified here are so tightly tied to

the adoption of Bitnet that it seems probable the introduction of this communications technology

was instrumental in unlocking the potential of middle-tier universities, which may have been

nurtured for some time prior through increased funding and other policy initiatives.32

         Still, this research leaves an important open question: How do researchers choose their

collaborators? Effective research collaboration is predicated on familiarity, common knowledge,

and trust (Crane, 1965; Merton, 1973). As such, professor-student and student cohort

relationships may play a particularly important role in multi-institutional collaborations.33,34

Thus, Bitnet likely increased the role recruiting and migration patterns played in the architecture

of innovation systems. Furthermore, in other national settings where graduate student dispersion

patterns or the distribution of capital-intensive research equipment were markedly different, the

introduction of electronic networks may not have had the same effect. Alas, our data only set the

stage for asking such questions; we leave these puzzles for future research.



32
   Not only was Bitnet just one feature of the evolving US research infrastructure, it was also just one of many
communications-related innovations that gained widespread adoption during the 1980s. For example, TeX (used for
digital typography) and personal computers (such as Apple’s Macintosh) were other innovations that lowered the
cost of collaboration and gained broad adoption during that decade. Once again, though, we note that the specific
timing of changes in collaboration patterns identified here are so tightly tied to the adoption year of Bitnet that
although other innovations were surely important (and perhaps complementary) in facilitating collaboration, they
did not diminish the critical role played by Bitnet.
33
   Based on biographical information for researchers involved in a sub-sample (163) of the collaborations in our
study, Table A16 shows a significant fraction involved researchers who were previously at the same institution.
Interestingly, the majority of these had professor-student (or professor-post doc) relationships (as opposed to
professor-professor, for example) during the time they were at the same institution. Furthermore, although we
hesitate to draw any strong conclusions from this small sub-sample, it seems that “institution swapping” is a less
important part of the story for co-located collaborations (<100km) than for those separated by a greater distance.
Overall, these descriptive data suggest faculty moves and former students play an important role in generating inter-
institution collaborations across both quality types and distance.
34
   Professor-student collaborative relationships are particularly salient if research is paradigm shifting. Although his
study does not focus on collaborations per se, Weinberg (2006) shows that the interaction of prior geography
(having been co-located with an intellectual “leader” of a new paradigm) and vintage (being young in a field, such
as a graduate student) are strong predictors for making important contributions early in the life of a scientific
revolution.
