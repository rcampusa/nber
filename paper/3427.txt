1. Introduction


     Lagged ON? growth rates are poor forecasters of future ONP growth rates
in postwar US data and data from many other countries. A high ON? growth
rete today does not seem to signal lower growth rates in the future that
would bring the level of GN? hack towards a trend. This observation has led
many researchers to the conciusion that ONP is reughly a random walk.
However, other variables are much better forecasters of future ON? growth,
and this multivariare evidence ahnwa that ON? does in fact contain strong
mean-reverting or temporary components.


     The consumption/ON? ratio is the most important variable for long-run
ONP forecasts since it is stable over long periods of time, since it is
highly autocorrelated, and since consomptinn is neatly a random walk. ON?
deciines more than consumption in a recession, so the consumption/ON? ratio
riaes.   Viewing such a rise in the consumption/ON? ratio, one can forecast
that ON? must eventually rise again to reestablish the historical ratio.
Thus a change in the consumption/ON? ratio can be used to forecast long term
movements in ON? growth. Since consumptinn is nearly a rsndom wslk, ON? must
do mcst of the adjusting; the ratio forecasts long term ON? growth rather
than long tern consumption growth.      Its high autocorrelation means that the
consumption/ON? ratio can pick up long horizon movements in ON? that a more
chcppy right hand variable might miss.


     Roughly similar statements are true of labor income and stock prices.
Lagged labor income growth is a poor forecaster of future labor income
growth, and lagged returns are poor forecasters of future returns.          The
nnnsumption/lahor income ratio is a much better forecaster of labor income
growth, and the dividend/price ratio is a much better forecaster of returns.
Each implies much sore temporary variation than is suggested by univerlate
regress ions
     This paper documents this characterization of the data, extending the
results of Cochrane and Sbordone (1988), King, Pleaser, Stock and Watson
 (1989), snd especially lass (1990), and explores its implications for
measurements of the petsistenco of shocks to GHP, for methods of detrending
or "cyclically adjusting" GNP, for the cxcess smoothness of consumption found
in tests of the permanent income hypothesis, and for time-variation in
expected stock returns.


     Section 2 studies the persistence of shocks to GNP. This issua has been
the focus of a large body of empirical research (see Nelson and l'losser
(1982), Campbell and Msnkiw (2987) Clark (1987) ,     Cochrane    (1988) .   Cogley
(1990) among many others).    If CNP growth rates are not forecastable, then
shocks are permanent, so there is no "business cycle" to study,


     We will find two novelties in using iaultivariate information to study
the persistence of shocks to GNP. Fitst, with aevéral variables there are
several shocks, and these shocks contain more information than univariate
shocks. A univariete "shock to tN?' is a movement in CNP growth not forecast
by pest GNP growth.    But a aoltivariate shock to GNP is a movement in GNP
growth not forecast hy!past CNP growth and other variables, and thus contains
more informatian. Furthermote, CNP will generally respond to (muitivatiate)
shocks to othot variables as well as shocks to GNP, where we can only trace
its response to its own shocks in a univariate regression.


     I find that CNP behaves much like a random walk in its univariate
representation, but that GNP displays transitory variation in response to
multivariatm ahocks.      CNF's response to a consumption shock is partly
permanent but also partly temporary. Hare importantly, CNP's response to a
CEll' shock holding consumption coiistaoi is almost entirely transitory.      This
has a natural interptetation:     If consumption does out change, permanent
income must not have changed, so any such change in tHE' must be entirely
transitory.   Thus, by isolating tHE' shocks with no consumption change, the
multivariate system is better able to document temporary components in tHE'
than regressions of GM' growth on   lagged   GNP growth.1


     Second even if we arc only interested in the response of GNP to
univariate shocks, an estimate of that response formed from a regression ut
GM' growth on its own   pest   is different from an estimate formed by finding
the univariate GM' process implied by a regression of GNP growth on other
variables. This is a general proposition: a pth order vector autoregression
implies   different univariate       processes    than pth order univariate
autoregressions (Zellner and Palm (1978)).       But it is especially true when
the lagged conswsption/GNT ratio is a right hand variable.      The VAR imposes
that this ratio is stationary, so the permanent tomponent of CUE cannot vary
more than that of consumption. The VAR exploits this information to make an
improved estimate of CUP's long-run response to uoivariate shocks, and this
estimate shows more transitory variation than estimates besed on univariate
autoregressions -


     Section 3 examines implications of multivariate CUP forecasts for
detrending or "cyclically adjusting" CUP.        The linear trends of the GO's
hroke down with the "productivity slowdown" ef the JO's, and there has since
been much interest in estimating stothsstic trends for CUP.      This issue (in
part) originally motivated the literature on persistence and unit roots. A
good stochastic trend should not respond to business cycles (if they exist),
but should respond to long.tcrm fluctuations in CUP in a sensible way, to
allow definitions of cyclically adjusted budget deficits, or ratios of
monetary aggregatos to cyclically adjusted GNP.




1Cothrane and Shordone (1988) show that the permanent income hypothesis
implies that consumption and CUP are cointegrated and consumption is a random
walk, so one can measure the variance of the permanent component of CUP by
the variance of the permanent component of consumption, which is consumption
itself. Fama (1990) explores the permanent income story in detail and uses
it to interpret the response of CUP and investment to a consumption
("wealth") shock.  He suggests the use of consumption to measure the
pernanent component of income, and documents the imporrsnce for forecasting
CUP growth of the consumption/CUP ratio together with the observation that
consumption is nearly a random walk.
    As univariate and multivariate forecasts of CHP growth differ1
univarjate and multivariato estimates of stochastic rrends differ.          A
stochastic trend based on a uuivariate OfT? autoregression is essentially the
same as OFF itself, since that autoregression has little power to forecast
ON? growth. The multivariate estimate of a stochastic trend is very close to

consumption multiplied by the mean ONI'/consumption ratio.   Thus it responds
to long-term movements in ON? as consumption does, but moves little over
business cycles. It can also be interpreted as an instance of the permanent
income hypothesis: the multivariate trend in ON? is (approximately) permanent

income, as revealed by consumption.


     Section 4 examines implications fat "excess smoothness" rejections of
the permanent income hypothesis. The persistence of income shocks has hsd an
immediate economic application in this area.    If income really is a random
walk, as the univariate evidence suggests, then consumption changes should
equal income changes. Since the variance of consumption changes is a good
deal less than that of income changes, the permanent income hypothesis has
been rejected in favor of "excess smoothness" of consumption. (See Deaton
(1987). campbell and Deeton (1989), campbell and Mankiw (1989).        Flavin
(1988), Hansen, Roherds and Sargent (1990) and Quah (1990) criticize this
literature.)   Section 4 verifies this finding based on univariate labor
income regressions, but finds that the mean-reversion in labor income implied
by multivariate estimates easily explains the smoothness of consumption
growth.


     Section 5 uses the same techniques to examine time-variation in expected
stock returns, or equivalently, the existence of temporary components in
stock prices. Fama and French (1988a) and Foterba and Summers (1988) found
some evidence that lagged returns forecast future returns. Richardson (1990)
end others have argued that the apparent forecast power of lagged returns is
statistically insignificant. However Fame end French (1988b) find that other
variables, end the dividend/price ratio in particular, are strong and
statistically significant predictors of futute teturns. (See also Hodrtck
(1990) for a statistical investigaricn.)    Similarly, Oochrane and Sbordone
(1988) find that sultiveriete generalizations of Poterba and Sumrsers'
variance ratios that include dividends indicate much larger temporary
components in prices.


      I   find that prices and dividcnds behave much like CNP and consumptiod.
Returns have very little univariate     predictability, so       prices look like a
univariate    random walk. But prices diaplay very different responses to the
two ehocke one can define in a bivariate system. The response of prices (and
dividends) to a dividend shock is almost entirely permanent; the response of
prices to to a price shock holding dividends constant is entirely transitory,
while dividends show no response to this shock.


      This also has a natural interpretation.     A   shock to   dividends can come
with no change in discount rates, and hence no change in expected returns.
The shock to dividends has an entirely permanent effect on dividends.          (One
interpretation of this feature has managers setting dividends to "permanent
earnings", inducing a random walk just like permanent income consumers.)
Hence, the shock to dividends should and does have an entirely permanent
effect on prices. On the other hand, a shock to prices with no
contemporaneous change in dividends suggests a discount rate or risk premium
change.     This changes expected returns, and thus sets in motion expected
changes in prices.       Eventually, discount rates return to their mean and
prices return to their customary multiple n dividends, which were unaffected
by the discount rate shock.       Thus, by isolating discount rate changes as
shocks to prices with no change in dividends, the multivariate system is able
to   decument time variation in expected returns that is missed by regressions
of returns on lagged returns.




2. Measuring the persistence of CNP in postwar US data.


      Table 1 presents a vector autoregression of log CMI' end nondurable +
services    consumption growth on lagged log CMI' and consumption growth and the
lagged log consumption/ON?         ratio.   It also presents          a onivsriate
autoregression of ON? growth an lagged ON? growth. All the calculations that
follow are based on these regression ccefficients.2


       The VAR       includes      two lags of each variabi.e, while the univariate
autoregression includes four lags.               More lags do not change the qualitative
results, but just add wiggles to the impulse-response and spectral density
functions. Both regressions are generous by the usual specification tests,
for example the last lag is statistically insignificant.              I also experimented
with a variety of extra right hand variables including stock returns and
term and default premia. These variables significantly forecast GNP growth,
but they do not have much effect on the long-run impulse-response functions.
Like isore lags, extra variables basically just add wiggles to thc
impulse-responses at short horizons.


       Several features of the regressions in table I are noteworthy.                    The
multivariate CNP forecast is a good deal belier than the univariate forecast:
the lagged consuisption/CNP ratio is highly significant in the VAR                       CR?
forecasting equation, and the R2 of the VAR             CR? equation is higher than that
of the (longer) univariate autoregression. Consumption growth is slightly
predictable in the VAR,           but   with a much lower R2 than CR? growth.


       Fig. I presents impulse-response functions of the consumptton-CRP VAR,


2The VAR imposes that CNP and consumption are cointegrated, or,                 equivalently
that the log consumption/CR? ratio is stationary and does not contain a unit
root or random welk component.    Cochrane (1989) provides a critique of the
methodology in which one conducts tests for cointogratinn and then imposes
the results in subsequent analysis, which is why such tests are absent hero.
Plots of the consumption/CR?, consumption/labor income and dividend/price
ratios show that they do not have trends, and suggest that the essumption
that these ratios are stationary is not unreasonable.   (The same is not true
of all ratios, for example nondurables alone/CR?.) However, the whole point
of these ratios is that they are slowly mean-reverting, and hence can
forecast slowly mean-reverting behavior in CN? or stock prices. Hence, they
are likely to spuriously fail to reject a unit root test if one does not-
allow for ample serial correlation.

     All the left hand variables are one period growth rates. Hodrick (1990)
argues that this gives better statistical perfornance than aggregated left
hand variables that have been common in the mean reversion literature.

calculated from the regressions in table 1.         (The appendix details the
calculations.)     The VAR errors are orthogonalized with consumption first and
then income.       Equivalently, the instantaneous response of ON? to a
consumption shock is forced to zero. This is also equivalent to including
current ON? growth in the consumption growth regression! but not vice versa.3


     Several features of fig. 1 are noteworthy. First, the eventual response
of consumption is the same as that of ON? to each of the shocks,           This
results from the assumption that the consumption/ON? ratio is stationary, and
hence can be included on the right hand side.     If consumption and ON? ended
up with different responses to a shock1 the consumption/ON? ratio would not
be stationary.     Second, look at the responses of consumption and ON? to a
consumption shock. Consumption is almost a random walk: its impulse response
function is almost flat. ON? has an instantaneous response of about 2/3 the
consumption change; this rises to about 1 1/2 times the consumption response
after 4 quarters, and then declines to equal the consumption change by the
time 40 quarters have passed. Fama (1990) interprets this as the response of
investment to a wealth shock.     Third, look at the response to a ON? shock.
This is a shock to ON? that does not contemporaneously affect consumption.
It has only a very small eventual impact on consumption, hot ON? shows a
strong mean-reverting response to this shock.4    .4. shock to ON? that does not
change consumption must not have changed permanent incnrsn, and thus must be



3iinfortunstely, some identification assumption is always needed on VAR
errors, since the system can always be equivalently reexprnssed in terms of
new errors that are a nonsingular linear combination of old errors.
Blancherd and Qush (1989) explore an identification method in which the
long run response to one shock is forced to zero. As it turns out, the two
methods produce nearly the sara result, as the income shock here has
essentially no permanent component.

4The slightly positive long run response to the ON? shock ts not robust to
changes in specification. Slight changes in veriebles or sample period yield
smaller or even negative responses to this shock.   For example, if one uses
private ON? (ON? - government purchases of good and services, CITIBASE series
Oct82), the long run response to the ON? shock is -.5! In annual data, the
positive serial correlation of consumption disappears, so both consumption
responses are basioally flat, and its response to a ON? shock essentially 0
at all horizons.
temporary.


       Fig. 2 presents univariate impulse-response functions f or GM'.5 These
functions are estimated from the univariare autoregression of table 1 and
from the VAR.     the impulse-response function estimated froa the univariate
autoregression displays a good deal of persistence: in response to a unit
shock, CNP climbs to about 1.6 after a year, and then declines only to about
1.4.      The univariate irpulse-reaponse estimated from the VAR has quite
similar short run dynamics, but it displays much more mean reversion at long
horizons, ending up at about half its peak value.6


       Compare either of the univariote impulse-responses in fig. 2 to the
eu].tivariate impulse-responses in fig       1.   Clearly, whether shocks to GM' are
persistent or not depends crucially on the information set one uses to
forecast GM' growth.     If one observes consumption as well as GNP, one can
forecast that a shock to GM' which does not contemporaneously move
consumption will almost entirely disappear.           If one is restricted to only
observing GUI itself, shocks induce a nuch larger persistent component.


       Fig. 3 shows how the univariato Cli? dynaaics estimated from the VAR
differ from those implied by the univariace autoregression in the frequency
domain.      The long-horizon behavior of Cli? is reflected in the spectral
density at frequencies near zero, or long periods. (The appendix details the
connection between spectral donsitios at zero and impulse-response functions
as univariate measures of persistence.)           The VAil uses the information that
the spectral densities of consumption and CliP growth must be equal at


5The vertical scales of the univariate (fig. 2) and multivariate (fig. I)
impulse-responses are not comparable. Loosely, fig. 1 presents the responses
to one standard deviation shocks (unit shocks of the orthogonalized
representation); fig. 2 presents the responses to one percent shocks.           This
follows the conventions in the literature.
6The value of the long horizon response ia sensitive to variables and
samples.   For private GM', it is less than .5.   The basic pattern in which
the VAR indicates much more aean reversion than the univariate autoregression
is not sensitive,

3. "Detranding" or "cyclically adjusting" DDE


     Given a single time series, there are many ways to break it into "trend"
and "cyclical" components.   Different ON? forecssts will affect momt such
decompositions.     I will exaaine one attractive decomposition, due to
Beveridge and Nelsen (1981). This decomposition defines the stochastic rrend
in ON? as the level ON? will be after all transitory dynamics work themselves
out. Equivalently, the trend in ON? is ON? plus all expected future changes
in ON?.


     Precisely, Beveridge and Nelson decompose ON?     into a stochastic trend
   and a cyclical component 5

The trend is defined as

or, equivalently,

formulas for implementing (3.1) fron a VAR.)



7Watsen (1990) found a similar dip in the spectral density of output
estimated from a cointegrated VAR snd also the spectral density implied by
the King, Plosser, Stock and Watson (1989) model.       The contrast between
Watson's tesulta and univariate estimates of spectral densities implied by
the persistence literature inspired this section of this paper.

      Fig. 4 presents log ON? and the Beveridge-Nelaon stochastic trend,
estimated from the consumption-CM? VAR of table I.                (Precisely, the
conditional expectations Et in (3.1) are formed from ON? growth, consumption
growth and rho consumption/ON? ratio, using the VAR regression of table 1.)
This stochastic trend responds to long-run movements in ON? growth during the
70's and go'5, yet shows the traditional NEER business cycles as transitory
variations about that trend.


     If consumption were a pure random walk, the Beveridge-Nelson trend would
be exactly consumption plus the mean log CNP/consumption ratio. Fig. 4 also
plots this quantity, and shows thst it is almost the sane as the trend. This
provides a nice interpretation: consumption should be proportional to
permanent income, which is a natural measure ot the trend in actual income.
By using consumption, we are in essence using consumer's forecasts of income
growth to measure the trend.     The Beveridge-Nelson trend differs slightly
from consumption plus the mean ratio, as consumption data departs slightly
from the predictions of the permanent income hypothesis. Consumption growth
is slightly predictable,       and     the   trend calculations    exploit this
predictability to define the trend ss the level consumption will attain in
the future (plus the mean ratio) rather than its value today.


     Fig. 5 contrasts univariate and multivariate Beveridge-Nelson trends.
The "VAR trend" is the multivsriate trend from fig. 4.             For the "VAR
estimated" univariate trend,     is forued from current and lagged OFF growth,
using the univariate impulse-response function implied by the VAR,        In the
other univariate trend, E is formed from OFF growth, using the parameters of
the univariate autoregression.          Since the VAR estimated univariate
impulse-response displays mote mean-rewersion than the directly estimated
univariate impulse-response, the two trends are different.           Eveb if one
insists on using past ON? only to form a detrended OFF, the univariste
impulse-response estimated from the VAR shows the recessions of the SO's to
be transitory, while the directly estimated univariate impulse-response views
these movements in ON? as permanent.

4, "Excess smoothness" and the permanent intone hypothesis
                                                                                           (I

should equal income growth, Ac — Le5 —          w.
                                           A weaker implication is that the
variance of consumption growth should equal the variance of income growth.
As we have seen, income is nearly a rsndcrn walk based on univariate
autoregressions, but consumption varies a great deal less than incone. This
is the heart of "excess smnnthnese" of ccnaumption.                 Conversely, if one
assumes that income follows      a   stationary univariate process around a trend,
as   in Flavin (1981), one finds that consumption varies by more than it should
under the 8TH, which is the original        finding    of "excess sensitivity" (much
simplified).


      The observations on persistence of rho last sections suggest a
resolution of excess smoothness.          Estimates of long run impulse-responses
U) in multivoriate systems were ouch ooaller than univariate estimates.
Since A      1, this suggests that multivsriato estimates of p(A) might also be
lower than univariate estimates, so the predicted variance of consumption



                                           11
growth might be smaller.


     To address this question, I repeated the VAR              and univariate estimation
of Table I. using labor income in place of GNP.                 For labor income I used
personal disposable income less dividend, interest and rent income (CITIBASE
series GYP - CPRENJ   -    GPDIV   -
                                       CPINT)        converted to 1982 dollars using the
personal disposable income deflator (CYD82/CYD) -                 Table 2 presents the
results.   As before, the lagged consumption/income ratio is significant in
the incoms regression but not in the consumption regression. Labor income is
closer to a univariate random walk than GNP: the univariate regression of
income growth on two lags has an R2 of 0.000 with e p-value of A9.


     Figures 6, 7, and 8 present the impulse-response functions and spectral
densities, analogous to figures 1, 2, and 3 for CNP. These results present
an even more dramatic case than CNP. The bivariate impulse-response function
(fig, 6) shows that income and consumption have almost che same, and
completely permanent, response to a consumption shock.                  The response of
income to an income shock (with no contemporaneous consumption change) is
almost entirely transitory. The univariate impulse-response estimated from a
univariate autoregression (fig. 7) is sisost completely flat, as is the
spectral   density of        income      growth estimated from the univariate
autoregrcsmicn (fig. 8).      Based on univsriate information, labor income Is
slmust a perfect random walk. But the univariate impulse response (fig. 7)
sod spectral densities of income (fig. 8) estimated from the VAR                 show a
substantial mean reversion at long lags. This occurs because, although both
Income and consumption look like random walks in univsriste autoregressions,
the variance of income growth is about three times that of consumption
growth.    The long run movements in the two series must be equal, or the
consumption/income ratio would not be stable over time.


     To examine the excess smoothness puzzle, I estimated the variance of
revisions in permanent income, using the VAR forecasts of income, uoivariate
furecssts of income, and univsriste forecasts with the univariate process
implied by the VAR. The VAR for consumption and income can be rewritten in
orthugocalized moving average representation (see the appendix)

     Table 3 presents the results. Note that income growth has about twice
the standard deviation of consumption growth.                   Thus if income is a random
walk, consumption is in fact excessively smooth.                             Line 2 of the table
replicates this result: the income                 autoregression   implies that consumption
growth should have s standard deviation of 1,52%, compared to the actual
value of 0.58%.       However, when we estimate the parameters of the income
autoregression with the VAR in line 3, the predicted standard deviation of
consumption drops to 0.45%, less than the actual value.                        Similarly, when we
forecast income from the VAR system itself, line 1, the predicted standard
deviation of consumption is 0.65%.                 Tn either case, the evidence for excess

    income.


         These calculations are intended to illustrate the importance of
    multivariate rather than univariate forecasts of income and the forecaat
•   power of the legged consumption/income ratio in perticuler, using the rules
    of the game of recent permanent income studies. They ere not intended as a
    resolution of all the many puzzles confronting empirical implementations of
    the permanent income hypothesis.     In particular, I intentionally do not
    address the following issues


         1) Non-testability.   Hansen, Roberda and Sargent (1990) show that the
    present value part of the permanent income model is not testable. (The Euler
    equation prediction that consumption growth should not be forecastable im, of
    course, testable.)   If consumers really do only see past income in making
    consumption decisions,     or any other set of variables observed by
    econometricimns, then the model predicts an easily rejected stochastic
    singularity; equation (4.1) holds with no error. If consumers have access to
    variables not observed by the econometrician, and if there is a single
    nondurable consumption good, Hansen, Roberds and Sargent show that there is
    one testable restriction, namely that the present value of the change in
    forecasts of future income following a $1 consi.seption change should be $1.
    (This is a restriction on a regression of income on lagged consumption only.)
    Restrictions on other aspects of a VAR    income forecast are not robust to the
    possibility that agents posses superior information. Furthermore, they show
    that if nondurables are only one component of consumption, even that one
    restriction is not testable.




    9'this explanation is related to Quabs (1990). Qnah examined decompositions
    of a persistent univariare income process into components not observed by
    econometritians, but that agents could be imagined to observe, that would
    explain the relative variances of consumption and labor income.    Here,
    consumers are assumed to only see the income process, and the puzzle is
    resolved by noting that VAR estinstes of that process predict about the
    nbserved standard deviation of consueption.




                                         14
    2) Non-cointegration of consumption aod labor income.      The PIE model
predicts that consumption and labor income should not be cointegrated, and
hence that the consumprion/labcr income ratio contains a random walk.
(consumption should bc cointegrated with capital income).        Yet the VAR
imposes that labor income and consumption are cointegratod. The data suggest
the same: the consumption/labor incoae ratio is stable over time       as the
labor and capital shares of income ate stable over time.


    The prediction that consumption and labor income are not cointegrated
cones from rho linear technology adopted by the PIN.       No matter how much
capital consumers accumulate, this has no effect oo their labor income.    ln

growth models with nonlinear production functions, accumulating a large
amount of capital raises wage rates and hence links the level of consumption
(wealth) end labor income. This observation suggests that the instability of
the consumption/labor income ratio is not a serious prediction of the PIE,
which is meant as a local approximation.      (However, human capital may be
linearly accumulated, and the unskilled labor income/consumption ratio may
not be stable over time.    The oon-oointegration prediction may apply better
to this nonstandard inrerpretatiou of the variables.)


     3) Specification issues.       The model is in ncnseasnuslly adjusted
per-capita levels. I followed Caapboli and Mankiw (1989) in applying it to

seasonally adjusted logs.    The speciiicatiou above does not allow for time
aggregation, nonsmparable or nouquadcatic prefmronces, dursbilicy in goods,
and ignores growth. This 'resolution" also ignores the fact that ccnsunption
growth is forecastablo.


     4) who cares?      The PIE is tested as a complete general equilibrium
model.     It is no longer a "consumption function"--a small part oi a larger
model. Since the state of tho art in empirically oriented stochastic general
equilibrium models hae advanced beyond quadratic utility and linear
technology, why bother testing the PIN? (Cochrane (1990) makes this point in
detail,)

5. Mean reversion in stock returns


     Table 4 presents a VAR   of    dividends and prices (cumulated returns) and
a regression of returns on Lagged returns          The data are from the CRSP
value-weighted NYSE portfolio.        They are annuaL to avoid the seasonal in
dividends. More lags and other right hand variables (term premiuis, default
premium, interest rate) add more wiggles to the short-run impulse-response
functions, but again do not alter              the pattern of     the   long-run
impulse-response functions. The table and subsequent figures use the entire
tRSP sample, from 1927 to 1989.          Results using postwar data are quite
similar.


     The results in table 4 are similar to the previous results for CNP and

consumption.      The lagged dividend/price ratio significantly forecasts
returns, but nnt dividend growth. Dividends look a lot like a random walk,
as do returns when regressed only on lagged returns.       (In postwar data, the
dividend/price ratio forecasts both returns and dividend growth more
strongly.      The t statistics rise from 2.1 to 4.00, and 0.78 tn 2.71
respectively. However, the impulse-response functions are quite similar.)


     Fig. 9 and fig. 10 present multivariste and univmriate impulse-response
functions. Note the similarity of the multivsriate impulse-response (fig. 9)
to the consuaeption-GNP impulse-response in fig. 1. In response to a dividend
shock, prices and dividends move immediately to their Long run values.
However, a price shock with no movement in dividends is completaly
transitory.


    As I mentioned in the introduction, these results suggest s natural
interpretation.    A shock to dividends can occur with no effect on discount
rates, and hence no effect on expected returns. Since the shock to dividends
seems to have a persanent effect on dividends, it shouLd and does have a
persanent effect on prices. A pure shock to discount rates shouLd affect
prices and not earnings or dividends, as the price shock does in the VAR. A
shock tn discount rates changes expected returns, and thus induces future
temporary variation in    prices.     As discount rates cevert to their mean,

prices revert to their normal multiple of (unchanged) dividends.


     Fig. 10 presents univariate Impulse-response functions for stock prices.
One is directly estimated from the regression of returns on past returns,
while the other is implied from the VAR. In     contrast to rhe   ONE' regressions,
these look the same. Thus, both the VAR and univariate estimate show little
evidence for univariate mean reversion; evidence for mean reversion in prices
(or predictability in returns) comes when you isolate a discount rate ahock,
as a price shock with no movement in dividends.




6. Concluding Remarks


     Lagged growth rates of CNP, labor income and stock prices have little
forecast power for future growth rates, and imply little mean-reversion in
those variables.        Yet multiple regressions using the consumption/ON?.
consumption/labor income and dividend/price ratio imply much larger mean
reversion in ON?, labor income and stock prices.         Since these ratios are
stable, consumption and dividends provide informstion about the "trend" to
which ON?, labor income and stock prices most return.


     In part, the ratios indicate mean reversion because they produce higher

    in forecasting regressions.       But much more importantly, one can define
multiple shocks with multiple forecasting variables.       Thus, the response of
ON? to a ON? shock that holds consumption constant is almost entirely
transitory. ss the permanent income hypothesis suggests; stock prices have a
large transitory response to a shock to prices that holds dividends constant,
as a change in discount rates suggests.          On the other hsnd, shocks to
consumption and dividends    induce   permanent changes in 051', labor income and
prices. Since univariate shucka are a combination of the two multivariate
shocks,   they mask the underlying moan reversion.

     These    observations help to document the existence of temporary
components in ON? and stock prices, theyhelp to dcfine useful stochastic
trends,   and they indicate s resolution of the "excess smoothness" purole of

      I   conclude that if one is going to say that a variable is nearly a
random walk or that it displays some mean-revorsion it is crucially
important to say what information set one has in mind. It is quite possible
to find that a variable is nearly a random walk with respect to one
information sot (its own lags) but has large temporary variation with respect
to soother. Stable ratios (oonsumption/GNP, dividend/price) with near-random
walks are aonie of the most important other variables to consider for the
issue of long-run mean reversion.

      The a. give the response of the growth rate at t+j to a unit ahock at t.
Similarly, E,0a1 gives the response of the level of              to a unit shock at

      The series       may also be decomposed into a random walk and a purely
stationary component.       It turns out that no matter how one does this, the
innovation variance of the random walk component is the same, and equal to
the spectral density ac frequency 0 of dye.          Seth quantities are related to

In particular, the Zeveridge-Nelsou trend defined below is a random walk with
this innovation variance.      (See Cochraoe (1988) for a derivation


      Thus one nay equivalently characterize the persiatente of univariate
shocks to      by the behavior of the univariate impulse-response function at
high lags, the innovation variance of a random walk component, or the
spectral density of growth rates at frequency 0.           If ' follows a random
walk, the impulse-response fuocrien is one at all horizons and the spectral
density at zero is equal to its value at other frequencies.          Processes more

Mean-reverting processes have impulse response functions that fall, as
reverts following a shock, and spectral densities at zero lever than
elsewhere.                 In the halt that the level                       Is statinnaty, the
impulse-response               function fails all the          way back to zeto, and the spectral
density      of Ay is zero at frequency zero.


       The above generalizes naturally to multivariate systems.                                Far example,
when one variable ac1 is added, we write the joint Wold representation as

       ax = p +
where

                     ayt           =
       ax0
             —
                           ,                 = ax     -
                                                          Proj(Ax1IAx1 Ax2,.,
                     ac
and   A(L) is a matrix of lag polynomials.



       Now Et                  gives   the response of            (and nt+k) to unit shocks at t,
                      =    C(l)    measures the limiting value of this impulse-reaponse
and X7_0         C
function.        Including                  on the right hand side of the VAR imposes that
C(l) is singular, i.e. that the limiting responses of y and c to each shock
Ia the same.


2. VAR     estimation          and transformations,


A.   VAR



       I stmrted by estimating a cointegrated VAR in error-correction form,

             —   fi +                   +         4             + ,   ,. -e   fr)'(y l°tl> +

Table I presents estiioaLes of this VAR for consumption sod GNP. to vector

      A(L)ax — p3 + -o'x1 +                                                   = N                   (Al)

              —     Ay                           1pY
                                                         a—
                                           1

                    Act
    and A(L) is a matrix of lag polynomials.


    B. Impulse-Response function


         First I orthogonalized the error terms by Choleski decomposing the
    variance covariance matrix of the innovations, in the order consumption,
    income, other variables. This is equivalent to including current consumption
    growth in the income regression, so all contemporaneous correlation between
    the consumption and income errors in the Wold representation is assigned to
    the consumption shock. Precisely, I found a triangular matrix R such that

              —    E(f   fi) —

    Then we can define new errors

         Vt R1t                  E(vv) = R1RR'R1'        I

    Rewriting the VAR (A.l) in terms of these new errors,

         A(L)Axt —         +
                               lOtX ff Ri         E(VtV!) —      I
         To find the implied Wold moving average or VAR impulse-response
    -function, I simu]ared the response of the VAR to the Vt: shocks without the
    constants and starting from initial conditions
                  — 0.
                       ct_i — 0.    Ayt.       0, Ace.       0

    This leads to the representation

         Ax p + D(L)e.                                                     (A.2)

    The elements of 0(L) are the impulse-response functions plotted in Fig.s 1, 6
    and 9.



    C. Spectral density


         I constructed spectral densities of GNF and consumption growth from
—   (A.2)by




                                                   25
                                                                                        (Al)


0. Implicd univariate impulse response


       To find the univariate impulse              response function for ON? implied by the
VAR,   I factored the spectral density of Ay5.                  Precisely, the first row of
(A.3) is

               —                       + D12(m)P12(z)
To find the Weld representation of Ay aod hence its univariate impulse
response, one must find a polynomial a(z) whose roots are all on or outside
the unit circle, and such that

       a(z)a(z) — D11(z)D11(zh + t12(z)D12(zH.
To do this, I found the roots of the right hand side numerically, selected
the roots outside the unit circle, and then constructed the polynomial a(z)
with those roots.          This polynomial a(L) is the univariate impulse-response
function.


E.   Beveridge-Nelsoo trend


       Writing e one-leg VAR (without means) in companion form, we obtain

                               -       0c                    Acti

                                                                                0
                              0 0 1 -- 0 -.

                                              [00001J     y11-c1
        xt             —                  B                   x t-1        +    c.
                                                                                 t

Where the fl's are CLS regression coefficients.                      Then we can calculate the
trecd from (3.1) as

           —
               y   + [ 0 1 0 0 J
                                   j —l
                                          B3 x =    [0   1 0 0 J B    (I-B)

I followed this procedure generalized to the number of lags in each VAR.
