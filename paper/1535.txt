                         Tariffs vs. Quotas with
                           Endogenous Quality

                                 ABSTRACT




        This   paper   analyzes some aspects   of   tile   effects of trade     restric-
tions   (such as tariffs,    quotas and quality controls) and           their   desira-
 bility   when the quantity of the imported good is endogenous, and the
 foreign producer is a monopolist. It uses a fairly general model
 based on the work of Spence and Sheshinski.

      A crucial determinant of the direction of these effects is shown
to be the valuation of increments in quality by marginal consumers,
relative to that of all consumers on average. A way of comparing in-

finitesimal equivalent policies is developed and used to compare import
equivalent policies. For reasonable characterizations of demand —
tariffs are shown to dominate quotas on the basis of their revenue ef-
fects alone, while quotas are shown to dominate tariffs on the basis
of their quality effects alone. Also, quality controls are shown to
dominate both tariffs and quotas on the basis of revenue effects alone
for reasonable characterizations of demand. Some special cases are
also analyzed, including the case where demand is modelled along the
lines of Scori and cclv services of the good produced matter to
consumers.

                TARIFFS VS. QUOTAS JITh ENDOGENOLS QUALITY


                                  Introduction

     This paper   analyzes   some aspects of the effects of trade restric-
 tions   and their desirability when the quality of the imported good(s) is

 endogenous, and the foreign producer has market power.

     Typically, a firm   must   decide on the rnmiber of products produced

 and their qualities. By introducing many qualities a producer could

 target products to groups of consumers and make greater profits by doing

so. However, there are likely to be significant costs associated with

producing   many qualities,1 and to this extent the producer would want

to produce one product targeted to all consumers.

    This discussion suggests two aspects of a producer's choice of poten-

tial interest. The first relates to how the producer when faced with

diverse consumers chooses one good which is best suited to the group as

a whole, and how this aspect of his choice is affected by trade restric—

tions. The second relates to the pricing of a product line —— and the

effects of trade restrictions on such pricing policies. I will deal

with the first in this paper. The second is dealt with in a companion

paper. (See Krishna 0984).)

    Existing work in the trade literature on the effects of trade restric-

tions with endogenous quality focuses mainly on the nature of these effects
in a competitive world. The specifications of the models are therefore
particularly   suited to the perfectly competitive paradigm. Unfortunately,

they also tend to obscure some significant aspects of firm behavior in

an imperfectly competitive world.

       Previous srk by IDdriguez (1980) and Santoni and Van Cott     (1980),
for example, deals with these questions in the context of a specific

model (associated with Swan (1970)), where demand is for services of the

good only, and higher quality goods are more durable.       This specifica-

tion simplifies the analysis considerably. As only the quantity of ser-

vices matters to the constmier, questions regarding the composition of

the product line, or those regarding targeting products to groups of

consters do not arIse at all! ly one quality is produced ——           that
which minimizes the unit cost of producing services when the optimal

level of services is being    produced.   In their model, quotas cause

quality upgrading, while ad—valorem tariffs do not. Although this

accords well with empirical work (see Turner     (1983),   Feenstra (1982)),

their reason Is related to cost rather than demand conditions. An

alternative reason, based on demand conditions,emerges from my analy—

us. This reason is related to quality being chosen so that it is best

suited to all consumers who are served.

    Hence, it seems   fair   to argue that while the effects of trade restric-

tions with   endogenous quality have been studied, the issues are far from
well   understood, especially in the context of imperfectly competitive

markets.

    An advantage of the Swan model is that the comparison of various


policies can be made with the aid of a two—dimensional diagram. This

is not possible in a more general model. Hence, the techniques used

in this paper cannot be only diagramatic. In this paper) I develop a

simple way to compare various infinitesimal policies. These comparisons

 are illustrated using diagrams whenever possible.
                                   —3—


      In   the first part of this paper, I consider the effect of trade

restrictions when the market structure is that of foreign monopoly, and

only one quality is produced —— so     that the product    must be targeted to

all   consumers. Quality is modeled in a general way as a factor that

ratses     the willingness to pay for a unit ——   as   in Spence (1976) and
Sheshinski (1976). In contrast to the results obtained using the Swan
specification (which is a special case of this specification), quotas
do not necessarily raise qualities and tariffs do not leave the quality
of imports unaffected. The effect on quality of a quantitative restric-
tion is shown to depend on the valuation of quality increments by the
marginal consumer as compared to the average valuation of quality incre-
ments by all consumers. If the marginal valuation of a quality incre-
ment exceeds the average, quality downgrading occurs as the result of
the   quota.    If the reverse is true, quality is upgraded in response to
the quota. The intuition behind this result is straightforward. A bind-
ing quota removes the marginal consumer from the market. If this consumer
valued quality less (more) than the average consumer, the benefit to the
monopolist of raising quality exceeds (falls short of) the cost of raising
quality     and it is in the monopolist's interest to raise (lower) quality.

      Similarly, the effect of a minimum quality level is to raise

(lower) output, if the valuation of an increment in quality by the

marginal conser exceeds (falls short of) that of the average.

      An ad—valorem tariff affects the monopolist's decision on both out-

put and quality and this couplicates the result. If the valuation of an

increment in quality by the marginal conser is more than the average,

quality is downgraded, but the reverse is no longer true.

       In   the second section the effect on welfare of any restriction is
decomposed into its components namely that via output, quality, and revenue.
Irrespective of whether quotas raise or lower quality their welfare effects
via quality alone are shown to be beneficial. When import equivalent
policies are compared, the ranking of policies is shown to depend on
whether quotas raise or lower quality and on whether tariffs lower the
volume of imports or not. In the "normal" case, when quotas raise quality
and tariffs lower imports, tariffs dominate quotas on the basis of their
quality effects alone, while quotas dominate tariffs on the basis of their
revenue effects alone. It is also shown that quality controls dominate
both tariffs and quotas on the basis of quality effects alone, as long as
a tariff reduces imports.

       Other definitions of equivalence — such as revenue equivalence or

expenditure    equivalence can also be   dealt   with in my framework, and they
lead   to similar results.   Their analysis is omitted in the interests of
brevity.

                      The Effects      of Trade iestrictions


        The analysis In this paper is confined to a partial equi1ibrim

setting. There Is one foreign producer of the product, who acts as a

monopolist. The producer          is assumed     to    set a price, and a -
quality    level (or equivalently, an output and quality level) which               the
consumer    takes as given. c.iality Is modelled as a uni—dimensional

variable,     q •    In   order to focus on the role of demand conditions in

this    paper, I assume that there is a constant marginal cost, C(q) ,                  of
roducing     a unit of output of quality q •                 x   is total demand. The

inverse demand function facing the producer Is given by P(x,q)

Pq(x,q) Is assumed positive. c.iality is thus modelled in a general

way, as a factor that increases the willingness to pay for any given

output level.2

        The monopolist's choice of x and q will be given by the solution

to the profit maximizing problem:


(1.1)                  Max   fl(x,q)     (P(x,q) —     C(q))x
                       x,q


        Assume that a unique interior solution exists to this problem.

Then, first order conditions for a maximum require that:


(1.2)               fl(x,q) —    P(x,q)x    +   P(x,q)   — C(q) — 0

and

(1.3)                                       —            0

                                 {Pq(x,q)       Cq]X
                                               —0—
       The second order conditions for a maximum are given by the Hessian

                                                 xq                            —
                                                                                       11          12
(1.4)      "H"                                                             i
                                                                                                  H22
                  L(Pxq                        {qq Cqq)7}J                         Ln21



        The effect,   on quality, of a quantitative restriction may be

examined by reformulating             the problem set up in (1.1) as a maximization
problem subject to the constraint that x (                             .       Simple comparative

statics on q with respect to                           , evaluated at              —   x*   ,    would    indi-
cate    the effect of a "slightly             restrictive" quota. This procedure gives
the result that:
                                   —P
(1.5)                  —    —            xg
                                         —c
                      dx         (p           qq
                                                   )
                                   qq
                        x—x*



        This may be   easily interpreted with reference to Diagram 1.1.

Equation (1.2) gives the level of x that maximizes profits for each

given q •        The locus of such points                 is   traced out by x(q) in Diagram

1.1.     Similarly, equation (1.3) traces out the level of q that maxi-

mizes    profits for each given level of x .                          q(x)     is the locus of such


points. x*,q*         are given by the Intersection of x(q) and q(x)
                                         elements of the Hessian "H', are negative,
Notice that      as H11          H22 ,
the sign of the slopes of x(q) and q(x) at x*,q* are                                              the same as

 the sign of xq .          In     addition, as H > 0 ,                       x(q) Is            steeper    than

 q(x). The restriction on x essentially suspends equation (1.2),

replacing It by the veTtical line , x .                   Lowering    i   from    x thus
moves the equilibrium         in   the direction of the arrows in Diagrams l.1(a)
and    (b). This      raises quality if             < 0   and   lowers it if xq >

quality,    while Pq() is the valuation of an increment in quality by

the marginal consumer. The following interpretation of P                         (as given

by Spence) is illuminating in this context. In Spence's words:


        "xq is the change in Pq as one moves dow-n the slectruni of
        consumers ordered by their willignness to pay. If P    < 0
        the marginal value of quality falls as absolute willingness to
        pay falls. en this is true, the average value attached to
        quality exceeds the marginal consumers valuation."3


        Lowering output removes the marginal consumer from the market.

If the marginal consumer values quality less than the average value

attached to quality, it is in the interest of the monopolist to

raise (lower) quality, as shown by equation (l.5).

        The effects of minimum       quality   standards may     be   analyzed in an
identical fashion. The comparative statics calculations show that:


                                    dx
                                             —Px
                                               xq
(1.6)                                H
                                           (2PX + xPXX)


This    expression has the same          sign as xq .     If    1xq < 0 , as        rises,
x falls. This result may be interpreted as follows. The increase in

        kes serving    the marginal consumer less profitable as           he   does not
                                                —8—
value increments in q as highly as the average, and                             so   output falls

with increases in q

        Unlike the effects of a quota and             quality control,              which       in   effect

suspended one equation, an ad—valorem tariff affects the position of

both x(q) and q(x) .               The problem facing the producer is


                             Max    (P(x,q)(l—t)      —   C(q))x
(1.7)
                             x,q


Simple comparative statics yield:



(1.8)                      dx        (P    x + P)(P —       C        )x — P        x P x

Second order conditions ensure that if Pxq > 0 , dt < 0 .                                  If        P

                                                                                                          <0

the sign of            is indeterminate.


Similarly,

                                      x    xx   q              xq




Again,               > 0           < 0        and if xq < 0 ,            the       sign    of             is
ambiguous.         Diagrams 1.2(a) and (b) illustrate the effect of an increase

in t •       'E"    is the free trade equilibrium.                    A" is the equilibrii.nii

with a tariff. It is obvious from the diagram that at least one of


and
        dt   must     be negative if Pxq         < 0.


        The effects of a specific tariff are qualitatively the same as

those of a quota.          The specific tariff, a ,              has producers maximizing

profits given by:

(1.10)             fl(xq,s)       —   (P(xq)   — C(q) —   s)x

Doing the required comparative statics yields:



(1.11)                   dx
                                   (Pqq —cqq )x

                                  ds


so a specific tariff always lowers output. It raises quality if

while lowering it if P        >   0.
                       xq

      Raving derived the effects of different kinds of restrictions on

the quality and output choices of a monopolist, it is appropriate to

relate the results In this section to previous work in the area.

      Trade theorists, in discussing the effect of trade restrictions

on quality, have focused attention on models of perfect competition,

and on the demand characterization associated with Swan (1970). The

assmiption in such dels is that demand is essentially for services

produced by the goods, and higher quality goods have greater durability

and hence produce more services. As a result, the questions regarding

product lines and choice of characteristi's do not arise at all. ly

the quality that minimizes cost per—unit of services will be produced.

Quality choice is completely determined by cost conditions. This

characterization is somewhat unappealing as it asst.es that the quality

dimension cannot be used by the monopolist in his interests.

      An ad—'alor tariff does not affect this choice of quality, but a

quota does in the Swan model. The intuition behind this result is as
follows. The quota,
                                        — 10 —

when binding, can be thought of as having a shadow price associated with

it. The effect of raising q on cost per unit of a aervice is, to the

first order, equal to zero, as cost per unit of a service is ainimized.

However, an increase in q lowers the shadow price of the constraint,

as   it   makes   the   constraint less binding. Thus, on the margin, raising

q in response to a quota is profitable. Tariffs do not raise quality as

the cost minimization problem is unaffected by a tariff.5

      There are two advantages to using a re general framework.

First, it shows that the monopolist, with two characteristics to set

so as to maximize profits, will use both to extract as much surplus

fr constmers as possible. Any restriction changes the optimal mix

'between the use of the two, and how this mix       changes   depends on demand

characteristics as shown earlier.

      The second advantage of the approach is its generality. The

approach of Rodriguez (1979) and Santoni and Van Cott (1980) emerges

as a special case. Though they only consider the case of competition,

it is easy to extend omè of their results to the monopoly case, as is

done later.

      The results of this section are crucial to the analysis of the next

section. In the next section, tariffs, quotas and quality controls

which lead to an equal infintesimal reduction in imports are conpared.

     2.1 Preliminary Remarks:

          This section compares ad—valorem tariffs, quotas, and quality

controls that achieve a given slight reduction of imports. A few pre—

          I   will assume that any desired quality level can be ensured. It is

assumed that the administrative machinery can set both minimum and

rnaximum quality standards. In the same spirit, tariffs are zxt confined

to being positive. It is possible for a tariff to raise imports, and

decreases in physical imports may require subsidies.


     2.2 The Sale of Licenses:

          In order to be able to compare tariffs and quotas, it is necessary

to specify how          import     licenses are distributed, who          appropriates     the

rents, and what these rents are. This is easy in the case of corn—

petition,          where the difference between domestic            price       (as determined by

market supply with the quota and market demand), and the foreign price,

determines the level of rents. This difference is the price of a

license auctioned to competitive suppliers.

          In the case of foreign inopo1y, no foreign supply curve exists,

with or without any restrictions present. It is not                         obvious   how much

would b paid for a license, and what ensures that a license is used.
The     problem is     that   of   specifying how   the     sale of license affects the
                                          — 12 -


profit   maximization problem perceived by the monopolist. e inter-

pretation of the specification that follows is that the goverxent sets

a price for a license which is sold to foreign producers who               take   this

price as given and beyond their control. A license allows the foreign

producer to export one unit of a good of any quality it desires. Thus,

a license acts exactly like a specific tariff. If the government

wishes to set a quota at the level R ,               It   uld implement it by setting

the license price          such that the foreign monopolist chooses to sell

only R
      This   is   portrayed in DIagram         2.1(a) and (b). DIagram        2.1(a)
shows the optimal choice of x for a given q and                       2.1(b) depicts

the optimal choice of q for a given x •                    The former is characterized

by the familiar marginal cost equals marginal revenue condition. The

latter is characterized by the inverse demand function being                tangent    to

the cost function. These are implications of the first order conditions

for a maximum.       MR(x,q)     is the marginal revenue function corresponding

to the inverse demand function p(x, qf) •                  x   and qf are the profit

maximizing output and      quality     choices for the monopolist under       free
trade.

      When imports are restricted to be R , qR                 is the profit maximizing

quality choice for the monopolist as shown in Diagram                  2.1(b). If qR

is the   quality    choice, p(1,qR) Is the inverse demand function facing

the   monopolist    in Diagram        2.1(a)   ,   and    MR(x,qR) Is the corresponding

marginal revenue curve.          If   a license price of       L is set, the monopo-

list u1d wish to produce R .               Thus, the quota at level R can be
                                   - 13   -
implemented by setting a license price of pL •       R   is the profit maxi-

mizing choice of output on the part of the monopolist, given a license

price of L , his beliefs on how he can affect the price Pt and a
quality level of qR •    qR   is the profit maximizing quality choice when

output is R

     This assption on the beliefs of the foreign monopolist is not

the only possible assumption that could be made. The foreign firm might

believe   that it can influence the price of a license, in this case, the

relative strengths of the monopolist and the government would determine

what part of the rents were appropriated by the monopolist. If the

monopolist refused to purchase any licenses and the government wished to

have the quota level actually Imported, the only price it could change

for a license would be zero. All rents would accrue to the foreign

firms under this assumption. There are two     reasons   why I do not

choose to make this assumption. Firstly, the relative strength of a

government as compared to a firm make the assumption implausible.       In


addition, it is often argued that in practice, tariffs generate revenues

but quotas do not as licenses are rarely sold.     I compare tariffs and

quotas when the best case for quotas is made. I show that even on these

terms, revenue effects of a tariff tend to dominate those of a quota.

The assumption that quotas generate no revenues would needlessly bias

the welfare comparisons to follow in favor of tariffs.

     Once again, notice that under this assumption on the beliefs of the

monopolist, the revenue from the sale of licenses is identical to the

revenue from a specific tariff, s ,    that   lovers import. to the level
                                      — 14

of   the restriction. If fact, all the effects of the quota may be asso—

elated with those of the specific tariff, s, that implements the quota.


  2.3 Tariffs vs. iotas:

        In order to compare different kinds of restrictions, it is neces—

.ary to specify the national lfare function. I will assune that the

dand side      can be represented by a utility maximizing aggregate con—

stser    who has rights   on all profits generated by competitive domestic

producers of a numeraire good. The profits generated by production of

the imported good accrue to foreign nationals. The weight given to

revenue in the welfare function may be less than one if there were con-

siderable administrative costs of collecting the revenue, or if govern-

ment essentially wasted part of revenue raised. Similarly, if the

goverrnent cannot undertake policies in the national interest due to

revenue considerations, this weightmay exceed one. The national welfare

function, when the specific tariff "s" is levied is defined by:


(2.1)                 W(x,q,s) — {u(x,q)     —
                                                 P(x,q)x]   +   asx


"a" is the weight given to revenue raised in           the welfare function,
and is assumed to be non—negative. P(x,q) is the price paid by the
consumer for purchasing a unit of the goodof quality q •              sx   is the

revenue    earned by government from the scheme outlined above, where s

is   determined so as to cause the monopolist to sell only the desired

level of imports. Both x and q, of course, depend on s as well.

        The effect on national welfare of a unit decrease in the level of

imports from the free trade levels, caused by a quota may be decomposed
                                               — 15 —

into    three parts —   the     effect via output, the effect via quality, and

the effect via revenue. Define As as the specific tariff required to

lower imports by one unit. Then the change in ilfare due to a reduc—

tion of imports by one unit is given by:

                            Q

                                                                         3s


Using equation (1.11) and setting Ax                        —1 ,    yields:

                                                1R1

As the monopolist maximizes profits, -Px — (P — C).                                    Differentiating

(2.1), and using (1.9), (1.11), and (1.12) and evaluating welfare changes

about s =    0 allows equation (2.2) to be re—written as:

                                                             (xP )

               Q
                                               PqX)
                                                            qq          qq
                                                                             )x        P qq   — C )
                                                                                                 qq



This expression shows that there is always an adverse effect on welfare

via output of a quota. This is expected, as a monopolist produces too

little output for any given quality level, and a quota aggravates this

distortion.

        Less expected is the fact that as Pq is assumed to be monotonic

in output, there is always a beneficial effect on welfare via quality

and revenue. Notice that:6

If 'xq is positive, the average valuation of quality incrents

wuSt be below Pq , so that (2.5) is negative. Similarly, if P                                       Is


negative, (2.5) must             be positive. As Pqq —                   < 0 by second order
                                                                   Cqq
conditions, the second term in (2.4) is always positive. When xq <

the inopolist is producing too low a quality level (as /q >                                   0),   and a

quota raises quality, thus .raising welfare. If P                             >   0   ,   too high a

quality level is being produced (W/q< 0), and a quota lowers quality,

which again raises welfare.

         The effect on welfare, via revenue, Is always beneficial as

the sale of licenses transfers some of the monopolist's profits to the

national government.

            Now consider the effect on welfare of an import equivalent tariff,

        •     National welfare is given by:
  T

                                  W —   U(x,q)   —   P(x,q)x   + atP(x,q)x

Differentiating (2.4) gives:

where (1.8) can be used to define the import equivalent tariff rate,

            as   being:

         The effect on welfare via output of an import equivalent tariff and

quota are identical. The effect of the tariff on welfare via quality is

beneficial if P1q > 0 , as then the tariff lowers quality and, as

quality is at too high a level, this is beneficial. If P                        < 0

quality is Bet at too low a level, but the tariff may                   lower   it further,

atd the effect of a tariff on welfare via quality may                   be harmful. The
effect via revenue raises welfare if a positive tariff is required to

lower imports, while it lowers welfare if a 8ubsidy is required.

        Using (2.9) and (2.4) allows us to compare a quota to the import

equivalent tariff. The resulting expression is somewhat formidable.

Consider the sign of this where xq < 0 and                                 < 0        so that a quota

leads to quality upgrading and an ad—valorem tariff lowers imports, the

'norinal' case on the basis of casual empiricism. In this case, then the

above expression is positive and a comparison of a tariff and quota on

the basis of their effects on welfare via quality alone goes in favor

of quotas.         If P1q > 0 (which implies that                          < 0 )      or    .   > 0


(which implies Pzq < 0), the reverse is true.

             The intuition behind this is clear from Diagram 1.2(a) and (b).

Consider first the case where xq <                   0, portrayed in Diagram 1.2(a). A
quota    and an import equivalent tariff give rise to equilibrium points
such as C and A if.         -< 0       ,   and   C and A' if --           >0     .   As     the monopolist
sets    quality    too    low   when   P    <    0   and as C lies at
                                                                higher utility  a

level       than A, a quota      dominates a tariff in the normal case. If     > 0,


a   tariff     dominates a quota as A' lies above C. If xq > (Diagram 1.2(b)),
then    a    tariff dominates a quota as quality is set too high and C lies above A.

         !xpanding the terms       in   the second set of brackets in (2.10) gives

proposition   1: Comparisons between tariffs and              quotas   which   are   import

equivalent depends on the Importance of revenue raising in the national

welfare function as given by a , as well             as    on the nature of preferences

over output and quality. For the normal"               case    ( 0,       P     < 0) •     the

choice of policy depends only on the weight assigned by a to revenue

considerations in the national welfare function. If a is very large,

so that revenue considerations are of great importance, a tariff always

dominates a quota. If revenues are given a small enough weight in the

national welfare function, so that a is close to zero, then quotas

always dominate tariffs.


      Another special case allows us to focus on the role of P                        in

U —   P x are equal to zero. Hence, there is no effect on welfare,
                                                                   via

basis of revenue effects only. The revenue effects of a tariff in this

case are preferable to those of the quota as (2.12) reduces to:

  2.4     Tariffs vs. (iotas: A Special Case:

        Next consider the case where demand    is    for services of the good

produced. Higher quality is identified with greater durability, and

hence a greater quantity of embodied services. Rodriguez and Santoni

and Van Cott discuss how quotas and tariffs can be ranked in such a

m6del in the presence of conpetition.



        The assumption behind this specification is that utility is a func-

tion only of the amount of services provided. Thus, if S — xq             is the

level of services, we assume


                                U(x,q) —   T(xq)
Thus,

                         P(x,q) — q r'(xq) — qG(xq)


is the inverse demand function for the good of quality q .            Dividing   by

q gives G(xq) —
                      Pi)   ,   as the inverse demand function for services.

The monopolist maximizes:


                       [P(x,q)-C(q)]x -    [C(S) -   C()j
Thus, q is chosen independently of S, so as to minimize               C(q)

so that quality choice is independent of demand         conditions.   Notice that

as a consequence an ad—valorem tariff does not affect the choice of q

A quota, however, does affect the choice of q


For notational convenience ,     define w to be 2C' + SC. Notice that
w < o    as   a,r(S,g) < 0 by the second order conditions for a maximum.

o    that quality is upgraded due to a quota.


We know that the effect via quality on welfare of a quota is always

beneficial, and in this case, a tariff has no effect on welfare via

quality. Thus, their comparison in terms of their effects on welfare

via quality is given by:



                                      -       — (—x2C'q)                         >0

Thus, we have shown the following:


Proposition 3:      If demand for the good is derived from services produced

by the good and higher quality good produce more services, then if
  — 0    ,   so that revenue considerations are unimportant, a quota is pre-

ferable to an import equivalent tariff. If              is large, and revenue

considerations are of primary importance, a tariff is preferable to and

import equivalent quota. If both are equally important, and demand for

services is linear, a tariff is preferable to the import equivalent

quota. Notice that this is the opposite of the Rodriguez result

where   a quota was preferable to a tariff.

        This   concludes the comparison of tariffs and quotas which     are
import equivalent. We turn now to a comparison of each of these poli-

cies with import equivalent quality controls.


  2.5 Quality Controls vs. Tariffs and Quotas:

        Any comparison of a quality control with a tariff or a quota will

be naturally biased in favor of the tariff and quota, as these measures

generate revenue. Therefore, I will only compare them in their

effects on welfare via quality, denoted by         (MJq —

Notice that quality controls always raise welfare via their effect on

quality. Comparing a quality standard to a quota gives,


                                                                 (P   )x             (2P +xP     )

     In their effects on welfare via quality alone, quality standards

are superior to quotas. The intuition behind this result may be

understood by refering to Diagram 1.1. If xq < o                                 , higher   welfare

arises from higher q and higher x , given by the shaded region in

Diagram l.la. Similarly if xq > 0 , higher welfare arises fron lwer

q and higher x , given by the shaded region in Diagram l.lb. A quota
leading to a decrease in output of a unit leads to equilibrium at a

point like A. A quality control that lowers output by as much, leads

to equilibrium at point B. The welfare at B is always higher than that

at A.

        Next, I compare a tariff and the import equivalent quality control.

Again, only their effects on welfare via quality are compared. Note
                                                        —25—

that   we already have a result in the case where demand is only for ser—

vices provided. In this case, as                         tariff      do not affect quality choice,

and as the effect on welfare via quality of quality controls is always

beneficial, quality controls dominate tariffs in their effects on

welfare via quality.

       The comparison for the general case is made in equation (2.23

as        0 •        If    -      < 0 ,        so a tariff reduces output, a quality contilol

is required to reduce output, and a tariff is better than quality

control. Again, the intuition is apparent from Diagraxn 1.2. Consider

first the case where P                     <   0    and - < 0         ,   so that a tariff is required
                                      xq                  dt
to lower imports. It is easy                       to   see that the tariff shifts both x(q)

and q(x) towards the origin as in Diagram 1.2(a). A and B are achieved

by a tariff and a quality control that are import equivalent. As the

quality chosen by the monopolist is too low, and as B lies directly above

A, the quality control must dominate the tariff in its effect on welfare via

quality alone.            Siallarly, if . > 0 ,                     then a subsidy would be required
to lower output, and A' would be the equilibrii under the import
equivalent tariff. A' lies directly above B and thus the tariff would
                                           - 26   -


dominate the import equivalent quality control in terms of its effects
on welfare via quality. Similarly, if xq > 0                    as in Diagram   1.2(b),
the quality control dominates the tariff as A (the tariff point) lies

directly above B (the quality control point). As xq > 0                    the monopo-

list sets quality at too high a level, so that the comparison between A

and B on the basis of quality effects alone goes in favor of the quality

control.

       The results of thIs subsectIon may be smarIzed as follows:


Proposition 4: When         revenue   considerations are unimportant (a          0),

then   quality controls dominate Import equivalent quotas. In addition,

If   imports fall due to an ad—valorein tariff, they dominate import

equivalent tariffs as well.


       Quotas    are   widely   used in order to restrict trade. However, the
common feeling is that tariffs are a superior way of restricting trade.

If the quality aspect is supressed in the above framework, it is easy to

see that tariffs dominate quotas Ho.ever,                when quality aspects are in-
troduced,    a tendency enrges for quotas             to dominate tariffs on the basis
of   their quality effects, and        their ranking      depends on the importance of

such   effects,    relative to other effects. In          other words, quotas become
more desirable instn.ments, compared to tariffs, when their effects on

quality    are   taken into     account.   Similar     comparisons of policies which

are equivalent in terms of revenue or foreign exchange use can be

made with similar results.

                                       Conclusion

         Although the effects of trade restrictions with endogenous quality

 have been previously studied the specification of the structures to be

 analyzed have been particularly suited to the paradigm of perfect coin—

 pçtition.

         In an imperfectly competitive world, a large number of questions

 arise which do not have corresponding analogues in a competitive world.

 In order to study such question, it Is important to develop simple

 models to capture, possibly in Isolation, the factors which might be

 important in answering such questions. This paper Is to be viewed as an

 attempt at doing just this.

        The purpose of   this paper   was to analyze the effects of different

kinds of trade restriction on the quality chosen by a foreign monopolist,

and to examine the relative desirability of alternative policies in

attaining a given non—economic objective. The presumption (based on the

Swan model) that quotas raise quality while ad— Valorem tariffs leave

quality unaffected was shown to be unfounded. Moreover, their effects

were shown to depend on the valuation of quality increments by marginal as

compared to all consumers —     i.e.       to demand conditions rather than to cost

conditions as in the Swan model. Away tocompare "infinitesial" equivalent

powers was developed. The use         of   this technique showed that when import

equivalent policies were compared in terms of their quality effects, tariffs

were    dominated by quotas in the "normal"         case and not just   in   the Swan model.

In   the other cases (considered to be somewhat special) ,        it was shown that
these    rankings could be reversed.

          1 Advertising costs for example are often thought of as being fixed and

product       specific.
          2 The effects of trade restrictions and their comparisons are all
evaluated at the free trade levels throughout the paper. In addition,
in order to be able to simplify the analysis I assume throughout that
derivative of the Inverse demand function with respect to quality is a
monotonic function of output.

          4 As an example one might consider the following. There is a con—
tinuuin of consumers, indexed by e ,                     with   reservation price u(6,q).
All consumers purchase one unit of the commodity, or none. Consumers
are distributed by f(O). u8(8,q) > 0. Demand is then given by
l_F(O*(p,q)) , where 8* Indexes the marginal consumer. P(x,q)
represents the corresponding inverse demand function. !ssy calcula-
tions show that as expected, if high 0 consumers value increments In
quality more than low 8 ones, so that U9q > 0                                 then xq < 0 as:

                                               _u8q18*(P(x,q) ,q) ,q]
                               Pq(x) —             f(8*(P(x,q),q))
