                             THE DIFFUSION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES:
                        EVIDENCE FROM THE ELECTRIC UTILITY INDUSTRY

                                         ABSTRACT




       This paper investigates the effect of firm size and

ownership structure on technology adoption decisions,

using data on the electric utility industry.                    We argue

that traditional models of technology diffusion are sub-

ject to sample selectivity biases that may overstate the

effect   of    firm size on adoption probabilities.              By exten-

ding conventional hazard rate models to use information
on both adoption and non-adoption decisions, we differen-

tiate between firms' opportunities for adoption and their

underlying adoption propensities.                The results suggest
that large firms and investor-owned electric utilities

are likely         to   adopt new technologies earlier than their

smaller and publicly-owned counterparts.                  Moreover,    the

selection biases from conventional statistical models can
lead one      to    overstate size effects by       a   factor of two and
to   understate ownership structure and factor cost effects

by two to four times.

1.   Introduction
        Economists have long been interested           in under-


standing the determinants of technology diffusion across
firms    and industries.1         An important set of questions in

this area concerns "Schumpeterian" hypotheses of the

influence of competition and firm size on innovation.

Much of the theoretical and empirical work on process

technology diffusion suggests that firm size may play an
important role in decisions to adopt new technologies,

perhaps     as a       proxy for such factors such    as   risk aver-

sion,    participation in research and development activi-

ties, or economies of scale in using the innovation.

Recent empirical studies yield mixed results, however,                  on

the question of whether larger firms are more or less

innovative than are their smaller counterparts (see

Oster,      1982, Hannan and McDowell, 1984, and Levin, Levin,

and Meisel (hereafter LLM)          ,   1987).
        This paper uses data on steam-electric generating

technology        to    analyze patterns of process technology

diffusion across firms.             By restricting the study to the

electric utility industry, we abstract from competitive
and market structure effects:              virtually all firms

operate      as   local monopolies subject either to rate of

return regulation in the case             of   investor-owned utilities
                                                   most
(lOUs) or to other forms of control in the case of

government and cooperatively-owned utilities.2                This

allows us     to   focus the analysis on the role of firm size

and two other determinants of technology diffusion sug-

gested by the theoretical and empirical literature:
factor cost differences that influence the expected cost

savings from adopting an innovation and firms' ownership
structures.        The nature of our data also makes     it

possible for       us   to   distinguish between measured size
effects resulting only from differences in opportunities

to adopt and those           resulting from an underlying propen-

sity   to   adopt new technologies quickly.
       Two steam-electric generating technologies are

analyzed in the paper:           high pressure conventional units
(2400 pounds per square inch (psi)) and very high

pressure supercritical units (above 3206 psi).3               The 2400

psi technology was first introduced in 1953 and began to

       2
        The existence of de facto exclusive retail
franchises and rate-of-return regulation need not imply
that firms have no incentives to undertake cost-reducing
investments. For investor-owned utilities (bus),
regulatory lag provides strong incentives to invest in
cost saving technologies (Joskow, 1974). Other mecha-
nisms through which investment incentives may operate
include the threat of municipal condemnation (takeovers)
and the possibility of wholesale power transactions with
other utilities. All three of these mechanisms operated
during our sample period and were particularly prominent
during the l95Os and l960s, when most of the generating
units in our sample were planned.
        These technologies are discussed in Joskow and
Rose (1985).   We do not consider nuclear power techno-
logies; see Sommers (1980) for a study of nuclear power
technology choice.

diffuse fairly widely by 1958; the supercritical technol-

ogy was first introduced in 1957 but diffused much more

slowly.    We use data on 144 utilities that built steam

generating units between 1950 and 1980                   to   estimate the

determinants of firms' decisions                 to   adopt each of these

technologies.    Results from            a   broad range      of   statistical

specifications suggest that larger firms and investor-
owned utilities tend     to    adopt new technologies earlier

than do small firms and municipal or cooperative

utilities, conditional on equal factor prices.                       Our

finding of positive correlations between firm size and
the speed of technology adoption is similar to the

conclusions reached by Sommers (1980) with respect to
nuclear power, by Hannan and McDowell (1984) with respect

to   the banking industry,         and by many of the case studies

in Mansfield (1968) and Nasbeth and Ray                   (l974).       This

result stands in contrast           to       Oster's (1982) conclusion

that large firms were slower to adopt innovations in the

steel    industry and   to LLM's         (1987) conclusion that firm

size does not affect technology adoption by grocery

stores.

        We also find that controlling for differential

opportunities    to   adopt   is    critical to the results.               Large


        These studies do not, however, control for
differential adoption opportunities. As discussed at
greater length below, this may bias their results toward
estimating positive relationships even when no relation-
ship exists.
                                        4

firms have a higher probability of building a new genera-

ting unit of any kind         in a given year,    other things

equal.     Failing   to    account   for these higher building

probabilities leads one         to   overstate size effects on

adoption propensities by         a   factor of two and   to   under-
state the effects of ownership structure and potential

cost savings on adoption propensities for the 2400 psi

technology.
      The paper   is      structured as follows:     In the next

section we briefly discuss theoretical and empirical
models of interfirm technology diffusion.             Section    3

describes the particular innovations we study and the

factors likely    to      affect their diffusion.     Statistical
models of adoption decisions are developed and compared

in section 4 and estimates from these are reported in

section    5.   Conclusions are contained in the final

section.



2.   The Diffusion of New        Technoloies
      Theoretical models of technology diffusion have
attracted increasing attention in recent years; see

Stoneman (1986) and David (1986) for overviews.               Although
the specific predictions depend upon the assumptions and

focus of each model, a common Set of factors that should

influence the diffusion process tends            to emerge.    These

include expected cost savings from adopting the
innovation,      competitive conditions and technological
characteristics that affect the appropriability of gains,

and characteristics that influence the expected profit-

ability of the innovation or firms' "willingness to
innovate," such      as    economies   of scale or of   learning in

using the innovation, firm participation in complementary
R&D activity, and discount rates.            A diffusion path

typically   is    generated by assuming that the cost of

adopting the innovation declines through time.               Firms'

relative positions along this path are determined by

their characteristics:         firms with lower discount rates

will adopt before firms with higher discount rates,

larger firms will adopt sooner than smaller firms if
economies of scale are important, firms with high factor

costs will adopt innovations that increase input effi-

ciency earlier than will firms with low factor costs.

     Early theoretical work assumed that the costs and

benefits of the innovation were known.           More recent

papers have relaxed these assumptions and emphasized the
effects of uncertainty.          In these models diffusion paths

can be generated      as   uncertainty about the technology      is

resolved over time.         Adoption decisions are influenced by
firms' prior estimates of the mean and variance of the

innovation's returns,         their information updating proces-

ses and risk aversion, and the expected path of future

technological change.          These models suggest that more
                                         6


risk averse firms will be slower             to   adopt innovations,
that firms       may make mistakes      (adopt technologies that are

ex post unprofitable and fail to adopt those that are ex

post profitable), and that interfirm diffusion will be
slower when innovations are perceived to be riskier.

     Institutional characteristics also may play an

important role in determining the path of diffusion.                   Of

these,       the theoretical literature has been most concerned

with possible vintage or "history" effects induced by the
embodiment of technology         in    long-lived physical capital.
 As David (1986) notes, new technologies will be rela-

tively disadvantaged when they are embodied in indivisi-
ble capitat goods, particularly if capital costs of new

plant are high relative         to    the operating cost of existing

facilities.         Not only will this tend         to   slow the

diffusion of the new technology throughout the industry,

it also suggests that the pattern of technology diffusion

across firms will be dependent upon the history of

capital investment.           Firms that are equally likely to

adopt    a    new technology,   other things equal, may do so at

different times       if   their initial capital configurations

differ.        It seems misleading,      however,    to characterize

this as a difference in "innovativeness."

     In this study, we distinguish between early use of

technology that       is   observed only because opportunities

for adoption are more frequent and early use that
                                      7


reflects an early decision       to   employ   a   new technology.

In particular, large firms may adopt innovations sooner

for reasons that have little to do with technological

progressiveness, such    as    their more frequent capital

additions to replace old (retired) capacity or to meet               a


given growth rate in demand.5             We decompose the firm

size effect into a component that influences a firm's

opportunities to adopt an innovation and             a   component that
affects its decision    to    exercise an opportunity to

introduce the new technology.6            This explicit distinction




        Our notion of innovativeness is quite similar to
Mansfield's (1968, p. 172) argument that large firms
should be interpreted as being more progressive only if
"the difference in the speed of response between large
and small firms is greater than would be expected if a
large firm acted as if it were simply the sum of an
equivalent number of small, independent firms."
     An example may clarify our distinction. Compare two
utilities: a large firm with 1000 megawatts (Mw) of
capacity and a small firm with 100 Mw of capacity, each
growing at 10 percent per year. Assume that both will
use the new technology at the first available oppor-
tunity; that is, they are equally "innovative." If new
units come in 100 Mw increments, the large utility will
build a unit next year, while the small utility may not
build a new unit for 10 years. We attribute this gap to
differences in opportunities, not to differences in the
propensity to adopt new technologies.
     6
        Our decomposition also can be interpreted as
separating the factors that affect the probability of
observing a firm's adoption decision from those that
affect the adoption decision itself.  In this sense, the
decomposition is a correction for sample selection
biases.

differentiates our work from most previous empirical (and

theoretical) work on technology diffusion.7

        Finally,     a   number of factors that have received

relatively little theoretical         attention also may influ-
ence interfirm diffusion patterns.             These    include the

role of human capital investments and labor unions,

regulatory distortions of technology choices, and
deviations from pure profit-maximizing objectives (for

example,      by government-owned firms or non-profit enti-

ties).8       The predicted effects of these are context-

specific.       For example, some forms of regulation may

speed technology diffusion (Hannan and McDowell, 1984, on

banking regulation); others may retard           it    (Oster and
Quigley, 1977, on building codes).             Government ownership

might allow technology-oriented bureaucrats to adopt
innovations sooner than would         a   profit-maximizing manage-
ment;       in other cases, the insulation from profit-maximi-

zing pressures might permit management           to    lag in techno-

logy adoption (Wilson)

their dependence on specific assumptions about the nature

              (1982) captures this distinction by using
plants rather than firms as her unit of analysis. She
finds that steel plants owned by large firms tend to take
longer to adopt innovations than do plants owned by small
firms, other things equal.
        8
        A number of these issues are raised by Nelson and
Winter (1982) and Stoneman (1986).

of the technology and the industry,                   it is   useful to ask

whether there are any generalizations that can be drawn

from the empirical literature.              Empirical tests of
interfirm diffusion models have tended                     to focus   on

possible 'Schumpeterian' effects of firm size and market
structure on technology adoption decisions.                      Early
studies by Mansfield (1968), Romeo (1975), and some of

the case studies       in   Nasbeth and Ray (1974) find that

larger firns tend       to adopt    innovations sooner than do

their    smaller counterparts, although this relation                      is    not

universal.9        Much of the early literature was either

largely qualitative or susceptible                   to   considerable

statistical and methodological criticism, however.                              Many
of the statistical analyses suffer from selectivity

problems (e.g., Romeo, 1975, uses data only on adopting
firns    in his time-to-adoption analysis) or from pooling

across noncomparable innovations                or    industries (see the

interindustry analysis in Romeo, 1975, and Benvignati,
1982,    for examples).

        Recent work,    in an   effort     to    address some of these

concerns, has employed more sophisticated statistical
models of    the   diffusion process.            The results continue             to

be mixed,    suggesting that no simple generalizations may

apply    in all industries,        aster (1982) examines the

        For a number of innovations studied in Nasbeth
and Ray (1974), small firms lead large firms in techno-
logy adoption.

diffusion       of   the basic oxygen furnace (BOF) and continu-

ous casting in the relatively concentrated U.S. steel

industry.        She finds a negative effect of firm size on

adoption probabilities; large firms tend                to    adopt both
innovations later than do smaller firms, although the

effect    is    significant only for the BOF.            LLM (1987) find

negative effects of concentration on retail grocery
stores'      decisions    to    adopt optical scanner systems, but

positive effects of market share.                 They report some
evidence that the largest chains are not among the first

adopters, but their reliance on              a   dummy variable for

large   average store size instead of measuring firm size
makes   it     difficult   to    say much about firm size effects.
In contrast, Hannan and McDowell (1984) find strong

support for Schumpeterian models of innovation:                      they
conclude that the probability of adopting automated
teller machines (AIMs) rises with both firm size and

market concentration.             They also find significant

regulatory effects (ATM5 appear              to be   used    to   relax unit

banking and branching restrictions) and ownership effect
(banks owned by bank holding companies are more likely to

adopt AIMs)      .    Sommers (1980)    concludes that large

utilities and members of power pools are more likely                        to

try nuclear technologies, although he does not look
                                     11

explicitly at time       to   adoption and his econometric model
creates some interpretation problemsJ°

     We extend this body of empirical work in a number of

dimensions.   First, almost all of these studies mix

"innovativeness" effects with "opportunity" effects; we

explicitly differentiate between these.                  Second,    we

consider flexible forms for the time path of diffusion.

Much of the empirical work         to date      has assumed that the

"hazard rate,"     or   probability of adopting an innovation
conditional on not having already adopted                it,   is   constant

or nonotonically increasing through time after condition-

ing on utility characteristics.            Finally,      adding evidence
on the determinants of adoption decisions in the electric

utility industry may help economists              to   better understand

differential effects of factors like firm size across
industries.   To    accomplish this,       we    first must describe

how these factors are likely         to   influence the innovations

we study.




     10  Sommers uses a logit model to estimate the
choice between coal and nuclear technologies conditional
on building, but he uses only one observation per
utility: the first adoption (for adopters) or last non-
adoption (for non-adopters) decision.  Utility character-
istics are measured in the year of that decision,
implicitly assuming that characteristics that affect
adoption decisions vary through time but that the time
path of characteristics prior to the adoption decision is
irrelevant. These features make it difficult to compare
his results to those of other studies.

3.   Technological Innovation        in    Steam Electric Generating

Technology.      1950-1980

      In an earlier paper (Joskow and Rose,          1985), we

argued that technological advances in fossil-fueled

electricity generation over the past thirty years have
focused on improving the design thermal efficiency of

generating units by increasing their steam operating

pressures.       Increases in thermal efficiency reduce

operating costs by enabling utilities to generate more
electricity from       a   given amount of fuel.    Our 1985 study

identified two significant steam generating technologies

introduced after 1950:          high pressure subcritical units

operating   at     steam pressures around 2400 psi and very

high pressure supercritical units operating above 3206
psiJ'     These technologies are the focus of the present

analysis.
     The previous theoretical and empirical literature on

technology diffusion suggests         at    least five factors that

are likely    to    affect the pattern of inter-utility


     11
          At pressures
                       abve the critical level of 3206
psi, water heated to 706 F directly vaporizes to dry
steam.   Increasing steam pressure is one way to increase
design thermal efficiency. This admittedly is only one
dimension over which generating unit technology has been
improved, however. Others include higher steam tempera-
tures, the introduction of reheat cycles and multiple
bleed point preheat cycles, and larger unit sizes. In
our 1985 paper, we argue that technological progress in
thermal efficiency over the last 25 years has focused on
raising steam pressure conditions.   This emphasis is
maintained in our present study.
                                 13

adoption of these technologies.       These include:    the

expected cost savings, uncertainty over the distribution
of expected savings, utility size, utility ownership

structure, and time.12      We describe their anticipated

effects below.

     We expect the speed of adoption to be increasing in

average fuel costs.    At their introduction, both techno-

logies were expected   to   reduce operating Costs by

enhancing fuel efficiency.     While the design efficiency

gains were relatively modest (on the order of      2   to   5


percent), the significance of the ex ante cost savings

depended on the utility's expected cost of fuel over the
life of the generating unit.      These costs vary consider-

ably across utilities.13      For the 144 utilities in our

     12
         We ignore potential differences in the regula-
tory environment across IOIJs and focus instead on
differences in ownership structures.   Since municipal and
cooperative utilities are not regulated in the same sense
as are lOUs, any differences between the groups may
reflect both organizational and regulatory effects.   All
investor-owned utilities face essentially the same
general form of regulation. Within this general struc-
ture the regulatory environment of course varies over
time and space.  These differences are difficult to
characterize empirically, however, and we do not believe
that variables reflecting such differences are likely to
be correlated with the independent variables that we use.
It may be worthwhile to introduce measures of variations
in the competitive and regulatory environment in future
research. Absent this, our results should be interpreted
as measuring the influence of the observed factors in the
presence of regulated local monopoly markets.

         Transportation costs can account for a high
fraction of delivered coal costs, implying that locations
near high quality coal sources may face substantially
lower costs.

sample,      the ratio of highest to lowest average fuel cost

per million Btus was 325 percent                   in 1962   and 393 percent

in 1972.       Such differences in fuel costs                should contri-

bute   to    significant variation       itt       the relative attrac-

tiveness of the new technologies.
       Theoretical models suggest that greater uncertainty

about   a    technology's potential will lead                to   a   slower

diffusion path, all else equal.                    Although data are not
available      to   construct   a   direct test of the influence of

uncertainty on adoption patterns, some insight may be
gained by comparing diffusion paths across the two

technologies.         The 2400 psi units constitute                   a signi-

ficant improvement over pre-existing subcritical techno-

logy although they were not a major departure from that

technology; the supercritical units represent                          a   more

radical change from previous boiler technologies.14

This dichotomy suggests that the uncertainty surrounding

the ex ante costs and benefits                of    adopting the super-

critical technology        is   likely   to        have been considerably

larger than the uncertainty associated with adopting the
2400 psi subcritical technology.                    We would expect this to

shrink the adoption probabilities for the supercritical

technology and lead to          a   slower diffusion path.

        14
          Operating at supercritical pressures eliminates
the need for a substantial amount of equipment associated
with saturated ("wet") steam, but requires more advanced
materials and designs to handle the considerable increase
in steam pressure.

     The expected speed of diffusion also                is    dampened by
the embodiment of generating technology in very long-

lived capital equipment.             Capital costs of powerplants
are large relative to operating costs and plants are

designed      to   have useful lives of thirty years            or more.

As power plants age their utilization patterns typically

change,   moving from base load          to   cycling   to    peaking

operation.         Additions   of   new generating capacity are

driven primarily by increases in electrical load, rather

than by opportunities          to   replace existing capacity with

capacity that has significantly lower operating costs.15

Although both 2400 psi and supercritical technologies
were expected        to   lower the total cost of generating

electricity, neither promised sufficient savings                   to

warrant scrapping existing facilities and replacing them

with new generating units.16                 This will tend to slow

diffusion of both technologies and implies that we will

observe   a    utility's decision       to adopt   one of these



     15
              Obviously, generating capacity eventually                 is
retired, so that retirements have some effect on the
demand for additional capacity.  During our sample
period, however, capacity additions dwarf retirements.
For example in 1970, 28,000 megawatts (Mw) of new
generating capacity was added, while only 1,000 Mw was
retired.  Edison Electric Institute Statistical Yearbook
of the Electric Utility Industry/1983, page 12.
     16
         This is in sharp contrast to Oster's (1982)
finding on the economics of replacing existing steel
furnace technology with the basic oxygen furnace.

technologies only when the utility decides               to    add new
baseload capacity.17

        There are    a   number of channels through which firm
size might influence innovativeness.                First,    larger
utilities are more likely          to   have internal engineering,

design and maintenance staffs that are both interested                     in

and capable of adopting new technologies before substan-
tial experience has been gained with them (Joskow and

Rose,    1985).     Second,     larger utilities are likely to be

less averse to the risks of early adoption.                   For utili-

ties with a large portfolio of generating units, the

impact of    a    "mistake" on the cost of service and overall

profitability will be modest.18              Third,   if there are

economies that lead        to   lower costs when more plants of a

given technology are operated by             a   single firm, larger

        17
         We assume here and throughout the paper that a
utility's decision to add new baseload capacity is
independent of its technology choice.  This corresponds
to an assumption that utilities first decide their
schedule of additions, based primarily on demand growth
projections and unit retirement schedules, and then
decide what type of units to build to meet their addi-
tions schedule.   This assumption may not strictly hold;
if new technologies are scale-augmenting, technology
choice may have some effect on building schedules. Even
in this case, the increase in efficient size is unlikely
to be large relative to the size of the "average"
generating unit. We therefore maintain the independence
assumption as approximately correct, and believe that
accounting for potential correlations is unlikely to
yield additional insight.
        18
         If the cost impact is small relative to total
costs, regulators are less likely to notice or penalize                    a
utility in regulatory rate hearings.
                                       17

firms may find early adoption more attractive.                       We find

some evidence of this type of economy in our earlier work

(Joskow and Rose, 1985):            there appears to be modest

learning-by-doing that may lower construction costs as                           a

utility gains experience with              a   given technology.

Finally,     if   new technologies are scale augmenting, they

may be more attractive         to   larger utilities that can

economically add capacity           in large       chunks.19

        We also expect larger utilities to build new

generating units of any kind more frequently than do
smaller utilities,       ceteris paribus.                This will result

from the relationship between size, growth rates, and the

lumpiness of generating units.                 Thus, there may be a

natural numerical relationship between size and speed of

adoption that arises not from differences in the propen-

sity to adopt new technologies but instead from differ-
ences    in economic opportunities to add new capacity.                      As

a result,     failing   to   account for differential building

frequencies may induce         a positive         correlation between

firm size and the estimated speed                 of    adoption, even if
the true relation is a positive effect of size on the

probability of building but           no       effect of size on the

probability of adoption conditional on building.

Distinguishing between these two effects                    is   critical   to

the interpretation of the results.                     We are not aware of

        19
             But see note     16,   sura.

any other work that controls for the opportunity            to   adopt
as we    do here.

        Ownership structure may affect adoption probabili-
ties although the direction of the predicted effect is

ambiguous.     There are three types of utilities in our

sample:     investor-owned (private) utilities, government-
owned utilities (primarily municipal utilities) and

cooperatives (primarily rural electric cooperatives)
The largest group    is    the investor-owned utilities, which

are most likely to behave as profit-maximizing firms.20

Municipal utilities ("munis") and cooperatives ("coops")

may have objectives other than profit-maximization that
alter their behavior relative       to   that of investor-owned

utilities.     Munis and coops also appear     to be   less likely

to be involved in R&D activities:        73% of investor-owned

utilities belong to the Electric Power Research Institute

(EPRI), as compared to only 37% of munis and 32% of coops

(EPRI, 1987, p.l).        We expect most of these differences

to   lower innovation probabilities for munis      and coops.
There could be offsetting considerations, however.               If

government-owned utilities are more responsive         to   the


      20
         Regulatory lag and opportunities to make
wholesale transactions that are subject to relatively
loose regulatory constraints (Joskow and Schmalensee,
1983) provide incentives to adopt cost-saving techno-
logies.  Since new generating technologies tend to be
more capital-intensive than older generating tech-
nologies, rate of return regulation may provide addi-
tional incentives (Smith, 1974).
                                      19

interests of power plant engineers,            for example,   we might

expect greater pressures        to   adopt new technologies

(Joskow, 1976).   We expect this to be of potential

significance only for the largest government- or coopera-
tively-owned utilities.

     Finally,   the expected pattern of diffusion through

time is unlikely to be monotonic.             While much of the
literature posits constant or increasing hazard rates, we

expect that adoption probabilities will increase ini-

tially and then decline for both of our innovations.               The

technologies we explore co-exist in time with each other
and with older (lower pressure) technologies.               Although
the 2400 psi technology was developed before the super-

critical technology,   for a large part of the sample

period the 2400 psi and supercritical technologies
represent competing choices.21             This suggests that the

probability of adoption for 2400 psi units may decline
after some date as utilities decide to "skip" a genera-

tion of technology and move immediately to the newer

supercricical technology.        Declines      in the   adoption
probability for the supereritical technology are likely
to arise not from the development of more advanced


     21                 .   .
          A number of utilities reverted to older techno-
logies after building one or more units with the newer
technology.   For reasons discussed below, this result may
be expected for the supercritical technology.    Less
explicable is its occurrence for the 2400 psi technology.
                                      20

technologies but from unexpected problems with super-
critical units.          The development of substantial reliabil-

ity problems and unexpectedly high maintenance costs for

supercritical units during the mid-1970s appear               to   have

reduced      or   eliminated the expected savings from this

technology (Joskow and Rose, 1985, and Joskow and
Schmalensee, 1987).           Adoption probabilities for super-
critical technologies should have decreased after these

problems were realized.22
        In summary,      we expect adoption probabilities for

each of the two technologies considered in this paper                  to

be increasing in firm size and fuel costs.                The predicted

effect of ownership structure         is        ambiguous, although   it

seems    likely that the probability of adopting an innova-
tion will be higher for investor-owned utilities than it
is   for government and cooperatively owned utilities.

Finally,      we expect that adoption probabilities will vary

through time, initially rising             as    uncertainties about the

technology are resolved and costs decline and ultimately
falling as even newer technologies become available.


4.    Statistical Models of Technolozy Adoption
        The empirical literature has used a variety of

approaches        to   estimate models of technology diffusion.

        22
         One might expect this to increase the adoption
probability for 2400 technologies, although there is
little evidence of this in the data.
                                         21

We discuss below two of the most popular classes of

models with the assumptions implicit in their use.                        These

are models based on normal probability distributions,

including probit and Tobit analyses, and those based on
failure time       or   hazard rate specifications. We also

describe    a    statistical model of technology adoption that
we believe distinguishes firm size effects on "innova-

tiveness" from firm size effects on adoption oppor-

tunities better than have most previous models.
       Common     to    our paper and much of the literature on

technology diffusion         is   a focus on time to       transition or

first use of a new technology,            not on technology choice

      se.   In line with this, we characterize firms                 as

being either in the "no adoption" state, prior                  to   their

first use of the new technology,              or   in   the "adoption"

state, once the technology has been used and forever

after.23        This emphasis is appropriate if one is con-

cerned with how long          it takes   firms in an industry          to   try

a    new technology rather than with how long               it takes      firms

to    convert their entire production lines to the new

technology.        This approach seems of particular interest




     23
         As such, our paper belongs in the literature on
interfirm diffusion patterns; see Hannan and McDowell
(1984) and LLM (1987) for other recent examples of this
type of study.  Intrafirm diffusion patterns-- the
penetration of innovations within firms-- have been
subject to less empirical study.
                                               22

for industries such ss electric utilities,                        in which

technology          is    embodied in long-lived capital.24

     We    also assume         that     a    utility's probability of
adoption       is    related    to    its characteristics, such as size

and average fuel cost, as of some point in time; cross-

sectional differences                in these     characteristics drive the

differences          in    utility adoption dates.           Variations in

adoption rates through time are determined by forces
comnon    to    all utilities,          such as the number of other

firms adopting the technology,                    improvements in the

technology through time,                or   resolution of uncertainties

about the technology's costs and benefits.                        Using this

assumption, which typifies much of the empirical work                             in

this area, we work with models that specify the adoption

probability          as:     Pr(utility       i   adopting   at   time t) —   f
(X.,t), where X. are utility i's characteristics measured

at some time common to all utilities.



Normal probability models

     A number of studies have used                   a   normal probability
distribution to analyze the time until adoption for firms
or plants, measured from some initial                     date of



     24
         If capital is long-lived and operating costs are
low relative to capital costs, replacement of capacity is
likely to be slow even if firms are aware of technologi-
cal advances and prepared to adopt them as soon as it is
profitable to do so.
                                          23


availability.25          This model was implicit in early

studies that used OLS regressions               to   estimate the

determinants of interfirm differences in adoption dates

(c.f. Mansfield, 1968, and Romeo,               1975).          A significant

shortcoming in many early studies               is   the failure to

account for sample selection or censoring problems:

firms       that had not adopted the new technology by the end

of the sample period frequently were excluded from the

analysis (Romeo, 1975) or treated               as   never adopting.

These biases can be eliminated by including both adopters

and non-adopters in the sample and using                    a   Tobit model to

treat end-of-sample censoring on adoption dates; see
Oster (1982) for         a    study using this technique.
        A    second potential problem arises from the normal

distribution's range over              (-,÷).        Presumably      a tech-


nology cannot be adopted prior to some innovation date,

implying that the time until adoption                  is   distributed over

(0,   +)     ,   where time    is   set equal to     0 in the      year that

the technology first becomes available.                         The statistical

analysis could account for this either by treating the
distribution as a left-truncated normal or by transfor-

ming the model.          We find the latter course most appealing

and in our empirical work with the normal probability

model assume that the log of the time to adoption is

        25
         One could as easily measure time since adoption,
counting backward from the end-of-sample date (see Oster,
1982).
                                                         24

  distributed              as a   normal random variable, with right

  censoring at the end-of-sample date.26
          To derive the likelihood function based on this

  distributional assumption,                          define the set of exogenous

  variables that affect firn                           i's    adoption decision as                              X.,

  firm i's time until adoption                           as    t, and        the end-of-sample

  censoring date as                T.        We       also define X.
                                                                  —1
                                                                     =                -X.1        as    a

  normalization              to ease         the comparison between this model

  and the other models discussed below, where the time                                                           to

  adoption         is a      decreasing function of X.$                           and        fi        is       the

  paraneter vector from the normal probability model.
  Given these assumptions, the likelihood function                                                     is:

variations in adoption dates are attributable only                           to

variations in firms' characteristics                       (X).    The model

does,    however    assume that the "critical" level of                     X     n

above which firms choose to adopt the technology,

declines through time.               This can be seen most easily by

                                                                       is
recognizing that the expected time                    to    adoption

declining in      X:      E(t.X)            in        +     52    —   -X    +     5a2

This feature of the model              is   consistent with the assump-

tions    built into most theoretical models of technology

diffusion that the cost of adoption or perceived riski-
ness of the technology declines over time.



Hazard rate models
        A second class of models used to analyze technology

diffusion is based on failure time or hazard rate

specifications       (1-{annan       and McDowell, 1984, and LLM,

1987).        The hazard rate, h.(t)         ,
                                                 is   defined as the

probability that firm            i    will adopt an innovation at time

c    conditional on having not adopted the innovation before

t.      Because these models explicitly                   focus   on transition

probabilities, they seem particularly suited to study

patterns of technology adoption across firms.27



         27
         See Kalbfleisch and Prentice (1980) for descrip-
tions of failure time models and their applications.
Hazard rate models have been used extensively to model
unemployment dynamics; see Lancaster (1979) and Nickell
(1979) for early applications.
                                                     26

      Although particular distributional assumptions on
the hazard rate vary across applications, the models

share a common structure.                        The unconditional probability

that firm i will adopt the innovation at time t (the

density function)           is       equal to:


                                             t
(2)   fjt) =         h.(t)       exp(- 5         h.(r)dr)
                                            r=O


and the probability that firm                        i    will not adopt the

innovation prior           to    t    (the "survivor" function) is equal

to


                                        t
(2)   1   -   F(t)    -         exp(-5 h.(r)dr)
                                      r=O

To estimate this model,                 the form of the hazard rate must

be specified.             In principle, virtually any function that

satisfies the properties of                      a   conditional probability

could be used.            For concreteness, we consider two

specifications of the hazard rate.
      The proportional hazards model                          is   perhaps the most

widely used specification; in the diffusion literature,
LLM (1987) use this model to estimate the diffusion of

optical scanners among retail grocery stores.                               The

proportional hazards model assumes that the relative
hazard rates for two firms are constant through time,

allowing the hazard              to be       decomposed into separate firm
                                          27

and time components.             We can write this as       h(t) —
               where h0(t) specifies the evolution of the
h0(t)exp(Xj,
hazard rate over time and X.1 are fixed firm characteris-

tics.            The time component can be estimated non-para-

metrically (see LLM, 1987) or parametrically by assuming
some distribution for h0(t). Our estimates of the

proportional hazard model parameterize h0(t) using the
Weibull distribution:             h0(t)    at1.    Under this assump-

tion, the likelihood function for the data is:



                            N1

the parameters of the Weibull proportional hazards model.

 The adoption probability            is   increasing   in   X;     the

hazard rate will be monotonically increasing,                    decreasing
or constant through time as a is greater than, less than,

or equal to one.

        Alternatives       to    the proportional hazards model allow

the relative probabilities of adoption across firms                      to

change through time.             This can be accomplished either by

allowing time-varying firm characteristics to affect

adoption probabilities (see Hannan and McDowell, 1984) or
                                                            28

by interacting time and firm effects.28                                                         To allow us to

compare resuLts across different models, we choose the
latter approach.                     Je specify the hazard rate as follow-

ing    a    log-logistic distribution:

                                     a       -l                                             a
                       =                 e                                                      e
(5)        h.(t)               met                exp(X.)             /   (1       +                exp(X.)

where subscript                 e   denotes estimates from the log-logistic

hazard model.                 This specification allows                                     us      to estimate

the hazard as a function of the constant firm charac-

teristics          (X) used              to       estimate the Tobit and Weibull

diffusion models discussed above.                                         As in the Weibull

hazard model, the adoption probability                                                 is       increasing in
X..        The log-logistic specification implies a monotone

decreasing hazard rate if                              a      1       and      a       hazard that         is

initially increasing then decreasing for                                                    a       > 1.   This

latter characteristic                         is   particularly appealing for our
data.           The log-likelihood associated with this specifica-

tion       is:

Models conditional on building (double-censored models)

        All of the models described above assume that date

at   which utilities would choose                 to   adopt the new technol-

ogy    is    known and that the variables included in X affect

firms'       adoption decisions but not their adoption oppor-
tunities.              As described earlier, we think these assump-

tions       are unlikely to be satisfied either in our data set

or in most technology diffusion studies.29                              In parti-

cular, we expect large firms to build generating units
more    frequently than do small firms, generating spurious
correlations between firm size and adoption probabilities

in    the earlier models.

        This       is    illustrated   in   figure      1.       Denote the latent

(unobserved) adoption value for firm                         i   at time   t    by

A(X.,t).           Firm    i   will adopt the new technology               at    the

first       opportunity after A(X,t)                   A*, where A* is the

"critical" level required for adoption.                            Each time we

observe the utility building                 a    new unit we learn one of

two things.              Either the utility uses an old technology,


        29
         Similar assumptionsare implicit in many studies
of unemployment transitions, in which job offers are
assumed to arrive independently of variables included in
x.
                                        30

in which case we know A(X.,t)            < A*,       or the utility adopts

the new technology, in which case we know
                                                                A(Xt)
Censoring occurs when          a   utility does not build each year.
Let    t* be       the date at which A(X.,t)              A*.    We know that

t*    lies somewhere between the date of the last old unit

(t0)
     and the date of the first new unit
                                        (t1)

utilities that build frequently, the gap between    and
                                                 t0
   will tend to be small and    will be quite close to t*
                             t1
(see   t and t1 in figure 1). For utilities that build

infrequently, the gap between t0 and t1 may be large,

suggesting that t1 may greatly exceed t* (see t0 and t15
in figure 1).

       If we       have data on the units built before the

utility adopts the new technology,               as well as the date at

which the utility first uses the new technology, we can

correct this censoring bias by estimating adoption

probabilities conditional on building                     a   new unit.
Consider       a   panel data set with observations on each

utility over time.          For each year, we observe one of
three outcomes:          the utility builds          a    unit and adopts the
new technology, the utility builds               a       unit but does not

adopt the new technology, or the utility does not build




     30
         Since we are interested in time to first use,
not in technology choice per se, we only need to observe
building decisions until the first new technology unit is
constructed.

which utilities build but do not adopt the new technol-

ogy, N3 is the set of utility-year observations in which

utilities do not build any units, and N1 + N2 + N3   NT.

        We choose a probit specification to model building

probabilities for each utility and                          a   log-logistic hazard

specification                 to    model the evolution of the latent
                                              32
adoption probabilities.                            We assume, as discussed in

note    17,   that utilities' building decisions are

independent of their adoption decisions.                               This implies

        31
         After a utility builds a unit with the new
technology it is considered to be in the adoption state
for the rest of the sample.
        32
         Any of the other models could be used to model
the adoption probability; we choose the log-logistic
hazard because it is the most flexible of the models we
consider.

the subscript f denotes estimates from the full-maximum

likelihood,           double-censored model.

        Under the independence assumption, this likelihood

function         is   separable in the building and adoption

probabilities.33                 We can therefore estimate the para-

meters of the adoption decision by estimating the

probability of adoption conditional on building.                                                      In this

light,       the biases of the conventional adoption models


        33
         While the independence assumption may not be
strictly true, we believe it is approximately correct for
this industry and that little would be gained from the
complexity introduced by allowing for correlated errors.

discussed above arise from sample selection biases:
these models censor observations in which utilities

decide     to   build but not adopt the new technology.                   While
sophisticated applications                of    the conventional models

recognize that the adoption date for non-adopters                        is

right-censored       at   the end of the sample date,              the

applications generally fail                to    treat the left-censoring

that arises because         utiities' adoption decisions are not
observed until they build             a   new unit.34
        In the following section, we report results using

each of the four specifications we have developed:

Tobit, Weibull proportional hazards, log-logistic hazard,

and hazard models conditional                   on   building.   We expect the

first    three specifications to yield qualitatively similar

results,    although the magnitude and interpretation of the
coefficients will vary across the models, due primarily

to their different implicit assumptions on the evolution

of the hazard rate through time.                      The results from these
models indicate what our estimates would be if we used

the techniques common in the diffusion literature.                        We
are most interested in comparing these estimates to those

from the model that conditions on building decisions,

which we consider         to be   a   more correct specification for

          An equivalent statistical treatment for the bias
is to write the likelihood function as a left- and right-
censored hazard model, in which we observe tO and tl for
each utility, and estimate the likelihood function over
N:  IT Pr(tO < t*          ti).

our problem.    Differences between the first three sets of

results and those of the double censored problem will

provide information on the significance of the biases
introduced by assuming that adoption (or observation)

opportunities are randomly distributed across firms,

independently of variables that affect adoption probabil-
ities.    While estimates   of   the building probability are

not required   to   estimate the adoption parameters, we also
                                                 illus-
report results from building probit equations to
trate the influence of size on adoption opportunities.



5.   Data and Results

        The statistical models developed    in the   previous

section are estimated using data on the building deci-

sions    and technology choices of 144 electric utilities

over the 1950 through 1980 period.        In this section,      we

first describe the data used in the analysis and present

descriptive statistics on the patterns of technology

adoption in the industry.        We next report estimates of

adoption patterns for the 2400 psi technology and compare
 the results across different statistical specifications;

 the corresponding results for the supercritical techno-

 logy follow.  The section concludes by discussing what we

 learn from the various statistical models.



 Data and descriptive statistics
                                                 35

        Our data set Consists of information on                   a   census of

144 electric utilities that built one or more fossil-

fired steam turbine generating units between 1950 and

l98O.              For   these utilities, we collected information

on the date and technology type of all fossil-fuel steam

turbine capacity additions, firm size                    in   megawatts of

capacity, capac.ty growth rates, average fuel cost per
million Btus, and type of ownership (investor,                        municipal,

federal,       or cooperative).

        We define X,          the    set of exogenous variables that

affect    a    utility's adoption decision,              to   include four

variables:           firm size, type of ownership, average fuel

cost,    and (perhaps)             time.    To    allow for nonlinear

effects of firm size, we include both size and size-

squared       in    the equations.         The building equation models a

utility's decision             to    build zero versus one       or   more units

in a given year.              We    assume that Z, the set of variables

that influence           a   utility's building decision, includes
the utility's size, growth rate, ownership structure

(perhaps),         and time.         The model allows for nonlinear size

effects and time trends by including quadratic terms                         in

both utility size and time.



         Missing data forced us to exclude from the
sample three utilities that built coal-fired generating
units during this period.  The utilities included in the
sample constructed 1091 units between 1950 and 1980,
which comprise virtually all fossil-fired steam turbine
capacity added during the sample period.
                                                          36

         As discussed earlier,                       the adoption models are based

on   a   constant         X.    for each firm, raising the question of

when the characteristics should be measured.36                                      We

consider two dates:                       1960 and 1970 (due to data collec-

tion requirements, fuel prices are observed two years

after each of these dates).37                                  The first of these allows

us to measure firm characteristics part-way through the

diffusion process for the 2400 psi technology and before

the diffusion process really begins for the supercritical

technology.               If utilities are forward-looking, 1960 may

be too nyopic.                 We therefore consider 1970 as an alterna-

tive.         As   there        is no      strong theoretical basis for
choosing between these, we allow the data to decide which
is   more appropriate.

         Before presenting results from tightly parameterized

statistical models of the diffusion process                                    it   may be

instructive              to    examine some simple descriptive statistics

on the data.                  Table   1    reports means and standard devia-

tions     for the variables used in the statistical analysis.

As indicated, the 2400 psi technology had diffused quite

widely through the industry by 1980, with                                 93    utilities

(65 percent) adopting this technology by the end of the

         36              .                   .   .    .
                   Building
                  probabilities may be a function
                     .
                                                                                         of
constant or time-varying firm characteristics.
         The choice of dates is somewhat arbitrary; we
were influenced by data availability in selecting these
two candidates.

sample.        The supercritical technology achieved much more

limited diffusion, with only                39    utilities      (27   percent)
adopting the supercritical technology by 1980.
        This pattern      is    amplified        in   table 2, which reports

the distribution of technology type for the 1091 genera-

ting units included in our sample.                         The table highlights

the co-existence of both old and new technologies over

long periods:          units --tinue         to be         built using old lower

pressure technologies twenty or more years after newer

technologies have been introduced.                         The relative domi-

nance of different technologies does shift over time,
however.       The 2400 psi technology supplanted lower

pressure technologies           as    the modal choice by the mid-

l960s    and was itself superceded by the supercritical

technology during         the   early l970s.               As noted earlier,

however,       the 2400 psi technology re-emerged as the

leading technology during the last part of the 1970s,
most likely       in   response      to   increasing dissatisfaction
with the operating performance of supercritical units.

        The differences in the diffusion path of the 2400

psi and supercritical technologies may be illustrated
best by    a   graph of the diffusion paths.                    Figure   2   plots

nonparametric (Kaplan-Meier) estimates of the survivor
function for each of the two technologies (see

Kalbfleisch and Prentice, 1980).                      As    indicated by the

bottom curve, the probability of adopting the 2400 psi
                                          38

technology       is   quite   small until after 1956.        From 1957,

the hazard rate (which           is   proportional to the slope of

the curve) looks fairly constant and relatively large.

Although    it    flattens     somewhat in the mid-1970s, it

returns    to    the previous rate by the end of the period,

suggesting that continued penetration                of   the technology

through the remaining           34    percent of the utilities      is


likely.
     The picture          is quite     different for the supercritical

technology.           The hazard rates are small until the mid-

l960s,    increase substantially for           a 5   year period,      and

then decline again in the early l970s.                    Virtually no
utilities adopted this technology after 1975 and                  it     seems

likely that the technology will never penetrate much

beyond the       27    percent adoption level achieved by         l98O.
With these diffusion patterns in mind, we now turn to

parametric estimates of adoption probabilities, to
determine whether systematic differences across utilities

explain the positions of individual firms along the
diffusion curves.


Results for the 2400 psi technology

            future work, one might wish to modify the
likelihood function to allow the cumulative probability
of adopting this technology to asymptote over time to
some level considerably less than one.
                                       39

        In this section,      we first examine Tobit,      propor-
tional hazards, and log-logistic hazard estimates for the

diffusion       of   the 2400 psi technology.39    These allow our
results      to be    compared to those of other diffusion
studies, most of which use         a   variant of one of these
models.      After discussing these          .lts, we    examine
estimates from the hazard model conditional on building

to determine the extent of biases introduced by the

exclusion of adoption opportunity information from the

first    three models.

        Table    3   reports results from the first three models.
As discussed earlier,         the exogenous variables in the

models are utility size and its square,           the utility's

average fuel cost, ownership dummy variables for coops
and government-owned utilities, and time.               Because

specifications that measure utility size by 1970 capacity

outperform those that use 1960 measures           of    size, only the

former are reported.4°         The first three columns report

Tobit, Weibull proportional hazards, and log-logistic
hazards results using 1962 average fuel prices.               The

         All the likelihood functions used in this study
were programmed in Fortran and estimated using a maximum
likelihood routine based on the BHHH algorithm. We are
grateful to Hank Farber for providing us with the code
for his optimization routine.
        40
         The results using 1960 size measures are quite
similar, but the standard errors tend to be somewhat
larger and the fit of the equation somewhat poorer than
in the corresponding equations that use 1970 capacity.
                                     40

second three columns report similar specifications using

1972 average fuel prices.        Since the Tobit nfodel impli-

citly assumes    a   constant hazard through time, time        is   not

included in the Tobit specifications.

        The results are quite similar across all six

specifications.       Firm size has    a strong,     significant,

positive effect on adoption probabilities.              Larger firms
are likely to adopt the technology earlier than are

smaller firms, although there are diminishing returns               as

indicated by the negative coefficient on the size-squared

term.     The quadratic peaks   at    8,500 to 10,000 Mw of 1970

capacity, substantially above the sample mean of 1,900 Mw
but not beyond the sample size range.              This suggests that

for a few large utilities, size has a net negative effect

on adoption probabilities.       The estimated magnitude of

the size effect is virtually identical across the Tobit

and Weibuli specifications and            is   substantially larger   in

the log-logistic specification.

        Fuel prices appear to have some positive impact on

adoption probabilities, although the effect is statisti-

cally distinguishable from zero only in the hazard models
that use 1972 fuel prices.       The point estimates for coop

and government ownership suggest negative effects on

adoption probabilities, but these are imprecisely
measured and cannot be statistically distinguished from

zero.     Finally,   the hazard nodeis suggest that adoption
                                         41

probabilities initially rise through time.             The magnitude
of the time coefficient in the log-logistic specification

implies that the hazard diminishes within the sample

period, suggesting that the Weibull's restriction on              a

monotonic hazard should be rejected.

       To explore how much of the size effect in these

results might be due     to    differences in adoption oppor-

tunities, we next estimated          a model   of utilities'

building decisions.          Table   4   reports estimates from
probit models of the building equations.41            The results
indicate strong positive effects of size on building

probabilities, although the quadratic terms indicate that
the size effects peak sooner for the building models than

they do for the adoption models (between 1600 and 6000

Mw).    This implies that building probabilities decline

with size over part of the sample of utilities.              Capacity

growth rates also have substantial positive effects on

building probabilities.        Building probabilities rise

through time, but at     a    declining rate.     Finally,   coops
and munis appear to build less frequently than do

comparable investor-owned utilities, although the
estimated effect   is   fairly unstable and imprecise across

specifications.


       41
         The estimates assume serially uncorrelated
independent errors.  If these assumptions are violated--
for example, by negative serial correlation in the
errors--the reported standard errors will be inconsistent.
                                                    42

        These results suggest that                        at   least part of the firm

size effect in the adoption models may be due to differ-

ences    in the frequency of building, which translate into

differences in the frequency with which we observe

technology choices                  of   different types of firms.                  To treat

this possible source of bias, we re-estimate the adoption

probabilities using the full information structure of the

problem.          While    we       could    in    principle apply this tech-

nique to all three models,                        the    Tobit and Weibull model

impose restrictions on the time path of hazard rates that
more flexible models reject, so we apply this technique

only    to   the log-logistic hazard.                          This model      is    esti-

mated on      a    panel of annual data on each utility over the
1950 through 1980 period.

        Table      5    reports          adoption probabilities conditional
on building for            a    number of specifications of the 2400

psi technology log-logistic hazard.                              A    comparison of
table    5   with table             3    suggests quite substantive changes
from the simple adoption model results.                                   First,    the

estimated effect               of       firm size on adoption probabilities

is   halved.           While larger firms appear                     to   exercise their

opportunities to adopt the 2400 psi technology earlier
than    do   smaller firms, about half the effect of firm size

on the simple adoption probabilities can be attributed to

differential building rates.                            This suggests that models

that fail         to    account for systematic differences in
                                    43

adoption    or   observation opportunities may significantly
overstate size effects on innovativeness.              The quadratic
term suggests that size effects peak           in   the same range       as

estimated in table     3.

        Moreover, after treating this source of bias,             the

effects of the other factors in the adoption model become
much more pronounced.        Average fuel costs have       a    much

larger estimated effect on decisions to adopt the new

technology and can be easily bounded away from zero.
The ownership variables also have         a   significant effect in
the full maximum likelihood model.            Once differential

building rates are accounted for, government-owned and
cooperative utilities are less likely to adopt the 2400
psi technology than are investor-owned utilities.                  At
least    part of this effect may be due        to   the smaller

effect of firm size.        Since munis and coops tend to be
smaller than are investor-owned utilities, firm size may

have absorbed part of the ownership effects             in the

earlier results.      When the effect of firm size         is

reduced,    the differences among the ownership structures
becomes more apparent.



Results for the supercritical technology

        These same statistical models can be used          to    study
the determinants of adoption probabilities for the

supercritical technology.       As we    noted earlier,     the
                                       44

greater uncertainty surrounding this technology                       is   likely

to   have slowed its diffusion and the development of

substantial reliability problems with early supercritical

units appears to have almost halted its diffusion by the

end of the 1970s.         We are interested in exploring

whether these factors also affected which firms are most

likely   to    have adopted the technology.

       Table    6   presents results from both simple adoption

probability models and full maximum likelihood models.
In columns 1 through 3, we report Tobit, Weibull propor-

tional hazards, and log-logistic hazard results,                        using

1970 capacity and 1972 fuel prices.                          In general, these

results are much noisier than were those for the 2400 psi

technology.         Utility size has    a   slightly larger effect on

adoption probabilities for the supercritical technology,

although the estimates are within                a    standard deviation of

those for the 2400 psi technology.                    The quadratic in size

continues      to be   important and adoption probabilities

again peak in the 8,500        to   10,000 Mw range.                Adoption

probabilities rise through time             (a       >   1    in both Weibull

and log-logistic models), but eventually decline (in the

log-logistic results).         The time paths                 are statistically

indistinguishable from those for the 2400 psi technology,
but the point estimates suggest             a    somewhat slower

diffusion rate for supercritical units.                         The fuel price

and ownership variables have no clear effect in these
                                         45

equations; the point estimates are unstable and the
standard errors are enormous relative to the coeffi-

cients
      We report estimates for the full maximum likelihood

model in columns         4   and   5 of table 6.   Correcting for

building opportunities has much less impact on the
results for the supercritical technology than it had for

the 2400 psi technology.             The firm size effect remains

within   10   to   20   percent of the estimates from simple

adoption probability models and are substantially larger
than were the corrected size effects for the 2400 psi

technology.        The hazard rate rises more quickly in the

full maximum likelihood model,             though the difference in
the coefficient from the simple log-logistic model does
not appear statistically signficant.               The estimated

effects of fuel prices and ownership structures continue

to be unstable and very poorly identified.

      These results may be an artifact of the limited

number of utilities that adopt this technology over the

sample period (39 of 144).               With only one-quarter of the

sample ever adopting the technology, the data appear not
to   contain enough information           to   pin down distinctions

among the adopters and non-adopters.                 Alternatively, the

results may reflect the peculiarities of the supercriti-
cal technology itself.

6.   Conclusions

        The results presented in this paper provide strong

evidence that large firms tend to lead the electric

utility industry in adopting technological innovations.
For both of the new technologies we analyze,                 large   firms

were significantly more likely to be among the early

adopters.         There does, however,      appear   to be    an optimum

size with respect to encouraging the diffusion of

innovations:        for the very largest firms        in the industry,

increasing size reduces the probability of early adop-
tion.      Our results also suggest that Oster's (1982)

finding of    a    negative correlation between firm size and
innovativeness in the steel industry does not generalize
to all capital-intensive industries.

        Our results also suggest that ownership structure

can exert am important influence on immovative activity.

 Investor-owned utilities tended            to   adopt the 2400 psi

technology earlier than did their municipally-owned and

cooperatively-owned counterparts in the industry, leading
to   more rapid diffusion of the technology through the

industry.         This finding   is   consistent with the observa-

tion that investor-owned utilities also exhibit more

involvement in industry research and development activi-
ties and organizations.

        Finally,    our analysis provides strong evidence on

the need to control for differences in building
                                 47

opportunities when analyzing firms' decisions          to   adopt

technologies embodied in long-lived capital.            Inmost

cases, we expect to observe more frequent capacity

additions for larger firms     in an   industry.     This can lead

econometric results to overstate the correlation between

firm size and adoption probabilities.           Je propose a

methodology   to   correct this bias, and find that its

application   to   the 2400 psi technol    'r   reduces estimated

size effects by one-half.      Moreover, we find that the
effects of ownership structure and factor cost differen-

tials are larger and more precisely estimated after

controlling for the opportunity bias.           These results

suggest that future studies of technology diffusion, and
other studies that employ hazard rate analysis, may
benefit from application of this methodology.
