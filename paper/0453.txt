                     Disequilibrium Dynamics With
               Inventories and Anticipatory Price-Setting


                              ABSTRACT



     This paper studies the sequence of short-run quantity-constrained

equilibria of a model with a single storable output, labor and money.

The durability of output gives rise to inventory fluctuations which

influence the course of the equilibria attained.

     One special feature of interest is the assumption that prices are

not at the level which would equilibrate all markets if there were no

stochastic shocks to the economy.   With prices frozen at this level, the

nature of the realized shocks determines the type of disequilibrium realized

and the unintended component of inventory change.

     The analysis concentrates on two questions: What is the statistical

nature' of the process governing the real wage, output, employment and

inventories?   And is it possible to test this model against the alternative

hypothesis that prices are continually flexible even after the shocks

have disturbed the system?   We find that although these theories are similar

in their qualititive structure, tests can be developed.      We also show

how the frequencies of different types of quantity-constrained equilibria

vary with the stochastic specification.   This may shed some insight on why

it is commonly believed that some types 9f disequilibrium phenomena have

not been observed.

Introduction


     The microeconomic foundation of macroeconomics has two fairly well-

articulated paradigms.   The neo-classical paradigm maintains that "markets

are working":competitive behavior achieves a Pareto optimal outcome under

the guidance of the price system.    Authorities should interfere as little

as possible with this allocation mechanism as long as competitive behavior is

maintained.    The lack of future and contingent markets pointed out by some

has been overcome through the assumption of rational expectations.    The

Keynesian paradigm on the contrary maintains that "markets are not working".

Price rigidities, even with competitive behavior, lead to a misallocation of

resources which can be partially remedied by government interventions.      This

malfunctioning of the price system is explained by informational consider-

ations in the absence of a complete set of markets.    The Keynesian paradigm

has recently received an extreme formalization in the work of Barro and

Grossman [1971], Benassy [1975], Dr~ze [1975], Malinvaud [1977] and others,

through the theoretical construct of fixed-price equilibria.

     Although the assumption of fixed prices provides a reasonable ex-

planation of a number of short-run phenomena, such as the multiplier effect

or the accelerator principle, it is incomplete in that it fails to provide

a theory to determine the level at which prices are fixed.     The short-run

equilibria attained will be markedly affected by the mechanism used to

describe price formation.    Via this route, the dynAmics of macroeconomic

fluctuations are affected by the price change proc(-'ss as well.
                                          ,
     The basic assumption of this paper is an attempt to be specific about

price formation while retaining a fixed-price, qllantity-constrained equili-
bration in the short-run.    We assume that prices are.fixed at the beginning

of the period' at the level which would be the Halrasian· equilibrium i f all

random factors in the economy had their average levels.     We will refer to

this as anticipatory    pricing.   Thus there is a tendency toward market

clearing, but short-run disturbances continually keep it from being achieved.

     This assumption should be contrasted with that previously used in the

disequilibrium literature where measured excess demands were responsible for

price changes in the following period.     Anticipatory pricing has the advan-

tage of being simpler, especially in the analysis of the stochastic evolution

of the system.    Furthermore, as the empirical evidence does not provide'

support for the hypothesis that excess demand is a principal determinant of

price changes, we felt that it was necessary to explore an alternative. Our assumrt:ion is

somewhat intermediate between the Walrasian (flexible prices) and Keynesian

short-run     (fixed prices) models, and it has n certain "rational expectations"

flavor.*

     The second theme of this paper is the role of inventories in macro-

dynamics      a topic of long-recognized importance, but one which has not re-

ceived much    attention within the disequilibrium literature.** This is rather

ironic, as it is commonplace to assert that the role of such stocks is to

cushion the effects of unforeseen fluctuations in demands and supplies,

presumably those that are undesired at the prevailing prices.     We will



* It is not, however, a full "rational expectations" model because the
rational forecasts of future prices do not enter the current notional demand
curves. This will be discussed further in the next section.
**
   Blinder-Fischer (1979) have examined flexible price models with inven-
tories in which the rate of interest is a determinant of the desired level
of inventory stocks. They do not address the stochastic nature of the dynam-
ics explicity, whereas this is our principal focus. Blinder (977) has examined
a Keynesian model with inventories and a price dynamics that responds to
lagged excess demands. Muellbauer and Partes (1978) have a short-run quantity
constrained model with inventories based on explicit maximization by rational
agents. They derive the effective demand functions to which our specification
can be regarded as a first-order approximation. Although they have obtained
many short-run comparative statics results they have not linked the successive
quantity-constrained equilibria together in a dynamic analysis.

analyze how the level of inventories interacts with the level of prices

and wages, and how the spillover effects in a fixed-price equilibrium

produce certain testable characteristics in       macro time series data.

We will argue that these can be used to discriminate between a model of the

type we study and the analagous flexible-price system.

     In Section 1 we set out the basic model and discuss its assumptions.

Section 2 derives the short-run quantity-constrained equilibrium as it

depends on initial inventory stocks and on the random disturbances within

the period.     Section 3 presents, for comparison purposes, the analagous

results under conditions of full price flexibility after these shocks

are realized.

     Sections 4 and 5 are the heart of the paper.     We first derive the

probabilistic nature of the equilibrium under a variety of stochastic

specifications.    The probabilities of different types of quantity constrained

equilibria can be compared under these alternative hypotheses.     Then, we

use these results to present the dynamics of inventory behavior and the

statistical relationships between real wages, inventories and employment.

We emphasize the possibility of using this type of analysis to test the

disequilibrium hypothesis with anticipatory pricing, against the market-

clearing assumptions.

     Our theoretical model suggests several lines of empirical investigation.

In an appendix, we present some time series evidence on the relationships

between the important variables of our system.     These are of a preliminary

nature and are not des1gned to test our view of the theory presented.        They

are nevertheless suggestive particularly because of the unexpectedly large

effect of inventories on the real wage.

1.    The Model


Basic Structure

       The model to be described below has two stores of value, money and in-

ventories, which interact together with the flow demands and supplies on

the labor and output markets to determine a short-run equilibrium.         Successive

short-run equilibria are linked together by the dynamics of inventory move-

ments and the prices and wages which result from them.

       Before deriving the stochastic structure of this dynamic disequilibrium

process, we should discuss the nature of the model -- and especially the

central role to be played by inventories and the price formation mechanism.

Inventories are accumulated as the result of an excess of output over sales

to consumers. * It is assumed that such sales of output are entirely con-

sumed; the inventories are owned exclusively by firms.        Similarly, money

balances are held only by households.        They are used to finance purchases

of goods in excess of labor income.      Both inventory levels and real money

balances are desired because they provide the individual decision makers

with flexibility in case they are unable to fully execute their desired trans-

actions.    In the aggregate, therefore, we will assume a positive desired in-

ventory stock and that the level real balances enters the demand and supply

function of households.   ** ***


* Bl inder (1978) offers an extensive discussion of inventories as inputs, but
finally assumes that their role as residual output is dominant, as we do.

** It should be mentioned, or rather confessed, at the outset, thattl1is form-
ulation does not treat the role of firms' profits and their imputation back
to the household sector in a consistent fashion. Implicitly, any money balances
accumulated by firms are immediately transferred back to the household sector,
but these profits are not anticipated at all. Hnner competitive conditions --
that is with many households, each of whom treats profit income as independent
of their own actions -- this formalization is consistent with a 100% profits
tax and a monetary policy designed to keep the nominal stock of money constant.
*** Rational a~entR should recognize t~e influence of firms' inventories on
their future profit irtcome, but we have neglected that as well. In future
work we. will addr.'e§slsavings     ~nd asset markets, uarticulaIly the relation

     Because firms wish·to maintain some inventories, part of planned pro-

duction may be intended for inventory accumulation.    An increase in inven-

tory stocks is not, by itself, enough to indicate that fi rms could not sell

all they wanted to.    The actual variation in these stocks is a composite of

the intended and unintended changes.

     The price-setting process is conceptualized as follows:    Time is measured

in discrete intervals.     The level of inventories is known at the beginning of

each period.     Further the expected values of demands and supplies of goods and labor

as functions of the nominal prices and the stocks of money and inventories

are known.     These functions may differ from their expected values because

of unforeseeable, random events.         Prices are set during the period at

the values that would clear the market if these expectations were all

realized.    During the period they remain rigid, and it is this inflexibility

which is the source of the disequilibrium dynamics that we will be studying.

     Obviously the extreme nature of this process is not to be justified

on the grounds that it precisely represents the workings of any economy.

Moreover, the length of the period affects the extent of the disequilibrium

generated by the temporarily frozen price levels in a serious way, and no

one choice can really be defended.     Nevertheless we believe that the study

of this model can provide useful insights and that it can be viewed as an

approximation to an actual economy in which a variety of disequilibrium

adjustments are taking place simultaneously.     After giving an algebraic

statement of the model, we will return to such a discussion.

Mathematical Specification

         In order to make the model tractable we will impose a linear struc-

ture on the supply and demand functions.              Following Barra - Grossman (1971)

and Malinvaud (1977) the amount by which an agent is constrained below his

desired level of purchase or sale in one market enters               intb the determination

of his desired trade in the other market.               These "spillover effects" are

also assumed to be linear.              For the production sector we have

         One should note that if the firm is interested in maximizing the present

value of its profits, expressed in real terms in units of output, it follows

that

         Suppose that the marginal product of labor is g > 0, and that it is

regarded as a constant over the range of variation we are considering.                   It

is natural to assume that if the sales are rationed by an additional unit,
                                 s
that is if x               < x     and x decreases by one unit, then the decreased demand
                      t          t      t
for labor would be such as to decrease actual output by less than one

unit, the residual being used for inventory accumulation.                 Thus we have


(1. 5)        o       <    c < llg


This can be derived from the second order conditions for the firm's problem.

Similarly an extra unit constraint on labor demand should be absorbed par-

tially by a reduction in inventory stocks and partially by a decrease in

the volume of goods offered for sale.


(1. 6)        o<           a < g •



         Finally, an extra unit of inventory should result in a mixture of

sales increase and labor demand decrease.                 However, since the adjustment

made within one period is only partial,

(For a formal derivation of similar restrictions see Blinder and Fischer(l978».

         For households we have the behavioral relations

respectively.

          The theory of household behavior differs from the theoryeor firma

because it is the households who hold money balances.                                 Since we will treat

the case of a constant money stock throughout, nominal prices and price

expectations are sufficient to specify the level of real balances.                                    Because

we take the view that the unit of time is rather short compared with the

planning horizon of the household, the principal determinant of the house-

holds' demand for real balances is its expectation of future prices and

wages.         It will be shown below that prices in any period depend solely on the

predetermined inventory level.                   Moreover, because inventories will follow

astationary Markov process, in the long run the average level of prices

and wages is known.                Under these conditions the price and wage expectations

relevant to demands at any moment in time can, to a first approximation, be

regarded as exogenous and fixed.                   Thus (1.9) and (1.10) include prices

and wages because of their short run effects, but need include neither

expectations nor money balances explicitly. *

          The standard theory of consumer behavior over time would give us a

zero degree homogeneity of market behavior in prices and wages for the

  increase, the constancy of long-run expectations would imply a negative

  "real-balance effect".

         Finally, to close the model, we make the standard disequilibrium

While these quantity adjustment rules can be criticized on several grounds,

they have the great advantage of providing analytical tractibility.                                         They

also lead to a theory that can, in principal, be tested against a corre-

sponding equilibrium theory.

      The basic assumption of our model is that Pt and w are set in advance

Discussion of the Model

     Although there is no firm microeconomic foundation for our assumption

that prices are fixed at their anticipated Wa1rasian levels, and are then

frozen there for the ensuing period, we had several reasons for adopting

such a formulation.    It is clear that in any macroeconomic model that deals

with sufficiently short time periods, neither the assumption of perfect

price flexibility nor the assumption of quantity flexibility would be

rea~onable.    The world is in continual disequilibrium to a much greater

extent then either pure formalization admits.        In this paper we will

emphasize quantities as the equilibrating vRr:l.ables. while recognizi.ng

that this is but one extreme among a continuum of possibilities.             In any

context where one adopts either the strict price-flexibility or quantity-

flexibility paradigms, the length of the period in question makes a big

difference as to whether the model does or does not approximate the reality.

      Our choice of the price level at the anticipated Wa1rasian equilibrium

should be compared with several other possibilities.             Most of the literature

on disequilibrium macroeconomics * has assumed that prices adjust from their

lagged values according to the lagged value of excess demand.             In our model,



* In the econometrics literature, both adjustment of prices to past excess
demands and partial adjustment to current excess demands have been used (see
for example Fair and Jaffee [1974], Laffont and Garcia [1977]. In the
economic theory literature adjustment to past excess demands has been the
rule (see Honkapohja [1979], Laroque (forthcoming».

        one of the impacts of previous disequilibria is to alter the level of

        stocks.    Therefore prices in our model will be higher after a period of

        excess demand for goods, as in these systems.       The analogous property

        does not apply to the wage rate, as labor services are not durable, nor

        is there explicitly intertemporal substitution of labor for leisure over

        individuals' lifetimes.

             These two price adjustment hypotheses are hard to compare on empirical

        grounds.    One reason why prices are likely to appear responsive to lagged

        excess demands is the auto correlation of errors.       However, such an obser-

        vat ion would not   contrad~ct   the basic motivation for having an anticipatory

        pricing process.    For contractual reasons, or because of the difficulty of

        monitoring and responding to the current state of disequilibrium t the firms

        and workers might try to use pricing rules designed to approximate an

        efficient market-clearing system. *

             In planned economies there is some evidence that prices are set so

        as to approximate equilibria that are forecasted.       This may provide a justi-

        fication of our anticipatory pricing assumption in modelling such systems.



        * To take one alternative, we might suppose that prices are set at the
        mathematical expectation of the ex post equilibrium. The difficulty
        with this assumption is that the bias of these prices away from ~* , w*)
                                                                      .  t     t
        depends upon the distribution of the disturbances € . Therefore a complicated
        pair of non-linear equations would have to be sOlvea to find the prices and
        wages, in contrast to the simple system (1.20) .- (1.21).
          Another price-setting mechanism is that prices are only incompletely flexible
        within the period. They end up somewhere between their lagged values and the
        location of the market-clearing equilibrium. This amounts to an adjustment
        in response to current, rather than lagged, excess demands. This hypothesis
        is attractive in that the length of the period can be reflected in the speci-
        fication of the adjustment speed. Unfortunately we were unable to obtain
        tractable dynamic results.

         Within each regime we can study the stability of the natural quantity

adjustment processes

where hI and h Z are sign-preserving functions.                        It follows from an examination

of the linear systems (Z.2)t (2.4)t (Z.6) and (2.8), that this dynamic

adjustment process would be locally
                                 , stable provided that

For example, suppose that an equilibrium in Regime 1 were disturbed by a

small upward perturbation in sales of                                              ~Xt.   This would produce. a lower level

of constraint in the supply of goods and hence an increase of                                                 c~x       in the
                                                                                                                    t

demand for labor.                     The change would give rise ·to more demand for goods by

bc~xt.     Summing up the induced increase in demands] stability requires 1 - bc                                                   >   O.

         Now, when we consider the entire equation system in which these

regimes are juxtaposed                                  it has been shown by Gourieroux, Laffont and

Monfort     [1978] that the existence and uniqueness of the quantity-constrained

solution is implied when these local stability properties hold within each regime.

         Let us compute the constraints on the                                            ~'s   such that the realized values

of demands and supplies satisfy the definition of each of the regimes.                                                       For

example, assuming that we are in Regime

(2.2) and i f they are to satisfy (2.1) we must have that

and conversely, i f (2.1]) is satisfied, then the solution to (2.2) will lie in

Regime 1.     Pursuing this method for the other regimes we find that they are

realized if the £'s lie in the following                                              region~;

3.   Short-run equilibria      with~~ice   flexibility


        For future reference, it is useful at this point to derive the

prices, wages and equilibrium quantities that would arise if prices and

wages were to adjust so as to clear both markets after the realization of

the disturbances.       Setting (1.14) equal to (1.15), (1.16) equal to (1.17)

and ignoring all the terms involving sp,illover          effects we can derive the

following expression for the equilibrium real wage:


(3.1)           ~ • (w~ - p~)= [Yo (8 1 + 82 ) + a O (01 + 02)] (St -   s)
                                                              2                   1
                                               + (6 1 + S2) v t - (01 + 02)   v
                                                                                  t



where     ~   is given by (1.24).    Equilibrium employment, and hence output, are

given by


(3.2)




        The stability condition      on the Walrasian price adjustment process

where wages respond to excess demand in the labor market and prices to

excess demand in the goods market implies that f..        <   O.   These stability con-

ditions will be satisfied whenever 01 and 02 are relatively small (see

 the right hand side of (1.24».         The comparative statics of the equilibrium

model with respect to inventories and shocks can be derived in a straight-

 forward way.       It may be seen that the real wage responds negatively to

 initial inventories, positively to shocks that increase the excess demand

 for labor, and positively to shocks that increase the excess demand for

 goods.       These comparative statics are in accordance with one's intuition

 that initial inventories are a substitute for labor inputs in the short-run

 production process.

4. ' Probabilistic structure of the short-run quantity'- constrained equilibria


      The principal question answered in this section is how the stochastic

specification of the model induces the probabilities that each of the four

 types of quantity-constrained equilibria will arise.      In complete generality,

the symmetry with which our model treats the goods and labor markets makes

 it impossible to derive specific conclusions about this distribution.          But

employing plausible qualitative conditions on the parameters, combined

with assumptions on the relative variances of the errors, we find limitations

 on the forms of the disequilibria that can arise.      Depending on the specification

 used, one or two of the regimes can be proven to be much less likely than

 the others.

      First one should note the obvious point that anticipatory price
setting makes the nature of the equilibrium independently determined from

one period to the next.
                                                                   222
     Let us assume that the    E'S   have mean zero and variances 01' 02' 03'

o~ respectively.   It is probably reasonable to expect that firms are more

sensitive to constraints than are individuals.       The permanent income hypothesis

in its purest form would not leave any room for spillover effects in con-

sumption or in labor supply.     Firms, although infinitely 11ved in principal,

do not allow their inventories to serve as a complete buffer when plans

cannot be carried out.    Some of the impact of sales constraints is to

lower production, even in the short-run.       Therefore we will assume through-

out the rest of this section that
                                                     -22-

       To derive the probabilities of the four regimes we use the inequality

 constraints defining them (2.LI) - (2.14) •                              These          constraints       can   be

 Independent Shocks


         The first specification of the errors that we will consider is the

 case in which they are independently distributed.

          It is natural then to define

     The highest probabilities are associated with the Keynesian unemp1oy-

ment (Regime 1) and repressed inflation (Regime 3) modes, where the corre-

lations are positive.   An intuition for this result can be derived from

the observation that when errors occur one at a time only Regime I and 3

are possible.   This point is due to the fact that the first effect of a

shock is to constrain one agent (firms or consumers) in one market and by

the spillover effect the other agent in the other market.           The stability

conditions imply that one remains then in a regime where both agents are

constrained, i.e. either Keynesian unemployment or repressed inflation.

     The comparison between Regimes I and 3 and between Regimes 2 and 4 is

difficult and depends on the variances and on the spillover coefficients.

One possibility to obtain further results can be obtained if we are willing

to make the assumption that shocks originating on the consumers' side of

both markets are small compared to producers shocks.*            This can be de-
                    2 2 ·

the work of Malinvaud.

    Even under the maintained hypotheses (4.1) this comparison could still go

    either way. *



    Three Cases of Non-Independent Shocks

            We shall now consider three cases where the errors are interpreted

    as shocks to the technology and preferences of a particular form and are

    not, therefore, independent across the equations.       Let us first consider

    firms.     Suppose that there is a unit increase in labor demanded as the

    result of some factors exogenous to the model, for example a change in the

    tax rules governing employment.     If the entire output of these workers is
                              s
    placed on the market, x     increases by g -- that is
                              t


    (4.2)

    On the other extreme, the additional output could be divided between inven-

    tory accumulation and sales in the same proportion that would be caused by

    an involuntary rather than a voluntary shock to employment.       Then one \JOuld

    have


    (4.3)

    Recall that 0 < a < g.

            For individuals the argument is slightly more involved, but one ob-

    tains similar extreme cases as approximations.     An exogenous increase of

    one unit in the level of labor offered to the market brings in a real

    income of w - Pt in period t.      Therefore the appropriate increase in
               t
    demand for goods, under the hypothesis that all of this income is to be



* To confirm the further intuition of Malinvaud that Keynesian unemployment
is more likely than repressed inflation, one would have to invoke a bias
of the price setting mechanism away from the anticipated Walrasian levels.

prevailing in that period.               This would make the analysis of the quantity-

constrained equilibrium virtually as complex as the system with independent

errors.  It is more tractable if we take the approximation that w - Pt is,
                                                                 t
in the long-run, equal to the real marginal product of labor g. This would

give us


 (4.4)


which is analagous to (4.2). Alternatively, we can suppose that the extra

earnings are divided between spending on goods and accumulation of money

balances in the same proportion that the individual allocates his constrained

 labor income.        Since one unit less of labor supply causes goods demand to

 drop by b, we obtain

                  2

                  t


         It is possible to examine each of the four possible combinations of

 these assumptions (4.2) or (4.3), together with either (4.4) or (4.5).              To

 obtain the flavor of the analysis, however, we report on only three of these

 cases.     We will see that the results are rather sensitive to this specification.

     In summary, this specification of the shocks implies that Regime 4,

Classical Unemployment, will be the most common                                        occurrenc~,with     Regimes 2

and 3, Underconsumption and Repressed Inflation occurring less frequently.

    We now consider the case where none of the effects of the shocks

impact upon the stocks of inventories or of money balances:



(4.2) and (4.4):                 (Both sectors' shocks affect only their notional demand
                                  for flows.)
     This case is a good deal simpler than that studied above because it

implies that        v~ = g v~.              Since   v~   and    v~       completely determine the nature

of the short-run equilibrium, as described in Section 2, the regimes are

defined by

indeed the probabilities of the regimes would be invariant to such a speci-

     Finally we look at the case in which both sectors allocate the shock

between the stock they control and current notional demands in the same

proportion as they would for a constraint on their trades.

Regimes 3 and 4 are going to be more likely than Regimes 1 and 2, whatever

the error structure is.                  The goods market is systematically more likely to

be in excess supply than in excess demand!

    We can see t therefore t that the nature of the shocks is an important

determinant of the probability of reaching any of the regimes.   If direct

evidence were available as to the nature of the binding quantity constraints

at different points in time, * indirect evidence would be available as to the

relative magnitude of the shocks.




* For example, suitable unemployment/vacancy data would be relevant to
the labor market. Evidence in the goods market is harder to ascertain
since intended inventory movements may be confounded with flow disequilibrium.

5.   Dynamic Behavior of Quantity-Constrained     E~ui1ibrium   Process


        In this section we will utilize the stochastic structure derived

above to study the dynamics of inventories, employment, output, the real

wage and correlations among them.      We will compare the results of the

disequilibrium model to those arising from a system where prices are

flexible    ~fter   the realization of the shocks, as described in Section 3.

In particular we will ask whether or not these systems are "observationally

equivalent", and we will suggest methods for testing one of these hy-

potheses against the other.



The dynamics of      inven~orie~



        In this model inventories are entirely composed of unsold stocks of

final goods.     Because there is no depreciation, the change in stocks is

simply the difference between production and sales.       The evolution of in-

ventories is described by


(5.1)


Equation (5.1) is a stochastic difference equation because it and x           are
                                                                          t

        Equation (5.4) can now be analyzed under a variety of conditions

corresponding to particular assumptions on the joint distribution of                  £
                                                                                          t
As the details are straightforward, we will only summarize the results here.

        If the four shocks are independent, little can be said in general

about the Markov process defined by (5.4).         The mean value of the error

term averaged over the four regimes will not be zero because they enter

in a piecewise linear, rather than a linear, fashion.          Therefore the long-
                                                                                              "
run average for St will be biased away from its target s.

        It is interesting to ask whether the time series behavior of inven-

tories can be used to distinguish between this model and the equilibrium

model of Section 3.

        Using (3.1), (3.2) and (3.3) we can see that in the equilibrium stock

adjustment equation will be of the same general form as (5.5) but the

errors enter linearly.     This suggests the following test of the equilibrium

model.

        Write the equilibrium model as


(5.6)

If this equation were estimated, K s would be the value of the constant.

Moreover, if the data were partitioned into various subsets, the same constant

would be consistantly estimated in each of them.            This should be contrasted with

the case of disequilibrium as in (5.5).        If the data were partitioned according to

       the expectation conditioned on regime                      i~   would be observed in each regime.

                 Of course it is not obvious at all which regime is operative at which

       point.          Unlike previous work in disequilibrium                econometrics~     the direction

       of the price change in our model does not indicate anything about the
,...
       effective quantity constraints.                    Therefore the brute force procedure would

       be to estimate the disequilibrium system by maximum likelihood methods
                                                  T
       separately for each of the 4                   partitions of the T data          points~        allowing

       a different constant in each                   regime~   and·then to perform a likelihood

       ratio test of the overall maximum likelihood among these reg.rcssions

       against the equation estimated with a single constant.

                 Of course if T is fairly large this method becomes impractical.                                 Some

       economies of computation are                   possible~ however~         under more restrictive

       2 and 4 which in turn exceed that in Regime 3.                            Moreover these constraints

       can provide an algorithm for partitioning the data, if (4.2) and (4.5)

       are adopted as maintained hypotheses.                      For example, if      a~   is thought to

       dominate 04' we know from (4.6) that Regimes 2 and 4 become far more likely

       than 1 and 3.               We might therefore begin by running the unconstrained regression

       (5.5)~          ignoring the biased error term, and then assign that half of the data
                                                                                                           '1c

occurs where the shocks affect current notional demands and desired stocks

in the same proportion as would quantity constraints:                           (/•• 3) and (4.5).

      We have from (5.2) that

is small compared to Ee: 31 e: 3 < 0.               Thus   an~proximate        test of the disequilibrium

model under the maintained hypotheses (4.3), (4.5), is to segregate the data

into two subsets, presumably those in or out of Regime 4, and test for the

inequality of the constants in these separate regressions.                                 (Of course this

will be a weaker test than the full maximum likelihood procedure, but the

computational advantages may be significant.)

      Other combinations .of (4.2) (4.3) and (4.4) (4.5) can be studied with

similar results.

        In the disequilibrium model we have studied, the anticipatory nature of

the price adjustment process makes the real wage a function of inventories

alone.   Therefore, in the absence of observational errors, a perfect

(negative) correlation between them would be observed.

     The equilibrium model's real wage is given by (3.1).              It is easy to

show that the coefficient of (s              - s) is the same in this equation as it is
                                         t
in the disequilibrium theory.            The two dHfer only in the presence of the

error term.     Because of observational errors, however, we cannot discriminate

between them.

The dependence of L , anticipated employment if there are no shocks, on
                   t
inventories can be computed from (1.21), (1.22) and (1.23) to be:
                                                     -37-


     In the equilibrium model employment is given by (3.2).                    Note that the

systematic dependence of employment on inventories is the same under either

theory.

     As in the case of the autocorrelation of the inventory series, the

difference lies in the stochastic structure.                    Different constant terms in

the regressions within each regime would provide evidence for the dis-

equilibrium hypothesis.

     We will not elaborate upon the possibilities under all the stochastic

specifications treated previously.                     It is useful, however, to examine one of

them again because it indicates how a combination of evidence on inventories

and employment can help identify regimes and provide a sharper discrimination

between these theories.

        Consider the case of (4.3) and (4.5), where disturbances impinge upon

notional demand for stocks in both sectors.                     The relations (5.8) become:

                                            (l-ac)        3

equation (5.7).       When d       fa 2 is small, the sign of the errors in each of
                               V   z   vI
the three possible regimes is precisely the same in (5.9) as it is in (5.7).

Therefore, if we identify a particular partition of the data points for one

equation, then under the maintained hypotheses about the errors, the constants
                                    -38



estimated by maximum likelihood from the other equation should stand in the same

relationship across the regimes when the data are partitioned the same way.

                                                                        2   2
     Indeed a further check is possible, using the fact that a    fa  is

small.   We can neglect the difference between the constants estimated in

Regimes 2 and 3 compared with their relation to that in Regime 4.               From

(5.9) and (5.7) we can see that the difference between Regime 4 and the

other two in the employment regressions is       E£~I£~   <   0, and in the inven-

tory autoregression it is   (g~a) E£3 1£3     < O. We can infer that the cross-
                                    t     t
equation difference in the constants in the inventory autoregression

should be less than g times the bias in the employment regressions, because

a > O.   (The productivity of labor, g, can be estimated as the average real

wage, so this procedure is well-defined.)

Correlation between real wages   and~loyment



     Both the disequilibrium and equilibrium models predict a negative

correlation between real wages and employment when (01 + 02) is relatively

small.   Tests based on the stochastic structure similar to those described

above can be constructed, but we believe that they will be harder to use.

There are difficulties in constructing a real wap,e series corrected for the

changing composition of the labor force and the           problem    of obtaining

wage rates when overtime and other considerations distort the relationship

between hours of employment and total earnings.

    Appendix

             We gather together a few regression results that are related to the

    results of this paper.      No attempt is made to give a detailed treatment of

    problems in structural estimation of macroeconomic systems.        These results

    should be viewed merely as exploring some correlations in the data, and not

    as necessarily confirming or disproving specific hypotheses.

             Nevertheless we believe they are of interest.   In particular they

    point out the strong influence of inventories on the real wage.

             The variables used are:

              W, wage The real wage in the manufacturing sector.   Computed as the

                      ratio"of hourly earnings to the implicit price deflator for

                      personal consumption expenditures.

        H, hours      The measure of total manufacturing employment.    Computed as

                      the product of weekly hours for production workers with total

                      employment in the manufacturing sector.

INV, inventories      Total inventories in the manufacturing sector.

IMP, import price
           index      Index of unit-values of imported goods.

                 All data are seasonally adjusted.

             We present three sets of regressions for monthly, quarterly and annual

     data.     In accordance with the theory, we treat as exogenous the initial level

    of inventories.

             In the monthly regressions we use the previous month's value.    In

    both quarterly and annual regressions we use the value associated with the

     last month of the previous time period.

             The wage, hours inventories and import prices are used in logarithms,

    time is not used as a logarithm.

Summary of Results

     The principal reason for performing three separate types of regressions

is that we do not know the timing of the anticipatory pricing and the shocks

which are supposed to be accomodated by disequilibrium quantity adjust-

ments.   No attempt was made to search for regressions with more explanatory

power, but we do present two forms of the equations according to whether

the import price index variable is included.   It was felt that this variable

is largely exogenous and that it exerts a strong influence on prices and

output quite independent of the inventory situation.
