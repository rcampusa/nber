                      Investment and Sales: Some Empirical Evidence




                                        ABSTRACT


     This paper attempts to give a structural interpretation to the distributed lag

of sales on investment at the two-digit level in US manufacturing. It first presents

a simple model which captures the various sources of lags and their respective

implications. It then estimates the model, using both data on investment and sales as

well as direct evidence on the sources of lags. The spirit of the paper is

exploratory   the model is used mainly as a vehicle to construct, present and

interpret the data.

     We find that the following model can roughly generate the distributed lag

structure found in the data. Firms face delivery lags of 3 quarters. They also face

adjustment costs, which lead them to take into account expected future sales, with

discount factor .9 when constructing the desired capital stock, and to close about 5%

of the gap betwen actual and desired capital per quarter. They pay for orders at a

constant rate between the time of order and that of delivery. The model is however

not very successful in explaining differences in dynamics across sectors.

     This paper attempts to give a structural interpretation to the distributed lag

of sales on investment at the two digit level in US manufacturing. It first presents

a simple model which captures the various sources of lags and their respective

implications. It then estimates the model, using both data on investment and sales as

well as direct information on the sources of lags. The spirit of the paper is

exploratory ; the model is used mainly as a vehicle to construct, present and

interpret the data.

     Lags in the response of investment expenditures to sales can be attributed to

four main sources. The first is expectations. Investment depends on future sales,

which themselves depend on current and past sales. The next two come from technology.

One, costs of adjustment, is internal to the firm. The other, delivery lags, is

external to the firm. Together, they imply that the firm is neither willing nor able

to adjust its capital stock completely and instantaneously to movements in sales. The

last source is financial. While the theory describes investment orders, data are

about investment expenditures, which are related to orders by a distributed lag.

Section 1 of the paper presents a model which incorporates these four sources

explicitly and shows their respective implications.

     Section 2 presents the basic investment and sales characteristics of each cf the

industries studied in the paper. It estimates a reduced form relation of investment

on sales and the capital stock, showing common patterns and differences across

industries.

    Given the existence of data on orders and deliveries by sector of origin one

can construct direct estimates of delivery lags by type of good. Given information on

the composition of capital by industry, one can construct estimates of delivery lags

by sector of destination, These estimates are presented in Section 3.
    Section 4 examines the stochastic behavior of sales in each industry.             It   shows

substantial differences in univariate representations of sales across industries.

There appears to be a relation between the degree of persistence of sales and the

size of the effect of sales on investment, which supports the hypothesis that the

stochastic behavior of sales is an important determinant of the distributed lag

effect of sales on investment.

     A more formal test of the theory is carried out in Section 5,            through estimation
of the structural model developed in section 1. The model is somewhat successful in

explaining the distributed lag structures and the differences across industries

through plausible structural parameters.

      Section 6 reviews and assesses the main results of the paper.




     Section I   .   A   flexible accelerator model



     We specify a flexible accelerator model. That is, we work under the maintained

hypotheses that there is a causal relation from sales to investment, and that no

factors other than sales affect investment1. While we do not believe that either of

these two assumptions is correct, we see this shorcut as appropriate For a first look

at the data2. We assume that investment behavior is characterized by

     (I) I       = X     (K*÷—K+_1) +                 +   ;   0 < X < 1


     (2)         =   cx(1—) E       o                         0 <   < 1   ;   > 0
                             I =0



     (3)         =   (1—e)K.._1         +   I
                                                                     i
                                          -V



                                                                          I'
      (4)   X,         =    E Wj It_i                           a         E        =   1
                           i=O                                           i=')
     where

                 is the capital in place at the beginning of period t

     K*÷ is the level of capital in place at the beginning of period

                 t+n, desired as of time t

     I           is investment orders at time t, for delivery at the beginning

                 of period t+n

                 is investment expenditures in period t

     St          is sales in period t

                 is a disturbance term

                 is the information set at time t, which includes at least

                 current and lagged sales.



     Consider first the case where firms face costs of adjustment of capital but no

delivery lags, so that n = 0. In this case, investment orders, expenditures and

deliveries are identical. From equation (1), net investment is equal to a fraction X

of the gap between desired and actual capital, plus a disturbance term ; gross

investment is equal to net investment plus replacement investment eK_1. Desired

capital in turn depends on the sequence of expected future sales, with discount

factor o     a    is   the steady state ratio of capital to sales.

     Costs o-f adjustement give us two important parameters, a gap parameter X and a

discount parameter a-. These are not strictly speaking technological parameters, but

rather functions of underlying technological parameters3. For example, an increase in

the convexity of costs of adjustment reduces X and increases c                 firms adjust more

slowly and look at expected sales further in the -future. We shall however treat them

directly as structural parameters.
                                    4

     Consider now the case where firms also -face delivery lags. Delivery lags are

formalized in the simplest possible way, by assuming that capital is delivered arid

ready to use n periods after it is ordered4. This modifies all four equations. At

time t, there is nothing the firm can do about its capital stock until time t+n

(orders cannot be cancelled). Thus, in equation (1), orders close a fraction of the

gap between the expected desired capital stock at time t+n and the actual capital

stock at time t+n—1, which is known as of time t. Similarly replacement investment

orders at time t are equal to $K+_. The expected desired capital stock at time t+n

in equation (2) depends in turn on the sequence of sales From time t+n on, expected

as of time t ;   given the delivery lags, sales expected between t and t+n—1 have no
effect on current investment decisions. Equation (3)   is   the modified accumulation

equation. Equation (4) gives expenditures as a distributed lag on orders. The

implicit assumption is that payment for capital goods is made partly on order, partly

before delivery, with the remainder paid at delivery. Delivery lags introduce

therefore a more complex dynamic relation both between orders and sales and between

expenditures and orders.

     To summarize, the dynamic relation between investment and sales depends on the

characteristics of the sales process through expectations, on costs of adjustment

through X and a, on delivery lags through n and on order—expenditure lags through

Cw) i=O,...,n. To see how they interact, we now consider a simple example.



     Peristence of sales, costs of adjustment and delivery



     Consider the case in which sales follow a stationary first order process.

Ignoring constant terms for notational simplicity, let S    follow
                                           C


          =        St—I +      ('LQB_l     E(c?_1)=c. E29 ci_1             = cr2
       Solving     for expectations in (2) and replacing in (1 gives

          =   EX    "   (1—a)/(1—) 3     St +   (E'—X)K+_1 -f


       Thus, five coefficients affect the size of the effect of S on I, , QB, X,                and

n. The first is the capital sales ratio and is non—dynamic. The next two, X and c,

are functions of costs of adjustment. More conve< costs of adjustment decrease X,

reducing the effect of any change in S. They also increase a, leading firms to look

over   a longer horizon ; if       is less than one, this will also decrease the effect o-f

S. Delivery lags are responsible for the term                   When   is less than one, this

also decreases the effect of S on I.

       If the effect of adjustment costs, delivery lags and persistence on the size of

the effect of sales on investment is relatively straightforward, their effect on the

dynamic, distributed lag relation is much less obvious. Indeed, in the above example,

only current sales affect current orders. Only i-F sales follow a higher order process

will investment orders depend on a distributed lag of sales. In that case, the lag of

investment expenditures on sales will be a convolution of this lag and the order

expenditure lag. Little can be said in general about this convolution ; i-f forecasts

of future sales depend or a distributed lag of past sales with both positive and

negative coefficients, some coefficients on lagged sales nay well be negative.




       Section 2. Basic characteristics of the data
    We have selected all the 2 ar 2 digit manufacturing se:toE for which we had

quarterly data on orders, shipments and investment expenditures, ai well as

associated price deflators. The result was the choice of thrteeri se:tors, eleven 2—

digit sectors and two 3—digit sectors (motor vehicles and aircraft). Their names and

mnemonics are given in the first two columns of Table 1. Orders, shipments and

expenditures are directly available. Capital stock series, which are needed for

estimation are constructed by accumulation of investment expenditures. Appendix A

gives sources, methods of construction and other information on the data. One data

problem must be mentioned in the text       shipments are collected or an establishment

basis, while investment expenditures are collected an a company basis. This is not a

major problem for most sectors except for Petroleum, in which a large proportion of

investment expenditures by companies classified in petroleum takes place in

activities largely unrelated to petroleum (see appendix A for details). The sample

period is 1958—1 to 1979—3.

     In examining the data, both informally here, or using econometric techniques

later, we assume that investment and shipments have both a detersinistic and a

stochastic component. We assume the deterministic component tc be the sum of an

exponential time trend and seasonal dummies. Examining the data using the alternative

assumption that there is no deterministic time trend would be useful but we have not

done it in this paper.

     The first six columns of numbers in table 1 give the estimated growth rates, the

means and the standard deviations of the deviations from trend and seasonal, for

investment and shipments for each sector. While we shall not focus on these

deterministic components in what follows, it must be noted that there is both wide

variation of growth rates among sectors, and between investment and shipments in a

given sector ;   this   last fact is evidence of long run movements in the capital

shipments ratio.

     One of   the reasons why investment may    move more or less compared to shipments

across sectors is simply the difference jr their capital/shipments ratios, . The

next column gives mean capital/shipments ratios. For reasons explained above, the

main outlier, petroleum, overestimates the true capital to shipments ratio, probably

by a factor of 2. Otherwise, the capital/shipments ratio varies between .24 and .63.

     Two sectors which are similar in all respects except in their mean capital

shipments ratio, will have the same ratio of      coefficient   of variation of investment

to the coefficient of variation of shipments. This ratio, denoted R, is given in the

last column. Except for food where it is equal to 5, this ratio varies across sectors

from 1.5 to 3.0.



     Table 2 gives further evidence on the relation between investment and shipments,

by giving, for each sector, estimates of the relation

     We shall see in Section 5 that this equation is, under specific assumptions

about the information set, the approximate reduced form of the structural model

described in equations (1) to (4). The equation gives investment expenditures as

depending on capital at the end of the previous quarter, on current and lagged values

of shipments, up to 6 lags, and o-f a first order disturbance term. In addition to

these variables, regressions include a constant, a deterministic exponential time

trend and seasonal dummies

    The coefficients on K(—1) and S to S(—6) are reported in the first seven

columns. The next two columns give the sum of coefficients on shipments, E, and the

sum divided by the mean capital shipment ratio, (/). If all sectors were the same,

except for their acer capital output ratio, (ia) would be the same across sectors.

The next column reports the value of the likelihood ratio test statistic, L,

associated with the hypothesis that shipments play no role in explainin investsent

expenditures. The last two columns give the coefficient of serial correlation cf the

disturbance and the P2 on the Q—transforflied variables, after taking out the

deterministic trend end the seasonal component.

     For four of the sectors (FO, CH, PET, PM) shipments have no significant effect

on investment, and the cumulative effect (measured by /) is quantitatively small.

For eight of the sectors, and for most of durable manufacturing (PA, RU and BCG in

non durable manufacturIng, and FM, NEM, EM, MV and AC in durable manufacturing),

shipments have a very significant effect, with an average cumulative effect of .31.

To get a feel for the sice of this coefficient, suppose that shipments followed a

random walk   the cumulative effect of shipments as measured by Ei, would then be

equal to X. A coefficient of 4   would then mean full adjustment of investment to the

anticipated gap between desired capital and actual capital.

     As we do not impose constraints on the distributed lag structure,

multicollinearity implies that the shape of the leg structure is not estimated very

tightly. The lag structure shows no definite pattern, and in particular no sign of

smooth decay as the lag length increases ;   in   many sectors, coefficients on S(—1) to

S(—3) are larger and more significant than the others.

     In the rest of the paper, we try to explain the characteristics o-f these

distributed lag structures and why they differ across sectors. But before we turn to

this task, we must mention another characteristic of these reduced forms. For all

sectors, even those where shipments are quantitatively and statistically significant,

the disturbance term, which measures the effects of variables other than sales, is

highly serially correlated and explains a good part of the movement in investment.

which shipments are significant is of .29. A large part of movements in investment

is thus not due to shipments (This is true also when shipments are replaced by orders

in (5)).   Even   if we   were successful in explaining the effects of                  shipments   on

investment, there would be a lot            left   to be explained.




      Section 3. Direct evidence on delivery lags



      In this section, we construct direct estimates of delivery lags facing each of

the sectors. We proceed in four steps. We first derive the capital composition of

each sector, and then calculate the delivery lag associated with each type of

equipment and structure. Next, we combine the information on capital composition and

delivery lag by type of good to get average delivery lags by sector. Finally, we

study whether the delivery lag associated with each type of good is approximately

constant or, instead, varies cyclically with the output of the sector producing the

type of capital goods.



     Sectoral composition of capital

     We construct a capital stock decomposition for each sector. We start from the

capital flow tables, which give the amount of investment of each type for each

sector, for both 1967 and 1972. We then go from these flows to stocks by using

information about depreciation and growth rates for each type of good and each

sector. The details of the computation are given in appendix B. The results are given
in table 3.

     capital equipment comes nearl entirely from four sectors mainly from non

electrical   machinery,   with smaller amounts coming from fabricated metals, electrical

sachinery and motor vehicles. The ratio of capital equipment to structures is similar

across sectors and close to unity, except for petroleum which has a much larger

proportion of structures in capital.



     Delivery lags by type of capital qood

     We use different approaches to the construction of delivery lags for structures

and equipment.

     Data on time to completion for different types of structures are directly

available ; we therefore use them.

     No such data exist on equipment and more work is needed. Of the four sectors

producing equipment, only three have delivery lags ; motor vehicles may be assumed to

be sold from stock. We have data on unfilled and new orders as well as on shipments

-for the remaining three sectors. If these sectors produced only capital goods, and if

all goods were produced to order, then the ratio of unfilled orders to shipments

would give a good estimate of the average delivery lag associated with these goods.

These two assumptions are however strongly violated : the proportion in total sales

of goods sold as capital goods is only of 4% for fabricated metals 207. for

electrical machinery and 43% for non electrical machinery. We use therefore the

following approach. We assume that all capital goods are produced to order and that

all sales by the producing sector to wholesalers and retailers, and only these sales,

are from stock. We then estimate the mean delivery lag by

     where V, S and b are respectively mean unfilled orders, mean shipeents and
the proportion of shipments sold to wholesalers and retailers for sector i. (Details
of construction are given in appendix B b varies between 42 and 46). The results

are given in table 4. Delivery laqs appear similar across the different types of

equipment ;   this   uniformity no doubt hides differences at a more disaggregated level.

Not surprisingly, delivery lags are longer for structures than for equipment. It

takes on average a year to build an industrial structure while it takes appro<imately

six months to receive equipment.



     Delivery lags by     sector
     All that is left to do is to combine results about sectoral composition with

those about delivery lags by type of capital. Implied average delivery lags by sector

of destination are given in Table 5. The main result, for our purposes is that,

except for petroleum, all sectors face very similar delivery lag structures ; the

mean delivery lag varies between 3.2 and 3.5 quarters8. This is therefore not the

source of the difference of the response of investment to shipments across sectors.



     Cyclical behavior of delivery lags

     Before leaving delivery lags, we return to a maintained assumption of our model,

and indeed of all models which assumed a linear relation between demand and

investment, namely that of constancy of delivery lags. We can use the time series on

orders and shipments for the capital producing sectors to examine the validity of

this assumption. if we assume that the proportion of production to order in total

production is constant over the cycle, then if delivery lags are constant, the

relation   between orders and shipments should be constant through time. We therefore
run the following regression

     Under the null hypothesis of constant delivery lags, c             0 so that d is
constant and equal to d. The distributed lag of           orders on shipments is taken to be a
Pascal   distribution,    a parametri:ation which is convenient under both the null and

the alternative hypothesis The coefficient + is allowed to differ from one to

reflect that some orders are cancelled and that not all shipments are in response to

orders. The mean lag is given by 2d/(1—d).

     Under the alternative hypothesis, c is positive and the mean lag is an

increasing function of the level of demand, measured by the deviation of orders from

an exponential deterministic trend and seasonals.

     The relation between shipments and orders can be rewritten as

         =   2dS_     —            +   f(l—d2O     +

     In the absence of good reasons to the contrary, we assume that et'           ,

disturbance term after transformation, is white, and estimate the above equation.

Results are reported in Table 6.         In addition   to the estimates of d and c, we give

estimates o-f    the mean lag when deviations of orders from trend are respectively eaual
to plus and minus one standard deviation.

     The results are quite clear and show delivery lags to be procyclical9. Having

duly registered this result, we nevertheless proceed to estimate our model which is

based ar constant lags ;        but these results make clear that the linear relation
between investment and shipments is at best a rough approximation and that further

research might uncover non—linearities.
      Section 4. Dynamic behavior of sales



      We have seen that whether or not an increase in current sales is expected to

persist is an important determinant of the relation between investment expenditures

and shipments, and that differences in processes for shipments across sectors have

the potential to explain differences in the dynamic response of investment to

shipments. In this section, we examine the characteristics of the univariate

representation of shipments across sectors.

      Table 7 presents the results of estimation of AR(4) processes for shipments. As

discussed earlier, we maintain the assumption of a deterministic time trend and

deterministic seasonality. Thus, we also include an exponential time trend and

seasonal dummies      their coefficients are not reported. An AR(4) representation is

sufficient to capture the dynamics o-f the stochastic component of shipments C

statistics are given in the table). In addition to the coefficients and their sum,

table 6 presents the expected time between two successive downcrossings of the means

which provides a measure of the length of the cycle in shipments.

     Table 7 shows large variations in persistence across sectors. Food exhibits low

persistence ;    at the other end, textiles, fabricated metals, electrical and non

electrical machinery, and aircraft exhibit high persistence. In two of these sectors

(TX,AC) ,   the hypothesis of non—stationarity cannot be rejected (using the

distribution appropriate under the assumption of a unit root and the presence of a

deterministic time trend in the regression). In many sectors, the degree of

substantial   effects of current shipments on investment orders.

     To see whether these differences in processes may help explain variations in the

investment—shipments relation, the last column reports the normalised sue of

coefficients on shipments in the investment equation, from table 2. One expects,

ceteris paribus, a positive relation between persistence and the normalised sum of

coefficients. There is indeed some relation between the two        the rank correlation

between cycle length and the normalised sum is equal to .42, which is significant at

the 1O level. The relation is however not tiht ; motor vehicles for example has lOW

persistence of shipments and a strong effect of shipments on investment. The next

section provides a more formal assessment by estimating the structural investment

equation implied by (1) to (4) given the sales process.




     Section 5. Structural estimation



     Derivation of the reduced form implied by (1) to (4)



     The first step is to eliminate unobservable expectations. We assume that the'

information set includes only current and lagged investment expenditures and

shipments, and that shipments are uncorrelated at all leads and ias with the

disturbance . This implies that expectations of shipments conditional on the

information set are the same as forecasts of shipments using a univariate

representation. This joint assumption is stronger than is needed for estimation, but
allows a more intuitive nterpretatiori of the relation between the :hara:teristics of

 the shipments process presented in sectior; 4 and the characteristics c the relation

between investment and shipmentst0. Let the R(4) process -for shipments be given by

                        St = a1S._1 +     a2S_2 + 3t— 4St—4                 +

     Investment expenditures depend on three sets of terms. The first is a

distributed lag of sales : the second depends on capital -from K_1 to                                     which

determine past and current orders, and thus current expenditures                               the third depends
on current and past disturbances.

     Equation (7) is the equation to be estimated. Before we do so, we make two

approximations

     The first follows from the fact that K is unobservable. We only observe

expenditures, not deliveries of                     capital.   Thus, the K series constructed by

accumulation using expenditures includes capital paid for but not yet delivered. If

capital goods were paid fully on order, our constructed K: would measure the true
                                        16

K+ and we could us our constructed                             in equation (7); if capital

Qoods were instead paid fully on delivery, our constructed K would correctly measure

the true K and we should use our constructed                           in equation (7). Rather

than to attempt to construct a two sided moving average of K to capture the second

term in (7), we simply proxy E Ut       K+__1       by our constructed         Given the slow

movement of K. compared to X, this is unlikely to be a source of major problems. It

may however bias the coeffcient on capital, an issue to which we shall return.

     The second is in the specification of the process followed by the disturbance

term in (7). If t   followed   an AR(1), the disturbance term would follow an ARMA(l,n).

In general, the disturbance term in (7) is likely to have an MA component at least o

order n. For computational convenience, we ignore this MA component and assume that

the disturbance term follows an AR process. We have found that an AR(l) appears

sufficient to yield white noise residuals.

     With these two approximations, equation (7) becDmes

    Prior   restrictions and identification



    The structural parameters in equation (7) are X, , n,             $,             and the

non—trivial elements of A ( is a vector of 1 and 0's>. From the previous sections we

have information on some of these elements, which we now use.

    From section 3, we know that n, the average delivery lag is for all sectors —

except petroleum— approximately equal to 3. Thus, we use n=3 in what follows''.
                                        i-I

     in section 4 we have estiaated the univariate representations of shipments. We
use these estimated coeffl:ients   to    construct the matri<       for each sector2. The

combination of the assumption that      n• arid   that S follows an      4 implies the

presence of S to S(—6) jr the investment equation.



     This leaves the parameters \, u, ,           and {w)i=O. . . ,:3.

     If the order—expenditure structure is left unconstrained, there are enough

structural parameters to fit the reduced form exactly. Even if we impose that the w,

be non negative, the model is in practice overparametrized and we are likely to end

up explaining the reduced form distributed lag by a pseudo structural order

expenditure lag structure. We therefore constrain the lag structure {Wt)         to   obey

     w free
        =   (1—) (l+w+,2)1wi,   for I =       12,3
     Weights are exponentially declining if w is less than unity, exponentially

increasing if w is greater than unity.



     Under the above assumptions, all remaining structural parameters are identified.

We have found however that our estimates of (X) and a-were highly correlated

asymptotically. Thus, it is impossible to estimate precisely the discount parameter

g3 and we are forced to assume rather than estimate the value of a. This is

unfortunate as a-, which measures the degree to whichfirms discount the future, is

one of the most interesting parameters of the model. We choose a value o-f a of .9

(values between .85 and .95 make little difference to the fit).

     Finally, returnlng to equation (8), we see that we can estimate separately ()

and (X—8). Using the values of   and    derived in sections 2 and 3 imposes an

overiderti4ying restriction on X ; using either    or 6 just identifies X. We decide

to estimate (Xe) and (X—) unconstrained. Given these estimates, we can by usinq the

values of   and 6 from the previous sections construct two estimates of X, one from

the reaction of investment to sales, and one from the eect of the past capital

stock on investment.



     Implied constrained reduced forms and estimated structural parameters.

      Equation (8) is estimated by maximum likelihood14. The results of estimation of

equation (8) are reported in tables B and 9. Table 8 reports the coefficients of the

constrained reduced form and repeats for comparison the coefficients of the

unconstrained reduced form already reported in table 2. Table 9 gives the values of

the structural parameters.



     We start with table 8. In addition to the coefficients, it gives the values ot

two test statistics. The first one, Li, tests the constrained model against a model

where all coefficients on shipments are equal to zero ;   it   shows therefore whether

shipments play an important role in explaining investment in the structural model.

The second one, L2, tests the constrained model, equation (8) against the

unconstrained reduced form, eqtiation (5) ; it shows therefore whether the constraints

imposed by the structural model on the distributed lag on shipments are rejected by

the data. Other things equal, high values of Li and low values of L2 are good news

for the structural model.

     Examining first the values of Li and L2 suggests the following conclusions.

Overall the structural model performs well in approximately two thirds of the

sectors. Looking at Li, the constrained model significantly outperforms (at the 5/.

level) a model with no role for shipments in 9 out of the 13 sectors. In 4 sectors

(FO,PA,CH,AC), the constrained distributed lag on shipments does not help predict

investment. Looking at L2, the restrictions imposed by the structural model are

significantly rejected in 6 of the sectors at the 57. level, and in 3 of them (PA,EM,

MV) at the ii level.

     Turning to the coefficients, the structural model is often successful at

replicating the unconstrained distributed lag structure (SCG, NEM in particular). The

model is able in most sectors to generate a flat, or slightly hump shaped distributed

lag structure.



    Being able to replicate approximately the reduced form is only good news if the

underlying estimated structural parameters make sense. These are given in table 9.

    Consider first the order expenditure lag structure implied by the estimates of

  and w. Apart from a few outliers, the results imply a relatively flat order

expenditure structure, which corresponds well to the available qualitative evidence
                                        A
    From the estimates of (Aot) and (O—X), and the values of   from table 1 and of 8

from table A, we construct two estimates of the gap parameter X. The first one, X1 is
                                    A
obtained by dividing the estimated (Xot) by , and is therefore derived from the

response of investment to movements in shipments. The second one, X2, is obtained by

subtracting from 8 the estimated ($—X), and is therefore obtained from the effect of

the lagged capital stock on investment. X and X2 are reported in the last two

columns of table 9 (they are measured at annual rates. Thus, an estimated value of X,

X, implies that investment responds within a quarter to close a proportion (X/4) of

the gap between desired and actual capital.

     The estimated value X varies between —.05 and .35. The estimated value of X2

varies between .08 and .17. The average value of X1 is equal to .19 (so that

approximately 57.   of the gap is closed within the quarter) and is higher than the

average value of X, .12 .    This result is interesting. One interpretation is that it
captures the notion that investment overreacts to sales. Consider for example the

case of motor vehicles     we have seen that the sales process is not very persistent

but that the effect of shipments on investment is large. The structural model

estiamtes therefore a large value of X1, consistent with low costs of adjustment.

But, if costs of adjustment were low, the effect of the lagged capital stock on

investment should be strongly negative and X2 should be large. Such is not the case

in this sense investment appears to overreact to sales. But the result that X1

exceeds k2 can also be due to the use of a proxy for the correct capital stock

series, which leads to a bias towards zero in its coefficient, and in turn to a

downwards bias in X2




     Section 6. Conclusion



    We set out to give a structural interpretation to the distributed lag relation

between investment and shipments at the 2 digit level. We have learned the following



     (1) Examination of the reduced form in section 2 reveals that there is no

standard and robust accelerator relation between investment and shipments at that

level of disaggregation. The relation between investment and shipments varies
                                      ,-'



substantially   across sectors. In all sectors, a good part of investment is not

explained by shipments ; indeed, in a few cases, there is no significant effect of

shipments on investment.

        When shipments affect investment, they do so through a long and rather flat, or

hump shaped, distributed lag.

        (2) Because the composition of capital is very similar across sectors, delivery

lag structures facing each sector are also very similar. All industries except

Petroleum face a mean delivery lag of approximately 3 quarters. Differences in

delivery lags are therefore unlikely candidates to explain differences in the effects

of shipments on investment across sectors.

        A byproduct of our work on delivery lags is also to show that they appear

procyclical. This suggests a non—linear specification of the effect of shipments on

investment that we do not pursue further in this paper.

        (3) Shipments follow very different processes across sectors. The processes

differ significantly in their dearee of persistence. There is a relation, although

not a tight one, between the degree of persistence of shipments and the size of the

effect of shipments on investment. This suQgests that the distributed lag in the

investment equation depends on the characteristics of the sales process in a way

which is at least qualitatively consistent with the theory.

        (4) The results of estimation of the structural model in section 5 suggest that

the following model can generate roughly the distributed lag structure found in the

data. Firms face delivery lags of 3 quarters. They also face adjustment costs, which

imply      (1) they take all future expected sales, with discount factor .9, into

consideration when constructing the desired capital stock ; and (2) they close 5 of

the gap between desired and actual capital stock each quarter. They pay for orders at

a constant rate between the time of order and the time of delivery.
     (5) While   this model can generate the long, flat or hump—shaped, distributed lag

found in the data, the ability of the structural model to fit each sector and to give

plausible explanations to differences across sectors is limited. The model performs

poorly in some sectors. It does not attribute differences in distributed lags across

sectors to any single main cause, such as differences in sales processes. In

particular, it attributes these differences in part to differences in both costs of

adjustment and in order expenditure lags. Although we do not have direct evidence on

these costs of adjustment, it is not clear why —especially given that capital

composition and delivery lags are so similar across sectors— costs of adjustment or

order—expenditure lags should differ substantially across sectors. It would be

interesting to examine formally how much of the differences across sectors could be

explained by differences in any one element, for example differences in shipment

processes with identical technologies (up to a capital shipment ratio) across

sectors. We have not done it yet.

     (6) We set up estimation of the   structural model so   as to get two separate

estimates of the gap parameter. A comparison of these estimates shows the estimate

obtained from the response to shipments often exceeds the one obtained from the

response of investment to the lagged capital stock. The result may be explained by

bias from the presence of errors in variables ; if not, it may indicate an

overreaction of investment to shipments. While this result is suggestive, our model

is too crude and ignores too many factors, and the difference between the two

estimates often too small for us to push it too strongly.

in the sector work however in sectors closely related to Motor Vehicles.

Such is not the case for Petroleum.



     Construction of Investment , Shipments and Orders

     Investment series are directly obtained from El]. Real shipments and

orders series are obtained by deflation of series in [2] by price

deflators constructed by aggregation of 3—digit deflators in [3], and by

time aggregation from monthly to quarterly and transformation to annual

rates.

     Construction of the capital stock series

     Time series for sectoral capital stocks are constructed using the

following accumulation equation
         =   (l—€3)K_   +

     where $ is the depreciation rate for capital of sector i. The

construction of $ is described in appendix B.

     The series is benchmarked so that the mean level of the capital

stock is equal to the mean level of investment expenditures divided by

the rate of growth of investment plus the rate of depreciation. This mean

capital stock value is used in table 1 to compute the mean

capital/shipments ratio, as the ratio of mean capital to mean shipments.
                                      A4

     This crude computation of the mean level of capital car be compared

to ratios using alternative establishment based measures of capital, such

as those given in [6]. Columns 4 and 5 of table A below give respectively

our estimated mean capital shipments ratio and the mean capital shipments

ratio implied by [6](The two definitions of capital differ slightly and

the results are not strictly comparable). The main discrepancy is for

Petroleum, due to the establishment/company discrepancy discussed above.




     Appendix B. Delivery lags



     Construction of capital composition

     Let i denote the sector, i denote the type of capital good, which

may be either a type of equipment or a structure. Let       gjj,     K
be respectively the depreciation rate, the rate of growth of capital, the

rate of investment arid the level of capital of type i in sector i. For a

given year, the following two identities hold
         =            — (l—E3)K(—1)
     l\jj —
     V   —           V J..
                  gij;rijt
     The above identities imply

              =   C
                                           /EE(C1+g)/(g+$)) I]

     This is the formula we use to compute capital composition. We

compute the composition for two different years 1967 and 1972 and then

take the average.
       Data for I are obtained by aggregation of capital flow     tables [J.
       Rates of growth g are assumed, for a given sector, to be the same

across all types of equipment. Thus for each sector i, only two values of

g are computed, one for equipment and one for structures. These are

computed using net capital measures from [6].

      Rates of depreciation O for each type of equipment are assumed to

be independent of the sector in which equipment is used. Thus, for

equipment, C 8 for all i. Depreciation rates for each type of

capital equipment are obtained from average lives, L, from IRS Bulletin

F lives (table 3 in [6]). These average lives are given in column I of

table A. Depreciation rates $ are then constructed as 2/Li.

      Rates of depreciation of structures are allowed to differ across

sectors of destination. Average lives of structures for each sector, L,

are computed using structure composition from [4] and lives by type of

structure from table 3 in 16]. These average lives are given in column 2

of   table   A. Depreciation rates are computed as 2/L1

      The implied sectoral capital compositions are reported in table 3 in

the text.

      Finally, the sector specific depreciation rates used to compute the

time series for capital in each sector,         are computed as

      Vj —   'LIV
                r'.ij,I\i1t'ij
                     11/

             .1


      The constructed depreciation rates are given in column 3 of table 4.




      Construction of delivery lags by type of qood
     Delivery lags are computed using the formula V/(1—b)S, where V1,

b and S1 are respectively unfilled orders, shipments and the proportion

of shipments sold to wholesalers and retailers. V and S are obtained

from the [7] for 1977 and b1 is obtained from table 13a in [7]. The

values of b1 are 467. for FM, 42 for NEM and 467. for EM. The implied

delivery lags can be compared to estimates by the Department of Commerce

(Survey of Current Business, July 1975) using a different approach ; they

are very similar.
Footnotes



 1.      Even if we take as given that investment depends on demand, there are three

possible candidates, production, orders and sales (shipments). Production data must

be constructed using finished goods inventory data and are not of high quality. This

leaves orders or shipments. Which one is appropriate depends on the technology. If

the technology is a "referee report' technology in which orders are shelved until

processed, capital requirements are more closely related to shipments. If the

technology is a "pipeline" technology, in which production takes time and production

starts upon receipt of orders, orders are more appropriate. Not knowing what

technology is more appropriate, we have done estimation both using shipments and

using orders. Because of space constraints, we only report results using shipments

here ;    results   using orders are not qualitatively different.

2.       To state more explicitly our position, we believe that the relation from

shipments to investment is indeed largely causal (see Blanchard (1986))          we believe

that the cost of capital affects investment, but our reading of empirical work is

that leaving it out is unlikely to bias the coefficients on sales substantially.

3.       If o and X are the parameters obtained from the standard quadratic cost of

adjustment model, they depend on the rate at which the firm discounts profits ,, and

on the degree of convexity of the cost function and of costs of adjustment. They are

related by the following       X =   i—(aI).   We do not impose this relation in what

follows

4.    Jorgenson and Stephenson (1967) also assume that n periods elapse between the

ordering of capital and the first arrival of capital. An extension would be to allow

for different delivery laos. However, doing so is interesting only if capital is

heterogenous. See Lucas (196) for a discussion. This leads to too complex an

empirical specification.
5.     The use c-f     approximate"   is   due to the fact that, in ing from the structural

model to (5), two appr-o:mations are made. One is the use of K as an empirical

counterpart to the variable implied by (I) to (4), which is unobservable. The other

is in the approximation by an AR(1) of the process ollowed by the disturbance term.

This is further discussed in Section 5.

6.    Because        denotes the ratio o capital to annual shipments, X is also expressed

at annual rates. That is, for a given value X, investment will close during a quarter

(X/4) of the dierence between desired and actual capital. This is why the number 4

rather than 1 appears in the tent.

7.    This result, which initially surprised us, is in fact consistent with previous

studies at the sectoral level (see for example references in the surveys by Jorgenson

(1971) and Uri(1982)). These studies usually report the R2 on the original variables,

which is obviously much higher. In our case for example, it always exceeds .9.

B.    I-f we recognized explicitly the heterogeneity of capital in our model of

investment and assumed for e>ample the technology to be Leantief in the various types

of capital, the longest delivery lag would be more relevant than the mean lag.

Sectors would still look fairly similar.

9.    Because we do not make any explicit correction for the fact that production is

partly to stock, or equivalently that some of the orders are satisfied without lag

from the shelf, the estimated mean lag is much shorter than the estimated delivery

lag constructed earlier.

10.    This joint assumption implies that investment should not help predict sales

given past sales and is thus testable. It is rejected in three sectors at the 57.

level, and in two (Petroleum, Aircraft) at the 17. level. Thus, for these two sectors,

the results below are biased. For the other ten sectors, the assumption in the text

is an acceptable first approximation.
11.    We have also done estimation assuming n 4 and n= for Petroleum. The

differences are not substantial.

12.    Thus, rather than estimating (6) and (B) simultaneously, we first estimate (6)

and replace A in (B) by its estimated counterpart. This procedure is much cheaper as

the first estimation is linear but is less asymptotically efficient.

13.    The difficulty of   estimating   precisely the discount rate in that type of

estimation has often been documented.

14.    The likelihood function is maximized using Davidon—Fletcher—Fowell until

convergence. Newton—Raphson is then used to obtain an estimate of the covariance

matrix of the estimated parameters.
