                                              ABSTRACT

The ability of consumers to make informed financial decisions improves their ability to develop sound
personal finance. This paper uses a panel dataset from Russia, an economy in which consumer loans
grew at an astounding rate - from about US$10 billion in 2003 to over US$170 billion in 2008 - to
examine the importance of financial literacy and its effects on behavior. The survey contains questions
on financial literacy, consumer borrowing (formal and informal), saving and spending behavior. The
paper studies both the financial consequences and the real consequences of financial illiteracy. Even
though consumer borrowing increased very rapidly in Russia, the authors find that only 41% of respondents
demonstrate understanding of the workings of interest compounding and only 46% can answer a simple
question about inflation. Financial literacy is positively related to participation in financial markets
and negatively related to the use of informal sources of borrowing. Moreover, individuals with higher
financial literacy are significantly more likely to report having greater availability of unspent income
and higher spending capacity. The relationship between financial literacy and availability of unspent
income is higher during the financial crisis, suggesting that financial literacy may better equip individuals
to deal with macroeconomic shocks.

1.       Introduction

         The 2008 financial crisis, characterized in part by mounting losses for individuals,

has generated interest in better understanding how to promote savvier saving and

borrowing behavior. The ability of individuals to make informed financial decisions is

critical to developing sound personal finance, which can contribute to more efficient

allocation of financial resources and to greater financial stability at both the micro and

macro level (see, e.g., Lusardi, 2008; Lusardi and Tufano, 2009a,b). Efforts to improve

financial literacy can also be an important component of efforts to increase saving rates

and lending to the poorest and most vulnerable consumers (Cole, Sampson and Zia,

2011).

         Our paper extends the existing literature in a new direction, using a panel survey

of financial literacy administered to a nationally representative sample of over 1,000

Russian individuals prior to and during the 2008 financial crisis. Russia is a particularly

important country to study given the large increase in consumer credit it has recently

experienced: Consumer loans (excluding mortgages) in Russia grew at an astonishing

rate: from about US$ 10 billion in 2003 to over US$ 170 billion in 2008—accounting for

over 10% of GDP in 2008 versus less than 1% in 2003 (World Development Indicators,

2010). This is one of the few panel data sets on financial literacy, and with it we are able

to address some novel questions, such as What is the level of financial literacy in a

country without a legacy of consumer credit and financial education? Are there not only

financial but also real consequences of low financial literacy? Are lower levels of

financial literacy related to greater financial vulnerability during a crisis, i.e., are less

financially literate individuals less able to deal with financial crises?


                                               2
       Assessing the direction of causality between financial literacy and financial

decision making or consumption and saving behavior has been a challenge in previous

work, as financial literacy is potentially an endogenous variable. However, this

assessment in a country like Russia may suffer less from the endogeneity problem, as

financial markets are not well developed and there are few financial education programs

in place. In our empirical work we are able to address this problem by relying on

instrumental variables (IV) estimation and using a new set of instruments, i.e., the

number of newspapers and the number of universities across regions, to measure

exposure to financial information or to peers with higher financial knowledge.

Importantly, because we have a panel data set, we are also able to account for

unobservable variables, such as intelligence, ability, and interest in financial matters,

which can also affect the relationship between financial literacy and financial or real

outcomes.

       We find that even though consumer borrowing increased very rapidly in Russia

between 2003 and 2008, only 41% of respondents in our sample have an understanding of

the workings of interest compounding and only 46% can answer a simple question about

inflation. Financial literacy is not only low in the general population, but is particularly

severe among specific groups, such as women, those with low income and low

educational attainment, and those living in rural areas. Most importantly, we find that

financial literacy in Russia is significantly related to the use of formal banking and

borrowing and negatively related to the use of informal borrowing. Financial literacy has

real as well as financial consequences: Even after accounting for many characteristics and

income, individuals with greater financial literacy are significantly more likely to report



                                             3
having higher availability of unspent income and less likely to report having experienced

lower spending capacity. In addition, the relationship between financial literacy and

availability of unspent income is stronger in 2009 versus 2008, showing that financial

literacy may better equip individuals to deal with macroeconomic shocks.

        Our findings suggest that rapid growth of consumer credit combined with low

levels of financial literacy—and the shock of the global financial crisis—might end up

being a dangerous mix. As Russia transitions quickly to a market-based banking system,

financial education and basic financial literacy are still lagging. Many young Russians

have parents who did not have experience with bank loans (i.e., they did not have an

opportunity to receive financial education at home)1 and did not receive formal financial

literacy courses in school (i.e., there is no curriculum requirement for financial education

in Russia). Furthermore, consumer debt was almost non-existent before 2001, so few

individuals are likely to have long personal banking relationships or experience with

formal debt contracts and other financial products. In the context of current events, this is

likely to be the first financial crisis that most Russians are experiencing as borrowers.

        The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the existing literature on

financial literacy and its effects on financial decision-making; Section 3 reviews the

environment for consumer finance in Russia; Section 4 describes our data, variables, and

summary statistics; and Section 5 presents our empirical strategy and reports our results.

Section 6 concludes.

 Although state banks existed in Soviet times, their main role was to serve state-owned enterprises. There
were no credit-reporting bureaus and the availability of credit to private firms and individuals was limited
(McMillan and Woodruff, 2002). For the correlation between financial literacy of the young and parental
background, see Lusardi, Mitchell, and Curto (2010).

                                                     4
2.      Review of existing literature

       Many papers have documented a strong correlation between financial literacy and

a set of behaviors. Bernheim (1995, 1998) showed that most households lack basic

financial knowledge and cannot perform very simple calculations, and that the saving

behavior of many households is dominated by crude rules of thumb. Hilgert, Hogarth,

and Beverly (2003) find a strong link between financial literacy and day-to-day financial

management. Financial literacy has also been linked to a set of behaviors related to

saving, wealth, and portfolio choice. For example, several papers have shown that

individuals with greater numeracy and financial literacy are more likely to participate in

financial markets and to invest in stocks (Christelis, Jappelli, and Padula, 2010; Yoong,

2011; Almenberg and Dreber, 2001; Almenberg and Widmark, 2011; Van Rooij, Lusardi,

and Alessie, 2011). Moreover, more literate individuals are more likely to choose mutual

funds with lower fees (Hastings and Tejeda-Ashton, 2008; Hastings and Mitchell, 2011).

       Similarly, Lusardi and Mitchell (2007a, 2011d) show that those who display high

levels of literacy are more likely to plan for retirement and, as a result, accumulate much

more wealth, a finding reproduced in many of the countries that are part of an

international comparison of financial literacy, which includes Russia (Lusardi and

Mitchell, 2011c). Financial literacy is found to affect not only the assets side but also the

liability side of households’ balance sheet. Moore (2003) was one of the first to report

that respondents with lower levels of financial literacy are more likely to have costly

mortgages. More recently, Gerardi, Goette, and Meier (2010) report that those with low

literacy are more likely to default on sub-prime mortgage or have problems with them.

Stango and Zinman (2009) find that those who are not able to correctly calculate interest



                                             5
rates out of a stream of payments end up borrowing more and accumulating lower

amounts of wealth. Campbell (2006) shows that individuals with lower incomes and

lower education levels—characteristics that are strongly related to financial literacy—are

less likely to refinance their mortgages during a period of falling interest rates. Lusardi

and Tufano (2009a,b) report that individuals with lower levels of financial literacy tend to

transact in high-cost manners, incurring higher fees and using high-cost methods of

borrowing. The less knowledgeable also report that their debt loads are excessive or that

they are unable to judge their debt position. Similar findings are reported in the UK

(Disney and Gathergood, 2011).

       In addition to greater susceptibility to fraud and abuse, lack of financial literacy

might lead to borrower behavior that increases financial fragility (i.e., greater loan

losses). Informed consumers may also exercise innovation-enhancing demand on the

financial sector and play an important monitoring role in the market that can help

improve transparency and honesty in financial institutions. Furthermore, financial

illiteracy appears to be particularly severe for key demographic groups: women; the less

educated; those with low income; ethnic minorities; and older respondents (e.g.,

Bernheim, 1995; Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007a, 2007b, 2008, 2011b; Lusardi and Tufano,

2009a,b; inter alia).

       Correlation between financial literacy and behavior does not mean causation, and

it is important to establish a causal link. Nevertheless, obtaining an exogenous source of

variation in financial literacy has been challenging. For example, it may be the desire to

invest in stocks or plan for retirement that causes individuals to invest in financial literacy

rather than the other way around. There also may be some omitted variables, such as



                                              6
ability or patience, that affect both financial literacy and financial behavior. One way

around this problem is to look at financial mistakes and assess whether they are

correlated with financial literacy, as it is harder to argue that the causality goes from

mistakes to financial literacy. Interestingly, Agarwal et al. (2009) show that financial

mistakes are prevalent among the young and the elderly, which are the groups that

display the lowest levels of financial knowledge. Calvet, Campbell, and Sodini (2007,

2009) examine data from Sweden and look at actions of investors that can be classified as

mistakes. They find that poorer, less educated, and immigrant households—demographic

characteristics that are strongly associated with low financial literacy—are more likely to

make financial mistakes.

       Another strategy has been to rely on instrumental variable (IV) estimation.

Several instruments have been used. For example, Lusardi and Mitchell (2009, 2011d)

follow Bernheim and Garrett (2001) in using high school financial literacy mandates in

different states and time periods in the United States. Van Rooij, Lusardi, and Alessie

(2011) have used the financial literacy of others, such as siblings and parents. Behrman et

al. (2010) use data from the Chilean Social Protection Survey and a set of plausibly

exogenous instrumental variables that satisfy critical diagnostic tests to isolate the causal

effects of financial literacy on wealth. All these studies show that financial literacy is

positively associated with a set of financial outcomes. Moreover, the IV estimates

indicate even more potent effects of financial literacy than suggested by OLS models.

       Financial literacy also appears to be correlated with economic development; for

instance, the percentage of individuals in the United States that correctly answered

questions on interest compounding and inflation was 72% versus 79% in the Netherlands,



                                             7
52% in Indonesia, 46% in Russia, and 34% in rural India (Figure 1).2 These findings have

been supported in recent studies using randomized control trials to explore the causal

impact of financial literacy on financial outcomes. For instance, in Indonesia, a randomly

selected set of unbanked individuals were offered financial literacy training sessions,

which were found to increase the demand for banking services among those with low

initial levels of financial literacy and low levels of education (Cole et al., 2011).

3.      The Russian Banking System

        This paper focuses on Russia, an economy that grew at a brisk rate in the past

decade and experienced a very sharp increase in consumer borrowing, as will be

described below. This setting provides a unique opportunity to examine the importance

and effects of financial literacy.

        The Russian economy grew, on average, by almost 7% annually from 2001 to

2009, while annual per capita income grew from US$ 2,101 in 2001 to US$ 8,676 in

2009, an increase of over 400% (Figure 2). This rapid increase in purchasing power was

associated with an increase in demand for consumer credit, particularly for the purchase

of household appliances and other durable goods (Presniakova, 2006).3 Within this same

time period, as mentioned earlier, consumer loans grew at a very fast rate, reaching US$

170 billion in 2008 (preceding a decline to about US$ 120 billion in 2009). This

accounted for about 10% of GDP in 2009 versus about 2% in 2003.

Russia is calculated by the authors.

  It is possible that Russians are more comfortable borrowing for durable goods, as buying goods on
installment was quite popular in Soviet times.

                                                    8
                                   [Insert Figure 2 about here]

       In aggregate, the Russian banking system grew at a rate of over 40% between

2003 and 2008, with almost a trillion US$ in assets in 2008. Yet, despite this recent

growth, the Russian banking system remains small by international standards; domestic

credit to the private sector was 41% of GDP in 2008, relative to other markets such as

Brazil (54%), India (49%), and China (104%). In addition, the proportion of household

loans as a percentage of GDP in 2007 is below 10%, lower than the rate in many

developing Eastern European states (15%) and developed Western European states

(above 50%) (Oxford Analytica, 2007b). Furthermore, in 2006, close to 60 million

Russians (42% of the population) were estimated to not be part of the formal banking

system (Rohland, 2008).

       Banks in Russia generally face an unfavorable investment climate, as indicated by

Russia’s ranking of 123rd out of 181 countries in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing

Business ranking (where 1 indicates the most favorable business environment) (Doing

Business, 2011). In this measure, Russia is ranked 89th in “getting credit,” which takes

into account creditor protection and the credit information sharing infrastructure.

       Within this weak business environment, there is concern that the tremendous

growth of credit will be associated with high rates of default, in particular if rapid growth

in consumer credit is combined with low levels of financial literacy among borrowers.

The share of bad consumer loans was a sizeable 12.25% in 2010 (Central Bank of Russia,

2011). It is within this rather unique context that our survey instrument was designed.



4.     Data and Summary Statistics



                                             9
         We use a panel dataset of Russian individuals in May/June 2008 and in June

2009. The 2008 sample was designed to be nationally representative at the individual

level, and weighted by gender, age, education, 46 oblasts (i.e., administrative regions),

and 7 federal region4 for a total of 1,600 individuals interviewed face-to-face.5 This is one

of the very few panel surveys measuring financial literacy and other key variables over

time. In 2009, 22% of individuals from the original sample either no longer resided at the

same location or refused to answer the follow-up survey. However, analysis of the data

between the two years does not show evidence of significant selection bias across the

covariates used in the empirical work (available upon request).

         These surveys collected information on individual levels of financial literacy (i.e.,

numeracy, knowledge of interest compounding, understanding of inflation), as well as

use of financial services (e.g., the use of bank accounts and formal credit). The dataset

also provides rich demographic and socioeconomic information, and measures of

financial vulnerability. The primary respondent was the household head, without an age

limit.

                                     [Insert Table 1 about here]



4.1      Demographic Information

         Table 1 provides summary statistics of the pooled sample (2008 and 2009). The

percentage of male respondents is 43.9%, consistent with national census averages

4
  Since March 1, 2008, the Russian Federation consists of 83 federal subjects. Six types of federal subjects
are distinguished: 21 republics, 9 krais, 46 oblasts, 2 federal cities, 1 autonomous oblast, and 4 autonomous
okrugs. We exclude the North-Caucasian (Chechnya) district because civil unrest prohibited surveying.
5
  Summary statistics by gender, age, and education (% with secondary degrees) are very similar to those
found in the 2002 Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (LSMS), as well as the 2002 Russian National
Census. Relative to the census data, however, our survey appears to under-represent individuals in the
highest income bracket. This is likely the result of difficulty gaining access to the highest income
individuals, many of whom live in gated housing communities, in order to conduct face-to-face interviews.

                                                     10
(Russian National Census, 2002). The average age in the pooled sample is around 45.

Most individuals (66%) live in households with three or more individuals, and 28.2% of

individuals live in urban regions, defined as settlements with a population greater than

500,000.

        With respect to employment, 52.5% are employees (both skilled and unskilled),

while 25.5% are retirees. The education level of individuals in our sample is relatively

high: only 8.4% of the sample has less than a secondary education, 29.9% completed

secondary school, and 61.8% completed a special vocational/ technical school or initiated

or completed their higher education, a characteristic that sets Russia apart from other

emerging markets and makes it a particularly useful country to study.

        The survey asks individuals to report their personal and household monthly

income, but these values are missing for almost 30% of the sample, i.e., individuals who

refused to answer.6 For our main regressions in the next section we impute missing

income observations and include dummies for brackets of family income rather than

using income values.7

        The survey also includes a self-reported measure of income shocks.8 Individuals

are asked, “Did you (your family) experience an unexpected significant reduction of your


6
  In our sample, mean personal monthly income for 2008 is US$ 762 (US$ 2,345 median income), while
average family monthly income is US$ 1,494 (US$ 12,500 median). This compares closely with official
statistics for 2008 of average per capita monthly income of US$ 1,404. Source: Russian Federation Federal
State Statistics Service: http://www.gks.ru/bgd/regl/b10_06/IssWWW.exe/Stg/1/17-01.htm
7
  The imputation methodology is based on regressions of family income on federal regions, gender, age,
education categories, and self-assessed economic classification groups. The corresponding figures for each
of the quartiles of the imputed income distribution are the following: Bottom quartile (1st): monthly income
< US$833; 2nd quartile: $833 ≤ monthly income < $1,433; 3rd quartile: $1,433 ≤ monthly income < $2,084;
4th quartile: monthly income ≥ $ 2,084.
8
  This is a categorical variable: the first category is individuals who report that they do not have enough
money, even for food (7%); the next category is individuals who report they can buy food, but cannot buy
clothes (23%); the third category is individuals who report they can buy food and clothes, but not durable
goods (e.g., a television or refrigerator) (52%); finally, individuals who report they can buy durable goods
(16%).

                                                    11
income over the past 12 months,” and we define a dummy “Income shocks” for those

who answer yes to this question. The summary statistics in Table 1 show that 35.9% of

the sample reported the experience of a negative income shock during 2009, showing that

the crisis and associated decline in income affected a large share of the Russian

population.

                                         [Insert Table 2 about here]



4.2      Use of Formal and Informal Credit

         Our next set of variables measures financial inclusion, which includes variables

related to respondent affiliation with financial institutions and borrowing behavior.9 Our

first variable is “Bank Account,” which indicates whether an individual uses a bank

account (which includes the use of debit cards). In Russia it is common practice for an

employer to provide employees with an account and associated debit card, so-called

salary or “plastic” cards, at a bank chosen by the employer, and salaries are paid to these

accounts only. However, the employee can use this account only to withdraw salary, and

cannot make deposits to the account; thus, this may overestimate the actual voluntary

“use” of bank accounts (Danske Bank, 2011). Similarly, accounts might be used only to

withdraw government transfers. In our sample, 33.8% of respondents report using a

checking account in 2008 and 35% in 2009, with only 13 individuals (1.2%) adding an

account in 2009 and no individuals closing an account (changes in financial usage

between the two years are shown in Table 2).


9
  An important feature to note about Russia is the absolute lack of and relatively low levels of trust in the
banking sector, which is potentially an important factor in explaining the low level of use of banking
products. Remarkably, only 28% of surveyed individuals in Russia report confidence in banks, the second
to lowest score in the region (EBRD, 2006).

                                                     12
           We also have information on consumer credit received from a bank or other

formal financial institution, including consumer debt, credit card debt, and mortgages.10

In 2008, 18.1% of our sample received bank credit and in 2009, 17.7% did so. Table 2

shows that 12.2% of the sample (131 individuals) used bank credit in 2008 but not in

2009, while 11.8% of the sample (127 individuals) who did not have bank credit in 2008

did have it in 2009.

           We measure the use of informal debt by defining a dummy that equals one when

individuals respond “yes” to the question “Do you currently have debt?” but do not

report having any bank credit. In 2008, 17% of individuals in the sample report using

informal sources of borrowing, while 12.9% of individuals used informal borrowing in

2009; 13% of the sample used informal borrowing only in 2008, and 9% used informal

borrowing only in 2009. Note that informal borrowing typically involves shorter

repayment periods than formal borrowing, along with higher interest rates, penalties, and

other fees.



4.3        Capacity to Spend and Save

           The next set of variables assesses respondent spending and saving capacity. The

survey includes a self-reported measure of spending capacity. This is a categorical

variable: the first category is individuals who report that they do not have enough money,

even for food (7%); the next category is individuals who report that they can buy food,

but cannot buy clothes (23%); the third category is individuals who report they can buy

food and clothes but not durable goods (e.g., a TV set or refrigerator) (52%); the final

category is individuals who report they can buy food, clothes, and durable goods (16%).
10
     Less than 5% of individuals have a mortgage or credit card.

                                                      13
We use an ordinal variable ranking between 1 (highest spending capacity) and 5 (lowest

spending capacity) (see footnote 5) and, for robustness, define a dummy variable for

individuals who report not having enough money for more than food. As shown in Table

1, 31.6% of individuals in the sample report low spending capacity, with the figure being

higher during 2009 (33.1%, compared to 30.1% in 2008), consistent with the financial

crisis experienced in that time period.

       A second set of variables measures the availability of unspent income, based on

the question “How often during the last 12 months did you (or your family) have any

money unspent from previous earnings before new revenues arrived.” The menu of

responses is “always,” “very often,” “sometimes,” “very rarely,” and “never.” Our main

results use an ordinal variable ranging from 1 to 5, and, for robustness, we also define a

dummy variable equal to one if the respondent reports “always” or “very often.” The

statistics shown in Tables 1 and 2 indicate that 39.4% of the sample report having

unspent income “always” or “very often” on a typical basis, and that the availability of

unspent income increased significantly from 34% in 2008 to 44.8% in 2009. We

speculate that at the onset of the crisis, some individuals increased their saving (and/or

reduced their spending), expecting to have lower income in the future. The ordinal

variable for the availability of unspent income has an average value of 2.36, with the

average being significantly higher in 2009 (2.57, compared to 2.14 in 2008).



4.4    Financial Literacy




                                           14
       Our survey includes four financial literacy questions, covering the concepts of

interest (two questions), inflation (one question), and sales discounts (one question). The

exact wording of the questions is reported below:

1) Let’s assume that you deposited 100,000 rubles in a bank account for 5 years at 10%
interest rate. The interest will be earned at the end of each year and will be added to the
principal. How much money will you have in your account in 5 years if you do not
withdraw either the principal or the interest?
      More than 150,000 rubles
      Exactly 150,000 rubles
      Less than 150,000 rubles
      I cannot estimate the amount even roughly

2) Let’s assume that you took a bank credit of 10,000 rubles to be paid back during a
year in equal monthly payments. The credit charge is 600 rubles. Give a rough estimate
of the annual interest rate on your credit. The interest rate is about:
      3%
      6%
      9%
      12 %
      I cannot estimate it even roughly

3) Let’s assume that in 2010 your income is twice what it is now and that consumer
prices also grow twofold. Do you think that in 2010 you will be able to buy more, less, or
the same amount of goods and services as today?
      More than today
      Exactly the same
      Less than today
      I cannot estimate it even roughly

4) Let’s assume that you saw a TV set of the same model on sale in two different shops.
The initial retail price of it was 10,000 rubles. One shop offered a discount of 1,500
rubles, while the other one offered a 10% discount. Which one is a better bargain—a
discount of 1,500 rubles or 10%?
      A discount of 1,500 rubles
      A 10 % discount
      I cannot estimate it even roughly

       Similar questions have been asked in other surveys, such as the U.S. Health and

Retirement Study, the American Life Panel, and the English Longitudinal Study on

Aging, and have been shown to measure both numeracy and financial knowledge



                                             15
(Lusardi and Mitchell, 2009, 2011c; Banks and Oldfield, 2007; Stango and Zinman,

2009).

         On average, in 2008, 41.4% of respondents correctly answered the question on

interest compounding; 23.3% correctly answered the monthly interest payment

calculation question; 45.6% correctly answered the question on inflation; and 69.5%

correctly answered the question on sales discounts. A large number of respondents

reported they “did not know” the answer to these questions. On average, in the pooled

sample, 30% of individuals replied “don’t know” to the question on interest

compounding; 49% to the question on monthly interest payments; 24% to the question on

inflation; and 22% to the question on sales discounts. These findings are similar to those

reported in other surveys (Van Rooij et al., 2011; Lusardi and Mitchell, 2011b; and

Lusardi and Tufano, 2009a,b), and in data in other seven countries (Lusardi and Mitchell,

2011c). Notably, we find that correct responses to all but one question increased during

the financial crisis, which might be explained by increased attention to financial issues in

the media or a rise in individuals’ interest in understanding their own finances.

                               [Insert Table 3 about here]



4.4.1    Constructing a Financial Literacy Index

         We construct an index of financial literacy using principal component analysis

(PCA) to summarize the information from the four questions detailed in the previous

subsection. For each question, we create a binary variable to identify the correct response

and perform PCA analysis based on polychoric correlations, following the method

developed to adapt PCA to ordinal data by Kolenikov and Angeles (2004). We estimate



                                             16
the financial literacy index as the first principal component of the four financial literacy

questions. The procedure is described in greater detail in Appendix A for the year 2008

(the analysis for 2009 is available upon request). The corresponding distribution of

eigenvalues is presented in Appendix A, Panel B (the first component accounts for 53%

of the variation) and the factor loadings/scoring coefficients for the index are detailed in

Panel C.11 The financial literacy index distribution is shown in Panel E.



4.4.2    Who is Financially Literate in Russia?

         Table 1, columns 2 and 3, show summary statistics for individuals with high and

low levels of financial literacy; asterisks indicate significant mean differences. We

identify “high” financial literacy as individuals with a financial literacy index greater than

the sample median. Univariate tests find that financially literate individuals are more

likely to be male, married or cohabiting, younger, and residents of urban Russian regions.

They are more likely to have vocational/technical, or some level of higher education, and

be employed in skilled or non-manual occupations. Importantly, individuals in the lowest

income quartile are more likely to score low in terms of their financial literacy, while

those in the highest income quartile are more likely to be highly financially literate. This

is consistent with many other surveys on financial literacy in other countries (see Lusardi

and Mitchell, 2011b, for an overview of financial literacy data in eight countries and

Christelis, Jappelli, and Padula, 2010, for an overview in eleven countries).



11
  Although we retain the first factor for the purpose of parsimony, the optimal number of factors, identified
by Humphrey-Ilgen parallel analysis (Lance, Butts, and Michels, 2006), is in fact two. We compare the
number of factors derived from our survey data against factors for random numbers representing the same
number of cases and variables and obtain the optimal number of factors at the intersection of plots of
factors against cumulative eigenvalues for the two sets of data (Panel D).

                                                     17
       Of primary interest to this study is the association between financial literacy and

financial outcomes. Table 1 indicates that there is a moderately positive association

between financial literacy and having a bank account (also shown in the correlation

matrix between financial literacy and bank account in Appendix Table B3). Individuals in

the high literacy group are also significantly more likely to use formal bank credit. In

addition, high literacy groups are significantly less likely to experience low spending

capacity, both in terms of the binary and the ordinal spending capacity variable. In

contrast, individuals with higher financial literacy are significantly more likely to

experience having unspent income and with higher frequency.



5.     Financial and Real Consequences of Financial Literacy

       The important question we aim to address in this paper is whether financial

literacy matters. To do so, we consider the following set of outcomes that expand upon

the previous literature. We first estimate a set of regressions in which the dependent

variable is (a) having a bank account, (b) using formal bank credit, and (c) using informal

credit. In addition to financial consequences we also look at real consequences. Our set of

dependent variables is (a) level of spending capacity and (b) availability of unspent

income. The sets of explanatory variables in our regressions include financial literacy,

gender, single-person household, the logarithm of age, a dummy for a negative income

shock during the last year, and dummy variables for education (4 dummies), occupation

(8 dummies), family income quartiles, and federal region of residence (7 dummies).



5.1    Empirical Strategy



                                            18
       Because we have a panel data set, we are better equipped to assess the effect of

financial literacy on a set of outcomes than previous studies. First, we use 2009 measures

of financial inclusion and outcomes and 2008 values of financial literacy and other

explanatory variables. We use past values of the independent variables to account for

both the potential simultaneity between financial literacy and financial outcomes, along

with the potential endogeneity of the financial literacy measure.

       Second, we use IV estimation to assess the impact of financial literacy on

financial behavior. Two instruments are used: (a) the number of newspapers in circulation

per two-digit region (both regional and national) and (b) the total number of universities

per two-digit region (both public and private). The two variables can be expected to be

correlated with financial literacy in terms of “exposure” to newspaper readership (either

directly or through family members and neighbors who read the paper) and higher

education of peers in the region. The experience of others is not under the control of the

respondent and is thus exogenous with respect to his or her actions, but respondents can

learn from those around them, thus increasing their own literacy. Several other studies

have documented that individuals learn about financial matters from peers (Duflo and

Saez, 2003; Hong, Kubik, and Stein, 2004; and Brown, Ivkovic, Smith, and Weisbenner,

2008). Studies have also documented the importance of proximity to a university as an

exogenous measure of financial knowledge (Christiansen, Joensen, and Rangvid, 2008).

       The bottom of Table 1 shows that the average number (by two-digit region) of

newspapers is 56 and the average number of universities is 18 (11 public and 7 private).




                                            19
Appendix C presents maps illustrating the regional variation in the number of newspapers

in circulation and the number of universities in the 46 Russian oblasts of our sample.12

        Third, to account for unobserved heterogeneity that can account for the

relationship between financial literacy and our set of outcomes, we use both years of data

and estimate individual random effects and fixed effects models.



5.2     Empirical estimates: Financial outcomes

        Our first set of estimates examines the correlates of the use of bank accounts by

respondents in our sample. Due to the low number of new bank accounts for the year

2009 in the sample, panel models cannot be estimated. Table 4 presents probit estimates.

The dependent variable is a dummy equal to one if the individual reports having a bank

account in 2009 and equal to zero otherwise. Explanatory variables are dated as of 2008

in order to mitigate as much as possible simultaneity problems. Marginal effects and

robust standard errors are presented throughout the table.

        Column 1 of Panel A shows the baseline probit estimates, which exclude

measures of financial literacy. We find that individuals who are older, more educated,

and have higher income are more likely to have a bank account, consistent with findings

in other countries (Christelis, Jappelli, and Padula, 2010; Cole, Sampson and Zia, 2011).

Columns 2, 3, and 4 include our two measures of financial literacy (an index and the

number of correct responses to the financial literacy questions). Both measures show a

significantly positive effect (at the 10% level) of financial literacy on the likelihood of

12
  In terms of federal regions (figures available upon request), the Central federal region, Volga, and the
Southern region have the highest newspaper circulation, while the Urals, the Far-Eastern, and the Siberian
region have the lowest numbers of newspapers in circulation. Moreover, the Southern region has the
highest number of universities, with the next highest being the North-Western and the Central regions. The
lowest numbers of universities are found in the Urals, the Far-Eastern, and the Siberian federal region.

                                                   20
using a bank account. The marginal effects suggest a sizeable impact: a one standard

deviation increase from the average level of financial literacy raises the likelihood of

using a bank account by 6.3–8.8%, depending on the measure used. Also note that adding

financial literacy does not much affect the estimates of education; thus, financial

knowledge has an effect above and beyond general schooling.

                                         [Insert Table 4 about here]

        Panel B of Table 4 presents IV probit estimates of the probability of using a bank

account. In this specification, we take into account that financial literacy could be an

endogenous variable. Moreover, financial literacy can be measured with error, and this

can also affect the estimated effect of financial literacy on the probability of having a

bank account. As discussed earlier, the set of instruments used to instrument financial

literacy is the total number of newspapers in circulation and the number of public and

private universities in every Russian oblast. The first-stage regressions are shown in

Appendix Table B1. The two instruments have a positive and statistically significant

impact on financial literacy. Both the F-statistics from the tests of joint significance and

the LM tests of omitted variables shown at the bottom of the table reject the null

hypotheses of joint insignificance and “significant improvement” to the model.13

        The estimates in the second stage, reported in the last two columns of Table 4,

show that the relationship between literacy and bank account ownership remains positive,

statistically significant, and is somewhat larger in the IV probit estimates than in the OLS

estimates. Moreover, the exogeneity test is not rejected. Thus, the OLS estimates do not




13
  The tests stem from two separate specifications for the first stage models, i.e. one incorporating the two
instruments and another without the two instrumental variables, respectively.

                                                    21
differ significantly from the IV estimates. Moreover, the Hansen J statistic of

overidentifying restriction at the bottom of the table shows that the instruments are valid.

         In Table 5, we examine the impact of financial literacy on the probability of using

formal bank credit. The probit estimates with past values (dated 2008) of the independent

variables in Columns A2 and A3 show that financial literacy is significantly positively

related to the likelihood of having formal credit. The marginal effects show that a one

standard deviation increase from the average level of financial literacy raises the

likelihood of acquiring formal credit by 14–18%, depending on the measure used.

                                          [Insert Table 5 about here]

         Panel B of Table 5 presents IV probit estimates. The statistics reported at the

bottom of the table reject the hypothesis that the instruments are not valid.14 The

estimates confirm the positive and statistically significant association between financial

literacy and formal credit. The magnitude of the marginal effects is very similar to the

baseline probit estimates.

         One concern is that there are omitted variables (for example, ability) that can bias

the estimated effect of financial literacy. In Panels C and D of Table 5 we make use of the

panel aspect of the data and report estimates from random effects probit and fixed effects

logit models. The latter model excludes observations that do not vary within the panel,15

and hence uses a smaller sample. Both the marginal effects from the random effects


14
   Additional linear probability models examine instrument validity. The results are available upon request.
The weak-instrument robust-inference tests examine the null hypothesis that the coefficients of the
endogenous regressors in the structural equation are jointly equal to zero and that the overidentifying
restrictions are not rejected. Both tests are robust to the use of weak instruments. The tests are equivalent to
estimating the reduced form of the equation (with the full set of instruments as regressors) and testing that
the coefficients of the excluded instruments are jointly equal to zero. The Hansen J statistic of
overidentifying restriction at the bottom of the table marginally rejects the null hypothesis that the
instruments are valid at the 10% level.
15
   Moreover, we exclude age in the fixed effects model to achieve identification.

                                                      22
model and the odds ratios for the fixed effects model confirm the positive association

between financial literacy and bank credit. Hence, an increase in the financial literacy

score within the year is associated with a higher likelihood of acquiring formal credit.

        Finally, Table 6 examines the likelihood of using informal credit as the dependent

variable. The marginal effects from the probit model with past values of the independent

variables, shown in Column 1, suggest that single individuals (those living in single

person households) and those with low educational attainment are more likely to use

informal credit. Moreover, individuals who experienced a negative income shock during

the last year are more likely to use informal credit, which provides some evidence as to

how Russians have dealt with shocks. Columns A2 and A3 add financial literacy

measures, i.e., the index and the number of correct responses, respectively. Financial

literacy is negatively associated with the likelihood of using informal credit. The

marginal effects suggest that a one standard deviation increase from the average level of

financial literacy reduces the likelihood of acquiring formal credit by 10–13%, depending

on the measure used and given the overall predicted probability of the model. The effects

are statistically significant at the 1% level.

                                     [Insert Table 6 about here]

        Panel B presents the marginal effects and robust standard errors from the IV

probit regressions using the same instruments that were mentioned previously. The tests

at the bottom of the table confirm the validity of the instruments. The results confirm the

negative association seen previously between financial literacy and use of informal credit.

The magnitude of the coefficient estimates increased by almost twofold compared to the




                                                 23
simple probit model estimates, and the coefficient becomes statistically significant at the

1% level.

       The models in Panels C and D indicate weaker negative associations between

financial literacy and informal credit, and the negative effects shown are not significant at

any conventional levels. Interestingly, the significance of the year 2009 crisis dummy and

income shock dummy in the fixed effects model appear to highlight the use of informal

credit as a primary way to deal with shocks.



5.3     Real effects of financial literacy

       We turn now to the real consequences of financial literacy. In this section, we

examine the relationship between financial literacy and financial vulnerability indicators,

such as respondent level of spending capacity and availability of unspent income. Tables

7 and 8 replicate the same four sets of estimates as the previous tables, using as

dependent variables (a) an ordinal spending capacity variable, ranging from 1 (high

spending) to 5 (low spending), and (b) an ordinal variable capturing the availability of

unspent income, ranging from 1 (low frequency) to 5 (high frequency).

       The results in Table 7 show that older individuals, as well as those in the lowest

income quartiles, are more likely to experience low spending capacity. The addition of

the financial literacy variables in the ordered probit models of Columns A2 and A3

indicates that financial literacy also matters for spending; those who are more financially

literate are less likely to report low spending capacity during the financial crisis. The IV

estimates in Panel B continue to confirm the negative association between financial

literacy and low spending capacity.



                                               24
                                        [Insert Table 7 about here]

        Moreover, the panel models in Panels C and D of Table 7 confirm the negative

relationship between financial literacy and low spending capacity, both in the random

effects GLS model and within groups, in the fixed effects model. The results are

statistically significant at all conventional levels, and the magnitude of the effects is

similar to those of the previous model. In the panel models of Table 7, two additional

specifications are introduced in Columns C2 and D2.16 These include interaction terms

between financial literacy variables and the dummy variable for the year 2009. The

rationale for adding those variables is to examine whether the interaction between

financial literacy and the year of the financial crisis is significantly associated with lower

spending capacity. However, both sets of interaction terms are not statistically significant.

                                        [Insert Table 8 about here]

        In Table 8, we use the frequency of having unspent income as (an ordinal)

dependent variable and present estimates of ordered probit models and linear models for

two-stage least squares, random effects GLS, and fixed effects in Panels A, B, C, and D,

respectively. The model’s first three rows show a significantly positive coefficient of

financial literacy on the availability of unspent income. The baseline ordered probit

estimates in Column 1 show that males and high-income individuals are more likely to

have income that is unspent on a regular basis. Columns A2 and A3 add the financial

literacy variables to the ordered probit specification and show that financial literacy is

significantly positively related to the incidence of having unspent income available. The




16
   These results are robust to the substitution of the financial literacy index with the number of correct
responses, which are not shown.

                                                   25
finding is robust. The IV probit estimates in Panel B confirm a significant and positive

effect of financial literacy.17

         Moreover, the estimates from random effects GLS models in Panel C show a

positive effect of financial literacy in the panel sample, with marginal effects similar in

magnitude to those of the probit model. The inclusion of the interaction terms between

financial literacy and the year 2009 in the panel models shows a significant positive

interaction term. Thus, financially literate individuals are significantly more likely to

have unspent income in the year 2009. Moreover, the fixed effects model in Panel D

shows a positive interaction term for the effect of financial literacy. This suggests that

more literate individuals in 2009 are more likely to save more frequently, as compared to

less literate individuals.



5.4      Robustness exercises

         In Appendix Tables B2–B4 we perform three sets of robustness exercises to check

the validity of our findings. The estimates in Table B2 in the Appendix replicate the level

of spending estimates, using a binary variable for low spending as the dependent variable.

All four panels of Table B2 exhibit statistically significant negative coefficients of the

financial literacy measures on spending. In the panel models, the interaction terms

between financial literacy and the year 2009 are negative, but once again statistically

insignificant. The magnitude of the marginal effects in the probit model of Panel A is

such that a one standard deviation from the average level of financial literacy reduces the

likelihood of experiencing low levels of spending capacity by 8.5–10%, depending on the


17
   Similarly, Klapper and Panos (2011) find that financial literacy is positively related to participating in
private and public retirement plans and negatively related to informal ways of saving for retirement.

                                                     26
measure used and given the overall predicted probability of the model. The IV probit

estimates in Panel B confirm the negative association between financial literacy and low

spending, along with the validity of the instruments used. The magnitude of the

coefficients in the IV model is very similar to the probit model. Moreover, the sign and

statistical significance (10% level) of financial literacy is the same, which suggests that

the instruments used are valid.

       Appendix Table B3 presents estimates for models with a binary version of

unspent income as the dependent variable. Columns A2 and A3 show that financial

literacy is significantly positively related to the incidence of having unspent income. The

magnitude of the marginal effects presented suggests that a one standard deviation

increase in financial literacy raises the likelihood of having unspent income by 10–

11.5%. The IV probit estimates in Panel B confirm this. They show a significant positive

marginal effect of financial literacy, of a slightly lower magnitude than the probit model,

and also confirm the validity of the instruments used. Moreover, the estimates from

random effects probit models in Panel C show a positive effect of financial literacy in the

panel sample, with marginal effects similar in magnitude to those of the probit model.

The inclusion of the interaction terms between financial literacy and the year 2009 in the

panel models shows a significant positive interaction term. Hence, financially literate

individuals are significantly more likely to have unspent income available in the year

2009. However, the fixed effects models in Panel D fail to show significance of the

financial literacy variables within individuals although the odds ratios obtained are

positive and greater than one.




                                            27
       Finally, in Appendix Table B4, we perform an additional robustness check

concerning the validity of our instruments. We use specifications similar to our IV

regressions in the previous tables, but also include control variables for the log values of

the regional unemployment rate and the average monthly income per capita in every

administrative region.18 These robustness checks largely refute that the impact of our

instrumental variables is due to regional differences in living standards. All financial

literacy effects remain large and statistically significant, with the only exception being the

effects in the spending regressions, where the coefficients become smaller in magnitude

and statistically insignificant. This is indeed the variable that is likely to be affected the

most by regional living standard differences. Hence, the results confirm the robustness of

our instruments, and the magnitude of the majority of the effects remains high and

statistically significant.

       In unreported regressions, we use self-assessed financial literacy (on a scale from 1

to 5) in place of the financial literacy measures used so far. Our results prove robust to

the use of this measure and are available upon request.



6.       Conclusion

         Our study contributes to the literature on financial literacy by examining its

effects on both financial and real behavior in a relatively understudied context, that of an

emerging market experiencing a financial crisis. We find that financial literacy is

significantly related to greater participation in formal financial markets and negatively

related to the use of informal sources of borrowing. Moreover, individuals with higher

levels of financial literacy are significantly more likely to report greater levels of unspent

income and less likely to report lower levels of spending. Finally, the relationship

between financial literacy and the level of unspent income is higher during the financial

crisis, after controlling for household characteristics. Our results suggest that greater

financial literacy can help individuals face unexpected macroeconomic and income

shocks.

Interest_1   Let’s assume that you deposited 100,000 rubles in a bank           2008     41.43%     31.19%      27.37%
             account for 5 years at 10% interest rate. The interest will
             be earned at the end of each year and will be added to the
             principal. How much money will you have in your account            2009     34.64%     32.02%      33.33%
             in 5 years if you do not withdraw either the principal or the
             interest

Interest_2   Let’s assume that you took a bank credit of 10,000 rubles          2008     23.37%     28.31%      48.32%
             to be paid back during a year in equal monthly payments.
             The credit charge is 600 rubles. Give a rough estimate of
             the annual interest rate on your credit.                           2009     35.94%     14.06%      50.00%

Inflation    Let’s assume that in 2010 your income is twice as now, and         2008     45.62%     31.47%      22.91%
             the consumer prices also grow twofold. Do you think that
             in 2010 you will be able to buy more, less, or the same
             amount of goods and services as today?                             2009     50.47%     24.12%      25.42%

Discounts    Let’s assume that you saw a TV-set of the same model on            2008     69.55%         9.12%   21.32%
             sales in two different shops. The initial retail price of it was
             10,000 rubles. One shop offered a discount of 1,500 rubles,
             while the other one offered a 10% discount. Which one is           2009     69.55%         8.38%   22.07%
             a better bargain – a discount of 1,500 rubles or 10%?

Pooling Financial Literacy Responses

       We deviate from the approach taken by Van Rooij, Lusardi, and Alessie (2011),

who perform an iterated principal factor analysis of dummies based on the correct and

“do not know” responses to each financial literacy question, since (a) binary data do not

lend themselves to traditional factor analysis (Shapiro, Lasarev, and McCauley; 2002),

and (b) creating multiple binary variables based on categorical data introduces spurious

correlation into the principal factor procedure (Kolenikov and Angeles; 2008).

       For robustness, we compute two versions of a financial literacy index using the

Van Rooij et al. (2011) method: one based on the four dummies used in our approach and

another based on two dummies for each question – one each for the correct and “do not

know” responses. Both versions of these indices are highly correlated with our index

(Panel B).

       To test whether two alternatives can be pooled in a multinomial logistic model –

Anderson (1984) refers to this as “alternatives being indistinguishable with respect to the

independent variables in the model” – we employ a simple likelihood ratio (LR) test for

the following hypothesis:

 H0: β1,A|B = … βK,A|B = 0 for alternatives A and B in a model with K parameters (1)

       We fit two models: an unrestricted model with test statistic LR2F and a restricted

model with outcome A as the base category and all coefficients except the intercept for

outcome B restricted to 0, with test statistic LR2R. The test statistic for combining

categories A and B is LR2A/B = LR2F – LR2R ~ χ2 with K degrees of freedom (Long and

Freese, 2006; Claudill, 2000).




                                            45
       Following Lusardi and Mitchell (2007a), we classify responses to the financial

literacy questions in the survey as either “correct”, “incorrect”, or “do not know”. We test

whether the last two alternatives can be pooled, and the resulting test statistics (available

upon request) indicate that we cannot reject the null hypothesis that “incorrect” and “do

not now” responses are indistinguishable in our model.

       As a second test, we construct for each financial literacy variable an ordered

variable = 0 if answered “difficulty answering”, = 1 if answered incorrectly, and = 2 if

answered correctly. We find no significant differences between logit and ordered logit

tests on the determinants of financial literacy responses (results available upon request).
