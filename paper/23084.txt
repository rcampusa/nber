Estimating the Employment Effects of Recent Minimum Wage Changes: Early Evidence,
an Interpretative Framework, and a Pre-Commitment to Future Analysis

                                          ABSTRACT

This paper presents early evidence on the employment effects of state minimum wage increases
enacted between January 2013 and January 2015, and offers an interpretative framework to
understand why it is of interest to study recent changes in isolation. Given the ongoing transitions
of many states’ minimum wage rates, we also set the stage for a pre-committed analysis of the
minimum wage changes scheduled for coming years. Through 2015, we estimate that
employment among young adults and young individuals with less than a completed high school
education expanded modestly less quickly in states that enacted one-time or multi-phase statutory
minimum wage increases than in states that enacted no minimum wage increases. Across the
specifications we implement and the samples we analyze, many of our estimates are statistically
indistinguishable from zero. Data on the longer-run effects of this period’s minimum wage
changes will be essential for more fully assessing these changes’ effects and for drawing strong
conclusions regarding how minimum wage increases affect employment in this decade’s
institutional and economic environment. As data become available for the full 2016 through
2019 calendar years, we will execute and report the results of analyses that follow the road map
this paper develops.

        In the years following the Great Recession, there was a lull in both state and federal

efforts to increase minimum wages. Following the federal minimum wage’s July 2009 rise to

$7.25, few states enacted new statutory minimum wage changes through the end of 2012. The

increases that occurred were primarily linked to state statutes that provide for annual indexing of

their minimum wage rates for inflation.

        In contrast, a significant number of state-level minimum wage policy changes have taken

place since January 2013. On a January-to-January basis, one-time or multi-phase statutory

minimum wage changes were enacted by 1 state from 2012 to 2013, 4 from 2013 to 2014, and 17

from 2014 to 2015. Across these states, the average increase enacted between January 2012 and

January 2015 was $0.92. Over this same time period, the minimum wage rose by an average of

$0.46 across the 9 states that indexed annually for inflation. Many additional minimum wage

changes have since taken effect, including 19 state-level changes implemented in January 2017.2

        This paper presents early estimates of the employment effects of the first waves of the

minimum wage increases described above. More importantly, given the ongoing implementation

of states’ multi-phase minimum wage increases, we set the stage for a pre-committed analysis of

these minimum wage changes’ effects over coming years. As data become available for the full

2016 through 2019 calendar years, we will execute and report the results of analyses that follow

the road map laid out below.

        We interpret changes in employment and wages through the lens of a conceptual

framework developed by Clemens and Wither (2014).3 The framework is well suited for this

  Note that slightly different counts of states are obtained when making year-over-year rather than January-to-
January comparisons. We classify the District of Columbia as a state for these tabulations. We do not include New
Jersey in our list of “indexers” because it had not begun indexing its minimum wage rate for inflation until 2014.

purpose because it concisely captures the economic intuitions that underlie both the intended and

unintended consequences of the minimum wage. The framework accomplishes this by

connecting analytic descriptions of the minimum wage’s effects to the combination of market

and institutional forces that shape wage rates at the low end of the skill distribution. It highlights

that the minimum wage’s capacity to increase workers’ wages depends on the magnitude of

bargaining frictions. With regards to employment, it links the minimum wage’s effects to the

determinants of demand for low-skilled labor. A key insight that follows naturally from this

framework is that the response of employment to a change in the minimum wage may vary

significantly across settings. Consequently, historical estimates of minimum wage effects may

provide little guidance regarding the effects of the minimum wage changes that have been

recently enacted. This motivates our effort to analyze these changes’ effects in isolation. We

summarize the framework’s key features in section 1.

       In section 2, we survey the minimum wage literature’s most recent developments. Our

survey emphasizes 2 points of interest. First, we briefly discuss the recent literature’s lack of

consensus regarding the employment effects of historical minimum wage changes. Because

minimum wage changes may have quite different effects across settings, we emphasize that the

literature’s lack of consensus has little bearing on the need for fresh analysis of more recent

minimum wage changes’ effects. Second, we highlight the recent literature’s more generalizable

theoretical insights, which may aid in interpreting estimates from both past and future analyses.

       In sections 3, 4 and 5, we set the stage for our empirical analysis. Section 3 provides

further background regarding the minimum wage changes we analyze. Section 4 discusses the

data sources we utilize. Section 5 then describes the regression specifications we implement.




                                                  3
Our initial analysis follows a standard difference-in-differences strategy.4 We complement this

analysis with a triple-difference research design. The triple-difference design nets out

employment trends among individuals in skill groups that are not affected by the minimum wage

as an approach to controlling for cross-state variations in labor market conditions over time.

        Section 6 presents our short-run estimates of the effects of state minimum wage changes

implemented between January 2013 and January 2015. Our overall reading of the evidence is

that, through 2015, recent minimum wage increases have modestly held back employment

among young adults and young high school dropouts. Our best estimate is that employment

expanded one percentage point less among low-skilled groups in states that implemented one-

time or multi-phase statutory minimum wage increases than in states that did not increase their

minimum wage rates. The disemployment effects we find are particularly stable across the

specifications we estimate on a sample of the least-skilled, least-experienced workers.

        While some of the estimates we present are distinguishable from zero at conventional

significance levels, many are not. Because the follow-up (or “post”) period for this initial wave

of analysis consists only of 2015, we are reluctant to draw strong qualitative conclusions. The

uncertainty underlying our estimates highlights the need for future data on longer-run effects. In

this regard, the early evidence from the cross-state experience resembles early estimates from the

Seattle Minimum Wage Study (Hill et al, 2016).

        We analyze two data sets, the basic Current Population Survey (CPS) and the Merged

Outgoing Rotation Groups (MORG) of the CPS. Our estimates are moderately larger in



4
 Our strategy is similar to that employed in a recent analysis by members of the President Obama’s Council of
Economic Advisers (CEA). The primary difference is that we analyze samples selected on the basis of age or both
age and education, while the CEA analysis (Black, Furman, Giuliano, and Powell, 2016) focuses on industries that
disproportionately employ low-skilled workers.

                                                        4
magnitude and are more frequently statistically significant when we analyze the CPS-MORG

than when we analyze the basic CPS. This raises the question of whether the difference arises

due to sampling variations or differences in data quality.5 Future years of data may help to

answer this question. The difference is relevant in part because the CPS-MORG files permit

analysis of a richer set of earnings-related outcomes than do the basic CPS files. When

researchers turn to analyses of these outcomes, it must thus be kept in mind that the underlying

employment impacts appear larger in the CPS-MORG samples than in the larger samples from

the basic CPS.

        Finally, negative point estimates are more pervasively linked to one-time or multi-phase

statutory minimum wage changes than to the minimum wage changes generated by inflation

indexing provisions. As highlighted by Strain and Brummund (2016), the employment effects of

indexation provisions may be concentrated over the years immediately following their

implementation. The responses of forward looking firms should not be expected to coincide

with each year’s modest and forecastable inflation adjustment. Dynamic considerations of this

sort are consistent with recent insights from work by Sorkin (2015) and Aaronson, French, and

Sorkin (Forthcoming).

        In section 7 we offer concluding remarks. Our overall assessment is that strong

conclusions must await the arrival and analysis of data for years beyond 2015. Future estimates

will benefit from their ability to track the relatively medium- to long-run effects of this period’s

minimum wage changes, many of which have yet to be fully implemented. The capacity for

future estimates to describe long-run effects may prove more important than their ability to draw

on larger quantities of data per se.

         Future analyses will also be better positioned to account for potentially confounding

economic factors that emerge as being relevant to this research setting. To date, for example, it

is unknown whether economic forces ranging from immigration to trade to technology have

differentially affected local labor markets in ways that are correlated with this period’s minimum

wage changes. As knowledge deepens regarding these factors’ relevance to local labor markets’

post-recession recoveries, it will become possible to tailor research designs to more fully take

these forces into account.




Section I: A Framework for Characterizing the Minimum Wage’s Effects

         This section introduces a straightforward framework for characterizing the minimum

wage’s effects on employment and on the wage distribution.6 The framework follows the

dichotomy of Bound and Johnson (1992) in describing wage rates as arising from a combination

of competitive market forces and bargaining institutions. Individual i’s productivity, the product

of the quantity and market price of his or her output, is ai per hour. Firms maximize profits by

employing all individuals they can hire at wage rates less than or equal to ai. Absent binding

minimum wage regulation, firms offer individual i a wage of θiai. If workers are paid precisely

their marginal product, θi = 1. When θi < 1, workers are paid less than their marginal product. If


6
 This framework is based on Clemens and Wither (2014), from which some portions of this section’s text are
drawn. We focus here exclusively on the demand side factors underlying wage and employment determination.
Clemens and Wither (2014) allow for supply side factors through the introduction of individual-specific reservation
wage rates. The simplified framework we present here omits the supply side because it is not relevant to the insights
we emphasize. We note at the outset that the framework says little about the dynamics of the minimum wage’s
effects. We defer a discussion of dynamic considerations until section II.

                                                         6
θi < 1, there is room for a minimum wage to transfer resources from firms to workers without

reducing employment. The bargaining parameter θi, which is central to this possibility, may vary

in magnitude due to a variety of labor market frictions (Manning, 2011).

       The statutory minimum wage, wmin, may constrain firms’ wage offers. So long as ai ≥

wmin, so that the value of the individual’s expected output equals or exceeds the statutory

minimum wage, a profit maximizing firm will offer employment at wmin when θiai < wmin. When

ai < wmin, on the other hand, the firm will not offer the individual employment. The market and

institutional forces captured by θi and ai thus enable the framework to describe the minimum

wage's primary intended and unintended effects.

       To summarize: Let wi be individual i’s observed wage. If a firm’s unconstrained wage

offer is not bound by the minimum wage, individual i will be employed at a wage of wi = θiai. If

θiai < wmin and ai ≥ wmin, the firm will employ the individual at the minimum wage (wi = wmin),

but would have offered less if not constrained. Finally, the individual is out of work and has an

observed wage of wi = 0 if ai < wmin.

       In the policy debate, minimum wage advocates typically intend for minimum wage

increases to transfer income to workers out of their employers’ profits. In this framework, that

transfer can be large when the bargaining position of workers (θi) is relatively weak. Minimum

wage opponents typically worry that increases will erode the labor market opportunities of low-

skilled workers. In this framework, that employment effect can be large when the market value

of many workers’ output (ai) is low relative to the level of the minimum wage. The overall

impact of the minimum wage, then, depends on its level relative to the productivity of

prospective workers and on the bargaining power those workers possess when negotiating wage

rates with prospective employers.

                                                 7
         We now take a somewhat deeper analytic look at the minimum wage’s employment

effects. Within this framework, the minimum wage's effect on the overall rate of employment

depends on where the minimum wage falls within the productivity distribution. At time t, let ai

be distributed according to the probability density function 𝑓𝑡 (∙). The employment loss linked to

a minimum wage of wmin is then

                                                    𝑤𝑚𝑖𝑛
                                                ∫          𝑓𝑡 (𝑎𝑖 )𝑑(𝑎𝑖 )                                              (1)
                                                 0


Equation (1) shows straightforwardly that the employment loss linked to the minimum wage will

be large when the productivity of many individuals falls below it. This follows directly from the

assumption that profit maximizing firms will only employ workers whose output has greater

market value than the cost of employing them.7 Both increases in the statutory minimum wage

and decreases in the value of the goods and services a prospective worker would produce can

increase the share of the workforce that lacks employment for this reason.

         Equation (1) is informative regarding two further, related questions of interest. First, how

much employment loss should we expect to result from increasing the minimum wage?

Equation (1) makes clear that the employment loss due to a change in the minimum wage

depends on the density of the productivity distribution between the minimum wage's old and new

levels. Similarly, the wage gains associated with a minimum wage increase depend on the

distribution of θiai between the minimum wage’s old and new levels. The density of these




7
  In the simple framework developed here, the worker’s wage is the only cost of employment to the firm. A more
general model would highlight that the relevant employment costs include the costs of benefits, training, and
regulatory compliance. A still richer model would emphasize uncertainties regarding workers’ abilities and the
dynamics of human capital development. In a multi-year contract, for example, it need not be the case that ai ≥ wi,
at all points in time or even over the life of any one worker’s contract. Profit maximization requires only that the
expected value of a worker’s output exceeds expected employment costs over the course of the worker’s contract.

                                                             8
distributions may, of course, vary significantly across settings. Minimum wage changes that

move through thin portions of the productivity distribution will tend to have small employment

effects while changes that move through thick portions can have large effects.

       Additional factors may either dampen or augment the effect one would infer from the

baseline productivity distribution. Perhaps most importantly, a minimum wage increase may

alter the productivity distribution itself. This may occur through changes in both “real” and

“nominal” productivity. Nominal productivity will rise with the minimum wage when minimum

wage increases are passed onto consumers in the form of higher prices. With regards to equation

(1), this is germane because the relevant notion of productivity is “revenue product,” meaning

the quantity of output the worker produces multiplied by its market price. The minimum wage

may also alter real productivity if it affects production arrangements, worker effort, or the skill

composition of the workforce itself, among other factors.

       Second, how will the employment effects of a given minimum wage evolve over time?

This depends on how the productivity distribution evolves over time. Observing once more that

ai is nominal productivity, the relevant distribution can be shifted by either inflation or real

productivity growth. The employment effect of a given minimum wage will thus be more

sustained when inflation and real productivity growth are slow than when they are rapid.

Relatedly, either deflation or a negative labor demand shock will increase the employment loss

linked to a given minimum wage. In the face of such shocks, the minimum wage acts as a source

of rigidity that mediates the transmission of the shock into some ensuing combination of wage

and employment changes.

       A final point worth emphasizing is that the prices and/or price indices relevant to the

minimum wage’s effects may differ from the general price level. The relevant prices are the

                                                  9
market prices of the outputs low-skilled workers produce. These prices can be affected by

factors other than general inflation. They can be affected, for example, by the evolution of the

technologies through which goods in low-skill-intensive industries are produced. The

introduction of a technology that substitutes for low-skilled labor at lower cost, for example, can

reduce the prices of the goods low-skilled individuals produce. The introduction of such a

technology would thus result in a downward shift of the relevant productivity distribution. This,

in turn, would increase the employment loss associated with a given minimum wage. A similar

analysis can be applied to expansions of trade with countries that are lower cost producers of the

goods low-skilled workers produce in the United States.




Section II: Insights from the Recent Minimum Wage Literature

       This section overviews three sets of developments from the last decade of research on the

minimum wage’s effects. Sub-section II.1 briefly discusses the recent literature on the minimum

wage’s relatively short-run employment effects. Sub-section II.2 discusses additional lines of

research that are relevant for understanding the minimum wage’s effects on the real wage

distribution. Sub-section II.3 discusses developments in the literature’s understanding of the

dynamics of the labor market’s responses to minimum wage changes.




Section II.1: The Recent Literature on the Minimum Wage’s Employment Effects

       The recent literature on the minimum wage’s employment effects has generated little

consensus. Recent analyses include work by Neumark, Salas, and Wascher (2013), Allegretto,

Dube, Reich, and Zipperer (Forthcoming), Clemens and Wither (2014), Clemens (2015),

                                                10
Zipperer (2016), Dube and Zipperer (2016), Powell (2016), and Meer and West (2016). While

there is little consensus, a common thread distinguishes papers that emphasize negative effects

from papers that emphasize null effects. Statistically insignificant estimates of employment

elasticities tend to be obtained by authors who significantly constrain the variation in state and

federal minimum wage policy that is used to estimate the minimum wage’s effects.8 Negative

effects tend to be estimated by authors who harness a relatively large fraction of the policy

variation at hand.9 The key issue, then, is how one evaluates prevailing approaches to

constraining variation. That is, the question is whether the prevailing sample selection criteria

and saturated econometric models are essential for reducing bias, are introducing their own

biases, or are simply reducing statistical power.10 We do not attempt to resolve these issues here.




Section II.2: Evidence on Additional Effects on the Real Wage Distribution

         Despite a lack of consensus regarding the minimum wage’s employment effects, the

recent minimum wage literature has generated a variety of interesting insights. Two key lines of

  The relevant papers include Neumark, Salas, and Wascher (2013), Clemens and Wither (2014), Clemens (2015),
Powell (2016), and Meer and West (2016).
10
   The phrase “saturated econometric models” refers to models that include large covariate sets as controls.
Common examples involve the inclusion of state-specific trends and even larger sets of interactions between
monthly or quarterly time indicator variables and indicator variables for each of the 9 census divisions (that is, 12 x
9 = 108 control variables for each year covered by the sample) or 4 census regions. Additional control sets of
interest involve interactions between time effects and variables that describe states’ baseline characteristics. While
it may initially sound odd for the inclusion of such control sets to be described as a potential source of bias, the
channels through which bias can be introduced are broadly recognized. It is commonly recognized, for example,
that “controlling” for state-specific trends can bias estimates towards 0 when a policy intervention’s effects unfold
dynamically (see, for example, Wolfers, 2006, or Baum Snow and Lutz, 2011). In the minimum wage context, this
point has been made through simulations presented in the 2013 working paper version of Meer and West’s (2016)
analysis. There are similarly straightforward sources of bias that can be introduced by controlling for interactions
between time effects and states’ baseline characteristics. A final key issue involves the question of whether “within
census region” or “within census division” sources of variation in minimum wages are less prone to generating
biased estimates than variations that extend both across and within regions.

                                                          11
insight involve effects that can be central for understanding the minimum wage’s impact on the

real wage distribution. These include investigations of the minimum wage’s effects on output

prices and research on bargaining spillovers.

       Research on the minimum wage’s effects on output prices includes a series of papers by

Daniel Aaronson and co-authors (Aaronson, 2001; Aaronson and French, 2007; Aaronson,

French, and MacDonald, 2008). These papers, which focus on output prices in the low-skill

intensive restaurant sector, consistently find evidence of positive price pass through. A first

implication of these findings is that price pass through blunts the real effects of nominal

increases in the minimum wage. From the firms’ perspective, the resulting revenue increase

partially offsets the underlying cost increase; from the workers’ perspective, the increase in their

incomes is partially offset by increases in the prices they face as consumers.

       A second point is that price pass through can have distributional implications. Working

from the strong assumption of complete price pass through, MaCurdy (2015) finds that minimum

wage increases are less redistributive than one might expect. This follows from two facts. First,

the consumption bundles of low income families are weighted towards goods produced by

minimum wage workers. Second, many minimum wage workers are themselves in middle and

upper income families.

       Aaronson and his co-authors develop a further insight related to market structure. More

specifically, they observe that positive price pass through can be used to distinguish between the

standard competitive market model and the standard monopsony model. While the competitive

market model predicts strong price pass through, the monopsony model has weaker predictions

and would, in its most basic form, predict the opposite.



                                                 12
       Additional research considers the possibility of spillovers driven by the minimum wage’s

effects on workers’ bargaining positions. This work emphasizes the bargaining positions of

workers initially earning wage rates above the new minimum wage, who are thus not directly

affected by the minimum wage changes under analysis. Studies finding positive effects on such

individuals’ wages include research by Lee (1999), Autor, Manning and Smith (2016), and

Engbom and Moser (2016). These studies thus highlight mechanisms through which a minimum

wage change’s effects may generate more redistribution towards low-skilled workers than one

might initially be inclined to expect.




Section II.3: Understanding the Dynamics of a Minimum Wage Change’s Effects

       The minimum wage literature has been less attentive than many program evaluation

literatures to issues involving dynamics. This applies to dynamics over both the period

preceding and the period subsequent to a minimum wage change’s implementation. On the first

point, the minimum wage literature has paid less attention than most literatures to the

anticipatory responses that may accompany long lags between a policy change’s legislation and

enactment. On the second point, much of the literature has similarly disregarded the potential

difference between a minimum wage change’s short and long run effects.

       Inattention to lags between legislation and implementation has been pervasive in the

minimum wage literature. In the debate between Neumark, Salas, and Wascher (2013) and

Allegretto, Dube, Reich, and Zipperer (Forthcoming), for example, the independent variable of

interest in the bulk of the reported specifications is the log of the contemporaneous minimum




                                                13
wage.11 Although non-trivial implementation lags are the norm, the baseline specifications thus

do not take them into account. Similarly, the baseline survey in Card and Krueger’s (1993)

pioneering case study occurred two years after the relevant minimum wage change had been

passed by the New Jersey legislature.12

        Recent insights from Sorkin (2015) and Aaronson, Sorkin, and French (Forthcoming)

highlight the relevance of firms’ technology adoption decisions to the dynamics of a minimum

wage change’s effects. The empirically relevant insight is that effects along this adjustment

margin will unfold in part as old-technology firms die and new firms invest in the technologies

they expect to maximize their net revenue streams. This dimension of a minimum wage

changes’ effects may thus occur gradually over an extended period following the underlying

legislation’s passage. In the context of the canonical New Jersey case study, the 1991 recession

was a period of churn between the minimum wage change’s legislation and implementation. It is

thus a period during which the adjustments emphasized by Sorkin (2015) and Aaronson, Sorkin,

and French (Forthcoming) may well have begun to take place. In the analysis we present below,

the regression framework is designed to flexibly track employment’s evolution over the years

subsequent to a pre-legislation baseline.

        The literature’s focus on contemporaneous minimum wage rates also shapes its

attentiveness to the dynamics of short- vs. long-run responses. Interestingly, Neumark and


11
   The analysis of Allegretto, Dube, Reich, and Zipperer (Forthcoming) includes a table that considers lags and
leads. Because all states’ minimum wage rates change many times during the sample, however, it is quite difficult
to ascertain what variation underlies the estimated coefficients associated with these variables.

   Card and Krueger (2002) summarize the legislative history as follows: “A bill signed into law in November 1989
raised the federal minimum wage from $3.35 per hour to $3.80 effective April 1, 1990, with a further increase to
$4.25 per hour on April 1, 1991. In early 1990, the New Jersey legislature went one step further, enacting parallel
increases in the state minimum wage for 1990 and 1991 and an increase to $5.05 per hour effective April 1, 1992.”
Card and Krueger implemented their baseline telephone survey in February and March of 1992. The survey was
thus conducted 2 months prior to the New Jersey minimum wage rate’s final increase and 2 years after New Jersey
passed the relevant legislation.

Wascher’s (1992) pioneering use of state panel data provides one of the literature’s more

nuanced discussions of dynamic effects. This issue was more recently taken up by Meer and

West (2016), who argue that minimum wage changes’ employment effects are better modeled as

effects on employment growth than as instantaneous effects on levels. The insights of Sorkin

(2015) and Aaronson, Sorkin, and French (2013) provide intuitive theoretical support for this

perspective. The specifications we implement are designed to allow such effects, if they are

relevant, to emerge straightforwardly through our estimates.




Section III: Background on State Minimum Wage Changes between 2011 and 2015

        Our analysis investigates the effects of state minimum wage changes enacted between

January 2013 and January 2015. Figure 1 and table 1 show our division of states into those that

have been indexing their minimum wage rates for inflation, those that enacted small statutory

minimum wage changes over this time period, and those that enacted statutory minimum wage

changes totaling at least $1 between January 2013 and January 2015. Using Department of

Labor (DOL) data on states' prevailing minimum wage rates, we code 8 states as states that

enacted minimum wage increases of $1 or more, 9 states as states that enacted minimum wage

changes less than $1, and 9 states as states that have indexed their minimum wage rates to

inflation since early in our analysis period. We assign each state to one of these three groups, or

to the control group. We do not allow states to be in more than one group—we are, in effect,

assigning each state to a policy characteristic.13



13
  States’ designations will increasingly overlap as we extend our analysis samples beyond 2015. In 2014, for
example, New Jersey introduced an inflation indexation provision. Several states with longstanding inflation
indexation provisions have more recently joined the ranks of the states with statutory minimum wage changes.

                                                       15
       Figure 2 shows the time paths of the average effective minimum wages in the states to

which we apply each designation. From January 2011 to January 2013, the figure illustrates that

minimum wage changes were quite modest and were concentrated primarily among states with

inflation indexing provisions. Several states had implemented non-trivial minimum wage

changes by January 2014. Substantially more minimum wage raising activity had taken place as

of January 2015.

       The timing of the minimum wage changes we analyze motivates the regression

specifications we implement. Specifically, we estimate the minimum wage’s effects from a base

period including 2011, 2012, and 2013 through subsequent years. We interpret 2014 as a

“Transition” year during which modest increases were implemented and future changes were

legislated. Notably, 2015, 2016, and 2017 are all years during which many minimum wage

increases have either already been implemented or are scheduled to be implemented. As our

future analyses incorporate data from 2016 through 2019, we will thus allow minimum wage

changes’ accumulated effects to vary across years. That is, we will allow our estimates of these

minimum wage changes’ transitional, short-, and medium-run effects to vary.




Section IV: Data Sources

       Our regression analysis utilizes data from the basic Current Population Survey (CPS) and

from the CPS’s Merged Outgoing Rotation Group (MORG) files, as processed by the National

Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). In future work, we will incorporate analysis of data

from the American Community Survey (ACS). The CPS-MORG files report data for a subset of

the observations in the basic CPS. Specifically, these are the individuals from which the CPS


                                               16
collects relatively detailed information regarding hours of work, weekly earnings, overtime pay,

and the characteristics of secondary jobs.

        In the estimates we present below, the distinction between the basic CPS and the CPS-

MORG has non-trivial relevance for the qualitative conclusions at which one would arrive from

our analysis. Though differences in our estimates across these data sets are not statistically

distinguishable from one another, estimates tend to be moderately more negative — i.e., the

disemployment effect appears stronger — when the sample comes from the CPS-MORG files

than when the sample comes from the basic CPS. This is important for future work to bear in

mind because analyses of outcomes like weekly earnings can only be conducted using the CPS-

MORG. For the time being, analyses of such outcomes must come with the caveat that estimates

will appear more negative than they would appear in an analysis of the basic CPS’s larger

samples. A key question, then, is whether the difference is attributable primarily to sampling

variations. If that is the case, then the smaller estimates associated with the basic CPS’s larger

samples would be unambiguously preferred. It is also possible, however, that differences in the

basic CPS and CPS-MORG questionnaires and data collection processes result in other

differences in the quality of the underlying data.14

        We supplement the basic CPS and CPS-MORG data with data on macroeconomic

covariates that may be relevant as control variables. In the analysis presented below, we control

for variations in the recovery of the housing market using the Federal Housing Finance Agency’s

(FHFA) median house price index. We similarly account for variations in broader labor market



14
  Data quality may differ in part because there are differences in the length of the relevant questionnaires.
Interestingly, differences between results obtained using the basic CPS and CPS-MORG files underlie a recent back
and forth involving Sabia, Burkhauser, and Hansen (2012), Hoffman (2016), and Sabia, Burkhauser, and Hansen
(2016). It is not clear whether the issues raised by these authors are relevant to our setting.

                                                       17
developments by controlling directly for employment among skill groups that are largely

unaffected by the minimum wage. At this early stage, we emphasize that it is difficult to know

precisely what macroeconomic factors will emerge as potential sources of bias for estimators of

the sort we implement. Additional covariates of potential interest include personal income per

capita, as measured by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and a “Bartik-style” control for the

local labor market implications of national industry trends (Bartik, 1991). Additional variables

of this sort can be constructed and integrated into the analysis as needed.

       Panels A and B of Figures 3 and 4 present two series relevant for gauging differences in

the macroeconomic performance of the groups of states we analyze. Specifically, Panel A

presents the evolution of the average house price index across these groups of states. Panel B

presents the employment rate for relatively young individuals with high school degrees and

individuals over age 30 with less than a completed high school degree. These are thus

individuals with skills or experience modestly but not overwhelmingly beyond those of most

minimum wage workers.

       The house price index reveals that the housing market recovery was particularly strong in

states that index their minimum wage rates for inflation and in states that enacted substantial

one-time or multi-phase minimum wage increases. Failure to control for variations in

macroeconomic conditions may thus bias estimates of the employment effects of this period’s

minimum wage changes towards positive values. The employment series similarly suggests that

economic conditions were stronger in states with substantial minimum wage changes than in

other states. Further summary statistics describing the samples we analyze can be found in tables

2 A and B.




                                                 18
       The remaining panels of the figure display employment trends among the skill groups in

our primary analysis samples. These include a sample of all young adults and a sample of young

individuals with less than a completed high school education. Employment among low skilled

individuals in states with substantial minimum wage changes appears to underperform to a

modestly greater degree in the figures constructed using the CPS-MORG files than in the figures

constructed using the basic CPS. Additionally, differential employment changes are more

apparent in the samples selected on the basis of both age (experience) and education than in the

samples selected on the basis of age alone. In the analysis presented below, estimates involving

the young adult samples are more sensitive to controlling for the macroeconomic proxies

discussed above.

       A final point of interest is that the baseline level of employment among low-skilled

individuals in states that enacted large statutory minimum wage changes was substantively lower

than the baseline levels of these groups’ employment in other states. This is a potential concern

for our analysis in that low-skilled individuals’ employment had more room to recover in these

states than in states that enacted no minimum wage changes. Mean reversion would tend to bias

our estimates towards positive values.




Section V: Framework for Estimating the Effects of Recent Minimum Wage Changes

       This section presents our regression framework for estimating the effects of recent

minimum wage increases. We take a standard program evaluation approach in which we divide

states into groups based on the policy changes they have implemented over this time period. We




                                                19
then estimate standard difference-in-differences and triple-difference specifications to identify

differential changes in employment among low-skilled individuals across groups of states.

        Our basic difference-in-differences specification is presented in equation (3) below:


 𝑌𝑖,𝑠,𝑡 =    ∑ 𝛽𝑝(𝑡) 𝑃𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑐𝑦𝑠 × 𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑑𝑝(𝑡) + 𝛼1𝑠 𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑠 + 𝛼2𝑡 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑡 + 𝑋𝑖,𝑠,𝑡 𝛾 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑠,𝑡 .        (3)
            𝑝(𝑡)≠0



We estimate equation (3) on samples restricted to the population groups most likely to be

affected by the minimum wage. These groups consist of young adults (lesser-experienced

workers) and individuals with less than a completed high school education (lesser-skilled

workers).

        Like any standard difference-in-differences specification, equation (3) controls for sets of

state and time fixed effects. The vector X contains sets of control variables that vary across the

specifications we estimate. In various specifications, it contains the median house price index,

the employment rate among individuals with moderately higher skill levels than the individuals

in the analysis sample, and individual-level demographic characteristics.

        The variable 𝑃𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑐𝑦𝑠 is an indicator for whether a state fits into a particular policy group.

Each of our specifications include multiple policy groups. In all specifications, we differentiate

between states that increase their minimum wage rates due to inflation indexing provisions and

states that enacted one-time or multi-phase statutory increases. We also differentiate between

states whose statutory increases total $1 or more and those whose increases are less than $1.


        The coefficients of interest are the 𝛽𝑝(𝑡) on the interaction between 𝑃𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑐𝑦𝑠 and

𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑑𝑝(𝑡) . For the analysis presented below, 𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑑𝑝(𝑡) is a single indicator for observations

that occur in 2015. Because we treat 2014 as a transition year, and thus exclude it from the

                                                  20
sample, the coefficient 𝛽𝑝(𝑡) describes differential changes in employment from a base period

consisting of 2011, 2012, and 2013 through 2015. When we update this analysis to incorporate

data for subsequent years, we will allow the dynamics of recent minimum wage changes’ effects

to unfold at an annual frequency.


        The coefficient 𝛽𝑝(𝑡) is an estimate of the causal effect of states’ minimum wage policy

changes under standard, but non-trivial, assumptions. The key assumption is that employment

among low-skilled groups would, in the absence of the minimum wage changes we analyze, have

evolved similarly across the various groups of states. We investigate this assumption in two

ways. First, we investigate the robustness of our estimates to changes in the variables used to

control for variations in economic conditions. That is, we examine whether our estimates are

robust to including no such controls, to controlling for the housing market’s evolution, and to

controlling for changes in employment among individuals in moderately higher skill groups.

Our updates to this analysis will incorporate further such controls as future research on this

period’s labor market developments points to additional factors that may be important.


        We further investigate threats to the causal interpretation of estimates of 𝛽𝑝(𝑡) by

estimating the triple-difference specification described by equation (4):


   𝑌𝑖,𝑠,𝑡 =    ∑ 𝛽𝑝(𝑡) 𝑃𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑐𝑦𝑠 × 𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑑𝑝(𝑡) × 𝑇𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡𝑖 + 𝛼1𝑠 𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑠 + 𝛼2𝑡 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑡 + 𝛼3𝑔 𝑇𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡𝑔
              𝑝(𝑡)≠0



              + 𝛼4𝑠𝑡 𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑠 ×𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑡 + 𝛼5𝑔𝑠 𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑠 ×𝑇𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡𝑔 + 𝛼6𝑔𝑡 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑡 ×𝑇𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡𝑔


         + 𝑋𝑖,𝑠,𝑡 𝛾 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑠,𝑡                                                                      (4)


Equation (4) augments equation (3) with three sets of two-way fixed effects. These include

group-by-time-period effects, group-by-state effects, and state-by-time-period effects. These

                                                 21
controls account for differential changes in employment across skill groups over time, cross-state

differences in the relative employment of the “Target” group relative to other skill groups at

baseline, and time varying differences in states’ economic conditions.

       The implications of the triple-difference model’s state-by-time-period effects depend on

what skill groups are included in the sample. The inclusion of state-by-time-period effects

enables the specification to control flexibly for economic factors that vary across states and over

time. They control for such factors as they manifest themselves through employment changes

among the individuals included in the sample as “within-state control groups.” In the triple-

difference specifications presented below, the within-state control group consists of the full

population ages 26 to 54.

       There is a trade-off in determining how high up the skill distribution one goes to select a

within-state control group. Individuals in modestly higher skill groups, for example, may be

both directly and indirectly affected by the minimum wage change of interest. Direct effects

may arise because individuals in modestly higher skill groups may sometimes work in minimum

wage jobs. Alternatively, their modestly higher pay rates may be benchmarked to the minimum

wage to preserve a compensation hierarchy within an employing firm. Indirect effects may arise

through bargaining spillovers or through firms’ substitution of very low-skilled workers for

modestly higher skilled workers. By contrast, high skilled individuals may be poor controls.

That is, the employment of high skilled individuals may be too stable for such individuals to

provide a reasonable counterfactual for the effects of economic shocks on employment among

the low skilled; their labor markets may be too different for the comparison to be meaningful.

The choice of a within-state control group is thus a dimension of the research design along which

judgment is needed.

                                                22
       Uncertainty regarding the ideal within-state control group may call for a straightforward

alternative to implementing the triple-difference specification described by equation (4). One

attractive alternative is to present information on the relationship between minimum wage

changes and employment across sub-samples of skill groups that fully partition the working age

population. Employment changes among various skill groups can potentially be interpreted as

evidence of labor-labor substitution, as evidence of other spillovers of economic interest, or as

evidence that confounding economic factors are at play. By presenting estimates that span all

skill groups, this approach allows informed readers to exercise judgment along these margins.

When examining such estimates, at least one point is clear: A credible specification ought not to

correlate modest minimum wage changes with substantial changes in employment among high

skilled individuals. The factors underlying patterns of employment among high skilled

individuals would be obvious sources of bias.




Section VI: Regression Estimates of Recent Minimum Wage Changes’ Effects

       This section presents our estimates of the short-run effects of minimum wage changes

implemented between January 2013 and January 2015 on employment among young adults and

young individuals with less than a completed high school education. The estimates are presented

in tables 3 A and B through tables 8 A and B. In all cases, the samples analyzed in tables labeled

A come from the NBER’s version of the CPS-MORG. The samples analyzed in tables labeled B

come from the basic CPS.

       Tables 3 A and B present estimates of equation (3)’s difference-in-differences model on

samples selected on the basis of both age and education. The sample consists of individuals ages


                                                23
25 and under with less than a completed high school education. The estimates in table 3A reveal

that, in the CPS-MORG files, employment among individuals in this group declined by between

1.6 and 2.1 percentage points more in states that enacted statutory minimum wage changes than

in states that enacted no minimum wage changes. The results across columns 1 through 4 reveal

that this finding is not particularly sensitive to controlling for changes in median house prices,

for employment among individuals in moderately higher skill groups, or by including sets of

individual-specific age and education dummy variables. The estimates in table 3B, which

involve samples from the basic CPS, are smaller. These estimates range between -0.7 and -1.4

percentage point and are in no cases statistically distinguishable from 0 at even the 10 percent

level.

         Estimates from tables 3A and 3B reveal that employment among young individuals with

less than a completed high school education increased moderately more in states that index their

minimum wage rates for inflation than in states that enacted no minimum wage changes over this

time period. Across both tables, these estimates range between 0.4 and 1.1 percentage points and

are in all cases within 1 standard error of 0. While the estimates thus suffer from limited

precision, the evidence is suggestive that the employment consequences of long forecastable

minimum wage increases differ from those of one-time or multi-phase statutory minimum wage

changes.

         Tables 4A and 4B present estimates analogous to those in tables 3A and 3B on samples

that consist of all young adults between the ages of 16 and 21. On this group, estimated effects

of one-time or multi-phase minimum wage increases are uniformly negative, but again estimated

with limited statistical precision. The estimates on this sample are more sensitive to the

inclusion of controls related to the housing market and employment among moderately higher

                                                 24
skilled individuals. Across the specifications presented, estimates range from -0.4 to -1.9

percentage points on the CPS-MORG samples and from -0.3 to -1.5 percentage points on the

basic CPS samples.

       A puzzling difference between the analyses of the young adult samples and the samples

of high school dropouts involves the employment changes correlated with inflation indexing

provisions. While employment among young individuals with less than a completed high school

education was positively correlated with inflation indexing provisions, employment among all

individuals ages 16 to 21 is, with the exception of one sample and one specification, negatively

associated with inflation indexing provisions. Across the estimates presented in tables 4A and

4B, point estimates for the estimated effects of inflation indexing provisions range from -2.4 to

0.1 percentage points.

       Tables 5 A and B and 6 A and B present estimates similar to those presented in tables 3 A

and B and 4 A and B, but for which we have divided the sets of states with statutory minimum

wage changes on the basis of the magnitudes of the minimum wage changes they implemented.

More specifically, we divide these groups of states based on whether the sum of their minimum

wage changes between January 2013 and January 2015 was at least $1 or less than $1. The

estimates in table 5A show that the negative employment estimates from table 3A load primarily

onto individuals in states in which statutory minimum wage changes were at least $1. In tables 5

A, for example, the point estimate for this group ranges from -2.2 to -2.7 percentage points while

the point estimates for states with increases less than $1 range from -0.5 to -1.2 percentage

points. Estimates using the basic CPS are again more modest in magnitude. A similar

description applies to table 6A and 6B’s estimates on samples of young adults ages 16 to 21.




                                                25
        The estimates in tables 7 A and B and 8 A and B are of the triple-difference model

described by equation (4). The results provide evidence that the estimates from earlier tables are

not driven by economic forces that shaped employment among prime aged individuals across the

various groupings of states. For one-time and multi-phase statutory minimum wage changes,

point estimates from the triple-difference models are, in essentially all cases, economically

indistinguishable from point estimates from the difference-in-differences models. In the triple-

difference specifications, estimates associated with inflation indexing provisions are generally

closer to 0 than estimates from the analogous difference-in-differences models.




Section VII: Discussion and Conclusion

       This paper presents early estimates of the employment effects of state minimum wage

increases implemented between January 2013 and January 2015. Through 2015, our best

estimate is that employment among young high school dropouts and young adults expanded one

percentage point less in states that enacted one-time or multi-phase statutory minimum wage

increases than in other states. We emphasize that given the short “post” period we analyze, data

on the longer-run effects of this period’s minimum wage changes will be essential for arriving at

strong conclusions regarding their effects.

       We close by briefly summarizing the analysis plan we will implement as we continue our

assessment of the effects of this period’s minimum wage changes. Data on both employment

and our macroeconomic control variables are now becoming available for the entirety of the

2016 calendar year. Our initial analysis of the 2016 data will thus involve straightforwardly

extending the template used in the current paper’s analysis. We will account for the minimum


                                                26
wage changes implemented in late 2015 and early 2016 by updating the variables we use to

describe states’ minimum wage policy changes. The construction of all control sets will remain

the same.

       Our future analyses of 2017 through 2019 data will benefit from the accumulation of

knowledge regarding the relevance of forces including immigration, trade, and technology for

local labor markets over this time period. We will adapt our analyses of 2017, 2018, and 2019

data to take such developments into account. That is, for analyses that incorporate data beyond

2016, we will supplement our straightforward extensions of the current paper’s template with

additional analyses designed to account for this period’s unique economic developments.

Further, we will expand the set of outcome variables to include hours of work, the nature of part

time employment, and weekly earnings. As needed, our analyses will incorporate the program

evaluation insights discussed above.

Notes: Data on minimum wage indexing provisions comes from the National Council of State
Legislatures. The states labeled as Indexers link annual updates to their effective minimum
wage rates to a measure of the cost of living. That measure is typically, but not in all cases,
based on the Consumer Price Index. Data on minimum wage changes comes from the
Department of Labor. States are counted as statutory increasers of under $1 if the combined
statutory increase in the minimum wage from January 2013 through January 2015 was under
$1. States are counted as statutory increasers of $1 or more if the combined statutory increase
in the minimum wage was $1 or more.

Panel A of this table reports summary statistics on the employment to population ratio for each of the four state
treatment classifications and for each of the two subgroups we study. The employment to population ratio is
calculated using the CPS MORG. Panel B reports changes between 2012 and 2015 by state classification of our
control variables. These include the all transactions FHFA median house price index and the employment-to-
population ratio for medium skilled individuals. Medium skilled individuals are defined as high school graduates
under 30 and high school dropouts between 30 and 65. The table also reports changes in employment rates among
26 to 54 year olds, who are used as within-state controls in our triple-difference specifications. Changes are
calculated as the average in 2015 minus the average in 2012.

     Figure 1: This figure displays our categorization of states according to their minimum wage policies over the period under analysis. States are defined as
     statutory increasers under $1 if the combined statutory increase in their minimum wage between January 2013 and January 2015 was under $1. States are defined
     as statutory increasers of $1 or more if the combined statutory increase in their minimum wage between January 2013 and January 2015 was $1 or greater.
     Indexers are states that index their minimum wage to a measure of the cost of living. Data on minimum wage indexing provisions comes from the National
     Council of State Legislatures.
Figure 2: This figure plots the average annual effective minimum wage for states in each of the four
state minimum wage policy categories from January 2011 to January 2015. States are defined as
statutory increasers under $1 if the combined statutory increase in their minimum wage between
January 2013 and January 2015 was under $1. States are defined as statutory increasers of $1 or more
if the combined statutory increase in their minimum wage was $1 or greater. Indexers are states that
index their minimum wage to inflation. The effective minimum wage is defined as the maximum of the
state and federal minimum wage. Data on minimum wage rates comes from the US Department of Labor.
Data on minimum wage policies comes from the National Conference of State Legislatures.

     increase in their minimum wage between January 2013 and January 2015 was under $1. States are defined as statutory increasers of $1 or more if the combined
     statutory increase in their minimum wage was $1 or greater. Indexers are states that index their minimum wage to inflation. Panel B plots the average annual mid
     skill employment to population ratio for states in each of the four state minimum wage policy categories from 2011 to 2015. Mid skill individuals are defined as
     those thirty years old or younger with a high school degree, or high school dropouts between the ages of 30 and 65. Panel C plots the average annual young
     employment to population ratio for states in each of the four state minimum wage policy categories from 2011 to 2015. Young individuals are defined as
     individuals 21 years old or younger. Panel D plots the average annual young dropout employment to population ratio for states in each of the four state minimum
     wage policy categories from 2011 to 2015. Young dropouts are defined as indidividuals 25 or under without a high school degree. Employment rates are
     calculated using the basic CPS data .
