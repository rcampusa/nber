Financial Frictions and Unconventional Monetary Policy in Emerging Economies

JEL No. E52,E58,F41

                                               ABSTRACT

We analyze conventional and unconventional monetary policies in a dynamic small open-economy
model with financial frictions. In the model, financial intermediaries or banks borrow from the world
market and lend to domestic households. Banks can borrow abroad up to a multiple of their equity;
in turn, there is a limit to how much bank equity households can hold. An economy-wide credit constraint
and an endogenous interest rate spread emerge from this combination of external and domestic frictions.
The resulting financial imperfections amplify the domestic effects of exogenous shocks and make
those effects more persistent. In response to external balance shocks, fixed exchange rates are contractionary
and flexible exchange rates expansionary (although less so in the presence of currency mismatches);
the opposite is true in response to increases in the world interest rate. Unconventional policies, including
central bank direct credit, discount lending, and equity injections to banks, have real effects only if
financial constraints bind. Because of bank leverage, central bank discount lending and equity injections
are more effective than direct credit. Sterilized foreign exchange intervention is equivalent to lending
directly to domestic agents. Unconventional policies are feasible only to the extent that the central
bank holds a sufficient amount of international reserves.

1       Introduction
    In response to weakening commodity prices and higher interest rates in
the U.S., emerging economies have suffered capital outflows, raising concerns
about macro and financial vulnerabilities. This evolving scenario is also
fueling debate on how policy should respond to these and similar shocks
when they materialize. A central issue in the debate is whether and to what
extent central banks in emerging countries should join their advanced country
peers in implementing quantitative easing, credit easing, and other so-called
unconventional monetary policies.
    But discussions of this issue have been hampered by our very imperfect
understanding of the rationale and implications of such unconventional poli-
cies. This is not surprising, given that dominant models of monetary policy
have assumed complete and perfectly functioning financial markets, which
imply that unconventional policies are redundant and irrelevant.1 This as-
sumption is unrealistic for advanced economies and even more so for emerg-
ing economies, which often have ill-functioning financial markets and sizable
stocks of dollar-denominated debt. In emerging economies, therefore, many
questions remain wide open: How do financial frictions amplify exogenous
shocks? Can the financial sector itself become a source of shocks? What
are the implications for monetary policies of both the “conventional“ and
“unconventional“ kinds? 2
       To tackle these questions, in this paper we develop a simple model of
an emerging economy in which financial imperfections take center stage. We
then use the model to analyze the impact of various real and financial shocks
and the role of alternative monetary and exchange rate policies. While the
model is mostly standard, dynamic, and built from first principles, we derive
results analytically. To do so, we impose some special assumptions, so that
our model may not be as general as others in the literature. But we believe its
simplicity offers a compensating payoff in terms of insight and understanding,
especially on the mechanics of conventional and unconventional policy.
      Domestic financial frictions, combined with external financial frictions,
can translate into an economy-wide foreign debt limit, with significant impli-
cations for aggregate demand and monetary policy. In our model, domestic

policies under perfect financial markets was originally shown in Wallace (1981).

residents cannot borrow abroad directly; instead, they borrow from domes-
tic financial intermediaries or banks which, in turn, borrow abroad. Foreign
credit to banks, however, has a limit that depends on the size of the banks’
equity capital. A crucial question, therefore, concerns the determination of
the financial sector equity base. We assume that intermediaries obtain equity
capital from households, but the typical household in turn faces an exoge-
nous upper limit to the amount of equity it can hold. This equity constraint
is quite consequential. Presumably it can be derived from more fundamental
domestic frictions, such as informational or enforcement imperfections, that
result in an incomplete transfer of equity from households to banks. 3 But
for our purposes, the exact source of the equity constraint is not as critical
as its implications.
    One of these implications is that the binding domestic equity constraint
becomes a binding international borrowing constraint, so that an endogenous
spread between foreign and domestic interest rates emerges. Hence, in addi-
tion to standard transmission channels, our model features an interest rate
channel of the type emphasized by Bernanke and Blinder (1988), Woodford
(2010), and others. Movements in the spread reflect changes in the demand
and supply for funds in the domestic loan market. The spread increases when
the external debt constraint becomes tighter.
    Another implication is that, when financial constraints are binding, the
economy’s external balance constraint determines how the economy responds
to several kinds of shocks. With binding borrowing constraints, domestic
agents cannot smooth out the effects of the shocks by running up debt. Hence
the trade deficit has to adjust on impact, meaning that domestic consumption
must fall or the real exchange rate has to depreciate, and by more than they
would in a world with perfectly functioning capital markets. In other words,
crucially, amplification of the shocks occurs.
    Shocks that require such a drastic external adjustment, which we refer to
as external balance shocks, include standard real shocks –for instance, tem-
porary drops in foreign export demand. But external balance shockscan also
arise in the financial sector. This is the case, if the equity constraint tight-
ens, so that financial intermediaries suddenly have less capital, or if foreign
lenders are suddenly willing to lend less to domestic financial intermedi-
   3
     Here our model is reminiscent of the work by Caballero and Krishnamurthy (2003, for
example). But their model is static and their analysis is concerned with a very different
set of questions.



                                           4
aries, for a given amount of equity in the financial sector. All of these al-
ternatives are conceptually different, but under binding financial constraints
they all imply forced deleveraging: financial intermediaries, and by implica-
tion domestic households, have to reduce their debt abruptly. This captures
what Dornbusch and Werner (1994) and Calvo (1998) termed sudden stops:
overnight, capital inflows become capital outflows, and the trade account has
to adjust quickly. If nominal prices are perfectly flexible, consumption and
exports drop, and the real exchange rate depreciates sharply.
    Adding the assumption of nominal price stickiness, we derive implica-
tions for monetary and exchange rate policies of both the conventional and
the unconventional kind. We start with conventional policy, taking up the
traditional question of fixed versus flexible exchange rates. Under a fixed ex-
change rate, the burden of adjusting to external balance shocks falls squarely
on aggregate demand and production. Since borrowing is not possible, an
external balance shock requires either increasing exports, cutting imports or
both. But if the exchange rate is fixed by policy, external adjustment can
only occur via a fall in imports and therefore in domestic consumption de-
mand. Since output is determined by demand, output in turn drops. So in
the face of adverse shocks, fixed exchange rates are contractionary.
        Things are rather different if the exchange rate floats and, instead,
there is a policy of fixing the interest rate. Adjusting to the same shocks then
requires a real depreciation which in turn, and provided that export demand
is not too price-inelastic, raises the dollar value of exports. Since the interest
rate is constant so is consumption, but the dollar value of consumption and
of imports both fall. This ensures external adjustment to the shock, even
though the economy cannot borrow more in order to smooth out the conse-
quences of the shock. Output goes up, since consumption is constant and
exports rise. Under flexible exchange rates, therefore, these adverse shocks
are expansionary.
        These conclusions do not hinge on the presence of dollarization per
se, since our baseline model assumes that equity claims and debts, both for-
eign and domestic, are denominated in foreign currency. But currency mis-
matches can be consequential. If the equity of banks is instead denominated
in domestic currency while foreign loans remain denominated in dollars, an
adverse shock that results in a real depreciation reduces the relative value
of banks’ equity, also cutting the capacity of the financial intermediary to
borrow abroad. This causes further deleveraging which, in turn, requires an
even larger real depreciation. In that sense, a currency mismatch is responsi-

                                        5
ble for added magnification of the effects of adverse shocks. These valuation
effects are eliminated if the exchange rate is fixed, a result that may account
for central bankers’ alleged fear of floating.
     While we emphasize external balance shocks, it is not too hard to extend
our analysis to shocks of other types. In particular, we discuss the conse-
quences of an increase in the world real rate of interest, which is of special
interest given recent changes in US monetary policy. We find, predictably,
that the shock has a contractionary effect on consumption and output in the
home economy. The effects of fixed and floating exchange rates are reversed,
relative to external balance shocks: when world interest rates go up, it is
fixed and not flexible exchange rates that prevent the immediate onset of a
contraction.
     Turning to unconventional monetary policies, we follow Gertler and Kiy-
otaki (2010) and analyze recent central bank facilities that provide lending
to firms and households (direct lending, in the Gertler-Kiyotaki terminology)
or to financial intermediaries (liquidity facilities). The discussion is orga-
nized around the following question: suppose that an emerging economy is
hit by an external balance shock and that its central bank holds a stock of
international reserves (or, equivalently, has access to a credit line abroad in
international currency, say dollars). What should the central bank do with
those dollars? What unconventional measures, if any, should it undertake?
     Three main conclusions emerge. First, direct lending and liquidity fa-
cilities make a difference if and only if private sector borrowing constraints
bind. This is intuitive, since otherwise the central bank would be offering
credit that is no superior to that which domestic agents can already get from
private sources abroad.
         Second, when borrowing constraints bind, liquidity facilities have a
general advantage over direct lending. The intuition follows from the presence
of leverage. If loans from the central bank improve the capacity of domestic
financial intermediaries to borrow abroad, then a favorable multiplier effect
kicks in: for every dollar the central bank lends, the intermediaries can lend
more than one dollar to domestic households. Hence, and in contrast with
direct lending, financial intermediaries leverage the resources advanced to
them by the monetary authority. In a situation of constrained borrowing
this is highly beneficial.
        Third, the feasibility of direct lending and liquidity facilities is limited
by the stock of foreign exchange reserves at the central bank. This is because,
ultimately, such policies work by alleviating the external debt constraint. The

                                         6
question of optimal accumulation and use of reserves in a dynamic context
emerges as a central issue (but we do not tackle it here).
         Several other unconventional policies turn out to be similar or even
completely isomorphic to direct lending or liquidity facilities. This is the
case, specifically, of central bank purchases of banks’ equity: we show that
the impact of such policies depends crucially on how equity held by the
central bank equity affects the borrowing constraint of the banking sector,
which in turn reflects how foreign lenders evaluate central bank equity vis a
vis privately-held equity. Indeed, if the two kinds of equity are treated in the
same way by foreign creditors, equity injections are equivalent to liquidity
facilities.
    How do conventional and unconventional policies compare with each other?
Our analysis suggests that, especially in dealing with external balance shocks,
conventional policies can be helpful. But they have limited effectiveness,
in the sense that they always involve trade-offs and are useless in relaxing
binding financial constraints. In contrast, unconventional policies can offset
external balance shocks directly. Yet they are also restricted in a way that
conventional policies are not: the amount of relevant central bank lending
cannot exceed available foreign exchange reserves (or foreign credit lines),
because the central bank cannot create international liquidity. This is a cru-
cial difference between central banks in advanced countries (that can create
such liquidity at will) and emerging economies.
    Finally, we study sterilized foreign exchange intervention. In our analy-
sis, sterilized intervention can be understood as an unconventional attempt
at alleviating the effects of financial constraints. Intervention is effective if
and only if financial constraints bind. And, that case, sterilized foreign ex-
change operations are equivalent to increases in central bank credit, either
to households or banks. A corollary is that sterilized intervention can matter
only because of the central bank credit required to sterilize, through which
the central bank makes its foreign liquidity available to private agents.
          This explanation for the real effects of sterilized intervention falls
out directly from our analysis, and deserves special mention for at least two
reasons. From the point of view of theory, it is new and different from others
in the literature, such as those based on portfolio balance or signaling effects.
From the point of view of policy, it may help explain why central banks are
prone to exchange market intervention at times of financial stress.
    The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the model. We
define equilibria and characterize steady states in section 3. Section 4 dis-

                                       7
cusses dynamic adjustment to external balance shocks under flexible prices.
Adding nominal price rigidity, section 5 focuses on conventional monetary
policy. Unconventional policies are the subject of section 6. Section 7 ex-
pands on sterilized foreign exchange intervention. Section 8 discusses the
implications of an increase in the world rate of interest. Section 9 concludes
with additional observations and suggestions for future research. Some pe-
ripheral technical derivations are delayed to an appendix.


2     The Model
We study a small open economy inhabited by households, firms, and finan-
cial intermediaries or “banks“ for short. To smooth consumption, households
borrow from banks, which in turn borrow from the rest of the world. Be-
cause of financial frictions, the external debt of the banks is limited by their
equity capital. In turn, households acquire equity in banks subject to an
exogenous limit that captures domestic financial frictions: that limit, or eq-
uity constraint for short, implies that domestic loan rates rise above the
world interest rate in order to match scarce loans with the credit demands
of households. There is an economy-wide endogenous collateral constraint,
with interesting implications for dynamics and policy.

2.1    Commodities and Production
Time is discrete and indexed by t = 0, 1, 2, . . .. There are two traded goods,
home and foreign. The foreign good has an exogenous price of one in terms
of a world currency, or ”dollar ”. We can therefore talk about foreign goods
or dollars interchangeably.
    In order to allow for nominal rigidities and a role for monetary policy, we
assume that the home good is the usual Dixit-Stiglitz aggregate of varieties,
with elasticity of substitution  > 1. Each variety is produced by one of a
large number of monopolistically competitive firms, via a linear technology in
which a unit of domestic labor yields a unit of output. Each variety producer
takes wages as given and sets prices, in terms of domestic currency (“peso“),
one period in advance. Standard markup pricing then yields Ph,t = Wt /(1 −
1/), where Wt is the wage and Ph,t the price of the domestic aggregate, both
in pesos.
    We assume the Law of One Price. Then, letting Et denote the nominal


                                       8
exchange rate (number of pesos per dollar), the world relative price of the
domestic aggregate, or real exchange rate, is
                                           Et
                                    et ≡        .
                                           Ph,t

With this definition the optimal markup condition becomes
                                          −(1−α)
                            wt = (       )et      ,
                                     −1
where wt = Wt /Pt is the real wage.
    Foreign demand for the domestic good is a function xeχt of its relative
price, with x a shift coefficient and χ a positive elasticity parameter. Do-
mestic demand, on the other hand, is derived from the demand for overall
consumption. Consumption is a Cobb Douglas aggregate of the home aggre-
gate and foreign goods so that, under usual assumptions, its price (the CPI)
          α
is Pt = Ph,t Et1−α . The demand for the home aggregate is then

                                    αPt
                           ch,t =        ct = αe1−α
                                                t   ct ,
                                    Ph,t

where ct is total consumption demand.
  The market-clearing condition for home output is
                                      (1−α)
                            yt = αet          ct + xeχt ,                 (1)

so that total output demand is split between domestic consumption demand
and exports.

2.2    Banks
Domestic households cannot borrow nor lend directly in the world market.
Instead, they do so from a large number of domestic financial intermediaries
or banks. Banks, in turn, can obtain funding from foreigners, possibly subject
to financial frictions.
    The representative bank lives for only one period. A typical bank starts
a period t with some capital or net worth of kt dollars which, as we will see
shortly, is transferred from the households to the banks at the beginning of
the period. It is probably best to think of kt as equity sold to households in

                                         9
exchange for an equiproportional share of the bank’s profits. Alternatively,
one can think of kt as deposits in the domestic banking system. The bank
can also borrow dt dollars from foreigners, at a fixed interest rate of ρ ≥ 0.
Accordingly, the bank can issue domestic loans worth lt dollars subject to

                                         lt = kt + dt .                                       (2)

The bank’s mandate is to maximize profits, given by

                               πt = (1 + %t )lt − (1 + ρ)kt ,                                 (3)

where %t is the rate of interest on domestic bank loans between periods t and
t + 1. Banks are competitive and take interest rates as given.4
    The representative bank is subject to a collateral assumption of the form

                                           dt ≤ θkt

where θ is a constant between zero and one. One can rationalize this con-
straint in various ways. For example, it may reflect the temptation that after
borrowing dt the banker can “run away“, and take with him an amount equal
to θ times equity. So naturally the banker’s debt cannot exceed θkt .
    The constraint can be rewritten as

                                        lt ≤ (1 + θ)kt .                                      (4)

This emphasizes leverage: it says that the bank can lend up to a multiple (1+
θ) of its equity. Note also that a bank’s profit πt can be written as the sum
of a ”normal” return on its equity plus an excess return on loans:

                               πt = (1 + ρ)kt + (%t − ρ)lt .                                  (5)

Excess returns are non-zero only if if %t > ρ –that is, if the rate of return
on loans exceeds the world interest rate, which is the bank’s cost of foreign
finance.
    Hence the bank’s problem has an easy solution. If %t = ρ, there are no
supra-normal returns, so lt and dt are indeterminate as long as

                                  lt = kt + dt ≤ (1 + θ)kt
   4
     Note that we are allowing for kt > lt , i.e. for dt to be negative. If so, the interpretation
is that the bank invests excess funds abroad at rate ρ.

                                               10
and πt = (1 + ρ)kt .
   In contrast, if %t > ρ , the bank will lend as much as it can. The collateral
constraint must then bind. Loan volume lt is then given by (1 + θ)kt and the
bank’s foreign debt is dt = θkt .
   Finally, note that the return to equity will be given by πt /kt , which can
be rewritten as

                 (1 + ρ) + (%t − ρ)(1 + θ) ≡ (1 + ωt )(1 + ρ)

2.3    Households
Domestic households choose how much to consume and work. They also
borrow from banks at rate %t and choose how much equity kt to send to banks,
collecting the return on that investment next period. Finally, they can invest
in a government bond that pays interest rt in terms of the final consumption
good. The government bond is in zero net supply, but introducing it allows
us to define an interest rate that will be a main lever of monetary policy.
    The representative household maximizes
                   ∞                         ∞
                   X
                           t
                                             X                     η
                          β U (ct , nt ) =         β t [log (ct ) − n2 ]
                    t=0                      t=0
                                                                   2

subject to the sequence of budget constraints (expressed in dollars)

e−α                       −α                                           −α                −α
 t bt +kt −lt = (1+rt−1 )et bt−1 +(1+ωt−1 ) (1+ρ)kt−1 −(1+%t−1 )lt−1 +et (wt nt +vt )+z−et ct ,

where 0 < β < 1, η > 0, vt denotes profits from domestic firms and z is an
exogenous endowment of foreign goods (dollars), which we can interpret as
oil or another commodity (this will prove useful later when we examine the
dynamics of adjustment).
    The household’s utility function is admittedly restrictive, but most of
what follows can be generalized if the period utility is of the form u(c)−v(n),
with u(.) and v(.) satisfying usual properties. A more crucial assumption is
that there is an exogenous limit to the amount of bank equity that the typical
household can hold, so
                                     kt ≤ e
                                          k                                 (6)
where e
      k > 0 is some constant. This domestic equity constraint is the result
of unmodeled domestic distortions. It could, for example, capture agency

                                             11
problems between households and firms, or imperfections in domestic equity
markets.
    The appendix discusses the solution to the households’ dynamic problem.
It can be summarized by an optimal labor supply condition

all of which are standard and have intuitive interpretations.
    Finally, the appendix shows that the equity constraint must be binding if
%t > ρ. If the equity constraint is binding, the bank’s external debt constraint
must also bind; correspondingly, the latter constraint is slack if the former
one is. Without loss of generality, then, we impose below that kt = k̃ always,
while the constraint dt ≤ θkt = θk̃ will be binding if %t > ρ and slack if
%t = ρ. And we will say that the economy is constrained in period t if %t > ρ,
and unconstrained if %t = ρ.


3     Equilibrium and steady states
In this section we first lay out the equilibrium conditions of this model and
then analyze different types of steady states.

3.1    Equilibrium conditions
In equilibrium, the household budget constraint reduces to
                   e−α                          −1
                    t ct − dt = −(1 + ρ)dt−1 + et yt + z.                  (10)
And, as discussed, the equilibrium amount of external debt is limited by the
equity constraint, with complementary slackness:
                         0 ≤ dt ≤ θ e
                                    k if %t = ρ                            (11)
                            dt = θ e
                                   k if %t > ρ                             (12)

                                         12
    A perfect foresight equilibrium is given by sequences ct , yt , et rt , %t , dt
that satisfy (1), (7)-(12) for all t = 0, 1, 2, . . . . This definition assumes that
d−1 is given and that shocks are absent. The consequences of unexpected
shocks are discussed below in the usual way.
   It is useful to note that inserting (1) into (10) and simplifying, the latter
equation can be rewritten as
                                       χ−1
                 (1 − α)e−α
                         t ct − [z + xet   ] = dt − (1 + ρ)dt−1                (13)

This equation shows the economy’s external balance in dollars and has an in-
tuitive interpretation. The LHS is the trade balance, given by the difference
between the dollar value of imports and exports. The RHS expresses that
a trade imbalance must be matched by taking new debt over and above the
service of the existing debt. A crucial part of what follows is that, in a finan-
cially constrained economy, the RHS is largely exogenous, so adjustment to
adverse shocks require an immediate fall in imports or an increase in exports,
hence some combination of falling consumption and real depreciation.

3.2    Steady States
For the rest of the paper, we restrict attention to constrained steady states.
The alternative assumption of an unconstrained steady state is not much
harder but is somewhat cumbersome, is a knife-edge case, and adds little to
our analysis.
   We characterize steady states in the usual way. Steady-state variables
are identified with an overbar. That a steady state is constrained means
that % > ρ, which in turn implies k = e  k. The Euler condition and interest
parity then imply that
                            1 + r = 1 + % = β −1 .
Therefore, a necessary condition for a constrained steady state is that β(1 +
ρ) < 1.
    As discussed, in a constrained steady state the household’s equity con-
straint binds. The external debt constraint correspondingly binds, reflect-
ing the economy’s inability of the economy to transfer enough “international
collateral” to the banks, which are the only agents that can borrow abroad.
In a constrained steady state, the bank’s debt is d = θe
                                                       k –not indeterminate,
but a multiple of the equity bound k. The steady state stock of debt only
                                      e
depends on θ and e  k.

                                        13
      In steady state, the economy’s budget constraint becomes

                         c̄ = −eα ρd + e−(1−α) y + eα z,                   (14)

the output supply function
                                                −1
                          (1 − −1 )e−(1−α) c        = ηy,                 (15)

and the market clearing condition

                             y = αe(1−α) c + xeχ .                         (16)

Since d = θe k, these three equations determine c, e, and y. Note that they
depend on the debt only through the term ρd in the first equation. An
increase in the equity bound e  k, in particular, implies that the debt will
be larger. If ρ > 0, the economy needs to generate a larger trade surplus
every period to service the debt. This requires consumption to be smaller
or the real exchange rate to be more depreciated. The interpretation is that
the economy is more impatient than the rest of the world, so a permanent
increase in e k allows for the banks to borrow more. In equilibrium, this
means consumption increases in the short run but falls in the long run.
    A special case to which we will pay special attention is ρ = 0 . Then the
preceding equations do not depend on debt nor the equity bound e    k. On the
other hand, the external debt d and the quantity of bank loans do depend
on that bound.


4      Short Term Adjustment with Flexible Prices
To highlight the basic workings of the model and the crucial role of financial
frictions, this section studies short term adjustment under flexible prices;
nominal rigidities and the implications for policy are deferred to later sec-
tions. As mentioned, we assume that β(1 + ρ) < 1, so that the steady state
is constrained.

4.1     External Balance Shocks: Real and Financial
Consider three kinds of shocks. The first two are financial in nature: a fall in
the commercial bank’s debt constraint parameter θ to θ0 < θ, or a drop the

                                       14
equity bound, from e  k to e
                           k´< e
                               k . We assume that the shocks are unanticipated
and, for concreteness and simplicity, permanent. The two shocks will have a
similar impact and call for deleveraging. But they are different in nature. The
fall in θ can be regarded as an external event, equivalent to the “sudden stop“
and “reversal of capital flows“ discussed by Dornbusch and Werner (1994)
and Calvo (1998), and to the “deleveraging shock“ discussed by Krugman
and Eggertson (2012). The fall in k̃, on the other hand, has been mostly
ignored in the literature, but realistically captures domestic distortions that
impede the capitalization of the banking system.
     The third shock is an unexpected, temporary fall in z. In particular, as-
sume that z is constant, except that in some period it falls unexpectedly to
z 0 < z for that period only. An unconstrained economy would normally bor-
row abroad to smooth the effects of this shock. But with a binding borrowing
constraint, the pattern of adjustment will be very different.
     These three shocks are different but, because the economy is constrained,
have the same effects: they all tighten the external balance constraint in the
period of the shock. In this sense, they can all be referred to as external
balance shocks, and require for an immediate cut in domestic consumption
and/or a real devaluation.
     To see this formally, assume for simplicity that ρ = 0, so that these shocks
do not change the long run resting position of the economy. Denote the new
steady state by overbars. Then d¯ = θ0 e k´, but other steady state variables are
unchanged.
     Transition to the new steady state must take only one period. We use
c, e, y, etc. to denote values during that period, which is the period of the
shock. The pattern of adjustment is driven by the external balance condition
(13), which can be rewritten as:
                       (1 − α) e−α c − (xeχ−1 + z) = s,                     (17)
where s ≡ k̃ 0 (θ0 − θ) + θ(e
                            k´− ek) + (z´− z) < 0 is a composite of the exter-
nal balance shocks. The expression is intuitive and describes how external
balance shocks necessitate a reduction of the trade deficit. This is clearly
the case if z falls. But in a financially constrained economy, the trade deficit
must also fall in response to financial shocks.
    Financial constraints can, in fact, amplify the size of the needed adjust-
ment on impact. This is clearly the case of the fall in exports, from z to z 0 .
In a financially unconstrained economy, the trade deficit would fall in the pe-
riod of the shock, but the economy would also spread the cost of adjustment

                                       15
over time by borrowing in the world market, increasing foreign debt. Here,
financial constraints prevent further borrowing, and hence the trade deficit
must shrink immediately fully to compensate for the fall in exports. In the
case of financial shocks, external balance directly implies that the foreign
debt must fall and the trade deficit must shrink on impact. This is necessary
because financial constraints bind and the debt is at its upper bound, so it
must fall from θe k to θ0 ke0 .
     The external balance condition (17) can be seen as a locus of the com-
binations (c, e) that are consistent with external adjustment to the shock
s. In other words, the condition implies that the shock must be met with
a reduction in the trade deficit, which requires some combination of a fall
in consumption and a real depreciation (an increase in e). The exact com-
bination is pinned down by the other equilibrium conditions. With flexible
prices, the relevant conditions are the optimal labor supply condition (7) and
the market clearing condition (1). In the presence of nominal rigidities, as in
later sections, the optimal labor supply condition does not hold ex post, and
it is replaced by a condition determined by monetary policy.
     Once the short term values of c and e are determined in the manner just
described, output and labor supply are given by demand, that is (1). The
response of output is ambiguous in principle, since consumption falls but
real depreciation switches demand towards domestic produce. In our case,
however, the latter effect dominates and output must increase under flexible
prices, as long as s < z (which must be the case unless the financial shock is
too large relative to z ). This is shown in the appendix, with also discusses
more formally some of the assertions of this subsection.
     Finally, the loan rate adjusts to clear the domestic credit market in the
short run, according to:
                                               e
                                c = cβ(1 + %)( )α                         (18)
                                               e
This says that the loan rate (and the spread between it and the international
rate ρ) increases when consumption falls or the real exchange rate depreciates.
Recalling that an adverse shock s must result in a combination of falling c
and higher e, it follows that the shock must increase the loan rate. This
is natural: in the face of the shock, households would like to smooth out
the adjustment by borrowing; but the economy cannot come up with the
necessary funds (on the contrary, deleveraging is necessary). The domestic
loan rate must then increase to choke off this increased demand for loans.


                                      16
4.2    Favorable Shocks
The nonlinearities in the model raise the possibility that financial constraints
may be slack in the adjustment to a favorable shock which calls for a reduction
in external debt. To see this, consider a temporary increase in exports from z
to z 0 > z. Intuitively, the economy would like to increase savings to propagate
the beneficial impact of the shock to future periods. On the other hand, we
know that the steady state does not change.
    The adjustment must be as follows: suppose that the economy reaches
the steady state one period after the shock (this will be the case if the shock
is small enough, as we will see). Then, the three last equations of the last
subsection, with s = z 0 −z > 0, determine c, y, and e. Therefore consumption
must increase, the exchange rate must appreciate, and output must fall on
impact. The loan rate % must fall below its steady state value. This is just
the reverse of our argument at the end of the previous subsection.
    But % cannot drop too much –that is, it cannot fall below ρ. This means
that if the increase in z 0 is large enough, the economy cannot remain finan-
cially constrained in the period of the shock, and therefore % = ρ. By the
same reasoning, debt must fall below θe   k in the short run.
    To be more precise: there must be a value of z 0 , call it z 1 , such the
economy ceases to be financially constrained. For such a value, % = ρ, and
the Euler equation becomes
                                            e
                              c = c(1 + ρ)β( )α .
                                            e
This and
                          (1 − −1 )e−(1−α) c−1 = ηy,
                             y = αe(1−α) c + xeχ ,
determine c, y, and e. Given these values, z 1 must then be pinned down by
the external constraint:
                              e1−α c = y + ez 1 .
So if the shock is small enough, in the sense that z 0 ≤ z 1 , the economy
remains financially constrained and converges to the new steady state in one
period.
    What happens if the shock is larger, so that z 0 > z 1 ? Clearly, the exter-
nal debt carried to the period after the shock must be less than its steady
state level, so the economy must take at least two periods to converge to the

                                      17
steady state. The same reasoning as above suggests that there must be a
z 2 > z 1 such that, if z 0 ∈ (z 1 , z 2 ), the economy goes back to the steady state
after two periods. In this case, the economy is unconstrained in the period
of the shock but constrained thereafter; the loan rate rises in the period after
the shock to some value higher than ρ but lower than its steady state level.
In that period, consumption and the real exchange rate start converging to-
wards their steady state values. Two periods after the shock, the initial debt
reduction is completely reversed, and the economy settles back in the steady
state.
    For even greater values of z 0 , adjustment to the steady state can take
successively three periods, four periods, etc. Note the contrast with negative
shocks, which cause an abrupt adjustment, involving a move to the steady
state after only one period, regardless of the size of the shock.


5         Conventional Monetary Policy
To study monetary policy, we assume now that prices are fixed one period
in advance. With nominal rigidities, the optimal labor supply condition (7)
does not hold ex post. What replaces it? We take the view that the monetary
authority can control one of the short-term real variables in the model by an
appropriate setting of available instruments, although we do not model the
specific link between instruments and real variables.5
    The monetary and exchange rate policy regime makes a crucial difference,
so we analyze two alternatives: an exchange rate peg in which the central
bank fixes the real exchange rate at its steady state level ē, and a floating
exchange rate regime in which the real interest rate is held at its steady state
level by central bank policy.

5.1         External shocks under an exchange rate peg.
To make the analysis as simple as possible, focus on the case of a constrained
steady state in which ρ = 0, so that consumption, output and the real
exchange rate are independent of debt levels. Suppose first that the central
bank pegs the real exchange rate at its steady state level ē. Then, consider
an unanticipated, adverse external balance shock s of the kind discussed in
the previous section.
    5
        In this we follow e.g. Romer (2013).

                                               18
   Keeping the same notation as before, variables in the period of the shock
have no subscript or overbar, while steady-state variables carry an overbar.
Since policy keeps e at ē, consumption and output must fall. This is because
the external balance constraint (17) becomes

                        (1 − α)ē−α c − (z + xeχ−1 ) = s.

As stressed in the previous section, the shock requires a reduction in the
trade deficit. But because the exchange rate is fixed, the trade deficit can
only fall if consumption falls. Consumption must, in fact, contract more than
under flexible prices, since exchange rates cannot aid in the adjustment.
    In turn, since output is determined by demand, we have y = αē(1−α) c +
xēχ , so that output falls unambiguously along with the fall in consumption.
It is easy to show that the loan interest rate rises, and by more than it
would under flexible prices. This is intuitive, because the exchange rate peg
requires a sharper consumption fall than under flexible prices, and therefore
the demand for loans increases by more.
    In summary, the combination of price stickiness and a binding borrowing
constraint produce an abrupt adjustment in which consumption and output
fall sharply (more than under flexible prices), and the domestic interest rate
spikes up.

5.2    External shocks under an interest rate peg
Alternatively, suppose that the shock s is the same but monetary policy
keeps the real interest rate at its steady state value 1 + r = β −1 . The Euler
condition implies that, in the period of the shock, the interest rate peg implies
that consumption is constant at its steady state value: c = c̄. The external
balance equation therefore becomes

                        (1 − α)e−α c − (z + xeχ−1 ) = s

The LHS is a decreasing function of e as long as χ is larger than one. There-
fore (recalling s becomes negative) the shock causes a real depreciation (e
goes up). The intuition, clearly, is that the trade adjustment required by an
adverse shock cannot be met by a fall in consumption, which is fixed by the
interest rate policy. Instead, the dollar value of imports must fall or exports
must increase, both of which are accomplished by a real depreciation. In


                                       19
fact, it is easy to see that the real depreciation must be steeper than under
flexible prices, since consumption does not help with external adjustment.
    In this case the market-clearing condition is:

                              y = αe(1−α) c + xeχ .

So output increases in response to the shock, since consumption does not
move but e is higher than in steady state.
   Finally, the arbitrage condition (9) in this case is
                                             e
                             1 + r = (1 + %)( )a .
                                             e
Since e rises above ē, the loan rate % increases above its steady state value.
This is necessary to keep the real interest rate r (which is defined in terms of
the consumption aggregate) from falling due to the temporary depreciation.
    So under an interest rate peg and a floating exchange rate we have a very
different pattern of adjustment than under a fixed exchange rate. As long as
export demand is not too price inelastic, a real depreciation raises both the
dollar value of exports and the level of output. Consumption is constant, but
the dollar value of consumption falls, and so does the dollar value of imports.
Both of these factors ensure external adjustment to the shock, even though
the economy cannot borrow more in order to smooth out the consequences
of the shock.

5.3    Currency Mismatches
So far we have assumed that the equity capital made available to banks by
households is denominated in foreign currency. But this does not have to be
so, nor is it necessarily so in the real world. Alternatively, let us assume that
the equity constraint is not kt ≤ e  k, but instead

                                   eαt kt ≤ e
                                            k,

so that implicitly we now assume that the equity capital is denominated
in domestic currency. Since foreign and domestic loans are denominated in
foreign goods (or dollars), the new assumption captures the possibility of a
currency mismatch. This means that as relative prices change, in particular
as the real exchange rate depreciates (an increase in et ), the equity constraint
tightens.

                                       20
    The necessary amendments to the model are straightforward. The bank’s
problem in subsection (2.2) is untouched, while the household’s problem and
its solution remains the same except for the obvious correction to the com-
plementarity condition. As a consequence, the definition of equilibrium is
the same except that (11)-(12) is replaced by

                                       eαt dt ≤ θe
                                                 k,
                         eαt dt = θe
                                   k   if   %t > ρ

    The analysis of steady states also remains essentially untouched. Focusing
in the financially constrained case, (14)-(16) must still hold. These equations
depend on d, which in this case must satisfy

                                  eα d = θ e
                                           k.

Hence, if ρ > 0, the preceding equation plus (14)-(16) simultaneously deter-
mine y, c, e, and d. If ρ = 0, on the other hand, (14)-(16) remain independent
of d, and hence suffice to pin down y, c, and e. In this case, eα d = θe       k
determines d.
    Now consider the implications of currency mismatches for shocks and
alternative monetary policies under prices that are sticky (for one period
only). Continue the analysis of an external balance s as before, which we
now interpret exclusively as a temporary adverse shock to z, the endowment
of the foreign good, and ask how the analysis of the preceding two subsections
must change. Assume ρ = 0 for simplicity. Then the old and new steady
state values of output, consumption, the real exchange rate, and debt are the
                                        ¯
same. Let us denote them by ȳ, c̄, ē, d.
    Under afixed exchange ratepolicy, the analysis is just the same as without
currency mismatches. This should be evident because a fixed exchange rate
eliminates any additional tightening of the equity constraint that would result
from a real depreciation. The shock has to be accommodated by a contraction
in aggregate demand and output, as before.
    With a flexible exchange rate and fixed real interest rate policy, the
analysis here is considerably more involved because, given that the shock
results in an exchange rate depreciation, the external debt ceiling tightens
so that on impact the debt must fall below its steady state level. As a
consequence, it is no longer the case that the economy goes back to steady
state after just one period. Instead, it turns out that the return to the steady

                                       21
state is only asymptotic even if the economy is constrained in every period
after the shock.
    We can say more, however, assuming that the shock is small enough, so
that the economy remains financially constrained in every period. Because of
the perfect foresight dynamics starting the period after the shock, consump-
tion after the period of the shock must be a decreasing function of the debt
level d determined the period of the shock, with the intuition being that the
lower is accumulated debt, the higher consumption can afford to be there-
after. Note also that the fixed interest rate policy implies that consumption
in the period of the shock must be the same as consumption one period after
(recall the Euler equation). Both must be the same decreasing function of d.
    What does this mean for the behavior of the real exchange rate? Now
the external constraint can be written as

                   (1 − α)c − eα (d − d) = eα z 0 + xeχ−(1−α)

This is the same equation as in the case without currency mismatches, except
that in that earlier case c = c (because of the fixed interest rate policy) and
d = d = θe  k (because of the debt constraint), so that the LHS was simply
equal to (1 − α)c. In this case, by contrast, the exchange rate depreciation
implies that d < d, which together with the interest rate policy implies that
c > c . Hence the LHS must be greater than (1 − α)c regardless of the value
of e, and in fact it must be an increasing function of e (since eα d = θe
                                                                        k). It is
then apparent that currency mismatches imply that the shock must result in
a steeper depreciation of the currency (see Figure 1). The intuition is simple:
the shock tightens the equity constraint, which together with interest rate
policy implies that the required external adjustment is larger than without
currency mismatches. Hence the exchange rate has to depreciate by more to
generate the additional expansion of exports.
    The lesson is that currency mismatches add amplification and persistence
to shocks, because of the effects of exchange rate movements on financial
constraints. Such effects are eliminated under fixed exchange rates, which
therefore gain some appeal relative to flexible rates. But, as stressed, fixed
exchange rates remain ineffective to prevent an aggregate demand contraction
in response to the adverse shocks.

5.4     The limits of conventional monetary policy
We have seen that, in the face of external balance shocks, a floating exchange
rate regime that stabilizes the interest rate also manages to keep consump-
tion stable, while at the same time output rises. This result might seem
surprising, especially in the presence of foreign currency debt and even of
currency mismatches that imply a tighter borrowing constraint.
    In that sense, floating exchange rates appear to be more appealing than
an exchange rate peg, which is clearly contractionary. But even then, con-
ventional policy remains unsatisfying in this setting. To see why, recall our
setup has two distortions. The first one is a monopolistic competition distor-
tion, of the type that is familiar since the pioneering work of Mankiw (1985)
and Blanchard and Kiyotaki (1987). This distortion causes underemploy-
ment and underproduction, so that the marginal cost of foregoing one dollar
of consumption is greater than the marginal cost of the effort to produce one
more dollar of output to sell on the world market. The second distortion is
a financial constraint which, when binding, prevents domestic agents from
borrowing as much as they would like to given prevailing market conditions.
This constraint proves particularly onerous when the economy suffers adverse
external balance shocks and domestic agents would like to borrow in order
to ease adjustment –but cannot.
    Conventional monetary policy can help alleviate the first distortion but
not the second. It is well understood that, in models in the Mankiw-Blanchard-
Kiyotaki tradition with sticky prices, a surprise monetary expansion or inter-
est rate cut can expand employment and output, taking the economy closer
to the first best. Here, in the face of an external balance shock, allowing
the exchange rate to depreciate helps expand output and stabilize consump-
tion. Yet the depreciation can do nothing to offset the borrowing constraint
– in fact, in the presence of currency mismatches it can make that constraint
tighter. That is one reason to explore, as we do below, whether other “un-
conventional“ policies can do better. It will turn out, as we will see, such
unconventional policies are most effective precisely when adjustment under
conventional policies is “most painful”–that is, when financial constraints
bind.6
   6
    With currency mismatches, there may be another reason. We saw that a depreciation
causes the equity constraint to tighten, so that in equilibrium a larger depreciation is
necessary to restore external equilibrium after a shock. But that is only half the story. The
external constraint is now a hump-shaped function of e. That is to say, up to a point a real


                                             23
6      Unconventional Policies
Since the global crisis of 2008-09, advanced country central banks have en-
gaged in all sorts of unconventional monetary policies, motivating a lively
debate in the academic and the policy literature. Much less studied is the
fact that emerging market central bank have also engaged in unconventional,
though not always novel, monetary and financial policies.
    Prior to the crisis, many emerging market central banks claimed to adhere
to inflation-targeting, or a close version. At its simplest, this monetary frame-
work implied using the short domestic interest rate to target some forward-
looking measure of inflation, while letting the exchange rate float. Yet to a
limited extent before the crisis, and with abandon after the big crash, most
emerging central banks deviated from this simple orthodoxy. They often
engaged in foreign exchange intervention, whether sterilized or not.7 They
also fiddled with reserve requirements in order to control the growth of do-
mestic credit or monetary aggregates.8 And as the credit crunch caused by
the crisis made itself felt, they did as their developed country counterparts,
lending to banks and households, buying bonds and other kinds of paper of
different maturities, and sometimes going as far as to take equity positions
in domestic financial intermediaries.9
    Several questions arise. Should we understand such unconventional poli-
cies as an attempt to get around the borrowing constraints that play a central
role here? If in fact policies do affect financial constraints, what are their
effects on macroeconomic variables? And, what if conventional and uncon-
ventional policies are applied simultaneously? These are some of the questions
depreciation induces the fall in the trade deficit needed to accommodate the external shock.
But beyond that point, further real devaluation is self-defeating, because the adverse effect
of depreciation on the equity constraint dominates. Put differently, there is a maximum
external adjustment that can be accomplished via real devaluation alone. Moreover, notice
that non-monotonicity can occur even in the absence of currency mismatches. In our
analysis above we assumed for simplicity that χ, the price elasticity of export demand,
was greater than one. But this need not be so. A real devaluation cuts the unit dollar
price of exports and at the same time increases export volumes. If χ < 1, the first effect is
larger than the second, so the total dollar value of exports falls as a result of a devaluation.
and, again, there is a maximum external adjustment that can be accomplished via real
devaluation alone.

we study in this section.

6.1     Direct Lending
Start the discussion by assuming that the central bank has f > 0 dollars as
foreign exchange reserves. A passive policy might then be to invest them in
the foreign exchange market, earning the world rate ρ, and to transfer ρf to
households every period.
    In the spirit of Gertler and Kiyotaki (2010), we consider an alternative
direct lending policy: in period t the central bank lends ltg to households at
the market rate %t . The amount ltg is a policy decision. We assume that
0 ≤ ltg ≤ f , and that the central bank makes a transfer τt to the household
at the beginning of each period, so as to keep the amount of foreign reserves
constant at f .
    The commercial bank’s decision problem is the same as before. The
household’s problem remains almost unchanged, too, except that the budget
constraint is now

bt +eαt (kt −lth ) = (1+rt−1 )bt−1 +eαt (1+ωt−1 )(1+ρ)kt−1 −eαt (1+%t−1 )lt−1
                                                                          h
                                                                              +wt nt +vt +eαt (z+τt )−ct ,

where lth = lt + ltg is the sum of bank loans plus central bank loans to the
household. Note that the RHS includes the central bank transfer τt .
    The household’s first order conditions are exactly as before. But to derive
the associated equilibrium, we need to be more explicit about the central
bank transfer τt . As mentioned, at the end of each period t, the central bank
lends ltg to the household. We assume that the remainder, f − ltg , is invested
in the world market. In period t + 1, therefore, the central bank’s transfer
must be

           τt+1 = (1 + %t )llg + (1 + ρ)(f − ltg ) − f = ρf + (%t − ρ)ltg          (19)

This amount is the world return on foreign reserves plus the supranormal
profit on central bank lending. One can check that, with this assumption,
the central bank starts every period with the same amount of reserves. It
should also be noted that this is not an innocuous assumption, in the sense
that alternative uses of these “quasi-fiscal“ profits may change equilibria.10
  10
    While not the case in our model, one might conjecture that some central bank lending
programs may lead to losses. This would require τ to be negative; but this may not be


                                          25
   With this and our previous assumptions, it follows that, in equilibrium,
the external balance constraint reduces to
                       χ               g                     g
     (1 −α) e−α
             t ct − [xet + z] = (dt + lt ) − (1 + ρ)(dt−1 + lt−1 ) + ρf.                (20)

Compare this expression with the original (13). The new form of the external
constraint is intuitive: direct lending by the central bank allows the economy
to circumvent the external credit limit, at a cost ρ, which is the opportunity
cost of reserves to the economy.
    The other equilibrium conditions remain exactly the same, so that the
path of ltg affects equilibrium only through the immediately preceding exter-
nal constraint (20). This reveals a crucial aspect of credit policies. Take any
equilibrium in which the financial constraint is slack in a period t, that is,
0 < dt < θe  k . Then it is easy to see that, for any alternative values dˆt , ˆltg
such that 0 < dˆt < θe k and dt + ltg = dˆt + ˆltg , the same equilibrium obtains.
(To see this, observe that the equilibrium conditions depend only on the sum
dt + ltg and not on dt and ltg separately, as long as 0 < dt < θek.) The intuition
is simple: suppose that the financial constraint does not bind in period t.
Then, if the central bank extends additional credit to the commercial bank,
the latter simply reduces its external debt by an offsetting amount, leaving
the total supply of loans in the economy unchanged. Since the financial con-
straint does not bind, the same equilibrium obtains with the loan interest
rate equal to the world interest rate.
    In other words, the amount of central bank credit in period t is irrelevant
if financial constraints do not bind in that period. This is an instance of
a more general result, discussed by Céspedes, Chang, and Velasco (2015)
and others, which applies to a large set of unconventional monetary policies,
including many that have been tried in practice.
    To move forward, suppose ltg is a constant, and consider steady states.
The external balance constraint (20) becomes

                  (1 − α)e−α c̄ − [xeχ−1 + z] = −ρ(θe
                                                    k + lg ) + ρf

the case in which the steady state is financially constrained, so that d = θek.
In steady state, central bank lending allows the economy to effectively borrow
more than that limit.
feasible, e.g. if transfers from the taxing authority to the central bank have a limit. These
considerations restrict the set of feasible policies. For a thorough discussion, see Benigno
and Nistico (2015).

                                             26
   The case ρ = 0 is instructive. Then, as before, the steady state is in-
dependent of d and of lg . But direct lending matters in the short run: the
external constraint can be rearranged to read
                                       χ
                     (1 −α) e−α
                             t ct − [xet + z
                                           b] = dt − dt−1                    (21)

where
                               ẑt = z + ltg − lt−1
                                                g
                                                    .
In this case, central bank credit is isomorphic to control of z. Notice it is
the change in ltg , not the level, that matters. If ltg is constant, the policy
is irrelevant. This is intuitive, since z is a flow variable, while ltg is a stock
variable. Notice also that if f is large enough relative to the size of the shock,
this policy can be used to offset completely a temporary fall in z or other
equivalent shocks.
    To sharpen intuition consider, in particular, a temporary fall in z. Nor-
mally (without borrowing constraints), the household would like to borrow
abroad in order to smooth out the consumption effects of the temporary
shock. If the real international interest rate is positive, so that borrowing is
costly, the new feasible level of consumption has to adjust downward to reflect
the carrying cost of the additional debt. But if, as we have assumed here,
ρ = 0, so the additional debt has no carrying cost, the level of consumption
can afford to remain the same it would have been without the shock.
    Note, however, two related aspects of the policy: we have assumed that
the increase in credit, ltg − lt−1
                                g
                                   , is permanent; and we have assumed that
 g
lt ≤ f or, equivalently, that the credit increase is no more than the available
                                       g
amount of reserves, given by f − lt−1     . This implies that a credit increase
                                                               g
to offset a temporary fall in z will not be feasible if f − lt−1   is small. This
                                                  g
would be the case if f is small, but also if lt−1 is large, due to analogous
credit operations in the past.
    In other words, a main lesson is that direct lending can be used to offset
directly external balance shocks, but it is limited by foreign exchange re-
serves. The question of appropriate reserves accumulation and how it limits
credit policies then emerges as a critical one. Further progress would re-
quire to examine settings in which, realistically, z is continuously buffeted by
shocks, instead of the one time shocks we have allow for in this paper.




                                        27
6.2    Liquidity Facilities
Suppose that, instead of lending to households, the central bank lends part
or all of its f resources to banks. This is akin to what Gertler and Kiyotaki
(2010) term liquidity facilities, or discount-window lending.
    Such lending alters the bank’s problem. The amount that the bank can
lend is now
                                lt = kt + dt + dgt ,
where dgt is the loan from the central bank. We assume that central bank
loans carry the world rate of interest, and that the size of dgt is determined
by policy, subject to 0 ≤ dgt ≤ f .
    The impact on the bank’s incentive constraint turns out to be key. We
assume that discount lending affects the commercial bank’s foreign debt limit
in the following way:
                                dt ≤ θkt + φdgt                           (22)
with 0 ≤ φ ≤ 1. The idea is that a banker can “abscond“ after obtaining
external credit dt , as before, but now the cost is not only a fraction θ of equity
but also a fraction φ of its debt to the central bank. If φ = 1, in particular,
the assumption is that the banker cannot cheat on the central bank.
   Combining the two expressions, the associated limit on bank loans is now

                           lt ≤ (1 + θ)kt + (1 + φ)dgt .

This emphasizes that, if φ> 0, using central bank liquidity facilities banks
can leverage up and multiply dgt in the world market. In this sense, lending
to banks delivers more bang for the buck than lending to households, just
like an increase in private equity. The crucial assumption, of course, is that
the existence of a central bank loan increases the cost to the bank of reneging
on its foreign debt.
    The commercial bank now chooses lt and dt to maximize profits, given by

          πt = (1 + %t )lt − (1 + ρ)(dt + dgt ) = (%t − ρ)lt + (1 + ρ)kt ,    (23)

as before. Hence the bank’s problem has a similar solution as before: if
%t = ρ , lt and dt are indeterminate as long as (22) is satisfied; if %t > ρ,
(22) must hold with equality, so dt = θkt + φdgt .
   The household’s problem is as before, except that we assume that the
central bank transfers the difference between receipts from its past loans

                                        28
plus any interest earned on the resources not lent, minus the amount needed
for new investments. But because the central bank changes ρ for its credit,
the transfer is equal to the world return on foreign reserves:
            τt = (1 + ρ)dgt−1 + (1 + ρ)(f − dgt−1 ) − [dgt + (f − dgt )] = ρf .
With this assumption, the external constraint reduces to
                           χ−1
        (1 − α) e−α
                 t ct − [xet   + z] = (dt + dgt ) − (1 + ρ)(dt−1 + dgt−1 ) + ρf
which is the same as in the case of the previous subsection, except that dgt
replaces ltg . In contrast with the direct lending policy, however, the liquidity
facility affects the external credit limit, and the bank can now borrow more
abroad and lend more to the household.
    One implication is that, as with direct lending, the amount of liquidity
provided by the central bank dgt does not matter if and only if financial
constraints are slack (meaning 0 < dt < θk̃ + φdgt in this case). Another
implication is that financially constrained steady states are given by
              (1 − α) e−α c − [xe¯χ − 1 + z] = −ρ[θe
                                                   k + (1 + φ)dg ] + ρf .
This emphasizes that the liquidity facility is more effective than direct lending
in increasing the economy’s capacity to borrow abroad. The intuition, again,
is leverage.
    In the case of ρ = 0, the external constraint is as in (21), with ẑt =
z + (dgt − dgt−1 ). This is just as with direct lending. However, the additional
consideration is that, if constraints bind so that %t > ρ, dt = θe   k + φdgt . To
illustrate the differences further, suppose that ρ = 0 and the economy is in
a financially constrained steady state with zero central bank loans (in either
direct credit or discount credit). Consider then an unexpected, temporary
fall in z to z 0 < z . The analysis of the previous subsection implies that the
central bank would be able to prevent the shock from affecting real allocations
by extending direct credit to households in the amount lg = z −z 0 (this would
be possible provided z − z 0 ≤ f ). Alternatively, with a liquidity facility, the
amount needed for the same purpose would be dg = (z − z 0 )/(1 + φ). This
is because the liquidity facility would allow commercial banks to borrow an
amount φdg over and above the original credit limit of θk. If φ > 0, then,
the liquidity facility requires fewer resources than direct credit. In fact, if
f < z − z 0 ≤ (1 + φ)f , the former is feasible but the latter is not.11
  11
       Note, in the previous example, that we have assumed that the amount of central bank

                                             29
6.3     Equity Injections
Lending is not the only operation that the central bank can engage in vis
à vis the bank. Instead of lending at rate ρ, the central bank can choose
to take an equity position in the commercial bank. In so doing, the central
receives an equi-proportional share of the commercial bank’s profits. Under
some conditions, the analysis is the same as with liquidity facilities. But it is
interesting to see the details, if only to identify the necessary conditions for
this operation to play a useful role in offsetting the effects of shocks under
financial distortions.
     Let ktg denote the central bank equity position in the commercial bank.
Then the total equity of the commercial bank is κt = kt +ktg . The commercial
bank’s problem is then exactly as described in subsection (2.2), except that
κt replaces kt in all the obvious expressions.
     The household’s problem is as before, and its solution is the same, except
that the budget constraint reduces to
                                               
                                           kt−1                               (1−α)
et (kt − lt ) = −et (1 + %t−1 )lt−1 + et          πt + xeχt + et z − (1 − α) et     ct + et τt
                                          κt−1
where the RHS emphasizes that, in equilibrium, the household receives a
fraction kt−1 /κt−1 of the commercial bank’s profits, and also a transfer τt
from the government.
    The central bank finances the equity injection using reserves (or, equiva-
lently, a dollar credit line). In each period t, the central bank takes an equity
position 0 ≤ ktg ≤ f in the commercial bank, and invests f − ktg in the world
market. As before, we assume that the central bank transfers its profits to
the household, so that
                   
               kt−1                      g                        g
        τt =          πt + (1 + ρ)(f − kt−1 ) − f = πt − (1 + ρ)kt−1 + ρf.
               κt−1
Combining the last two expressions with the definition of profits πt , and
                                                   g
recalling that lt−1 = dt−1 + κt−1 = dt−1 + kt−1 + kt−1 , we have the equilibrium
version of the crucial external constraint:

    −(dt + ktg ) = −(1 + ρ)(dt−1 + kt−1
                                    g
                                        ) + xeχ−1
                                              t   + z − (1 − α) e−α
                                                                 t ct − ρf .

credit (either to households or banks) increases permanently. This is for simplicity of
exposition: the assumption ensures that the economy returns to the original steady state
in the period of the shock.

                                             30
In turn, the credit limit is

                                            k + ktg ).
                               dt ≤ θκt = θ(e

These expressions are the same as in the previous subsection, except that
ktg has replaced dgt and that φ= θ. The latter fact reflects, of course, our
assumption that central bank equity in the commercial bank is treated the
same as the household’s equity.
    The conclusions of the previous subsection then apply, in particular that
operations involving banks –whether liquidity lending or equity injections–
are more effective than direct credit in relaxing financial constraints because
of the bank’s leverage. But our discussion also suggests how equity injections
might differ from liquidity facilities.12

6.4       Combining Credit Policy and Monetary Policy
For monetary policy to have an effect one must assume sticky prices. In that
case, as we have seen above, the optimal labor supply condition (7) does
not hold ex post in the event of shocks. Instead, monetary policy provides
an additional short run condition for equilibrium. In the cases we have
examined, this means that either the real exchange rate or the real interest
rate are fixed by policy at their steady state levels.
    Given these observations, it is not hard to characterize the implications
of combining credit policy and monetary policy. Consider, for example, a
temporary fall in z to z 0 < z met with an increase of central bank credit to the
commercial bank, and assuming either fixed exchange rates or a fixed interest
rate policy. As we have seen, the economy converges after one period to the
steady state, which under the simplifying assumption ρ = 0 is independent
of the debt and credit policy. Hence, in the period of the shock, the external
constraint can be written as

       (24)


                          (1 − α) e−α c − [xeχ−1
                                             t   + z] = s
  12
    Gertler and Kiyotaki (2010), for example, suggested that the central bank might pay
more than the market price for its equity position. They stressed that this should be
understood as a transfer from the central bank from the commercial bank. This is clearly
also the case in our framework.

                                          31
with the external adjustment s is given by

                            s = (1 + θg)∆dg − ∆z

where ∆z = z − z 0 is the fall in exports and ∆d and ∆dg denote the increase
in external debt and central bank liquidity, respectively, in the period of the
shock. The last equality emphasizes that the credit response ∆dg essentially
offsets the shock ∆z by the amount (1 + θg )∆dg .
    The short run equilibrium is determined by the preceding equation to-
gether with the domestic market-clearing condition y = αe1−α c +xeχ and
the assumption that e = ē (under a fixed exchange rate) or c = c̄ (under a
fixed interest rate).
    This all means that the analysis of monetary alternatives complemented
by credit policies is as usual, once one takes into account how credit policy
effectively reduces the size of the external balance adjustment from ∆z to
(1 + θg )∆dg − ∆z. Again, a crucial issue is the availability of international
reserves, which places an upper bound on ∆dg .
    To summarize, in emerging markets unconventional policies can offset
exogenous shocks fully but are limited by international reserves. In contrast,
monetary policy faces no such limits, but involve tradeoffs involving output,
consumption and the real exchange rate, all of them operating through the
external balance condition. Further research is warranted in this regard,
especially on the optimal accumulation and utilization of foreign reserves in
(potentially) financially-constrained open economies.


7    Sterilized intervention
Many emerging markets claim to target inflation. A standard version of that
policy requires that monetary and interest rate policy be targeted at the rate
of inflation, while letting the exchange rate float freely. In that framework
there is no direct feedback from the exchange rate back to (say) the policy
interest rate. The level of the nominal (and real) exchange rate only matters
for policy to the extent that it affects the expected inflation rate and/or the
output gap. Moreover, the policy response to movements in the expected
inflation rate and the output gap is supposed to involve the interest rate only,
excluding by design active intervention in the foreign exchange market.
    This theory stands in sharp contrast to what many economies (emerging
and also advanced) have actually done during and since the 2008-09 crisis.

                                      32
Many have pursued standard foreign exchange intervention, both sterilized
and unsterilized. Attempts to affect the exchange rate via the derivatives
market have also been common. In Céspedes, Chang and Velasco (2014) we
provide an account of such policy responses in Latin America. Similar policies
have been put into place in other emerging market economies, particularly
in Asia.
    In what follows we ask what effects, if any, sterilized foreign exchange
intervention has in our model. We deliver one conclusion up front: such in-
tervention has effects if and only borrowing constraints bind. In this sense,
foreign exchange intervention can be understood as an “unconventional“ at-
tempt to lessen the effects of such borowing constraints.
    When discussing sterilized foreign exchange intervention, it is necessary
to add to the model some view on the supply and demand of domestic money.
The specific details are not important: one could append a quantity equation
or one could assume that domestic money is in the household’s utility or pro-
duction function; there are other, well-known alternatives. For concreteness
and simplicity also, we suppose for the rest of this subsection that money
exogenous, so that equilibrium in the money market only determines the
price level (the argument is modified in an straightforward way if the price
level is determined in alternative ways, such as interest rate rules, and money
market equilibrium determines the equilibrium money stock endogenously).
    Consider the impact of a sterilized central bank purchase of one dollar
with domestic currency. Without sterilization, nominal money supply Mt
would increase by Et (the nominal exchange rate); central bank foreign re-
serves would correspondingly increase by one dollar. However, sterilization
means that the central bank must adjust its asset position so as to keep Mt
the same. To do this, in particular, the central bank can increase its credit
to either households or commercial banks by the equivalent of one dollar (it
does not matter here if such an increase is given in domestic currency or for-
eign currency, as households or banks can rearrange their currency holdings
accordingly). The net result, in this case, is that at the end of the process
Mt will not have changed, central bank foreign reserves will have fallen by
one dollar, and either ltg or dgt will have increased by one dollar.
    Hence foreign exchange intervention affects the equilibrium conditions
only through their effect on ltg or dgt . While this argument is simple, it
has significant implications for our views of sterilized foreign exchange in-
tervention. We have discussed the issue at length in Céspedes, Chang and
Velasco (2013), in the context of another model that also involves financial

                                      33
constraints. Using the model here, one can easily show that:
    • Sterilized foreign exchange operations are equivalent to increases in
      central bank credit, either to households or banks.
    • Such operations matter only because of the central bank credit required
      to sterilize, through which the central bank makes its foreign liquidity
      available to private agents.
    • Sterilized foreign exchange intervention matters only when financial
      constraints are binding. Under other circumstances, as we have seen in
      earlier sections, central bank credit, either to households or banks, has
      no real effects.
    From the point of view of theory, these arguments for the real effects of
sterilized intervention are new and independent of others in the literature,
such as portfolio balance effects or signaling effects. From the point of view
of policy, they help explain why central banks are prone to intervention at
times of financial stress, precisely when borrowing constraints bind. More
broadly, if financial crisis involve a scarcity of liquidity, and in our perspective
exchange market intervention is precisely a means for providing liquidity, it is
only natural that monetary authorities will display what Calvo and Reinhart
(1999) termed “fear of floating“, in the sense of keep in intervention among
the policy tools to be used in times of stress.


8      Increases in the World Interest Rate
This section briefly considers an increase in the world interest rate ρ. This
is obviously of interest given prospective changes in monetary policy in ad-
vanced nations, which could have important effects on emerging markets, as
well as the ongoing debate on the long run world interest rate.

8.1     Impact on Steady State
Consider first a permanent increase in the world interest rate from ρ to ρ0 > ρ,
starting from a constrained steady state.13 As before, we denote the resulting
(new) steady state with overbars.
  13
    It is not hard to show that assuming that the increase in ρ is transitory only introduces
additional dynamics, which we omit to save space.

                                             34
    Because the steady state is constrained, the stock of steady state debt
remains the same: d¯ = θk̃ . The new steady state values of consumption,
output, and the real exchange rate are then given by equations (14)-(16),
except that ρ0 replaces ρ in (14). It is straightforward to show that, relative
to the old steady state, consumption is lower, output is higher, and the
real exchange rate more depreciated. This reflects that a higher interest rate
requires higher debt service, which must be met with an increase in the trade
surplus.

8.2       Adjustment under Flexible Prices
For simplicity only, we assume that ρ = 0 initially. Assume also that the
economy remains constrained in every period. Then the external balance
condition in the period of the shock becomes
                           (1 − α)e−α c = z + xeχ−1
because debt remains unchanged at d.   ¯ (As before, c, y, and e refer to values
in the period of the shock).
    The preceding equation, market-clearing condition for home output (1),
and labor supply condition (7) now determine c, y and e. But these are the
same equations that pin down the old steady state, so c, y and e must be
unchanged at their old steady state values. Adjustment, when it occurs, is
therefore abrupt: the economy remains in the old steady state in the period
of the shock, and jumps to its new state one period after.
    We have assumed that the economy remains financially constrained in all
periods. But this need not be so if the shock is large enough. To see this,
recall that the interest rate r has to adjust so that the Euler condition is
satisfied. If the economy is constrained in all periods, consumption growth
falls on impact, so r must fall. This leads to a fall in the lending spread; but
the spread cannot be negative. Consequently, for a large enough increase
in ρ, the economy must become unconstrained, at least initially: the spread
becomes zero, c falls below its old steady state value, and d falls below d .
    Hence, a large enough shock can be contractionary on impact. As in
other cases, shocks that are even larger can have effects for more periods,
etc. Since the analysis resembles that of other cases in the paper, we leave
the details to the interested reader. Just recall that ρ cannot become larger
than β −1 for the steady state to remain constrained.14
 14
      On the other hand, ρ can rise above β −1 temporarily.

                                            35
8.3    Nominal Rigidities and Policy
Consider prices fixed one period in advance, and suppose that policy keeps
the exchange rate fixed at its old steady state value. Denoting the latter
by eo , the short run equilibrium is given by the external balance condition

                       (1 − α) (eo )−α c = z + x(eo )χ−1

and the market-clearing condition

                           y = α(eo )(1−α) c + x(eo )χ .

By inspection, it follows that c = co and y = y o . That is, in the period of
the shock the economy remains at its original steady state. It moves to the
new steady state after one period. Overall, then, a fixed exchange rate policy
implies the same outcome as with flexible prices.
    By contrast, suppose that policy keeps the real interest rate fixed at its
steady state value (1 + r = β −1 ) and lets the exchange rate float. Then, the
Euler equation requires that consumption be the same this period and next:
c = c̄. That is, consumption drops immediately to its new long-run value.
The exchange rate is then given by

                           (1 − α)e−α c = z + xeχ−1

Since c̄ is smaller than in the old steady state, this equation implies that the
exchange rate must appreciate, provided χ is not too small. Finally, output
is given by the market-clearing condition (1). Output must fall, given the
drop in consumption and the appreciation of the exchange rate.
    In this case, it is the flexible exchange rate policy (with a fixed interest
rate) that is contractionary in the short run. The intuition is that an increase
in ρ does not affect the current debt burden, but only the debt service starting
one period after the shock. The fixed exchange rate policy takes advantage of
that fact and postpones the adjustment, while a flexible interest rate policy
brings the adjustment forward.

8.4    On Unconventional Policy
For concreteness, focus on the direct lending policy of subsection 6.1, as-
suming that the central bank has f units of tradables, and lends a constant


                                        36
amount ltg = lg to households. In the new steady state, the external con-
straint becomes:
                c̄ = −eα ρ0 (d¯ + lg ) + e−(1−α) y + eα (z + ρ0 f )
                      = eα ρ0 (f − lg − θk̃) + e−(1−α) y + eα z
The other steady state equations remain the same.
    The implications of a permanently higher world interest rate on the steady
state can be the same or the opposite of those in preceding subsections,
depending on whether the country as a whole is a net debtor or a net creditor.
The above equation reveals that c must be greater than co , and ē and ȳ lower
than eo and y o , if f −lg −θk̃ > 0. The intuition is obvious: the condition holds
when the country as a whole is a net creditor in the world market. Then, an
increase in the interest rate is just like a permanent windfall increase in z of
size ρ0 (f − lg ).
    A key observation here is that the size of the direct credit lg reduces
the implicit windfall: a larger lg means that the government is borrowing in
the world market on behalf of the representative agent, and that the cost
of borrowing is the world interest rate. Equivalently, here a dollar that the
central bank lends to households is a dollar that is not invested in the world
market, earning the world interest rate.
    As noted earlier, one should ask how lg was chosen in the first place. One
may also ask what is the optimal path of direct lending (and of other uncon-
ventional policies). But regardless, it is worth noticing that for countries that
are net creditors (admittedly, not a very large group) a permanent increase in
the world interest rate can be beneficial ex post, because it increases earnings
on the net foreign asset position. This effect would have to be taken into
account in the analysis of unconventional policies and reserve accumulation.


9     Concluding Remarks
Why are emerging markets so vulnerable to shocks? What features of the
domestic financial system account for the amplification and persistence of
domestic responses to external shocks? Given such features, how can we un-
derstand the role of monetary policy, both conventional and unconventional?
In this paper we have analyzed plausible answers to these questions, with
emphasis on the role played by financial market distortions in shaping an
emerging economy’s response to external shocks, whether real or financial.

                                          37
     One conclusion that emerges from our analysis is that the presence and
details of borrowing constraints are crucial. The inability to borrow to ease
adjustment to shocks determines the behavior of consumption, the real ex-
change rate, and output, as well as the room for policy to play a role.
     A second conclusion is that, with sticky nominal prices, monetary and
exchange rate policies make a big difference in determining the nature of the
adjustment to different shocks. For instance, if the shock is a temporary
drop in endowment of traded goods or a permanent tightening of the bor-
rowing constraint, flexible exchange rates help cushion the shock, while fixed
exchange rates cause larger drops in consumption and output. Conversely, if
the shock is an increase (whether permanent or transitory) in the world real
interest rates, fixed rates help postpone the pain of adjustment, while flexible
rates are associated with an immediate recession, and both consumption and
output fall right away.
     A third conclusion is that unconventional policies have a crucial role to
play, but this role is quite different than in advanced economies. In ad-
vanced economies, quantitative easing, credit easing, and the like emerged
as a response to the zero lower bound. Financial imperfections matter (oth-
erwise the price of long-term paper would be perfectly arbitraged with that
of short-term paper, given expectations) but they often have not been seen
as an essential part of the story. Indeed, in parts of the academic literature,
the effectiveness of unconventional policies is studied in the context of mod-
els with perfect financial markets. A good example of that is Benigno and
Nistico (2015).
     By contrast, the rationale for unconventional policies in emerging markets
is, in our view, inextricably tied to the presence of borrowing constraints and
other financial imperfections. Indeed, as we argued above, unconventional
policies are necessary because conventional monetary policies cannot elimi-
nate the adverse effects of financial distortions in the presence of shocks, and
in some circumstances can even aggravate them. Different unconventional
policies are at the end of the day different mechanisms for injecting dollar
liquidity in to the economy. The choice among them is guided precisely by the
need to get the biggest bang for those scarce “bucks” coming from abroad.
     Our analysis suggests several directions for future research. One, which
follows naturally from the preceding discussion, is to study optimal accumu-
lation and utilization of foreign exchange reserves. From the perspective of
this paper, foreign exchange reserves represent a key restriction on the avail-
ability of unconventional policies in emerging markets. Since we have shown

                                      38
that the latter have real effects when financial frictions bind, an appropriate
policy of accumulation of reserves emerges as a priority in the debate.
    A second direction is to explore alternative assumptions about finance
constraints. For instance, we assumed but did not provide microfoundations
for the equity constraint. While we do not believe that to be a serious
shortcoming for the analysis in this paper, it may turn out to be important
for studying some other questions, such as financial regulation. Perhaps
more significantly, we assumed finance constraints of a very simple form.
Examining the robustness of our results to other forms, such as dynamic
ones, is warranted.

10     Appendix
To describe the solution of the household’s problem in the main text, let β t λt
and β t γt denote Lagrange multipliers associated with the budget constraint
and the equity constraint. Then the first order conditions for maximiza-
tion are
                           λt eαt = βλt+1 (1 + %t )eαt+1
                              λt = βλt+1 (1 + rt )
                     λt eαt + γt = λt+1 (1 + ωt )(1 + ρ)eαt+1
                                    c−σ
                                     t  = λt
                                  ηnφt = λt wt
The complementarity condition

                           γt ≥ 0, = 0        if kt < k̄                   (25)

must also hold. These expressions require that, in any equilibrium, (9) must
hold. Also (and recalling the definition of ωt ), γt = 0 if %t = ρ –that is, the
household’s equity constraint does not bind if the interest spread is zero.
   Next, we justify assertions at the end of subsection 4.1. Rewrite the
external condition (17) in terms of the domestic good as

                              es + xeχ + ez = m                            (26)

where m ≡ (1 − α)e1−α c is the value of imports. We assume z > s, so
the preceding expression gives m as an increasing function of e, given the
shock s. This function depends on s : for any e, a larger (more negative)
shock drives imports m down.
    At the same time, combining the labor supply condition and market clear-
ing gives
                         µm−1 − αm = (1 − α)xeχ                         (27)
where µ ≡ (1 − α)2 (1 − −1 )η −1 The LHS is a decreasing function of m and
the RHS is an increasing function of e, so this whole expression represents a
negatively-sloped relation between m and e.
    Short-run equilibrium is given by the intersection of these two schedules:
this is depicted in Figure 2, where XX is the external constraint (26) and
MM is the graph of (27). An adverse shock means that s becomes smaller,

                                         40
displacing the XX downwards and resulting in a fall in m and an increase in
e –that is, a drop in imports and a real depreciation. Then, by the definition
of m, c must also fall: consumption drops along with the drop in imports
and in the real value of the currency.
   In this case, the output supply condition can be written as

                               (1 − α) y = µm−1 .

Since m falls, y must increase. The shock is expansionary for supply rea-
sons: as consumption and the real exchange rate drop, the marginal utility
of consumption rises. Labor supply and output then rise to keep utilities
equated at the margin.
    Finally, since c falls and e increases, while c̄ and ē are the same as in the
original steady state, the Euler equation (18) implies that % increases above
its steady state value.
