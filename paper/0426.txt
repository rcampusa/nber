                    The Term Structure of the Forward Premium



                                      ABSTRACT



     Most studies of the efficiency of the foreign exchange market focus on a

single maturity —   usually   aone month exchange rate. However, one observes that

forward contracts of many maturities are simultaneously traded in the foreign

exchange market. The hypothesis that the foreign. exchange market uses all available

information has implications for the joint behavior of forward exchange rates of

various maturities. This paper theoretically and empirically examines these imp-

lications.

     The paper proposes an equilibrium theory of the term structure of the forward

premium. By combining the theory of the term structure of (domestic and foreign)

interest rates with the hypothesis of interest rate parity, a simple expression

relating the six month forward premium to a geometric average of expected future one

month forward premiums can be developed. By assuming that the one and six month

forward premiums can be expressed as a bivariate stochastic process, one can derive

an expression for the expected one month forward premium. The theory will then im-

pose highly non—linear cross equation restrictions on the parameters of the model.

Two methods of testing the validity of the restrictions are presented. The results

indicate that the data are consistent with the theory for Germany and inconsistent

with the theory for Canada.

I.      Introduction


        There have been numerous studies of the efficiency of the foreign exchange

(see Levich 1979 for a survey of many of these studies). However, most of these

studies focus on a single maturity —     usually   a one month forward exchange rate.

We observe that forward contracts of many maturities are simultaneously traded in

the foreign exchange market; yet there are surprisingly few studies that examine

the implications of several forward contract maturities (see Porter 1971, GIddy

1977 and Brillembourg 1978). The hypothesis of market efficiency has well known

implications for the relation between a forward exchange rate of a given maturity

and the subsequently observed spot rate. In addition, the hypothesis of efficiency

has implications for the joint behavior of forward exchange rates of various

maturities. This paper will theoretically and empirically examine these additional

implications.

            Section ii will propose an equilibrium theory of the term structure

  of the forward premium. By combining the (certainty equivalence) theory of

     the term structure of (domestic and foreign) interest rates with the hypoth-

  esis of interest rate parity, a simple expression relating the six month

  forward premium to the expected future one mouth forward premium can be de-

 rived. It will be shown that the six month forward premium can be written

 as a geometric average of expected future one month forward premiums. In

 Section jj     it   is shown that a convenient and efficient method to extract

 the expected one month forward premium can be obtained by assuming that a

 general (bivariate) stochastic process generates the one and six month for-

 ward premiums. The theory developed in Section ii will then impose highly

 nonlinear cross equation restrictions on the parameters of the stochastic

 process.
                                   —2—

     The restrictions imposed on the parameters of the model by the eco-

nomic theory are highly nonlinear. Sections IV and V discuss two methods

of testing the validity of the restrictions. Section IV provides a sta-

tistical test of the hypothesis that requires only the unrestricted estimates.

The rejection region, under the null hypothesis, is derived. The statistical

test proposed in Section V requires the restricted parameter estimates.

Maximum likelihood methods for estimating the constrained models are dis-

cussed and implemented.



II. The Economics   of the Term Structure of the Forward Premium
     To develop a theory of the term structure of the forward premium, we
begin by assuming that interest rate parity holds. (See Porter 1971 for a
similar development). There is much empirical evidence in support of this
condition (Frenkel and Levich 1975, 1977). Interest rate parity states that

the expected rate of depreciation on foreign exchange equals the interest

rate differential. We can write this as:


                             1+1            t t+n
                                           ES

                                       =
                                            S
                                                    —                        (1)

                   implicit one period forward interest rate for period t+n.

  Dividing by the foreign country version of (2a), (2a*), yields:




                      '1L1÷'/ [i+i*j
  Substituting interest rate parity (1) into (3) and cancelling yields:

  E            is the implied expected change in the spot exchange rate in

  period t+n. Dividing (2b) by (2b*), equating to (3) and substituting from

 (4) yields:

where Fk,t is the k—month forward exchange rate prevailing at time t, and

equation     (6), for k = 1 and n, into equation (5) we obtain

 Et is the mathematical expectations operator conditional on the set of in-

   analysis of the tern structure of interest rates.

            To add empirical content to equation (7), we must specify how

  expectations are formed and what variables belong in Q• First, notice

  that the conditional expectations operator in (7),         E, has       as the

  conditioning set, where        includes all relevant information for calculating

  expectations of future one month rates of depreciation. For convenience in

  deriving testable implications based on (7),          let us write Ex as
              and so rewrite (7) as


                  = [ri + E(rit+iI) + ... +                                     (7')

  Let      be any subset of 21, such that       includes at least current and

  lagged values of r1 and              Now, take expectations of both sides of

   (7'),     conditional on the smaller information set       to obtain

this information set, we can easily calculate the conditional expectations

in (8').        We shall report two methods of calculating these expectations,

and the restrictions implied by (8').

The Weiner—Kolmogorov prediction formulas allow us to write the conditional

expectations in (8') in a simple fashion:

where [   ] means     "ignore negative powers of L." Substituting expression

(10) into (8') and rearranging, yields:

so test the validity of the restrictions embodied

        The intuition behind these restrictions arise from the following

observations. We assumed that the CR,                 R           process was generated by
                                            L)t
                                                  ,
                                                      n,t    )


a vector autoregression. That is, we regress both R1 and                           against

lagged values of (R1i Re). Wold has shown the conditions under which
                                    — 11 —


this     is valid (see Whittle 1963). If the economic agents realize this they

will use the parameters of the autoregression to generate their forecasts.

For the data to be consistent with the model the parameter values must be

restricted. These restrictions are summarized in equation (8) and

equivalently in equation (24).


IV. Econometric Tests and Results, I

           The restrictions implied by equation (24)             are highly nonlinear.

There are two basic methods to test the validity of the restrictions im-

plied by the theory. The first method, discussed in detail in this section,

was originally proposed by Wald. This method requires obtaining the un-

restricted maximum likelihood estimates p'           of   the parameter vector
  = (ci,   , y,    d). Let us write the restrictions implied by (24) in the

form h(ij)       0. Wald's method then tests h(q,U) =       0.   The second method,

discussed in detail in the next section is based on the likelihood ratio

test. This method requires obtaining in addition to the unrestricted

estimate, j, the restricted estimate .               One then compares the likelihood

of 4"     to   r• A difficulty with this method is obtaining the restricted

maximum likelihood estimates. The next section will present two methods

of obtaining r

           Under the assumption that {w, v} is bivarjate normal, the likeli-

hood function for a sample of
                                    Cw, v}, t = 1, 2, ... T is given by

Naxinimizing (25)      without any restrictions, that is, with all parameters

free, is equivalent to estimating (14) by least squares. Wilson (1973)

shows that the parameter estimates with an unknown V may be obtained by



                                                          t
                                                   T
                           mm        =

                                                  t=l
        To test restriction (24) we proceed as follows. Let


                         4,   = (ct', ', '• ')

                         =OLS       (unrestricted) estimate.


Write restriction (24) as


          h(4,) =    dA(4,) -   (1/n)c(A(4,) + A2() + ... + A(4,))                  (26)


                 =   (00...      0) =0

where we write A = A(tp) to indicate the dependence of A on ji.             The test

amounts to testing whether the vector h(4,) is significantly different from

the zero vector. The problem is to determine the shape of the rejection


region. The problem is intuitively solved as follows (Silvey 1975, pp. 115—

116, or Rao   1973, pp. 418—419):
        We expect        to be "close to" , under the null hypothesis, and.

we know that 1(1      — ) is     approximately N(0,              where B4,1 is the in-

formation matrix for the coefficient vector , in a single observation.

Expanding h(4,) about         in a Taylor series, to linear terms, we get


                                                                                    (27)

                                       I    iJ
Since h()      0, under the null hypothesis, we may      rewrite (27)   as



                               h() H ( — ).                                   (2R)

           Therefore, v h(4,)is approximately N(O, H, B Hg,). Letting x be

the vector of observations, the rejection region becomes



                {xn(h(p(x))'(H
                                  B1 H) h(ip(x))] >       k}.                 (29)


To actually apply this test one needs an estimate of            and B1. For
(l/n)B' we can use the estimated variance—covarjance matrix, obtained

from estimating (14).        For H, we numerically differentiate the 1x8 re-

striction vector h() (at the OLS estimates) with respect to all sixteen

parameters. Calling these estimates (1/n)B and H, the value W is

given by

                      w =
                            h(P)'[H(1/n)B     HJh(ip).
                                                                              (30)


Under the null hypothesis, h(p)        0, W is approximately distributed chi—

square with eight degrees of freedom. Large values of W indicate rejection

of the hypothesis.

        The OLS (unrestricted) estimates are given in Tables 1 and 2, under

the heading "Unrestricted Estimates."        See Data Appendix for a description
of the data. Also presented is an estimate of V and lvi. At the bottom

of observing a number greater than the
                                            statistic, given that the null
hypothesis is true.

         The results presented in Table 1 for Germany indicate a failure

to reject the validity of the hypothesis that the pure expectations theory

of the term structure of the forward premium is correct. The W—statistic

of 10.42 is insignificant, as indicated by a marginal significance level of

23.7 percent. The results in Table 2 for Canada indicate rejection of the

null hypothesis. The W—statistic of 21.84 is significant, as indicated by

a marginal significance level of 0.5 percent. The assumption that (Ri,R) is

stationary is equivalent to the assumption that the characteristic roots of the

matrix A are all less than one in modulus (see Sargent [1979a], p. 273). The roots

of A, using OLS estimates, were calculated and all were found to be less than one

in modulus.


V. Econometric Tests and Results, II


        In the last section, we presented tests of the validity of restric-

tion (24)     based on the unrestricted estimates. In the case of Canada,

we cannot determine the source of rejection. In this section, we shall

estimate the model with the restrictions imposed, and then compare the re-

stricted and unrestricted models using a likelihood ratio test.

        The restrictions implied by (24)     are highly nonlinear. Sargent

(l979b) proposes two alternative estimation strategies. The first method

requires estimating the first row of A, equation (l4a)        ,   by   least squares.

Then, the (M+1)st row of A, equation (l4b)    ,   is   calculated using an itera-

tive procedure. Form a preliminary estimate of A, call it A, by setting

row M + 1 to a row of zeroes, and all other rows to their known (or


consistent) values. Calculate the (M+l)st row of A, at iteration i ÷ 1,

where A.

         is the estimate of A on the 1th iteration. At each step in form—

ing A.÷i, all rows (except the (M+].)st) are kept equal to the corresponding

row of A. If this procedure converges, it will find an A that satisfies (24).

This procedure will converge if the characteristic roots of A are less than one

in modulus. Since the elements of row 1 are consistently estimated by least

squares, the (M+l)st row will be consistently estimated as a function of

the first row of A.

        Define the solution to the iteration on (31)            as the (set) function


                               (y, 6) = 4)(ct, 8)                              (32)


4) maps the a's and 8's into a set of y's and S's that satisfy restriction

(24).    Hence, one (consistent) estimator of y, 6 is 4)(a, 8).

        Under the restriction (24) the likelihood function in (25),

L(a, 8, y, cSifs},            becomes a function only of the a's and 8's. As

Wilson (1973) argues, maximum likelihood estimtes with an unknown V are

obtained by minimizing lvi, with respect to the a's and 8's, where

                                  T
                      lvi =    .E

                                    e (a, 8) a t(a, 8)'J


where the e(a, 8), the residuals from (14) , are functions of the a's and

8's only, since they were calculated from (14) with (24) imposed.

        A derivative free nonlinear minimization routine can be used to

estimate (14) under the restriction (24).           The IMSL subroutine ZXMIN,

which uses a quasi—Newton method, was used. Generally, 600 iterations

were required to obtain three significant digits. The least
                                   —18—
squares estimates of a and     were used as starting values.

         Tables 1 and 2 report, in addition to the unrestricted estimtes,

the restricted maximum likelihood estimates. In addition, the likelihood

ratio statistic, which is distributed x2(8), is reported along with the

marginal significance level.

         The results for Germany indicate a failure to reject the null hypoth-

esis. The likelihood ratio statistic of 11.134 is insignificant, as in-

dicated by the marginal significance level of 19.4 percent. The results

for Canada, a likelihood ratio statistic of 20.843 (marginal significance

level of 0.8 percent), indicate a rejection of the null hypothesis.

         Not surprisingly, the results implied by the W—statistic and likeli-

hood ratio statistic are very close (marginal significance levels of 23.7

percent and 19.4 percent for Germany, and 0.5 percent and 0.8 percent for

Canada). This is as it should be, since both tests are asymptotically

equivalent (Silvey 1970, p. 118), and the sample size is 188 observations.

         Can we use the restricted estimates to locate the reason the null

hypothesis is rejected for Canada? Table 3 \presents an estimate of the

variance—covariance matrix of the restricted parameter estimates (a and )

for   Canada. Standard errors for y and    are not reported since y and 5 cannot

be analytically solved for in terms of a and .     The difference between the

restricted and unrestricted estimates of a and     are insignificant. Using

the standard errors of the unrestricted estimates of y and     (not reported),

the unrestricted estimate of      is significantly different from the restricted

estimate (all other ys and cS's are insignificantly different). In calculating

the Wald statistic we required an estimate of h(ip)——the restriction vector im-

plied by (24).     An estimate of that vector, evaluated at the OLS estimate.

It    is interesting to note that the first restriction,         h1(p) = 0.211, is
also the largest in absolute value. Again the results are consistent be-
tween    the Wald test and likelihood ratio test.

        The period being examined, April 1973 — Nay      1975,   was a time of adjustment

to a new floating rate system. It is possible that the             "noisiness" of the
system    changed over time (Hakkio (1979] presents evidence that the variance had

increased for Canada). To allow for this possibility, we split the Canadian
                              — 20 —



sample in two, and reestimated the restricted and unrestricted version of

the model. The results are presented in Tables 4 and 5.

     For the first period we obtain a likelihood ratio statistic 21.465,

with a marginal significance level of 0.6 percent. So, we again reject the

null hypothesis for Canada for the first period. The likelihood ratio

statistic for the whole period and the first period are quite close. For

the second period we obtain a likelihood ratio statistic of only 13.302,

with a marginal significance level of 10.2 percent. Therefore, for the

second period we fail to reject the null hypothesis, and therefore con-

clude that the data are consistent with the pure expectations theory of

the term structure of the forward premium——for the second period.

As before, the roots of the A matrix indicate that the process was stationary.

As shown in Hakkio (1979), the variance of the forecast error changed over

time in the Canadian case. Consequently, the data may not have been

stationary and so the econometric methodology may have been suspect.

Splitting the sample in two. presumably reduced the problem posed by

heteroskedasticity.


VI. Conclusions

        Most studies that test foreign exchange market efficiency focus on

the relation between the spot exchange rate and a single maturity for the

forward exchange rate, usually the one month rate. This procedure ignores

the fact that more than one maturity currently is being traded. This

paper   extends the analysis of market efficiency so as to obtain implica-

tions concerning the joint movements of the spot exchange rate and the one

and six month forward exchange rate. Using the certainty equivalence theory

of the term structure of (domestic and foreign) interest rates and the

hypothesis   of interest rate parity, it is possible to write the six month

forward premium as a geometric average of the current one month forward

premium and expected future one month forward premiums. Testable implica—

tions are then derived by assuming that the one and six month forward

premiums are generated by a bivariate autoregression.


        The hypothesis of rational expectations imposes a set of highly non-

linear cross equation restrictions on the parameters of the model. Two

different methods were then presented to test the validity of the restric-

tions. Both methods yielded identical conclusions. It was found that for

Germany the data were consistent with the theory of the term structure of

the forward premium. For Canada the data were inconsistent with the theory.

Hakkio (1979) found that the Canadian — U.S. exchange rate system ap-

peared to change over time with respect to the forecast variance.    To

examine the implications of this, we estimated the model over two subperiods.

We then found that although the data were inconsistent with the theory in the

first subperlod, the data were consistent with the theory in the second sub—

period. Due to the complex nature of the restrictions, the cause of rejec-

tion could not be fully ascertained. In addition, although the theory may

be rejected for Canada, there is no clear alternative theory that can be

accepted.

                            DATA APPENDIX


     Weekly observations on the spot exchange rate and the one and
six month forward exchange rates were obtained for the period March 30,
1973 to December 30, 1976. The data were obtained from the Weekjy
Review of the Harris Bank. The exchange rates are wholesale bid rates
quoted in Chicago at 1:00-1:30 P.M. on each Friday. Most exchange rates
represent actual transaction prices.
     Several filter programs were run to detect errors and suspect
observations were checked and corrected.
