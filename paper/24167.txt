Structural Interpretation of Vector Autoregressions with Incomplete Identification: Revisiting

                                             ABSTRACT

Traditional approaches to structural vector autoregressions can be viewed as special cases of Bayesian
inference arising from very strong prior beliefs. These methods can be generalized with a less restrictive
formulation that incorporates uncertainty about the identifying assumptions themselves. We use this
approach to revisit the importance of shocks to oil supply and demand. Supply disruptions turn out
to be a bigger factor in historical oil price movements and inventory accumulation a smaller factor
than implied by earlier estimates. Supply shocks lead to a reduction in global economic activity after
a significant lag, whereas shocks to oil demand do not.

1    Introduction.
Structural interpretation of vector autoregressions has typically involved an all-or-nothing
approach to the use of prior information, treating some features of the underlying structure
as if known with certainty (often regarded as identifying assumptions) while claiming to be
completely ignorant about other features. In this paper we argue that both aspects of the
traditional approach can be improved on. Researchers need to acknowledge openly that
a reasonable person would have doubts about the restrictions that are typically viewed as
identifying assumptions. But we can make up for this in part by drawing on all available
information about the structure, while acknowledging that this information, too, is imperfect.
Under our approach, error bands incorporate not just uncertainty that is a result of having a
ﬁnite sample of data but also reﬂect our doubts about the structure itself.
    We illustrate these ideas by revisiting the role of supply and demand in generating historical
ﬂuctuations in the price of oil. As examples of excessive conﬁdence about certain features
of the underlying structural model, we revisit Kilian’s (2009) assumption that we know with
certainty that there is no short-run response of oil supply to the price and Kilian and Murphy’s
(2012) assumption that the short-run price elasticity of oil supply is known to be less than
0.0258. On the other hand, those studies made no use of information about the oil demand
elasticity, and indeed their estimates imply demand elasticities that are far too large to be
economically reasonable. We use this setting to illustrate how one can relax the strong
restrictions about supply but supplement it with imperfect information about demand and
other features of the economic structure to answer the kinds of questions researchers have
studied with earlier methods.
    Our paper makes a number of other methodological contributions. First, we show how to
use prior information about both elasticities and the equilibrium impacts of structural shocks.
Second, we show how to generalize structural vector autoregressions to allow for measurement
error. Third, we show how one can downweight earlier data if the researcher has doubts about
structural stability over time.
    Among the new insights that emerge from our analysis is an estimate of the short-run
oil supply elasticity of 0.15, consistent with the conclusion of Caldara, Cavallo and Iacoviello
(2017) but considerably larger than the upper bound assumed in Kilian and Murphy (2012,
2014). We are also led to conclude that supply shocks were more important in accounting
for historical oil price movements than was found in studies that assumed very precise prior
information about the size of the supply elasticity. We attribute the run-up in oil prices in
2007-2008 to strong demand confronting stagnating supply. Our results suggest that weak
demand and strong supply were both important in the oil price collapse in 2014-2016, while
attributing most of the rebound in oil prices in 2016 to stronger demand. Our analysis further
suggests that there is considerable error in measuring world inventories of oil. Once we allow


                                                1
for this measurement error, we ﬁnd little evidence for a contribution of speculation or changes
in inventory demand to most historical oil price movements, in contrast for example to the
conclusion of Juvenal and Petrella (2015).
    The plan of the paper is as follows. Section 2 summarizes the Bayesian approach for a
model that may be incompletely identiﬁed. Section 3 uses this framework to revisit earlier
studies on the role of oil supply and demand shocks. Section 4 shows how we can incorporate
a role for inventories while acknowledging the possibility of considerable error in estimates of
global oil inventories. Section 5 summarizes the prior information we rely on and describes
the conclusions that follow. Section 6 investigates how results change when we relax reliance
on individual sources of prior information, while Section 7 concludes.


2     Bayesian inference for structural vector autoregres-
      sions.
Our interest is in dynamic structural models of the form

                                           Ayt = Bxt−1 + ut                                              (1)

for yt an (n × 1) vector of observed variables, A an (n × n) matrix summarizing their contem-
poraneous structural relations, xt−1 a (k × 1) vector (with k = mn + 1) containing a constant
                                ′
and m lags of y (x′t−1 = (yt−1 , yt−2
                                  ′           ′
                                      , ..., yt−m , 1)′ ), and ut an (n × 1) vector of structural dis-
turbances. We take the variance matrix of ut (denoted D) to be diagonal. To obtain a
formal Bayesian solution we treat ut as Gaussian, though Baumeister and Hamilton (2015)
showed that the resulting Bayesian posterior distribution can more generally be interpreted
as inference about population second moments even if the true innovations are not Gaussian.


2.1     Representing prior information.
From a Bayesian perspective, a researcher’s prior information about A would be represented
in the form of a density p(A), where values of A that are regarded as more plausible a priori
are associated with a larger value for p(A), while p(A) = 0 for any values of A that are
completely ruled out. Information may pertain to individual elements of A or to nonlinear
combinations such as speciﬁed elements of A−1 , the equilibrium eﬀects of structural shocks.
Our applications in this paper draw on both sources of prior information. Implementation of
our procedure requires only that p(A) be a proper density that integrates to unity.1
    1
      Actually our algorithm can be implemented even if one does not know the constant of integration, so the
practical requirement is simply that p(A) is everywhere nonnegative and when integrated over the set of all
allowable A produces a ﬁnite positive number.



                                                     2
   While we allow the researcher to have arbitrary prior information about A, to reduce
computational demands we assume that prior information about the other parameters can
be represented by particular families of parametric distributions that allow many features of
the Bayesian posterior distribution to be calculated with closed-form analytic expressions.
Speciﬁcally, we assume that prior information about D conditional on A can be represented
using Γ(κi , τi ) distributions for d−1
                                     ii ,

                                                           n
                                        p(D|A) =           i=1 p(dii |A)                               (2)

                                                                    ii ) for dii ≥ 0
                     p(d−1
                        ii |A)   =                                                       ,
                                                      0                      otherwise
where dii denotes the row i, column i element of D. Thus κi /τi denotes the analyst’s expected
value of d−1                                     2
           ii before seeing the data, while κi /τi is the variance of this prior distribution. If
we have a lot of conﬁdence in this prior information, we would choose κi and τi to be large
numbers to get a prior distribution tightly centered around κi /τi . In the formulas below we
allow τi to depend on A but assume that κi does not. Appendix A oﬀers some suggestions
for how to choose the values for κi and τi .
    Prior information about the lagged structural coeﬃcients B is represented with conditional
Gaussian distributions, bi |A, D ∼ N (mi , dii Mi ):

                                                           n
                                     p(B|D, A) =           i=1 p(bi |D, A)                             (3)

                                     1
            p(bi |D, A) =                        exp[−(1/2)(bi − mi )′ (dii Mi )−1 (bi − mi )].        (4)
                            (2π)k/2 |dii Mi |1/2
The vector mi denotes our best guess before seeing the data as to the value of bi , where b′i
denotes row i of B, that is, bi contains the lagged coeﬃcients for the ith structural equation.
The matrix Mi characterizes our conﬁdence in this prior information. A large variance would
represent much uncertainty, while having no useful prior information could be regarded as the
limiting case when M−1i  goes to zero. The applications in this paper allow mi to depend on
A but assume that Mi does not. Appendix A oﬀers suggestions for specifying mi and Mi .


2.2     Sampling from the posterior distribution.
The Bayesian begins with prior information about parameters p(A, D, B) represented by the
product of p(A) with (2) and (3). The objective is to see how observation of the data YT =
(y1′ , y2′ , ..., yT′ )′ causes us to revise these beliefs. If the prior for d−1
                                                                              ii given A is Γ(κi , τi (A)),
                                 −1
then the posterior for dii given A and the data YT turns out to be Γ(κ∗i , τi∗ (A)) where

                                              κ∗i = κi + T /2                                          (5)


                                                       3
                                     τi∗ (A) = τi (A) + (1/2)ζi∗ (A).                                            (6)

The value of ζi∗ (A) can be calculated from the sum of squared residuals of a regression of
Ỹi (A) on X̃i :
                                                                                   −1
               ζi∗ (A) = Ỹi′ (A)Ỹ i (A) − Ỹi′ (A)X̃i                 X̃′i X̃i        X̃′i Ỹi (A)             (7)

                                                                                        ′
                          Ỹi (A) =          a′i y1 · · · a′i yT mi (A)′ Pi                                      (8)
                          [(T +k)×1]

                                                                                   ′
                                     X̃i     =    x0 · · ·     x′T −1 Pi                                         (9)
                                [(T +k)×k]

for Pi the Cholesky factor of M−1
                                i = Pi Pi .
                                           ′

    Likewise with a N(mi (A), dii Mi ) prior for bi |A, D, the posterior for bi given A, D, and
the data YT turns out to be N(m∗i (A), dii M∗i ) with
                                                          −1
                                    m∗i (A) = X̃′i X̃i         X̃′i Ỹi (A)                                     (10)

Baumeister and Hamilton (2015) showed that the posterior marginal distribution for A is
given by
                              kT p(A)[det(AΩ̂T A′ )]T /2 n         κi
                  p(A|Y T ) =      n           ∗     κ ∗ i=1 τi (A) .              (12)

                                                       i



Here p(A) denotes the original prior density for A, Ω̂T is the sample variance matrix for the
reduced-form VAR residuals,

                                                                               −1

and kT is a function of the data and prior parameters (but not dependent on A, D, or B)
such that the posterior density integrates to unity over the set of allowable values for A. The
value of kT does not need to be calculated in order to form posterior inference.
   The posterior distribution

                    p(A, D, B|YT ) = p(A|Y T )p(D|A, YT )p(B|A, D, Y T )                                        (14)

summarizes the researcher’s uncertainty about parameters conditional on having observed
the sample YT . If the model is under-identiﬁed, some uncertainty will remain even if the
sample size T is inﬁnite, as discussed in detail in Baumeister and Hamilton (2015). Appendix

3     Bayesian interpretation of traditional approaches to
      structural inference.
In this section we show how previous approaches can be given a Bayesian interpretation,
using a 3-variable description of the global oil market for illustration. The ﬁrst element of the
observed vector yt is the quantity of oil produced, the second is a measure of real economic
activity, and the third captures the real price of oil: yt = (qt , yt , pt )′ . For this section we use
the data sets from Kilian (2009) and Kilian and Murphy (2012), in which qt is the growth
rate of monthly world crude oil production, yt is a cost of international shipping deﬂated by
the U.S. CPI and then reported in deviations from a linear trend, and pt is the log diﬀerence
between the reﬁner acquisition cost of crude oil imports and the U.S. CPI. For details on the
various data sets used in this paper see Appendix C.
    The structural model of interest consists of the following three equations:

                                 qt = αqy yt + αqp pt + b′1 xt−1 + u1t                            (20)

                                 yt = αyq qt + αyp pt + b′2 xt−1 + u2t                            (21)

                                pt = αpq qt + αpy yt + b′3 xt−1 + u3t .                           (22)

Equation (20) is the oil supply curve, in which αqp is the short-run price elasticity of supply
and αqy allows for the possibility that economic activity could enter into the supply decision for
reasons other than its eﬀect on price. Oil supply is also presumed to be inﬂuenced by lagged
                                                                        ′     ′           ′
values of all the variables over the preceding 2 years, with xt−1 = (yt−1  , yt−2 , ..., yt−24 , 1)′ .
Equation (21) models the determinants of economic activity, with the contemporaneous eﬀects
of oil production and oil prices given by αyq and αyp , respectively. Equation (22) governs
oil demand, written here in inverse form so that αpq is the reciprocal of the short-run price
elasticity of demand. One of the goals of the investigation is to distinguish between the
consequences of shocks to oil supply u1t and shocks to oil demand u3t .


3.1    A Bayesian interpretation of Cholesky identiﬁcation.
As our ﬁrst example we consider the analysis by Kilian (2009), who used a familiar recursive
interpretation of the structural system with variables ordered as (qt , yt , pt ). From a Bayesian
perspective, this amounts to assuming that we know with certainty that production has no
contemporaneous response to either price or economic activity, so that αqy = αqp = 0, and
further that there is no contemporaneous eﬀect of oil prices on economic activity (αyp = 0).
In contrast to this certainty, the researcher acts as though he or she knows nothing at all
about how oil production might aﬀect economic activity (αyq ) or the demand parameters (αpq
or αpy ).

                                                  6
   We could represent this from a Bayesian perspective using extremely ﬂat priors for the last
3 parameters. For this purpose we used independent Student t distributions with location
parameter c = 0, scale parameter σ = 100, and ν = 3 degrees of freedom:
                                                                     ν+1
                                                                  2 − 2
                                   Γ( ν+1 )    1       αyq − c
                        p(αyq ) = ν √2      1+                             .
                                 Γ( 2 ) πνσ    ν          σ

The speciﬁcation is then a special case of the model described in Section 2 with
                                                    
                                          1    0   0
                                                    
                                   A =  −αyq  1   0                                       (23)
                                         −αpq −αpy 1

                                  p(A) = p(αyq )p(αpq )p(αpy ).

We also set κi = 0.5, selected τi as described in Appendix A, and put a very weak weight on
the Doan, Litterman and Sims (1984) random walk prior for the lagged coeﬃcients (λ0 = 109 )
to represent essentially no useful prior information about D and B.
    We calculated impulse-response functions for the above model in two ways, ﬁrst using the
traditional Cholesky decomposition of Kilian (2009), with point estimates shown as dashed
red curves in Figure 1. We also show the posterior median (solid blue) calculated using the
Bayesian algorithm described in Appendix B using the above prior distributions. The two
inferences are identical.
    Is there any beneﬁt to giving a Bayesian interpretation to this familiar method? One
interesting detail is the implied posterior distributions for αyq , αpq , and αpy which are shown
in Figure 2. Of particular interest are the prior (shown as a red curve) and posterior (blue
histogram) for αpq which is the reciprocal of the short-run price elasticity of demand (see the
upper right panel of Figure 2). The prior distribution is essentially a ﬂat line when viewed on
this scale, while the posterior has most of its mass between −0.6 and +0.2, implying a short-
run price elasticity of demand that is concentrated within (−∞, −1.67) ∪ (+5, ∞). The latter
distribution is plotted in the last panel of Figure 2. One is thus forced by this identiﬁcation
scheme to conclude that the demand curve is extremely elastic in the short run or possibly
even upward sloping.
  The claim that we know for certain that supply has no response to price at all within a
month, and yet have no reason to doubt that the response of demand could easily be ±∞
is hardly the place we would have started if we had catalogued from ﬁrst principles what we
expected to ﬁnd and how surprised we would be at various outcomes. The only reason that
thousands of previous researchers have done exactly this kind of thing is that the traditional
approach required us to choose some parameters whose values we pretend to know for certain
while acting as if we know nothing at all about plausible values for others. Scholars have

                                               7
unfortunately been trained to believe that such an all-or-nothing approach is the only way
that one could study these questions scientiﬁcally.
    The key feature in the data that forces us to impute such unlikely values for the demand
elasticity is the very low correlation between the reduced-form residuals for qt and pt . If we
assume that innovations in qt represent pure supply shifts, the lack of response of price would
force us to conclude that the demand curve is extremely ﬂat and possibly even upward sloping.


3.2    A Bayesian interpretation of sign-restricted VARs.
Many researchers have recognized some of these unappealing aspects of the traditional ap-
proach to identiﬁcation, and as a result have opted instead to use assumptions such as sign
restrictions to try to draw a structural inference in VARs. Examples include Baumeister and
Peersman (2013a) and Kilian and Murphy (2012), who began with the primitive assumptions
that (1) a favorable supply shock (increase in u1t ) leads to an increase in oil production, in-
crease in economic activity, and decrease in oil price; (2) an increase in aggregate demand
or productivity (increase in u2t ) leads to higher oil production, higher economic activity, and
higher oil price; and (3) an increase in oil-speciﬁc demand leads to higher oil production, lower
economic activity, and higher oil price. The assumption is thus that the signs of the elements
of H = A−1 are characterized by                       
                                             + + +
                                                      
                                           + + − .                                         (24)
                                            − + +
    This is more than an assumption about the signs of all the elements in A in that it fur-
ther imposes some complicated constraints on their joint magnitudes, requiring that feedback
eﬀects arising from a possible direct response of oil production to economic activity (αqy ) or
economic activity to oil production (αyq ) must be small. One simple way to guarantee the
sign restrictions is to set these two parameters to zero:
                                                   
                                      1    0   −αqp
                                                   
                                 A= 0     1   −αyp  .                                        (25)
                                     −αpq −αpy  1

Note that although we have imposed two zero restrictions, the model is still unidentiﬁed—
there is an inﬁnite number of values for {αqp , αyp , αpq , αpy } that all can achieve the identical
maximum value for the likelihood function of the observed data. We can also see that with




                                                 8
these two zero restrictions,
                                                                                 
                                                      1 − αpy αyp   αqp αpy   αqp
                                      1                                          
                  A−1 =                              αyp αpq     1 − αqp αpq αyp  .                  (26)
                           1 − αqp αpq − αpy αyp
                                                         αpq         αpy       1

If we believed that the supply curve slopes up (αqp > 0), an oil price increase depresses
economic activity (αyp < 0), the demand curve slopes down (αpq < 0), and that higher income
boosts oil demand (αpy > 0), the elements in (26) will always satisfy (24). The under-
identiﬁed system (25) with these sign restrictions is thus one way of describing the class of
models considered by earlier authors.
    One of Kilian and Murphy’s contributions was to demonstrate that sign restrictions alone
are not enough to pin down the magnitudes of interest. They argued that the supply elasticity,
although likely not literally zero as assumed in (23), is nevertheless known to be small, which
they represented with the bounds αqp ∈ [0, 0.0258]. However, they used no other information
about the supply elasticity, only imposing that it must fall within this interval. This will be
recognized as an essentially Bayesian idea in which the prior density is the uniform distribution

                                           (0.0258)−1 if αqp ∈ [0, 0.0258]
                             p(αqp ) =                                     .
                                                0          otherwise

This density is plotted as the red curve in the upper left panel of Figure 3.
    Kilian and Murphy also explored the beneﬁts of using prior information about the (2,3)
element of (26), αyp / det(A), which corresponds to the equilibrium eﬀect on economic activity
of a shock to demand. They imposed that the eﬀect of a one-standard-deviation shock was
restricted to fall in [−1.5, 0]. This prior is plotted in the bottom left panel of Figure 3.2
    By contrast, Kilian and Murphy did not use any prior information at all about the other
parameters other than the sign restrictions mentioned above. We again represent this with
the very uninformative Student t priors used in Section 3.1 now truncated by sign restrictions.
We used the algorithm described in Appendix B to form posterior inference resulting from the
prior
                                                                 √
                  p(αyp )p(αpq )p(αpy ) if αqp ∈ [0, 0.0258] and d33 αyp / det(A) ∈ [−1.5, 0]
       p(A) ∝
                           0                                   otherwise

for p(αyp ) and p(αpq ) Student t (0,100,3) densities truncated to be negative and p(αpy ) a
Student t (0,100,3) density truncated to be positive. The resulting posterior medians for the
impulse-response functions are shown in blue in Figure 4, and coincide almost exactly with the

                                                              √                    √
    Speciﬁcally, we imposed −1.5 < h23 < 0 for h23 =           d33 αyp / det(A) and d33 = 5.44, the standard
deviation of the error of the reduced-form forecast of pt .

inference reported in Kilian and Murphy’s article calculated using their original methodology,
which is reproduced as the dashed red lines in Figure 4.3
    Kilian and Murphy’s approach, like the more traditional approach to identiﬁcation dis-
cussed in Section 3.1, can thus again be given a Bayesian interpretation. But as in the
previous example, once we do so, we see prior information being used in some strange ways.
It is very odd to regard a supply elasticity of 0.0257 as perfectly plausible while maintaining
that an elasticity of 0.0259 is completely impossible. A more natural and honest represen-
tation of prior information would allow at least some possibility of larger values and would
not involve a sharp drop-oﬀ in the probability at any ﬁxed value. And it is very strange
to claim to have such precise information about the supply elasticity but know nothing at
all about the demand elasticity. Posterior distributions for the elements of A are plotted
as blue histograms in Figure 3, with the bottom right panel displaying the implied posterior
distribution for the short-run price elasticity of oil demand. The underlying model would lead
the researcher to conclude that monthly demand is extremely sensitive to the current price,
with a 60% posterior probability that a 10% increase in price leads to more than a 20% drop
in quantity demanded within a single month.
    In the following sections we review the literature on what we actually know and what we
don’t know about supply and demand elasticities.


3.3     Do we really know for certain that the oil supply elasticity is
        less than 0.0258?
The online appendix to Kilian and Murphy (2012) justiﬁes their 0.0258 bound on the supply
elasticity from the following reasoning. When Iraq invaded Kuwait in August of 1990 oil
production from both countries fell dramatically and the price went up 45.3%. But production
outside of Iraq and Kuwait increased 1.17% in August, suggesting a short-run supply elasticity
of 1.17/45.3 = 0.0258. Kilian and Murphy regarded this as an upper bound on what we might
expect in normal times due to excess capacity in 1990 and because “there was rare unanimity
among oil producers in 1990 that it was essential to oﬀset market fears about a wider war in
the Middle East.”
   Just prior to the invasion, on July 17 Iraq’s President Saddam Hussein had threatened
to use military force on Arab nations that did not curb oil production. Caldara, Cavallo,
and Iacoviello (2017) noted that the New York Times reported this threat with the headline,
“Iraq Threatens Emirates and Kuwait on Oil Glut.” Within a week, the United Arab Emi-
rates announced they would implement a signiﬁcant cut in production, and indeed U.A.E.
production in August was 19.5% lower than in July. Oil production outside of Iraq, Kuwait,

   The dashed red lines were produced using the exact methodology of their paper, which is not the posterior
median from their model.



                                                    10
and U.A.E. actually increased 1.95% in August, which would imply an elasticity of 1.95/45.3
= 0.043, almost twice the Kilian-Murphy estimate, once we acknowledge the eﬀect of the
implicit military threat on U.A.E. production.
    Caldara, Cavallo and Iacoviello further noted that August 1990 was but one of dozens of
historical episodes like this that could have been used for such calculations. Other examples
include strikes by Norwegian oil workers in 1986, attacks on Libyan oil ﬁelds in 2011, and
hurricanes disrupting Mexican production in 1995 and U.S. production in 2005 and 2008.
Estimating an average monthly supply elasticity for countries excluded from each episode
using instrumental variables, the authors came up with a short-run supply elasticity of 0.077
(three times the Kilian-Murphy upper bound) with a standard error of 0.037.
    Figure 5 plots monthly production from Saudi Arabia in which one clearly sees high-
frequency adjustments to changing market conditions. In response to weaker demand during
the recession of 1981-82, the kingdom reduced production by 6 million barrels per day, im-
plementing by itself an 11% drop in total global production. The Saudis initiated another
production decrease of 1.6 mb/d in December 2000 (a few months before the U.S. recession
started in March of 2001) and only started to increase production in March of 2002 (four
months after the recession had ended). The 1.6 mb/d drop in Saudi production between
June 2008 and February 2009 was another clear response to market conditions in an eﬀort
to stabilize prices. Equally dramatic in the graph are the rapid increases in Saudi produc-
tion beginning in August 1990 and January 2003 which were intended to oﬀset some of the
anticipated lost production from Iraq associated with the two Gulf Wars.
    Bjørnland, Nordvik and Rohrer (2017) analyzed monthly crude oil production from 15,000
individual wells in North Dakota over 1986 to 2015. They found producers varied both the
timing of completion of new wells as well as production ﬂows from existing wells in response
to monthly changes in prices, consistent with a short-run supply elasticity as high as 0.2 for
some shale producers.
    Even Kilian and Murphy (2012) implicitly acknowledged that they themselves were not
certain that the supply elasticity is below 0.0258, insofar as they also reported some results
using an upper bound two or three times this magnitude. If we were to give that procedure of
reporting multiple estimates a Bayesian interpretation, it amounts to ﬁrst producing an answer
as if we were certain the elasticity is below 0.0258, then producing an alternative answer as
if we were certain the elasticity is below 0.0516. Of course the correct Bayesian way to use
this kind of prior information is to acknowledge that we are not certain that the elasticity is
below 0.0258, nor are we certain that it is below 0.0516. But we do attach lower and lower
prior plausibility to higher and higher elasticities. This is the approach we will follow in the
analysis conducted below.

3.4     Do we really know nothing about the elasticity of demand?
Hundreds of studies have looked at the price elasticity of oil demand using all kinds of diﬀerent
data sources and methods. Studies using cross-section data include Hausman and Newey’s
(1995) estimate from a cross-section of U.S. households of a long-run price elasticity of gasoline
demand of −0.81 and Yatchew and No’s (2001) estimate of −0.9 from a cross-section of
Canadian households. Figure 6 displays some cross-country evidence, comparing petroleum
use per dollar of GDP with the price of gasoline for 23 OECD countries.4 The relative price of
gasoline diﬀers substantially across countries primarily due to diﬀerences in taxes. Residents
in countries with higher taxes use petroleum less, a ﬁnding that is well documented in the
literature.5 The regression line in the ﬁrst panel of Figure 6 implies an absolute value for the
demand elasticity of 0.51 with a standard error of 0.23, statistically signiﬁcantly greater than
zero and less than one. Since tax diﬀerentials tend to be stable over time, this coeﬃcient is
usually interpreted as a long-run demand elasticity. For example, one obtains virtually the
same regression if 2004 consumption is regressed on 2000 prices, as seen in the second panel
of Figure 6.
    Dahl and Sterner (1991) surveyed 296 diﬀerent estimates of the long-run price elasticity
of gasoline demand based on cross-section, time-series, and panel data, and found an average
value of −0.86. Espey’s (1998) literature review came up with −0.58; Graham and Glaister
(2004) settled on −0.77, while Brons et al. (2008) proposed −0.84. Insofar as taxes and
reﬁning costs are a signiﬁcant component of the user cost for reﬁned products, a 10% increase
in the price of crude petroleum should result in a less than 10% increase in the retail price of
gasoline, meaning that the price elasticity of demand for crude oil should be less than that for
gasoline.
   And there is no doubt that the short-run elasticity is signiﬁcantly less than the long run.
For example, it takes more than a decade for the stock of automobiles to turn over. Dahl and
Sterner’s (1991) survey found an average short-run elasticity of −0.26. Hughes, Knittel and
Sperling (2008) used exogenous petroleum supply disruptions as an instrument to conclude
that the short-run gasoline price elasticity was below 0.08 in absolute value for U.S. data over
2001-2006. Gelman et al. (2017) estimated a short-run elasticity of −0.22 with a standard
error of 0.05 from observations on individual ﬁnancial transactions of a half million consumers,
while Coglianese et al. (2017) used state tax changes as an instrument to arrive at an estimate
of −0.37 with a standard error of 0.24.
   We conclude that short-run oil demand elasticities above two in absolute value, such as

4    Inventories and measurement error.
Kilian and Murphy (2014) noted that another important factor in interpreting short-run co-
movements of quantities and prices is the behavior of inventories. Increased oil production
in month t does not have to be consumed that month but might instead go into inventories:

                                        QSt − QD     ∗
                                               t = ∆It .


Here QD                                                       S
      t is the quantity of oil demanded globally in month t, Qt is the quantity produced,
and ∆It∗ is the true change in global inventories. We append a * to the latter magnitude
in recognition of the fact that we have only imperfect observations on this quantity, the
implications of which we will discuss below.
   Let qt = 100 ln(Qt /Qt−1 ) denote the observed monthly growth rate of production. We can
then approximate the growth in consumption demand as qt − ∆i∗t for ∆i∗t = 100∆It∗ /Qt−1 . We
are thus led to consider the following generalization of the system considered in Section 3.2:

                                    qt = αqp pt + b′1 xt−1 + u∗1t                           (27)

                                   yt = αyp pt + b′2 xt−1 + u∗2t                            (28)

                            qt = βqy yt + βqp pt + ∆i∗t + b′3 xt−1 + u∗3t                   (29)

                          ∆i∗t = ψ1∗ qt + ψ2∗ yt + ψ3∗ pt + b∗′        ∗
                                                             4 xt−1 + u4t .                 (30)

Here u∗1t , u∗2t , and u∗3t as before represent shocks to oil supply, economic activity, and oil-
speciﬁc demand, with the modiﬁcation to equation (29) acknowledging that oil produced but
not consumed in the current period goes into inventories. The shock u∗4t in (30) represents
a separate shock to inventory demand, which has sometimes been described as a “speculative
demand shock” in the literature.
    As noted above, we do not have good data on global oil inventories. There are data on
U.S. crude oil inventories and monthly OECD reﬁned-product inventories, from which we can
construct a measure of crude oil inventories for OECD countries as in Kilian and Murphy
(2014, footnote 6); for details see Appendix C. We represent the fact that these numbers are
an imperfect measure of the true magnitude through a measurement-error equation

                                         ∆it = χ∆i∗t + et                                   (31)

where ∆it denotes our estimate of the change in OECD crude-oil inventories as a percent
of the previous month’s world production, χ < 1 is a parameter representing the fact that

                                                 13
OECD inventories are only part of the world total, and et reﬂects measurement error which
we assume to be serially uncorrelated and uncorrelated with u∗t . Although the problem of
having imperfect measurements on key variables is endemic in macroeconomics, it has been
virtually ignored in most of the large literature on structural vector autoregressions because
it was not clear how to allow for it using traditional methods.6 However, it is straightforward
to incorporate measurement error in our Bayesian framework, as we now demonstrate.
    We can use (31) to rewrite (29) and (30) in terms of observables:

                        qt = βqy yt + βqp pt + χ−1 ∆it + b′3 xt−1 + u∗3t − χ−1 et                    (32)

                          ∆it = ψ1 qt + ψ2 yt + ψ3 pt + b′4 xt−1 + χu∗4t + et                        (33)

where ψj = χψj∗ for j = 1, 2, 3. Equations (27), (28), (32), and (33) will be recognized as a
system of the form
                                    Ãyt = B̃xt−1 + ũt                                  (34)

    Note that although we have explicitly modeled the role of measurement error in con-
tributing to contemporaneous correlations among the variables, we have greatly simpliﬁed the
analysis by specifying the lagged dynamics of the structural system directly in terms of the
observed variables. That is, we are deﬁning xt−1 in (27)-(30) to be based on lags of ∆it−j
rather than ∆i∗t−j .
   The residuals ũ3t and ũ4t in (34) are contemporaneously correlated. We show in Appendix
D that by premultiplying (34) by the matrix Γ in expression (48), we can transform it into a
representation of the form of (1), in which the shocks are uncorrelated. The matrix Γ is a
function of ρ, the negative of a coeﬃcient from a regression of ũ4t on ũ3t :

                                                     χ−1 σe2
                                           ρ=                   .                                    (37)

    Notable exceptions are Cogley and Sargent (2015) who allowed for measurement error using a state-space
model and Amir-Ahmadi, Matthes, and Wang (2017) who identiﬁed measurement error from the diﬀerence
between preliminary and revised data.

                                                     14
For the transformed system we can generate draws for the parameters A, D, B in (1) using
the algorithm described in Appendix B.
   From these we can then go back and calculate the values of Ã, D̃, B̃ for the parameters in
(34) to make structural inference. To calculate structural impulse-response functions, note
that premultiplying (34) by Ã−1 puts the system in the reduced form (15) with ǫt = Ã−1 ũt .

    For purposes of calculating a historical decomposition, conditional on a draw of the pa-
rameters, ũt can be uncovered from (34) as ũt = Ãyt − B̃xt−1 . However, observation of
the four elements of ũt is not enough to know the value of the ﬁve shocks u∗1t , u∗2t , u∗3t , u∗4t , et .
Nevertheless, we can form an optimal estimate of those 5 magnitudes for each historical date
t. This gives us an estimate of the contribution of each of the ﬁve shocks to the observed
historical values for YT . Again see Appendix D for details.


5     A true Bayesian analysis of the shocks to oil supply
      and demand.
In addition to making use of the prior information about price elasticities reviewed in Sections
3.3 and 3.4, we propose to use prior information about coeﬃcients involving the economic
activity measure yt . For this purpose it is very helpful to use a more conventional measure
of economic activity in place of the proxy based on shipping costs that was used in Kilian
(2009) and Kilian and Murphy (2012, 2014). Among other beneﬁts this allows us to draw
directly on information about income elasticities from previous studies. We developed an
extended version of the OECD’s index of monthly industrial production in the OECD and 6
major other countries as described in Appendix C.
    Of course, even more important than having good prior information is having more data.
Kilian (2009) and Kilian and Murphy (2012, 2014) used the reﬁner acquisition cost as the
measure of crude oil prices.       Their series begins in January 1973.         Taking diﬀerences and

                                                    15
including 24 lags means that the ﬁrst value for the dependent variable in their regressions is
February 1975. Thus their analysis makes no use of the important economic responses in
1973 and 1974 to the large oil price increases at the time, nor any earlier observations.
    Kilian and Vigfusson (2011) argued that use of the older data is inappropriate since struc-
tural relations may have changed over time, suggesting that this is a reason to ignore the
earlier data altogether. Moreover, their preferred oil price measure (U.S. reﬁner acquisition
cost, or RAC) is not available before 1974, which might seem to make use of earlier data
infeasible. Here again the Bayesian approach oﬀers a compelling advantage, in that we can
use results obtained from estimating the model using earlier data for the price of West Texas
Intermediate (WTI) as a prior for the analysis of the subsequent RAC data, putting as much
or as little weight as desired on the earlier data set. We describe how this can be done below.


5.1     Informative priors for structural parameters.
This section discusses the prior information used in our structural analysis.

5.1.1   Priors for A.

The discussion in Sections 3.3 and 3.4 leads us to conclude that the absolute values of the
short-run demand elasticity βqp and the short-run supply elasticity αqp are unlikely to be much
bigger than 0.5. We represent this with a prior for βqp that is a Student t(cβqp , σqp  β    β
                                                                                          , νqp ) with
               β                              β         β
mode at cqp = −0.1, scale parameter σqp = 0.2, νqp = 3 degrees of freedom, and truncated to
be negative. This allows a 10% probability that βqp < −0.5. Our prior for αqp is Student
t(cαqp , σqp
          α     α
             , νqp ) with mode at cαqp = 0.1, scale parameter σqp
                                                               α          α
                                                                  = 0.2, νqp = 3 degrees of freedom,
and truncated to be positive. These along with our other priors are summarized in Table 1
and displayed as the red curves in Figure 7. Appendix F provides additional demonstration
that these are relatively weak priors that are perfectly consistent with values for the supply
elasticity as low as those maintained by Kilian and Murphy (2012, 2014), but also allow the
possibility of a supply elasticity greater than 0.0258.
     Because we use a conventional measure of industrial production we are able to make use
of other evidence about the income elasticity of oil demand. Gately and Huntington (2002)
reported a nearly linear relationship between log income and log oil demand in developing
countries with elasticities ranging between 0.7 and 1, but smaller income elasticities in indus-
trialized countries with values between 0.4 and 0.5. For oil-exporting countries they found
an income elasticity closer to 1. Csereklyei, Rubio, and Stern (2016) found that the income
elasticity of energy demand is remarkably stable across countries and across time at a value of
around 0.7. For our prior for βqy we use a Student t density with mode at 0.7, scale parameter
0.2, 3 degrees of freedom, and truncated to be positive.
    We expect the eﬀect of oil prices on economic activity αyp to be small given the small


                                                 16
dollar share of crude oil expenditures compared to total GDP (see for example the discussion
in Hamilton, 2013). We represent this with a Student t distribution with mode −0.05, scale
0.1, 3 degrees of freedom, and truncated to be negative.
    The parameter χ reﬂects the fraction of total world inventories that are held in OECD
countries. Since OECD countries account for around 60% of world petroleum consumption
on average over our sample period, a natural expectation is that they also account for about
60% of global inventory. Since χ is necessarily a fraction between 0 and 1, we use a Beta
distribution with parameters αχ = 15 and βχ = 10, which has mean 0.6 and standard deviation
of about 0.1.
    For the parameters of the inventory equation, we assume that inventories depend on income
only through the eﬀects of income on quantity or price. This allows us to set ψ2 = 0 to help
with identiﬁcation. We use relatively uninformative priors for the other coeﬃcients, taking
both ψ1 and ψ3 to be unrestricted Student t centered at 0 with scale parameter 0.5, and 3
degrees of freedom.
   The parameter ρ in (37) captures the importance of inventory measurement error and is
between 0 and χ by construction.7 We accordingly use a prior for ρ conditional on χ that is
χ times a Beta-distributed variable with parameters αρ = 3 and βρ = 9, which has a mean of
0.25χ and standard deviation of 0.12χ.
    We can also make use of prior information about the likely equilibrium impacts of various
shocks, which amount to prior beliefs about how the various elements of A may be related.

   Unless the determinant is restricted to be positive, all shocks could have either positive
or negative eﬀects on any variable. We could put as much or as little weight as we like
on the prior belief that h1 = det(Ã) > 0 using the asymmetric t distribution introduced by

Baumeister and Hamilton (2017):

                              p(h1 ) = k1 σ1−1 φ̃v1 ((h1 − µ1 )/σ1 )Φ(λ1 h1 /σ1 ).                   (41)

Here φ̃v1 (x) denotes the probability density function of a standard Student t variable with ν1
degrees of freedom evaluated at the point x, Φ(x) is the cumulative distribution function for a
standard N (0, 1) variable, and k1 is a constant to make the density integrate to unity8 . The
parameter λ1 governs how strongly the distribution of h1 is skewed to be positive. When
λ1 = 0 the density (41) is a symmetric Student t(µ1 , σ1 , ν1 ) distribution, while when λ1 → ∞
it becomes a Student t distribution truncated to be positive. To determine the location
parameter µ1 , we generated 50,000 draws for θA = (αqp , αyp , βqy , βqp , χ, ψ1 , ψ3 , ρ)′ from the
densities described in Table 1 and used the average value across these draws to obtain µ1 = 0.6.
We set σ1 = 1.6, the standard deviation of det(Ã) across these draws. Setting λ1 = 2 and
ν1 = 3 associates a 91.2% prior probability to det(Ã) > 0. This prior distribution for h1 is
plotted in red in the next-to-last panel in Figure 7.
    Even if det(Ã) > 0 and the other restrictions we have used are all imposed, the signs of
some elements of the impact matrix Ã−1 are still ambiguous:

These ambiguities arise from equilibrium feedback eﬀects. For example, from (40) the (2,2)
element of Ã−1 can be written as

                                                    det(Ã)+αyp βqy
                                             h2 =                   .
                                                        det(Ã)

If oil demand increases suﬃciently much in response to higher economic activity (βqy large)
and higher oil prices depress economic activity suﬃciently much (αyp a big negative number),
it is possible in principle for h2 to be a negative number. We can represent a belief that these
feedback eﬀects are modest with a prior for h2 that is a symmetric Student t distribution with
µ2 = 0.8, σ2 = 0.2, and ν2 = 3, which imply a 98.6% prior probability that h2 > 0.
     We thus use the prior

            p(θA ) ∝ p(αqp )p(αyp )p(βqy )p(βqp )p(χ)p(ψ1 )p(ψ3 )p(ρ|χ)p(h1 (θA ))p(h2 (θA ))        (42)

which gives the numerical value for p(A) used in the numerator of (12) that is associated with

      We don’t need to know the value of k1 for purposes of the algorithm described in Appendix B.

any proposed value for θ A . Odd-numbered columns of Table 2 report the prior probabilities
implied by (42) that the equilibrium impact of any given shock on any given variable is positive.
   Our priors also imply probable signs for the eﬀects s periods after a given shock based on
the dynamics incorporated in the prior p(B|A, D) described below. More persistence in B
implies more persistence in the eﬀects of shocks.

5.1.2   Priors for D given A.

Our priors for the reciprocals of the structural variances are independent Gamma distributions,
d−1
 ii |A ∼ Γ(κi , τi (A)), that reﬂect the scale of the data as measured by the standard deviation
of 12th-order univariate autoregressions ﬁt to the 4 elements of yt over t = 1, ..., T1 for T1
the number of observations in the earlier sample. Letting Ŝ denote the estimated variance-
covariance matrix of these univariate residuals, we set κi = 2 (which give the priors a weight
of about 4 observations in the ﬁrst subsample) and τi (A) = κi a′i Ŝai where a′i denotes the ith
row of A.

5.1.3   Priors for B given A and D.

Our priors for the lagged coeﬃcients in the ith structural equation are independent Normals,
bi |A, D ∼ N (mi , dii M). Our prior expectation is that changes in oil production, economic
activity, oil prices, and inventories are all hard to forecast, meaning our prior expected value
for most coeﬃcients is mi = 0 for i = 1, ..., 4. We allow for the possibility that the 1-period-
lag response of supply or demand to a price increase could be similar to the contemporaneous
magnitudes, and for this reason set the third element of m1 to +0.1 and the third element of
m3 to −0.1; this gives us a little more information to try to distinguish supply and demand
shocks. All other elements of m1 , ..., m4 are set to zero. For M, which governs the variances
of these priors, we follow Doan, Litterman and Sims (1984) in having more conﬁdence that
coeﬃcients on higher lags are zero. We implement this by setting diagonal elements of M to
the values speciﬁed in equation (44) and other elements of M to zero, as detailed in Appendix
A. For our baseline analysis, we use a value of λ0 = 0.5 to control the overall informativeness
of these priors on lagged coeﬃcients, which amounts to weighting the prior on the lag-one
coeﬃcients equal to about 2 observations.

5.1.4   Using observations from an earlier sample to further inform the prior.

We propose to use observations over 1958:M1 to 1975:M1 to further inform our prior. The
observation vector yt for date t in this ﬁrst sample consists of the growth rate of world oil
production, growth rate of OECD+6 industrial production, growth rate of WTI, and change in
estimated OECD inventories as a percent of the previous month’s oil production. We have T1
observations in the ﬁrst sample for this (n×1) vector {yt }Tt=1

                                                                and associated (nm+1×1) vector

            containing m = 12 lagged values of y and the constant term. For the second sample
(1975:M2 to 2016:M12) we use the percent change in the reﬁner acquisition cost (RAC) for the
third element of yt for which we have observations {yt , xt−1 }Tt=T
                                                                 1 +T2
                                                                     1 +1
                                                                          . Denote the observations

for the ﬁrst sample by Y and those for the second sample by Y and collect all the unknown
elements of A, D, and B in a vector λ.
    If we regarded both samples as equally informative about λ we could simply collect all the
data in a single sample YT = {Y (1) , Y(2) } and apply our method directly to ﬁnd p(λ|YT ).
This would be numerically identical to using our method to ﬁnd the posterior distribution from
the ﬁrst sample alone p(λ|Y(1) ) and then using this distribution as the prior for analyzing the
second sample (see Appendix E for demonstration of this and subsequent claims). We propose
instead to use as a prior for the second sample an inference that downweights the inﬂuence
of the ﬁrst-sample data Y (1) by a factor 0 ≤ µ ≤ 1. When µ = 1 the observations in the
ﬁrst sample are regarded as equally important as those in the second, while when µ = 0 the
ﬁrst sample is completely discarded. Our baseline analysis below sets µ = 0.5, which regards
observations in the ﬁrst sample as only half as informative as those in the second.
   Implementing this procedure requires a simple modiﬁcation of the procedure described in
Section 2.2. We replace equations (8), (9) and (5) with

Thus the mean for the prior used to analyze the second sample (a′i Φ̂(1) ) would be the coeﬃcient
from an OLS regression on the ﬁrst sample. When µ = 1 our conﬁdence in this prior comes
from the variance of the OLS regression estimate (dii M(1) ), but the variance increases as µ
decreases. As µ approaches 0 the variance of the prior goes to inﬁnity and the information
in the ﬁrst sample would be completely ignored.
    Likewise with no information about the structural variances other than the estimates from
the ﬁrst sample (κ = τ = 0), the prior for the structural variances that we would use for the
second sample would be

Again the mean of this distribution is the ﬁrst-sample OLS estimate (T1 /(a′i ζ (1) ai )) but the
variance goes to inﬁnity as µ → 0.

5.1.5   Comparison with Kilian and Murphy (2014).

Kilian and Murphy (2014) also used a 4-variable model of the global oil market to address
some of the questions considered in our paper. Here we summarize the key diﬀerences between
our approaches.
    First, Kilian and Murphy (2014), like Kilian and Murphy (2012), assumed that the supply
elasticity is known with certainty to be below 0.0258, a claim of prior knowledge that we
regard as unfounded for reasons detailed in Section 3.3. Kilian and Murphy (2014) imposed a
large number of such restrictions as if they were all known with certainty. Running their code
exactly as posted on the journal’s website generates 5 million draws of which only 16 satisfy all
of the restrictions they imposed. The ﬁgures in their article came from somewhat arbitrarily
choosing a single “representative” model among these 16. Even if one accepted that notion,
it poses practical problems for researchers wishing to replicate or update their ﬁndings; in
fact, one arrives at diﬀerent results even on their original data set if the code is simply rerun
with a diﬀerent starting seed for the random number generator (see Figure 8). By contrast,
all of the results we report below are based on 1 million draws, for which magnitudes like the
posterior median and posterior credibility sets are well motivated and well estimated summary
statistics. Furthermore, our summary statistics directly acknowledge both estimation error
and uncertainty about the identiﬁcation itself.
    Second, Kilian and Murphy measured aggregate economic activity using a detrended av-
erage commodity shipping cost. This series has exhibited erratic behavior in the data since
their study was conducted that likely reﬂects volatility in the ship-building and scrapping
cycle since the Great Recession and the collapse in iron ore shipments. Indeed, if one insisted

                                                 21
that this remains a reliable measure of world economic activity, it would force us to conclude
that the decline in world economic activity in 2015-2016 was even more severe than in the
ﬁnancial crisis of the Great Recession (see Figure 1 in Kilian and Zhou, 2017). Our preferred
variable, the log of world industrial production, is measured in standard economic units. This
allows us to estimate the percent change in world industrial production that would result from
a supply shock of speciﬁed size, something that Kilian and Murphy could not do.
    Other important diﬀerences are Kilian and Murphy (2014) treated global oil inventories as
if observed without measurement error. Our analysis below suggests that measurement error
in this series is quite important. They also completely threw out data before 1975. Our
approach downweights these data but does not ignore them altogether.
    Despite these major methodological diﬀerences, some of our conclusions are similar to
those reached by Kilian and Murphy (2014). We highlight below points on which our ﬁndings
reinforce and where they raise doubts about conclusions from the previous literature.


5.2     Empirical results.
The solid red curves in Figure 7 denote diﬀerent components of the prior information about the
contemporaneous coeﬃcients in A on which our analysis draws. The posterior distributions
with pre-1975 observations downweighted by µ = 0.5 are reported as blue histograms.9
    The posterior median of the short-run price elasticity of oil supply, αqp , is 0.15, a little
above Caldara, Cavallo and Iacoviello’s (2017) estimate of 0.11. Values less than 0.05 or
greater than 0.5 are substantially less plausible after seeing the data than anticipated by our
prior. The posterior median of the short-run price elasticity of oil demand, βqp , is −0.35,
signiﬁcantly more elastic than anticipated by our prior. Values for these and several other
magnitudes of interest are reported in column 1 of Table 3.
    Posterior structural impulse-response functions are plotted in Figure 9.10 An oil supply
shock (ﬁrst row) lowers oil production and raises oil price on impact, whereas a shock to oil
consumption demand (third row) raises production and raises price. An oil supply shock
also leads to a decline in economic activity. The eﬀect on impact is practically zero (see the
(1,2) panel of Figure 7), but accumulates over time (the (1,2) panel of Figure 9), a conclusion
consistent with a large number of studies going back to Hamilton (1983). Our estimates imply
that a reduction in oil production that raises the oil price by 10% would lower world economic
activity by 0.5% after a year. By contrast, if oil prices rise as a consequence of a shock to
consumption demand, there seems to be no eﬀect on subsequent economic activity. A similar
conclusion was reached by Kilian (2009) and Kilian and Murphy (2012, 2014), though it is

     Note following standard practice these are accumulated impulse-response functions, plotting elements of
(H∗0 + H∗1 + · · · + H∗s ) as a function of s where H∗s is given in (39). For example, panel (1,3) shows the eﬀect
on the level of oil prices s periods after an oil supply shock.

a little harder to interpret the ﬁnding in their exercise due to the indirect nature of their
proxy for world economic activity. An increase in oil prices that results from an increase
in inventory demand alone, which has sometimes been described as a speculative demand
shock, seems to have a persistent eﬀect on both inventories and prices and a negative eﬀect
on economic activity as well.
    Figure 10 shows the historical decomposition of oil price movements along with 95% credi-
bility regions.11 Column 3 of Table 4 summarizes the contribution of supply shocks to several
historical episodes of interest. Whereas Kilian (2009) and Kilian and Murphy (2012) con-
cluded that the supply disruptions associated with the First Persian Gulf War played little
direct role in the price increase, we ﬁnd supply and demand shocks to have been equally
important in this episode; a similar conclusion was reached by Kilian and Murphy (2014).
We also ﬁnd that accumulated supply shocks over 2007-2008 (showing up as an unexpected
stagnation in global oil production) also accounted for much of the oil price run-up over that
period, consistent with the analysis in Hamilton (2009), but in contrast to the conclusion in
Kilian and Murphy (2012, 2014). We ﬁnd supply shocks were less than half the story behind
the oil price collapse in 2014-2016. That ﬁnding diﬀers from that of Baﬀes et al. (2015) but
is consistent with the conclusions of Hamilton (2015) and Baumeister and Kilian (2016). Our
estimates attribute most of the oil price rebound in 2016 to strong demand.
    The results in the last panel of Figure 10 suggest that inventory demand shocks have played
a much smaller role in price ﬂuctuations than implied by the analysis in Kilian and Murphy
(2012, 2014) and Juvenal and Petrella (2014). A key reason we reach a diﬀerent conclusion
from these earlier researchers is our allowance for the possibility that our measure of world
inventories contains a lot of error. The posterior median of σe2 is 0.99,12 which is a sizeable
fraction of the total variance of the reduced-form VAR forecast of observed inventory changes
(ω̂44 = 1.06).13
    Our overall conclusion is that speculation is less important, and shocks to fundamentals, in
particular, shocks to supply, were more important, than was found in several previous studies.


6      Sensitivity analysis.
The above results achieved partial identiﬁcation by drawing on a large number of diﬀerent
sources of information. One beneﬁt of using multiple sources is that we can examine the
eﬀects of putting less weight on any particular components of the prior to see how it aﬀects
  11
     The ﬁgure plots the contribution of the current and s = 100 previous structural shocks to the value of yt
for each date t plotted.
  12
     We used equations (55) and (50) to calculate the value of σe2 = ρχd33 associated with each draw of θA .
  13
     Nor is it the case that our implied measurement error is imputed to have any signiﬁcant eﬀects. The
share of the 4 price movements in Table 4 attributed to measurement error shocks from equation (61) is 4.7%,
1.4%, 3.1%, and 1.7%, respectively.



                                                     23
the results.
   Table 3 presents the posterior median and posterior 68% credibility sets for some of the
magnitudes of interest when we weaken diﬀerent components of the prior. The ﬁrst column
presents results from the baseline speciﬁcation that were just summarized. Panels A and B
report inference about the short-run supply elasticity αqp and demand elasticity βqp . Panel
C looks at the response of economic activity 12 months after a supply shock, panel D the
response to an oil consumption demand shock, and panel E the response to an inventory
demand shock, with each shock normalized for purposes of the table as an event that leads to
a 10% increase in the real oil price at time 0. Note that this is a diﬀerent normalization from
that used in Figure 9, where the eﬀect plotted was that of a one-unit change in the structural
shock ∂yi,t+s /∂u∗jt .
   Table 4 reports a few summary statistics for the historical decomposition. Column 2
reports the actual cumulative magnitude of the oil price change (as measured by the reﬁner
acquisition cost) in four important episodes in the sample. Column 3 reports the posterior
median and 68% credibility sets for the predicted change over that interval if the only structural
shocks had come from the oil supply equation as inferred using the baseline prior.14
   We next explored the consequences of using a much weaker prior for the short-run supply
                                                         α     β
and demand elasticities, replacing the scale parameters σqp = σqp = 0.2 that were used in the
                                               α      β
baseline analysis with the alternative values σqp = σqp  = 1.0. This change gives the prior
for these two parameters a variance that is 25 times larger than in the baseline speciﬁcation,
with the result that prior information about these parameters is allowed to have very little
inﬂuence on any of our conclusions The implications of these changes for inference about key
magnitudes are reported in column 2 of Table 3. If we had very little prior information about
the elasticities themselves, we would tend to infer a smaller short-run supply elasticity (panel
A) and more elastic demand (panel B). Our core conclusions about impulse responses (panels
C-E) do not change.
    Our prior beliefs about the role of measurement error were represented by the Beta(αχ , βχ )
distribution for χ (which summarizes the ratio of OECD inventories to world total) and χ times
a Beta(αρ , βρ ) variable for ρ (which summarizes the component of the correlation between price
and inventory changes that is attributed to measurement error). Our baseline speciﬁcation
used αχ = 15, βχ = 10, αρ = 3, βρ = 9, which imply standard deviations for the priors of 0.1
and 0.12χ, respectively. In our less informative alternative speciﬁcation we take αχ = 1.5,
βχ = 1, αρ = 1, βρ = 3, whose standard deviations are 0.26 and 0.19χ, respectively. The
implications of this weaker prior about the role of measurement error are reported in column
3 of Table 3 and column 5 of Table 4. These results are virtually identical to those for our
  14
     Let pt denote the 100 times the change in log oil price in month t (the dashed line in the top panel of Figure
10) and p̂t1 the value of the solid line for that date. The number reported in column 2 is pt0 + pt0 +1 + · · · + pt1
for t0 = July 1990 and t1 = October 1990. The number reported in column 3 is p̂t0 ,1 + p̂t0 +1,1 + · · · + p̂t1 ,1 .

baseline speciﬁcation.
    Next we examined the consequences of paying less attention to data prior to 1975. Our
baseline speciﬁcation set µ = 0.5, which gives pre-1975 data half the weight of the more recent
data. Our less informative alternative uses µ = 0.25, thus regarding the earlier data as only
1/4 as important as the more recent numbers. The inferences diﬀer only slightly from those
under our baseline speciﬁcation.
    The role of prior information about lagged structural coeﬃcients bi is summarized by the
value of λ0 in (44). An increase in λ0 increases the variance on all the priors involving the
lagged coeﬃcients. Our baseline speciﬁcation took λ0 = 0.5, whereas the weaker value of
λ0 = 1 (which implies a variance 4 times as large) was used in column 5 of Table 3 and column
7 of Table 4. This has only a modest eﬀect on any of the inferences.
    The weight on prior information about structural variances is captured by the value of κ in
equation (5). Our baseline speciﬁcation used κ = 2, which gives the prior a weight of about
4 observations. The alternative in column 6 of Table 3 and column 8 of Table 4 uses κ = 0.5.
This does not matter for any of the conclusions.
    Finally, in making use of the historical data we relied on WTI prices prior to 1975, since
the reﬁner acquisition cost is unavailable. But our baseline analysis nevertheless used RAC as
the oil price measure since 1975. An alternative is to use WTI for both samples. Column 9
of Table 4 reports the measured size of the oil price change recorded by WTI in four episodes
of interest. The two oil prices can give quite diﬀerent answers for the size of the move in any
given month. Nevertheless, the inference about key model parameters (column 7 of Table 3)
is the same regardless of which measure we use.


7    Conclusion.
Prior information has played a key role in any structural analysis of vector autoregressions.
Typically prior information has been treated as “all or nothing,” which from a Bayesian per-
spective would be described as either dogmatic priors (details that the analyst claims to know
with certainty before seeing the data) or completely uninformative priors. In this paper we
noted that there is vast middle ground between these two extremes. We advocate that analysts
should both relax the dogmatic priors, acknowledging that we have some uncertainty about
the identifying assumptions themselves, and strengthen the uninformative priors, drawing on
whatever information may be known outside of the data set being analyzed.
    We illustrated these concepts by revisiting the role of supply and demand shocks in oil
markets. We demonstrated how previous studies can be viewed as a special case of Bayesian
inference and proposed a generalization that draws on a rich set of information beyond the
data being analyzed while simultaneously relaxing some of the dogmatic priors implicit in
traditional identiﬁcation. Notwithstanding, we end up conﬁrming some of the core conclusions

                                              25
of earlier studies. A key diﬀerence from earlier analyses is that supply shocks appear to be
more important and speculative demand shocks less important than found by some earlier
researchers. We ﬁnd that oil price increases that result from supply shocks lead to a reduction
in economic activity after a signiﬁcant lag, whereas price increases that result from increases
in oil consumption demand do not have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on economic activity. We also
examined the sensitivity of our results to the priors used, and found that many of the key
conclusions change very little when substantially less weight is placed on various components
of the prior information.

   A. Reference priors for D and B.
    Prior for D|A. Prior beliefs about structural variances should reﬂect in part the scale of
the underlying data. Let êit denote the residual of an mth-order univariate autoregression ﬁt
to series i and Ŝ the sample variance matrix of these univariate residuals (sij = T −1 Tt=1 êit êjt ).
Baumeister and Hamilton (2015) proposed setting κi /τi (the prior mean for d−1     ii ) equal to the
                                                    ′
reciprocal of the ith diagonal element of AŜA ; in other words, τi (A) = κi a′i Ŝai . Given
equation (5), the prior carries a weight equivalent to 2κi observations of data; for example,
setting κi = 2 would give the prior as much weight as 4 observations.
    Prior for B|A, D. A standard prior for many data sets suggested by Doan, Litterman and
Sims (1984) is that individual series behave like random walks. Baumeister and Hamilton
(2015, equation 45) adapted Sims and Zha’s (1998) method for representing this in terms of
a particular speciﬁcation for mi (A). For other data sets, such as the one analyzed in Section
5, a more natural prior is that series behave like white noise (mi = 0). For either case, we
recommend following Doan, Litterman and Sims (1984) in placing greater conﬁdence in our
expectation that coeﬃcients on higher lags are zero, implemented by using smaller values for
the diagonal elements for Mi associated with higher lags. Deﬁne

                               v1′ = 1/(12λ1 , 1/(22λ1 ), ..., 1/(m2λ1 ))                           (43)

                                                       λ23
Then Mi is taken to be a diagonal matrix whose (r, r) element is the rth element of v3 :

                                              Mi,rr = v3r .                                         (45)

Here λ0 summarizes the overall conﬁdence in the prior (with smaller λ0 corresponding to
greater weight given to the prior), λ1 governs how much more conﬁdent we are that higher
coeﬃcients are zero (with a value of λ1 = 0 giving all lags equal weight), and λ3 is a separate
parameter governing the tightness of the prior for the constant term, with all λk ≥ 0.
    Doan (2013) discussed possible values for these parameters. For the baseline speciﬁcation
in Section 5 we set λ1 = 1 (which governs how quickly the prior for lagged coeﬃcients tightens
to zero as the lag ℓ increases), λ3 = 100 (which makes the prior on the constant term essentially
irrelevant), and set λ0 , the parameter controlling the overall tightness of the prior, to 0.5.

   B. Details of Bayesian algorithm.
    For any numerical value of A we can calculate ζi∗ (A) and τi∗ (A) using equations (7) and
(6) from which we can calculate the log of the target

                     q(A) = log(p(A)) + (T /2) log det AΩ̂T A′                               (46)
                                n    ∗                              n
                           −    i=1 κi   log[(2/T )τi∗ (A)] +       i=1 κi   log τi (A).

We can improve the eﬃciency of the algorithm by using information about the shape of this
function calculated as follows. Collect elements of A that are not known with certainty in an
(nα × 1) vector α, and ﬁnd the value α̂ that maximizes (46) numerically. This value α̂ oﬀers
a reasonable guess for the posterior mean of α, while the matrix of second derivatives (again
obtained numerically) gives an idea of the curvature of the posterior distribution:

                                              ∂ 2 q(A(α))
                                    Λ̂ = −                          .
                                                 ∂α∂α′      α=α̂

We then use this guess to inform a random-walk Metropolis Hastings algorithm to generate
candidate draws of α from the posterior distribution, as follows. As a result of step ℓ we have
generated a value of α(ℓ) . For step ℓ + 1 we generate
                                                                ′
                                  α̃(ℓ+1) = α(ℓ) + ξ Q̂−1           vt

for vt an (nα × 1) vector of Student t variables with 2 degrees of freedom, Q̂ the Cholesky
                         ′
factor of Λ̂ (namely Q̂Q̂ = Λ̂ with Q̂ lower triangular), and ξ a tuning scalar to be de-
scribed shortly. If q(A(α̃(ℓ+1) )) < q(A(α(ℓ) )), we set α(ℓ+1) = α(ℓ) with probability 1 −
exp q(A(α̃(ℓ+1) )) − q(A(α(ℓ) )) ; otherwise, we set α(ℓ+1) = α̃(ℓ+1) . The parameter ξ is chosen
so that about 30% of the newly generated α̃(ℓ+1) get retained. The algorithm can be started by
setting α(1) = α̂, and the values after the ﬁrst D burn-in draws {α(D+1) , α(D+2) , ..., α(D+N) }
represent a sample of size N drawn from the posterior distribution p(α|YT ); in our applica-
tions we have used D = N = 106 .
                                                                   (ℓ)
    For each of these N ﬁnal values for α(ℓ) we further generate δii ∼ Γ(κ∗i , τi∗ (A(α(ℓ) ))) for
i = 1, ..., n and take D(ℓ) to be a diagonal matrix whose row i, column i element is given by
    (ℓ)                                  (ℓ)                   (ℓ)
1/δii . From these we also generate bi ∼ N(m∗i (A(α(ℓ) )), dii M∗i ) for i = 1, ..., n and take
                                               (ℓ)′
B(ℓ) the matrix whose ith row is given by bi . The triple {A(α(ℓ) ), D(ℓ) , B(ℓ) }D+Nℓ=D+1 then
represents a sample of size N drawn from the posterior distribution p(A, D, B|Y T ).
   C. Data sources.
    The data sets used in the original studies by Kilian (2009) and Kilian and Murphy (2012)
are available from the public data archives of the Journal of the European Economic Associa-
tion ( http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1542-4774.2012.01080.x/suppinfo) and we


                                                  31
used these exact same data for the statistical analysis reported in Sections 3.1 and 3.2. We
also reconstructed these data sets from the original sources ourselves as part of the process of
assembling extended time series as described below.
    Monthly world oil production data measured in thousands of barrels of oil per day were
obtained from the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) Monthly Energy Review
for the period January 1973 to December 2014. Monthly data for global production of crude
oil for the period 1958:M1 to 1972:M12 were collected from the weekly Oil and Gas Journal
(issue of the ﬁrst week of each month) as in Baumeister and Peersman (2013b).
    The nominal spot oil price for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) was retrieved from the Fed-
eral Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database maintained by the St. Louis FED (OILPRICE).
Prior to 1982 this equals the posted price. This series was discontinued in July 2013. From
August 2013 onwards data are obtained from the EIA website (http://www.eia.gov/dnav/
pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&s=rwtc&f=m). To deﬂate the nominal spot oil price, we
use the U.S. consumer price index (CPIAUCSL: consumer price index for all urban consumers:
all items, index 1982-1984 = 100) which was taken from the FRED database.
    For the extended data set our measure for global economic activity is the industrial pro-
duction index for OECD countries and six major non-member economies (Brazil, China, In-
dia, Indonesia, the Russian Federation and South Africa) obtained from the OECD Main
Economic Indicators (MEI) database in 2011. The index covers the period 1958:M1 to
2011:M10 and was subsequently discontinued. To extend the data set after October 2011,
we applied the same methodology used by the OCED. Speciﬁcally, we use OECD indus-
trial production and industrial production for the individual non-member countries which
are available in the MEI database and apply the weights reported by the OECD to ag-
gregate those series into a single index. The source of the weights data is the Interna-
tional Monetary Fund’s World Economic Outlook (WEO) database. The weights are up-
dated on a yearly basis and a link to a document containing the weights can be found at
http://www.oecd.org/std/compositeleadingindicatorsclifrequentlyaskedquestionsfaqs.htm#11.
    Monthly U.S. crude oil stocks in millions of barrels (which include the Stragegic Petro-
leum Reserve) are available from EIA for the entire period 1958:M1-2016:M12. We obtain an
estimate for global stocks as in Kilian and Murphy (2012) by multiplying the U.S. crude oil
inventories by the ratio of OECD inventories of crude petroleum and petroleum products to
U.S. inventories of petroleum and petroleum products. Given that OECD petroleum inven-
tories only start in January 1988, we assume that the ratio before January 1988 is the same
as in January 1988. To calculate our proxy for ∆it , the change in OECD inventories as a
fraction of last period’s oil production, we convert the production data into millions of barrels
per month by multiplying the million barrels of crude oil produced per day by 30.

    E. Using downweighted observations from an earlier sample.
    Let Y (1) denote observations from the ﬁrst sample, Y(2) observations from the second and
λ the vector of parameters about which we wish to form an inference. If both samples are
regarded as equally informative about λ, the posterior would be calculated as

                                                    p(Y(2) |Y(1) , λ)p(Y (1) |λ)p(λ)
                          p(λ|Y (1) , Y(2) ) =                                         .                        (62)
                                                    p(Y (2) |Y(1) , λ)p(Y(1) |λ)p(λ)dλ

Deﬁne p(Y (1) ) =         p(Y (1) |λ)p(λ)dλ. Then the posterior density based on the ﬁrst sample




                                                           35
alone would be
                                                     p(Y (1) |λ)p(λ)
                                                       (1)
                                           p(λ|Y ) =                 .
                                                        p(Y (1) )
Dividing numerator and denominator of (62) by p(Y(1) ) we see that the full-sample posterior
could equivalently be obtained by using the posterior from the ﬁrst sample as the prior for
the second:
                                           p(Y (2) |Y(1) , λ)p(λ|Y (1) )
                      p(λ|Y(1) , Y (2) ) =                                 .
                                           p(Y (2) |Y(1) , λ)p(λ|Y (1) )dλ
   We propose instead to use as a prior for the second sample a distribution that downweights
the inﬂuence of the data from the ﬁrst sample,
                                                      !          "µ
                                          p(λ|Y(1) ) ∝ p(Y(1) |λ) p(λ)

for some 0 ≤ µ ≤ 1. In the present instance the likelihood for the ﬁrst sample is given by

                                                                         #n         $                            %
                  (1)           −T1 n/2                 T1      −T1 /2                   (a′i yt − b′i xt−1 )2
                                                                                        T1
              p(Y |λ) =(2π)               | det(A)| |D|                         exp −
                                                                            i=1      t=1         2dii

so the downweighted ﬁrst-sample likelihood is

                                                                       #n       $ T

Repeating the derivations in Baumeister and Hamilton (2015) for this downweighted likelihood
leads to the algorithm described in Section 5.1.4.
       F. The inﬂuence of prior information about the supply elasticity.
    Our baseline prior implies a 6% probability that the supply elasticity αqp is below 0.0258.15
This could be misinterpreted to suggest that our prior imposes a big value for the elasticity.
The reason this conclusion is wrong is that it is the variance of the prior (concentration of
mass over any ﬁxed interval), not the probability of exceeding some speciﬁed bound, that
determines the inﬂuence of the prior. The Bayesian posterior distribution is a weighted
average of the likelihood, with weights given by the prior density. If the prior density has
a very large variance, the weights are approximately uniform over the range for which the
likelihood has nonnegligible mass, and the posterior is essentially the same as the likelihood,
with the prior exerting no inﬂuence on the posterior.
    We illustrate this with a simple parametric example, in which the data mildly favor a value
  15
       Note for c = 0.1 and σ = 0.2 that

where Φ̃3 (x) denotes the probability that a standard Student t variable with ν = 3 degrees of freedom would
be less than some value x.


                                                                36
of α = 0.05. Our baseline prior results in a posterior that is virtually identical to that implied
by the data (panel 3 in Figure F-1). By contrast, the Kilian-Murphy (KM) prior (insisting
that α < 0.0258) hugely distorts the data (panel 4). This is because our prior has a big
variance and the KM prior has a tiny variance. The KM prior imposes a strong prior belief,
whereas ours does not.
    Details of the example that produced this ﬁgure are as follows. Suppose that the parameter
of interest α is the variance of a N (0, α) distribution; we use this as a simple example of a
parameter that has to be positive. Suppose we have observed a sample y1 , ..., yT of size
T = 10 and that the average squared value of yt in the observed sample is s2 = 0.05. Thus
the likelihood function is
                                              1            T s2
                                f (y|α) =           exp −                                     (63)
                                          (2πα)T /2         2α
and the MLE is α̂ = 0.05. The likelihood is plotted as a function of α as the solid black
curve in Figure F-1.16 Suppose ﬁrst that our prior takes the form of a Student t(c, σ, ν)
distribution truncated to be positive with c = 0.1 and ν = 3. The ﬁrst three panels of the
graph correspond to three diﬀerent truncated Student t priors plotted as dotted red curves,
the ﬁrst with a relatively small variance (σ = 0.02) the second with a somewhat bigger
variance (σ = 0.05), and the third with a still bigger variance. In fact, the third distribution
has exactly the same variance and exactly the same parameters as the prior in our baseline
parameterization (σ = 0.2). The posterior associated with each prior is plotted in dashed
blue.17 The prior with a small variance has signiﬁcant impact on the posterior inference
about α. The prior with a bigger variance has a much smaller impact, and the prior with
the variance as in our baseline speciﬁcation has zero inﬂuence on the posterior distribution in
this example. This is true even though the latter prior only assigns a 12% probability to a
value lower than 0.05. What matters for how much inﬂuence the prior has on the conclusion
depends on the variance and bounds of the prior distribution. Our prior has a relatively large
variance, and imposes no bounds, and in this example has essentially zero measurable impact
on the posterior distribution.
   By contrast, the implicit prior used by Kilian and Murphy is the uniform distribution over
  16
     For ease of visual comparison with the prior and posterior, we divide (63) by the sum of the values over
α between 0 and 1, so that the likelihood (like the prior and posterior that will also be plotted) integrates to
unity with respect to α.
  17
     If p(α) denotes the prior and f(y|α) the likelihood, this was evaluated at any point α by

                                                       p(α)f (y|a)
                                       p(α|y) =    N
                                                   x=1 p(x/N )f (y|x/N )

for N = 1000. Note this results in the numerically identical posterior p(α|y) for any value of the normalizing
constant k used in the previous footnote, since numerator and denominator both get multiplied by k.

(0, 0.0258) plotted as the dotted red line in the fourth panel. The variance of the KM prior is

                                  (0.0258)2
                                            = 0.000005547.
                                      12

In addition to having a tiny variance, this distribution dogmatically rules out any possibility
of α > 0.0258, and so by force imposes this condition on the posterior distribution. As a
result, the KM prior hugely distorts the posterior inference for this example, as seen in the
