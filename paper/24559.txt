                                         ABSTRACT

A growing number of surveys elicit respondents’ expectations for future events on a 0-100 scale
of percent chance. These data reveal substantial heaping at multiples of 10 and 5 percent,
suggesting that respondents round their reports. This paper studies the nature of rounding by
analyzing response patterns across expectations questions and waves of the Health and
Retirement Study. We discover a tendency by about half of the respondents to provide more
refined responses in the tails of the scale than the center. Only about five percent provide more
refined responses in the center than the tails. We find that rounding varies across question
domains, which range from personal health to personal finances to macroeconomic events. We
develop a two-stage framework to characterize person-specific rounding. The first stage uses
observed responses to infer respondents’ rounding practice in each question domain and scale
segment. The second stage replaces each original point response with an interval, representing the
range of possible values of the respondent’s true latent belief implied by the degree of rounding
inferred in the first stage. We study how the inferred rounding types in the first stage vary with
respondent characteristics, including age and cognitive abilities.

    1. Introduction

Judgements about the likelihood of future events are an important input for predictions and decisions by

citizens, policy makers, and researchers. From the early 1990s on, surveys designed by economists have

increasingly measured respondents’ subjective expectations for future events using a 0-100 scale of

percent chance. This endeavor was prompted by earlier empirical evidence and theoretical arguments

demonstrating the greater informativeness of elicited probabilities for binary events relative to “yes/no”

intention measures (Juster, 1966; Manski, 1990). Manski (2004, 2017), Attanasio (2009), Hurd (2009),

van der Klaauw (2012), Armantier et al. (2013), Delavande (2014), Schotter and Trevino (2014), and

Giustinelli and Manski (2018) review the literature from various perspectives.

    The Health and Retirement Study (HRS), whose data we analyze in this paper, has measured

probabilistic expectations biannually since its start in 1992; Juster and Suzmann (1995) describe the

initial design. Section P of the HRS core questionnaire has been devoted to expectations measurement,

each wave including about 25 to 35 questions spanning different domains of personal and

macroeconomic uncertainty. From 2002 on, expectations have been consistently elicited on a 0-100

percent-chance scale, with many questions repeated across waves.

    Questions eliciting expectations on a 0-100 percent-chance scale in principle enable respondents to

report beliefs to the nearest 1 percent, encouraging a common rounding convention with minimal data

coarsening. But how do respondents use the scale in practice? The accumulated evidence reveals that

respondents tend to round their responses. Responses that are not a multiple of 5 or 10 percent occur

infrequently. When observed, they tend to occur near the endpoints of the scale to convey very small or

large probabilities.

    Some authors have devoted special attention to responses of 0, 50, and 100 percent. Fischhoff and

Bruine de Bruin (1999) and Bruine de Bruin et al. (2002) hypothesize that some respondents use 50

percent to signal epistemic uncertainty. Lillard and Willis (2001) and Hudomiet and Willis (2013)

conjecture that respondents form full subjective distributions for the probability of an event and then



                                                      2
report whichever of the values (0, 50, 100) is closest to the mode of their distribution. We analyze

reports of (0, 50, 100) percent jointly with responses to the entire set of expectations questions asked.

Systemic rounding of responses was observed as early as Dominitz and Manski (1997), who wrote (p.

272): “Most respondents do not round their responses to the values (0, 50, 100), but rather to the nearest

multiple of five.”

   Rounding of expectations poses a series of challenges for statistical inference. First, rounding

generates greater data coarsening than intended by the measurement scale. Second, the extent of

rounding is not directly observable and may vary across respondents and/or questions. Third, the reasons

why respondents round are incompletely understood.

   Observed response patterns carry information about respondents’ rounding practices, but they do not

reveal why respondents round. Manski and Molinari (2010) hypothesize that respondents may round to

simplify communication and/or to convey partial knowledge. If respondents round to simplify

communication, rounding generates a form of measurement error. However, the structure of the errors

produced by rounding is different from that occurring in the classical errors-in-variables model.

   Manski and Molinari studied respondent-specific response patterns across all expectations questions

asked in the 2006 HRS. They found strong evidence of rounding, with the extent differing across

respondents. They proposed use of a person’s response pattern across questions to infer the person’s

rounding practice, the result being interpretation of reported numerical values as interval data.

   In this paper, we significantly expand study of respondent-specific rounding patterns by analyzing

responses across all expectations questions asked in the core HRS questionnaire between 2002 and

2014. This enables us to learn important new features of rounding practices.

   Section 2 presents the main findings of our data analysis, with Supplementary Appendices reporting

further details. We initially study each wave of the HRS separately and find that the respondent-specific

rounding patterns reported by Manski and Molinari (2010) are stable across waves. We then pool data




                                                       3
across waves. This yields rich respondent-specific data that enables us to probe more deeply than the

earlier study.

    We discover a tendency by about half of the respondents to provide more refined responses in the

tails of the 0-100 scale than the center. In contrast, only about five percent of the respondents give more

refined responses in the center than the tails. We find that respondents tend to report the values 25 and

75 more frequently than other values ending in 5. We also find that rounding practices vary somewhat

across question domains, which range in the HRS from personal health to personal finances to

macroeconomic events.

    Based on our examination of rounding practices in Section 2, Section 3 develops a framework that

interprets each numerical response given by a respondent as an interval. We propose a two-stage

algorithm. The first stage classifies each respondent into one of a set of mutually exclusive and

exhaustive rounding types and places an upper bound on the amount of rounding each respondent is

inferred to apply when reporting their expectations. The second stage assigns an interval to each of the

respondent’s original point responses, which represents the range of values in which the respondent’s

underlying true belief is plausibly deemed to lie based on the respondent’s inferred rounding type. These

intervals can be interpreted as a measure of informativeness, or quality, of an increasingly used type of

data (numerical probabilistic expectations) from an important data source (the HRS).

    Our approach accommodates substantial heterogeneity in rounding practices. Within a specific

question domain, a respondent’s rounding type is a bivariate vector of the form (tail, center) rounding,

partitioning the 0-100 scale into two symmetric tails (0-24 and 76-100) and a center (25-75). Thus, in

addition to being person specific, the inferred degree of rounding may differ between the tails and the

center of the scale and may vary across question domains. The assigned intervals vary across

respondents and across values of the observed point responses.

    We use our framework to study how rounding tendencies vary with observable characteristics of the

respondents. We find that higher levels of educational attainment and of cognition are associated with a



                                                      4
tendency to give more refined responses (less rounding) across all scale segments and question domains.

On the other hand, the association of rounding with age appears to be non-linear, with youngest (50-59)

and oldest (80+) respondents displaying a higher tendency to round than respondents in the intermediate

age groups (60-69 and 70-79).

    These findings are substantively interesting, demonstrating systematic variation in how respondents

answer expectations questions. They may also help to inform researchers working with other surveys

that have less rich expectations data than the HRS. These researchers may know respondents’

characteristics, but not have enough expectations data to apply our approach directly.

    While this paper studies rounding as a subject of intrinsic interest, a reader may naturally ask how

the interval data that our proposed approach generates from respondent point responses may be used in

statistical analyses. In principle, empirical analysis with interval data is simply a matter of considering

all points in the relevant interval to be feasible values of the quantity of interest. The practical feasibility

of implementing this simple idea depends on the nature of the analysis. This matter has been addressed

in the econometric literature studying conditional prediction with interval measurement of outcomes

and/or covariates. See Manski and Tamer (2002) and Beresteanu and Molinari (2008). Manski and

Molinari (2010) provide an illustrative application of best linear prediction with interval-measured

expectations outcomes. Analogous applications to prediction with interval-measured covariates are

feasible.

    As far as we are aware, only two previous papers systematically study rounding of responses to

probabilistic expectations questions. One is Manski and Molinari (2010), on whose work we build. The

other is Kleinjans and van Soest (2014), who develop and estimate a panel-data structural econometric

model to analyze response patterns to each of six expectations questions in the HRS. Their analysis aims

to investigate the extent to which probability reports are determined by genuine underlying probabilistic

beliefs, rounding, a tendency to give so-called “focal” responses of (0, 50, 100), and selective item non-

response. Despite the very different approaches taken, their findings and ours reinforce each other in



                                                         5
some important respects. Specifically, they find that tendencies to round, give “focal” responses, and not

respond tend to be persistent over time.

   Beyond readers who have interest in expectations data, we anticipate that general statisticians

concerned with survey research will find this paper useful. Our study of tendencies to round responses to

expectations questions should heighten concern that respondents may round responses to numerical

questions in other contexts. Consider, for example, questions asking respondents to state their income or

the number of hours they worked in the past week. Respondents may round their responses, with the

extent of rounding differing across persons. Examination of a person’s response pattern across different

numerical questions, in the manner that we do here, may provide a credible way to infer that person’s

rounding practice. One may then interpret reported numerical values as intervals.

   Some surveys elicit interval data directly. For example, the HRS uses unfolding bracket questions to

enable respondents who are not willing to provide exact information about their income and assets to

indicate whether the quantities of interest lie above or below a sequence of specified thresholds.

Similarly, the Occupation Employment Statistics (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2018) collects wage

information in interval form. These intervals, too, can be analyzed using econometric methods for

interval data referenced earlier.

   Our interpretation of rounded responses as interval data provides an interesting counterpoint to

previous statistical research on data coarsening. Rounded numerical responses have a different structure

from the data analyzed in the literature on data coarsening (e.g., Heitjan and Rubin (1991), Heitjan

(1994), and Gill et al. (1997)). In that literature, it is assumed that the researcher observes a random set

X (an interval, a group, a partial categorization, etc.) to which an unobservable random variable of

interest x belongs with probability one. An assumption of “coarsening at random” is imposed, which

requires that the probability of observing X = A given x = x0 is constant for all x0 in A, where A denotes

a subset of the support of x. In contrast, the HRS does not provide set-valued expectations data. The

algorithm that we propose constructs sets X based on respondents’ point responses and their tendencies


                                                       6
for rounding across the entire set of questions eliciting subjective beliefs. Our approach does not assume

ignorability of the coarsening mechanism and it allows for a coarsening mechanism that differs among

respondents.



   2. Exploratory Analysis of Response Patterns across Questions and Waves in the HRS

Since 2002 the HRS has devoted Section P of its core questionnaire to measurement of expectations in

the domains of personal health, personal finances, and general economic conditions. Across seven

biannual waves spanning 2002 to 2014, expectations have been elicited on a 0-100 percent chance scale.

Many questions have been repeated across multiple waves. Table 1 shows the questions, organized by

domain and the waves in which they were asked.

   Expectations questions in the HRS refer to future realizations of binary events. In some cases,

respondents are asked to report the chance that the realization of a continuous variable will be above or

below each of a sequence of thresholds. Answers to these questions can be used to measure a

respondent’s subjective distribution function for the variable in question. See Dominitz and Manski

(1997) for an early example of elicitation and validation in this format.

   The number of questions per wave ranges between a minimum of 22 in 2002 and a maximum of 38

in 2006. Most questions are in the personal finances domain (between 11 and 23 per wave, 31 overall),

followed by the personal health domain (between 3 and 9 per wave, 10 overall), and the domain of

general economic conditions (between 2 and 7 per wave, 12 overall). A subset of 12 questions across the

three domains were asked in all waves.

   The number of responses varies across questions and waves, ranging from about 5,000 to 30,000

responses per question in each wave. The variation across questions stems from the fact that the HRS

makes extensive use of skip sequencing. Thus, whether a respondent is asked a specific question

depends on the previous answers given by the respondent and on whether the event specified by the

question is relevant to the respondent.

   The total number of responses generated by a question across the seven waves varies because

questions have been added and removed over time. It also varies due to changes in sample composition

across waves. The HRS sample has periodically been augmented with new cohorts of respondents who

joined the study in specific waves. Respondents exit the study due to attrition or death.

   Section 2.1 studies response patterns across questions in each wave, alternatively using all questions

asked in the wave and the twelve questions asked in all waves. Focusing on the latter questions, we

analyze the stability of response tendencies across pairs of waves. Supplementary Appendix 2.1

provides further detail, investigating patterns of response to specific questions.

   Having established the temporal stability of rounding practices, Section 2.2 pools the HRS data

across waves. This yields rich respondent-specific data that enables us to probe more deeply. We

analyze response patterns separately by question domain. We pay particular attention to the location of

responses inside the 0-100 scale and learn important features of respondents’ response patterns in

specific domains.

   Throughout the paper, the notation 𝕄𝕄10 and 𝕄𝕄5 denotes responses that are multiples of 10 or 5

other than (0, 50, 100). Thus, 𝕄𝕄10 ≡ {10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 70, 80, 90} and 𝕄𝕄5 ≡ {5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55,

65, 75, 85, 95}). When responses are non-rounded values – neither (0, 50, 100) nor a multiple of 5 or 10

– we distinguish those in the outer tails of the scale, specifically 1-4 and 96-99, from those between 6

and 94. The abbreviation NR denotes nonresponse.



   2.1. Temporal Stability of Response Tendencies

   2.1.1. Response Tendencies in Each Wave

We first examine response tendencies in each HRS wave. Table 2 shows the fractions of respondents

displaying each of seven mutually exclusive and exhaustive response patterns, progressing left to right

from the most rounded to the least rounded. Column 3 gives the fraction of respondents who respond to

no questions in the wave, coded in the HRS as “Don’t know” or “Refuse.” Column 4 gives the fraction


                                                        9
of respondents who, when they respond, only use the values 0 and 100 in the corresponding wave.

Column 5 gives the fraction who only use the values (0, 50, 100). Columns 6 and 7 give the fractions of

respondents who answer at least one question with a value in 𝕄𝕄10 and 𝕄𝕄5 respectively. Column 8 gives

the fraction of respondents who respond to at least one question with a non-round value in the outer

tails; that is, 1-4 or 96-99. Column 9, labelled “Some other,” gives the fraction who respond at least once

with a non-round value in the range 6-94.

   The set of expectations questions varies across waves. The top panel of Table 2 presents a version of

the statistics where respondents are classified into one of the seven response patterns using only the

twelve questions that were asked in all seven waves (i.e., P5, P6, P7, P16, P17, P18, P20, P28, P29, P32,

P47, P59). The bottom panel uses the responses to all questions asked in a wave.

   A very small fraction of respondents answer none of the questions posed to them. This fraction

ranges between 0.009 and 0.027, depending on the set of questions used to classify respondents.

Between 0.019 and 0.101 of respondents uses only the values (0, 100). Similar fractions of respondents

use only the values (0, 50, 100). Most respondents give at least one answer in 𝕄𝕄10 or in 𝕄𝕄5. The

fraction of 𝕄𝕄10 respondents ranges between 0.263 and 0.337 across waves when all questions asked in a

wave are used for classification and between 0.392 and 0.458 when only the questions common to all

waves are used. Similarly, the fraction of 𝕄𝕄5 respondents ranges between 0.427 and 0.513 when all

questions are used for classification and between 0.295 and 0.353 when only the common set is used.

   The fractions of respondents who give at least one response in the outer tails (1-4 or 96-99) or non-

rounded values in 6-94 are sizeable but considerably smaller, especially the latter. The former fraction

ranges between 0.101 and 0.144 when all questions are used for classification and between 0.054 and

0.092 when only the common set is used. The latter fraction ranges between 0.022 and 0.042 or between

0.011 and 0.020, depending on the set of questions used.

NOTE: N = sample size, NR = nonresponse, 𝕄𝕄10 = multiple of 10 but not (0, 50, 100), 𝕄𝕄5 = multiple of 5 but

increase in value; P28: live to be 75 or more; P29: live to be X or more; P5: live inheritance ≥ $10,000; P6: live
inheritance ≥ $100,000; P59: live inheritance ≥ $500,000; P7: leave any inheritance; P16: work for pay in the

P20: finding a job in few months if unemployed.


the 2006 wave of the HRS hold throughout the seven waves between 2002 and 2014. However, these are

aggregate patterns that may partly be susceptible to variation across wave in sample composition. To

address this issue, we compute transition matrices of response tendencies across waves. Specifically, for

each pair of waves indicated by column, Table 3 reports the fractions of respondents classified as

belonging to any rounding category in the first wave who transitioned to the same rounding category in

the second wave (1st row), who transitioned to a finer or coarser adjacent category (2nd row), and who

transitioned to a more distant rounding category (3th row). The reported calculations use the twelve

questions in common to the seven waves to classify respondents.

    We find that between 0.406 and 0.436 of the respondents remain in the same rounding category

across any pair of adjacent waves. Between 0.373 and 0.386 transition to an adjacent category. Thus,

between 0.788 and 0.813 of the respondents transition to the same or an adjacent category. Even

transitions between the first and last waves, with fourteen years separating them, display high

 persistence, with over 0.78 of the respondents transitioning to the same or an adjacent category.

     The amount of temporal stability observed in Table 3 is remarkable. This is particularly true given

 the criteria used to classify respondents to this point. For example, consider a respondent whose most

 refined answer in 2002 is a multiple of 10 percent other than (0, 50, 100) and who is thus classified as

 “Some M10.” If, in 2004, the same respondent were observed to give a single answer that is a multiple

 of 5 percent but not of 10 percent, he would be now classified as “Some M5.”



     2.2. Pooling Data across Waves to Probe More Deeply into Response Tendencies


     With temporal stability established, we henceforth pool the HRS data across waves. This greatly

 increases the number of expectations responses observed per respondent, multiplying it sevenfold for

 respondents interviewed in all waves between 2002 and 2014. Across all questions and waves, the

 average number of responses per respondent is 106.8. By domain, this figure ranges from 19.1 for

 personal health to 66 for personal finances. With such rich respondent-specific data, we can probe more

 deeply into rounding practices than Manski and Molinari (2010) were able to with the 2006 wave alone.




                                                          12
   To obtain further insight, we scrutinized the rounding behavior of 100 respondents drawn at random.

We found two highly interesting patterns. First, a substantial fraction of respondents round more

coarsely in the center of the 0-100 scale than in the tails. Second, respondents tend to use the percent-

chance values 25 and 75 more than they do other values ending in 5. Supplementary Appendix 2.2

describes the analysis underlying these findings.

       Our study of 100 randomly drawn respondents does not reveal how prevalent the discovered

features are across the whole sample of HRS respondents. To answer this question, we now refine our

earlier categorization of rounding patterns. We define the center (C) of the percent-chance scale to be

values in the range 26-74 and the tails (T) to be values in the ranges 0-24 and 76-100. The values 25 and

75 form the boundary between the tail and center. We group responses into nine categories, defined by

their presence in T or C and by the degree to which they are multiples of smaller numbers. The

categories are: 𝕄𝕄1-T ≡ values in 1-24 or 76-99 that are not multiples of 5; 𝕄𝕄1-C ≡ values in 26-74 that

are not multiples of 5; 𝕄𝕄5-T ≡ {5, 15, 85, 95}; 𝕄𝕄5-C ≡ {35, 45, 55, 65}; 𝕄𝕄10-T ≡ {10, 20, 80, 90};

𝕄𝕄10-C ≡ {30, 40, 60, 70}; 𝕄𝕄25 ≡ {25, 75}; 𝕄𝕄100 ≡ {0, 100}; 𝕄𝕄50 ≡ {50}.

   With this categorization, Table 4 shows the distribution of responses across respondents for each

question asked in Section P between 2002 and 2014. The two main features detected by inspecting the

random sample are decisively confirmed in the general HRS sample. Comparison of the frequencies of

𝕄𝕄25 responses (in column 5) with the frequencies of the remaining 𝕄𝕄5 responses (𝕄𝕄5-C in column 9

and 𝕄𝕄5-T in column 8) reveals that the fraction of {25, 75} responses is always higher than the fraction

of responses ending in 5 in the center of the scale; that is, responses in {35, 45, 55, 65}. For most

questions across the three domains, the fraction of {25, 75} responses is higher than the fraction of

responses ending in 5 in the tails of the scale; that is, responses in {5, 15, 85, 95}.

   Even more striking is comparison of the frequencies of responses in the tails of the scale versus

those in the center. The fractions of 𝕄𝕄10, 𝕄𝕄5, and 𝕄𝕄1 responses in the tails are higher than the

corresponding fractions of 𝕄𝕄10, 𝕄𝕄5, and 𝕄𝕄1 responses in the center for nearly all questions in Table 4.


                                                        13
 The only exceptions are questions P47 and P190, for which the fractions of 𝕄𝕄10-C responses are

 slightly higher than the fractions of 𝕄𝕄10-T responses.



     3. Transforming Expectations Responses into Interval Data

 The analysis of Section 2 reveals that HRS respondents differ systematically in their rounding practices,

 with a relatively small fraction habitually performing gross rounding and the majority sometimes giving

 more refined responses. We have established that the response tendencies are stable across waves.

 Furthermore, we have detected two patterns of responses that the earlier analysis by Manski and

 Molinari (2010) could not detect using only the 2006 data. One pattern is a relatively frequent use of 25

 and 75 percent. The other is systematic use of more refined responses in the tails of the scale than in its

 center.

      Generalizing the inferential approach proposed by Manski and Molinari (2010), this section

 develops a new algorithm that uses the response tendency of a respondent to characterize rounding of

 responses to particular questions. The algorithm classifies each respondent into one of a set of mutually

 exclusive and exhaustive rounding types and transforms each original point response into an interval

 where the true latent belief is deemed to lie. With this accomplished, statistical analyses of expectations

 may proceed using the intervals thus constructed in place of the observed point responses.

      Our algorithm relies on considerably weaker and more credible assumptions than inference that uses

 expectations reports at face value. Nevertheless, we cannot be certain that the intervals we construct are



                                                                      15
accurate. The algorithm is subject to two potential forms of misclassification. First, a given survey

response may be less rounded than the interval assigned by the algorithm; that is, the actual rounding

interval may be a subset of the algorithm’s interval. Then our use of the data is correct, but it yields

inference that is less sharp than it would be if the true degree of rounding were known. Second, the

actual rounding interval may not be completely contained in the algorithm’s interval. Then the actual

belief may lie outside our interval, making our use of the data incorrect. Still, use of the algorithm

substantially lowers the risk of the latter type of error relative to the standard approach that takes survey

responses at face value.

   The new algorithm embodies the data patterns documented in Section 2. Section 3.1 describes the

determination of a respondent’s rounding type. Section 3.2 presents the empirical distribution of the

respondents’ inferred rounding types and studies how rounding tendencies vary with observed

characteristics of the respondents. Section 3.3 explains how a respondent’s point response to a specific

question and the respondent’s inferred rounding type are used to construct the interval associated with

the observed point response.



   3.1. Determination of Respondent Rounding Types

Based on the evidence in Section 2, we allow a respondent’s rounding type to vary across question

domains and between the tails and center of the measurement scale. Thus, within a specific domain of

questions, a respondent’s rounding type is a bivariate vector of the form (tail, center) rounding,

partitioning the 0-100 scale into two symmetric tails (0-24 and 76-100) and a center (25-75). We believe

that our specific choice of tails and center reasonably reflects the empirical patterns of HRS responses,

but judgments need not be uniform. The algorithm can be easily adapted to different definitions of tails

and center or extended to accommodate finer partitions of the 0-100 scale (e.g., outer tails, inner tails,

center).




                                                       16
    The new algorithm refines the earlier one posed by Manski and Molinari (2010) in multiple ways.

One refinement is to separate tail from center rounding. Another is to classify persons who only use the

response values (0, 25, 50, 75, 100) as rounding to the nearest 25 percent rather than to the nearest 5

percent. A further difference between the two algorithms is that here we use a tighter criterion for

assignment of a person to a more refined rounding type.

    To explain the tighter criterion, consider categorization of a respondent as one who rounds to the

nearest 10 percent (or to a more refined degree). Manski and Molinari assigned a respondent to this

rounding type if all responses are multiples of 10 and at least one response is not a value in (0, 50, 100).

We use here a tighter criterion that requires observation of at least two responses that are multiples of 10

other than (0, 50, 100), of which one must be in the domain under consideration and the other may be in

a different domain and may also be a less rounded response; that is, a value that is not a multiple of 10.

    Adding the new requirement reflects our desire for further credibility when assigning a person to a

more refined rounding type. We want enhanced credibility because misclassification into an overly

refined rounding category yields an inferential error, as the person’s latent beliefs may not entirely lie

within the overly refined interval. Misclassification of a person into a rounding category less refined

than their actual one does not yield an inferential error, as the less refined interval includes the actual

one as a subset.

    The main criteria for classification of respondents are as follows:

•   Center rounding type Define 𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛 in {1, 5, 10, 50}, with n = 1, . . . , 4. Respondent j is classified as

    rounding to the nearest 𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛 percent in the center within question domain l if one of the following two

    conditions holds: (i) they are observed to give at least two answers in the center that are multiples of

    𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛 percent but not of 𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛′ for any n’ < n within domain l; or (ii) they are observed to give one answer

    in the center that is a multiple of 𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛 percent (but not of 𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛′ for any n’ < n) within domain l AND at

    least one answer in the center that is a multiple of 𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛′ for any n’ ≤ n within a second domain l’

    distinct from l.


                                                       17
•   Tail rounding type Respondent j is classified as rounding to the nearest 𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛 percent in the tails

    within question domain l if one of the following two conditions holds: (i) they are observed to give

    at least two answers in the tails that are multiples of 𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛 percent but not of 𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛′ for any n’ < n within

    domain l; or (ii) they are observed to give one answer in the tails that is a multiple of 𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛 percent (but

    not of 𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛′ for any n’ < n) within domain l AND at least one answer in the tails OR center that is a

    multiple of 𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛′ for any n’ ≤ n within a second domain l’ distinct from l.



    To illustrate, consider a respondent who has answered four expectations questions in the domain of

personal finances, either within the same wave or over multiple waves. Two of the observed responses

belong to the tails, {5, 85}, and two to the center, {30, 60}. As the set of responses includes two

multiples of 5 percent in the tails and two multiples of 10 percent in the center, our algorithm classifies

this respondent as one rounding to the nearest 5 percent, or to a finer degree, in the tails (𝓜𝓜5-T) and to

the nearest 10 percent, or to a finer degree, in the center (𝓜𝓜10-C).

    In this example, our algorithm reaches conclusions that differ in important ways from those of the

Manski and Molinari (2010) algorithm. Application of that algorithm would classify this respondent as

rounding to the nearest 5 percent, or to a finer degree, everywhere within the personal finances domain.

Equivalently, given that the Manski-Molinari algorithm does not allow for differential rounding between

tails and center, it would classify the hypothesized respondent as (𝓜𝓜5-T, 𝓜𝓜5-C). Using our algorithm,

the evidence generated by the respondent’s response pattern across questions classifies the respondent as

(𝓜𝓜5-T, 𝓜𝓜10-C), with a less refined rounding type in the center. This difference reflects our new

finding that respondents tend to round more coarsely in the center than in the tails, which could not have

been reached using a single wave of the HRS data.

    The Supplementary Appendix 3.1 provides additional and more complex examples. It also presents

the complete algorithm in a formal and compact way.

   3.2. Empirical Distribution of Rounding Types and Association with Observable

Characteristics

We apply the algorithm to all HRS respondents who responded to at least one expectations question in

any question domain and in any wave between 2002 and 2014. Table 5 reports the empirical distribution

of rounding types for each domain of questions. Depending on the domain, between 40.40% and 61.03%

of respondents are inferred to apply finer rounding in the tails than in the center. Between 28.49% and

38.73% of respondents apply the same degree of rounding in the tails and in the center. Between 2.90%

and 6.71% of respondents apply coarser rounding in the tails than in the center.

   The rounding type of a small minority of respondents could not be determined either in the tails or in

the center or both. Most undetermined cases occur when, for a given respondent, we do not observe any

answer in the relevant domain and scale segment. Among respondents for whom we observe at least one

answer in the relevant domain and scale segment, all cases of undetermined tail rounding type disappear

and only a few cases of undetermined center rounding type remain. The latter are respondents for whom

we only observe one answer in the center in the relevant domain and no answers in the center in the

remaining two domains.

   We now investigate how rounding types vary with observable respondent characteristics. This

exercise sheds some light on the heterogeneity of respondents’ tendencies to round. In addition, it may

inform researchers who analyze survey expectations in datasets other than the HRS. These researchers

may know respondents’ characteristics in their data sets, but not have enough expectations data to apply

our proposed approach directly.

   In principle, nonparametric regression of rounding type on respondent characteristics would give the

most complete information on observable heterogeneity in tendencies to round. However, we distinguish

twenty rounding types (4 tail categories times 5 center categories) and observe multiple respondent

characteristics. This makes nonparametric regression too cumbersome to be appealing. A pragmatic

approach is to summarize the data using parametric bivariate ordered probit regression, which embodies

the basic ordinal property that our rounding categories display across different degrees of rounding.

   Table 6 presents estimated coefficients of three bivariate ordered probit regressions, one per question

domain. The outcome variables are the respondent’s bivariate vectors of tail and center rounding

categories in each domain. As predictors, we use binary variables for respondent’s gender (male, with



                                                     20
female omitted), educational attainment (high school, some college, bachelor, and graduate, with less

than high school omitted), and race (black and other, with white omitted).

     We also include information on individual’s age and cognitive functioning. While these variables are

time-varying for each respondent, our analysis in Section 2.1.2 and 2.2 supports treating respondent

rounding behavior as fixed over time. We therefore account for age variation across respondents by

incorporating in our bivariate ordered probit regressions an indicator of whether each respondent’s

cross-wave average age lies in the categories 60-69, 70-79, and 80+ years, with 50-59 the omitted

category. We account for variation in cognitive functioning across respondents by including each

respondent’s cross-wave average cognitive score. See Fisher et al. (2012) and Crimmins et al. (2011) for

a description and an empirical assessment of the HRS cognitive measures.

     The cognitive score has a range of 0-35. In our data, the respondent-specific cross-wave average

cognitive score has a mean of 23 and a standard deviation of 4.11 across respondents. The respondent-

specific cross-wave standard deviation in cognitive score has a mean of 2.9 across respondents. The fact

that the standard deviation of the cross-wave average score is larger than the average cross-wave

standard deviation in the score lessens our concerns for using a time-fixed measure of cognitive

functioning in our bivariate ordered probit regressions. Nonetheless, the time variation in cognitive score

and its association with rounding warrant study in future research.

     The model permits the error terms of the latent variables underlying the inferred tail and center

rounding categories to be correlated with each other. The correlation parameter, 𝜌𝜌, is estimated along

with the other coefficients. The rounding categories are ordered from least coarse to most coarse. Thus,

positive associations indicate a tendency to round more coarsely.

     Formally, within each domain, the bivariate ordered probit model specifies two seemingly unrelated

latent equations for the respondent’s tendency to round, one for the tail and one for the center, where

𝑦𝑦 ∗,𝐶𝐶 = 𝑋𝑋𝛽𝛽𝐶𝐶 + 𝜀𝜀 𝐶𝐶 𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 𝑦𝑦 ∗,𝑇𝑇 = 𝑋𝑋𝛽𝛽𝑇𝑇 + 𝜀𝜀 𝑇𝑇 .   The pair (𝜀𝜀 𝐶𝐶 , 𝜀𝜀 𝑇𝑇 ) is assumed to have the standardized

bivariate normal distribution with means zero, both variances equal to one, and correlation 𝜌𝜌.

    For each 𝑘𝑘 = 𝐶𝐶, 𝑇𝑇, the model assumes that respondent rounds to multiples of 1 if 𝑦𝑦 ∗,𝑘𝑘 < 𝛿𝛿1𝑘𝑘 , to

multiples of 5 if 𝛿𝛿1𝑘𝑘 ≤ 𝑦𝑦 ∗,𝑘𝑘 < 𝛿𝛿2𝑘𝑘 , and so on, for a total of four categories in the tails (𝕄𝕄1-T, 𝕄𝕄5-T, 𝕄𝕄10-

obtain the likelihood function for the rounding types. For 𝑙𝑙= 1, . . ., 5 and 𝑚𝑚 = 1, . . . , 4, the probability

    We estimate the parameters by maximum likelihood using the Stata package described in Sajaia

(2008). The bivariate probit model and other multivariate discrete outcome models are discussed, for

example, in Amemiya (1981). Estimated coefficients with standard errors are reported in Table 6. Table

7 reports predicted probabilities of selected tail and center rounding types for persons with specified

covariate values.

    We find that higher levels of educational attainment and of person-specific average (cross-wave)

cognitive score are associated with a tendency to give more refined responses across all scale segments

and question domains. The patterns for the other predictors are more varied.

    For example, respondents in the oldest age category (80+) tend to give more rounded responses than

respondents belonging to the youngest one (50-59) across all scale segments and questions domains. On

the other hand, respondents in the two intermediate age groups (i.e., 60-69 and 70-79) belong to

rounding categories that may be more refined, coarser, or statistically indistinguishable from those

characterizing younger respondents, depending on the specific domain or scale segment.

    A potential interpretation of the observed age patterns is that individuals belonging to the

intermediate age groups may have more direct experience and hence better knowledge of the topics

covered by the questions than younger respondents, generating more refined responses among the

middle groups. On the other hand, individuals of older age might already, on average, have lower



                                                                  23
cognitive functioning, leading to coarser responses. This pattern, however, continues to hold after

conditioning on the respondent’s average (across waves) cognitive score. Parameter estimates for a

specification without cognitive score are shown in the Supplementary Appendix.

   Male respondents tend to round more coarsely than female respondents in the personal health and

personal finances domains, but only in the tails. On the other hand, male respondents tend to round less

coarsely than women respondents in the center in the domain of general economic conditions. While

respondents belonging to the residual race category (including Hispanic, Asian, and Pacific Islander)

tend to round more coarsely than white respondents, the differential rounding tendencies of black

respondents relative to white respondents vary across question domains and scale segments.

   The large, positive, and statistically significant estimates of the correlation parameter 𝜌𝜌 reveal that

rounding tendencies are positively correlated across scale segments. Hence, respondents who give

coarser responses in the tails are more likely to do so in the center.



   3.3. Using Survey Responses and Rounding Types to Form Expectations Intervals

As we have shown, rounding varies substantially across respondents and the tendency to round is

systematically associated with respondents’ observable characteristics. Yet, it is natural to wonder the

extent to which failing to account for rounding might lead to inaccurate conclusions when analyzing

data. A simple numerical illustration pertaining to the analysis of the effect of longevity expectations on

hours worked shows that ignoring rounding may yield highly inaccurate conclusions.

   Suppose that two respondents both round their response to the longevity expectation question to the

closest multiple of 25. Suppose that one respondent views their probability to live past age 75 to be forty

percent while the other respondent views it to be sixty percent, with the latter working significantly

more hours as a consequence. With rounding, both respondents report their probability to live past age

75 as fifty percent. The notable difference in hours-worked outcomes with apparently the same




                                                       24
expectations may be misinterpreted as caused by unobserved heterogeneity in labor-leisure preferences,

when the actual cause is different longevity expectations.

    Next, consider a scenario where the first respondent views their probability to live past age 75 to be

thirty-seven percent while the other respondent views it to be thirty-eight percent, with the latter

working slightly more hours. With rounding, the first respondent reports a probability to live past age 75

of twenty-five percent, and the second respondent reports fifty percent. The slight difference in

outcomes with an apparent large difference in expectations may be misinterpreted as evidence of

minimal effect of expectations on labor supply.

    These examples, while stylized, illustrate that ignoring rounding might lead to “boundary mistakes;”

that is, to significantly underestimating or overestimating an effect of interest. We therefore propose an

algorithm that uses the information contained in each respondent’s reporting behavior across the survey,

as analyzed in the preceding sections, to transform observed percent-chance point reports into intervals.

    Here we present the construction of interval data within the context of the illustration introduced in

Section 3.1. The Supplementary Appendix 3.3 discusses more complex cases, presents the complete



                                                          26
algorithm formally, and reports the distributions of interval width for the responses given to specific

questions.

   In the example introduced in Section 3.1, the respondent is observed to answer with {5, 30, 60, 85}

to four expectations questions concerning personal finances and is classified to be of rounding type

(𝓜𝓜5-T, 𝓜𝓜10-C) in that domain. Because the respondent is classified to round to the nearest 5 percent

in the tails, the algorithm assigns to each of the respondent’s point responses in the tails an interval of

width 5 centered around the point response. Specifically, the algorithm assigns the interval [2.5, 7.5] to

response 5 (i.e., 5 ∓ 2.5) and the interval [82.5, 87.5] to response 85 (i.e., 85 ∓ 2.5). Similarly, as the

respondent is classified to round to the nearest 10 percent in the center, the algorithm assigns interval

[25, 35] to the 30 percent response (i.e., 30 ∓ 5) and the interval [55, 65] to the 60 percent response (i.e.,

60 ∓ 5).

   In general, construction of intervals around point responses near the thresholds which separate the

center from the tails---that is, near 25 and 75 percent---requires specific “boundary conditions.” Such

conditions are not binding in this example. We explain them in the Appendix.

   By construction, each interval contains the point response because the former is centered around the

latter. Moreover, the interval is assumed to cover the unobserved true latent belief with certainty.

However, no assumption is made about the location of the true latent belief inside the interval.

   Our algorithm relies on considerably weaker and hence more credible assumptions than inference

using expectations reports at face value. At the opposite extreme, one could be ultraconservative,

maintaining that each point response is consistent with any amount of rounding. One would then replace

all reported expectations with a [0, 100] interval. Obviously, doing this empties the data of any

information content.

   Our choice of assumptions used to identify respondents’ rounding types and bound their unobserved

true beliefs strikes a balance between those two extremes and is informed by the respondents’ response

patterns across HRS questions and waves, which we have documented in this paper. A researcher


                                                       27
entertaining a different set of assumptions about how survey respondents round their expectations

reports could easily apply our framework by simply replacing our assumptions with theirs. In general,

stronger and/or more numerous assumptions will yield (weakly) narrower intervals.



    4. Conclusion

We have studied the nature of rounding in numerical reports of probabilistic expectations, a type of

survey measure that has become widely used in empirical economic analysis of individual and

household decisions under uncertainty. Our analysis of the responses to all expectations questions asked

in the HRS core questionnaire between 2002 and 2014 confirms earlier findings based on analysis of the

2006 waves of data and establishes important new findings. We propose an inferential approach that

interprets expectations reports as interval data and that explicitly incorporates the documented patterns

of responses across waves, question domains, and location within the measurement scale.

    The main tenet of the analysis is that observed response patterns across questions and waves carry

information about individual respondents’ rounding practices. Observed response patterns, however, do

not reveal whether individual respondents round their reports to simplify communication or to convey

partial knowledge. Consistent with the first interpretation, we have assumed that respondents have well-

formed latent point beliefs. If instead the relevant latent objects were sets or ranges of beliefs, the

algorithm would still work as intended as long as the algorithm’s interval completely includes the latent

interval.

    If respondents round to convey partial knowledge about the likelihood of future events of the kind

HRS expectations questions refer to, it would be better to allow them to express their ambiguity directly.

This could be achieved by allowing respondents to give either a single percent-chance value or a range

as they see fit. Then range measures of subjective expectations may be analyzed using existing

econometric tools for interval data. See Manski and Molinari (2010) and Giustinelli and Pavoni (2017)

for exploratory data collection and analysis of this type.

SA2 Exploratory Analysis of Response Patterns Across Questions and Waves in the HRS

Since 2002 the HRS has devoted an entire section of its core questionnaire to measurement of

respondents’ expectations in the domains of personal health, personal finances, and general economic

conditions. Figure 1 in the main text shows the list of expectations questions asked in Section P of the

HRS core questionnaire between 2002 and 2014 organized by domain.

   As documented in Table S1, the number of responses varies across expectations questions. This

occurs for several reasons. First, questions have been added and removed over time.

   Second, the HRS makes extensive use of skip sequencing. In particular, whether a specific question

is asked or not to a certain respondent may depend on the previous answers given by the respondent and

on whether the event specified by the question is relevant to the respondent. For example, respondents

who are older than 62 are not asked their subjective probability of working full-time past 62. Similarly,

respondents who are older than 75 are not asked their subjective probability of living past 75, and so on.

Moreover, respondents who respond ‘Don’t know’ (DK) or ‘Refuse’ (RF) to three consecutive

expectations questions are skipped to the next section.

   Third, sample composition may change over time. In particular, the HRS sample has been

augmented with new cohorts of respondents who joined the study in specific waves. On the other hand,

respondents may exit the study due to attrition or death.

NOTE: N of total observations includes all answers by any respondent in any wave to the corresponding question,
including don’t know/refuse. The set of questions each respondent is asked and observed to answer may vary
across waves as a function of aspects of survey design such as the decision of designers to introduce new
questions or to eliminate existing ones, the respondent’s time-varying characteristics used for skip logic, etc.
Additionally, new cohorts of respondents have been added over time, while a portion of respondents from the
initial cohorts have left the study due to death or other reasons.

NOTE: N of total observations includes all answers by any respondent in any wave to the corresponding question,
including don’t know/refuse. The set of questions each respondent is asked and observed to answer may vary
across waves as a function of aspects of survey design such as the decision of designers to introduce new
questions or to eliminate existing ones, the respondent’s time-varying characteristics used for skip logic, etc.
Additionally, new cohorts of respondents have been added over time, while a portion of respondents from the
initial cohorts have left the study due to death or other reasons.

SA2.1 Temporal Stability of Response Tendencies

   We start by investigating the empirical distributions of responses to each of the questions listed in

Table S1 above separately for each wave between 2002 and 2014. To reduce length, in Table S2 we

present the response patterns for a subset of 9 questions in different domains. We focus on questions that

were asked in at least 4 waves.

   For each of the 9 questions selected and for each of the waves in which those questions were posed,

the columns of Table S2 show the fractions of respondents who do not respond (NR), who respond 0,

50, or 100, who respond with any other multiple of 10 percent (i.e., in 𝕄𝕄10 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 70, 80,

90}), who respond with any multiple of 5 percent that is not a multiple of 10 percent (i.e., in 𝕄𝕄5 = {5,

15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 75, 85, 95}), and who respond in two ranges of multiples of 1 percent that are not

multiples of 5 or 10 percent (i.e., in 1-4 and in 96-99). In the column “Other” we report the residual

fraction of respondents who respond with a multiple of 1 percent that does not lie in the 1-4 or 96-99

range.

   By and large, HRS expectations questions feature low rates of item nonresponse in the personal

health and personal finances domains (below 0.05) and higher rates of item nonresponse in the general

economic conditions domain (typically between 0.05 and 0.10), with peaks of 0.25-0.30 rates of

nonresponse to specific questions eliciting respondents’ expectations of future performance of the stock

market (e.g., see question P47 in Table S2).

   The rates of 0, 50, and 100 vary across questions. For example, the fraction of 50 percent responses

tends to be higher in the general economic conditions domain, where they range between 0.20 and 0.30,

than in the remaining domains. Among the 9 questions shown in Table S2, the fractions of 0 and 100 are

highest for specific questions belonging to the personal finances and personal health domains. For

example, the fraction of 0 ranges between 0.35 and 0.50 for P14 (probability of losing own job during

the next year) and for P32 (probability of moving to a nursing home in 5 years); whereas the fraction of


                                                    4
100 percent is highest for P5 (probability of leaving an inheritance of at least $10K), ranging between

0.324 and 0.447 across waves.

   The high rates of 0, 50, and 100 in response to specific questions do not suggest any particular

degree of rounding. For example, responses of 50 percent are consistent with any degree of rounding.

Respondents who answered P47 (probability that the mutual fund will increase in value in the next year)

might genuinely believe that it is equally likely that the stock market will increase or decrease in value

in a 1-year time; they might mean that the chances that the stock market will go up are between 40 and

60 percent; or they might have epistemic uncertainty, using 50 percent to indicate a complete lack of

knowledge.

   Consistently high fractions of responses across questions and waves are multiples of 10 percent and,

to a lesser extent, of 5 percent. For the 9 questions shown in Table S2, the fractions of 𝕄𝕄10 and 𝕄𝕄5

responses range respectively between 0.20 and 0.45 and between 0.05 and 0.15 across questions and

waves. On the other hand, the fractions of cases where the response takes the value 1-4 or 96-99 are

substantially smaller and range respectively between 0.002 and 0.035 and between 0.000 and 0.010

across questions and waves. Responses in the “Other” category occur even more infrequently and

usually constitute 0.006 or less of cases.

   The main takeaway from Table S2 is that the basic patterns found by Manski and Molinari (2010)

using the 2006 data are confirmed for the remaining waves as well. Hence, these patterns are stable

across waves.

SA2.2 Pooling Data across Waves to Probe More Deeply into Response Tendencies
   The exploratory analysis presented in Section 2.1 of the main text describes the relative prevalence

of rounding patterns aggregated across the HRS respondents. To obtain further insight, we examine in

depth the rounding behavior of particular respondents across questions and waves. This kind of

exploration is possible in the HRS, as each respondent has been asked and answered many expectations

questions. Table S3 displays the average numbers of expectations questions asked and answered by HRS

respondents, in total and by wave and question domain. This exploration yields important new findings,

which we describe next.

   We proceed by drawing a random subset of 100 HRS respondents and by generating histograms of

the responses each respondent thus selected gave in each of the three question domains. Figure S1

illustrates using the respondent selected by the 9th random draw.

   Inspection of the histograms across the 100 randomly drawn respondents suggests that many of them

may be applying weakly coarser rounding in the middle of the 0-100 percent chance scale than in its

tails. To better visualize this pattern we report a grouped version of the histograms. For example, Figure

S2 presents the grouped versions of the histograms shown in Figure S1 for respondent #9. Specifically,

in Figure S2 responses are grouped according to the following partition of the 0-100 scale, where 25 and

75 are used as the thresholds separating the center from the two symmetric tails: 𝕄𝕄1-Tail = values in 1-

24 ∪ 76-99 that are not divisible by 5; 𝕄𝕄1-Center = values in [26, 74] that are not divisible by 5; 𝕄𝕄5-

Tail = {5, 15, 85, 95}; 𝕄𝕄5-Center = {35, 45, 55, 65}; 𝕄𝕄10-Tail = {10, 20, 80, 90}; 𝕄𝕄10-Center = {30,

40, 60, 70}; 𝕄𝕄25 = {25, 75}; 𝕄𝕄100 = {0, 100}; 𝕄𝕄50 = {50}.

   There are two notable features in the distributions of responses given by respondent #9 in Figure S2.

First, the high frequencies of 25 and 75 percent responses (grouped in 𝕄𝕄25) relative to other multiples

of 5 (grouped in 𝕄𝕄5-T and 𝕄𝕄5-C) suggest that 25 and 75 may have special status among multiples of 5.




                                                    8
These percentages correspond respectively to “1 in 4” and “3 in 4” chances. Thus, they might be viewed

by respondents as more rounded than other multiples of 5.

    The second important feature emerging from the histograms shown in Figure S2 is that the relative

frequencies of refined responses in the tail segments of the scale are generally higher than the

frequencies of such responses in the corresponding center segment. For instance, the heights of the bars

corresponding to 𝕄𝕄10-T responses are systematically higher than those corresponding to 𝕄𝕄10-C

responses in all three question domains. The same pattern applies to the remaining response categories.

This suggests that the more frequent use of multiples of 1 percent near the endpoints of the scale than

toward the middle of the scale documented by earlier analyses of rounding might be the expression of a

more general tendency of respondents to round more coarsely around the middle of the 0-100 scale than

in its tails.

SA3.1 Determination of Respondent Rounding Types

      Table S4 presents in a formal and compact way the complete algorithm used to determine a

respondent’s rounding type in the center of the 0-100 scale (panel A) and in its tails (panel B) within a

given question domain. Specifically, Table S4A maps all logically possible response tendencies that

may be observed in the center of the 0-100 scale into corresponding center rounding types. Table S4B

maps all logically possible response tendencies that may be observed in the tails of the 0-100 scale into

corresponding tail rounding types. For each question domain, each respondent is assigned a bivariate

(tails, center) rounding type belonging to the cross product of the tail and center rounding types listed in

the two panels of Table S4. Both panels make use of the partition of the 0-100 scale described in Table

S5.

      In Section 3.1, we present an example where a respondent is observed to answer four expectations

questions in the domain of personal finances. The respondent’s answers are {5, 30, 60, 85}. As the set

includes 2 multiples of 5 percent in the tails and 2 multiples of 10 percent in the center, the respondent is

classified as rounding to the nearest 5 percent or finer degree in the tails (𝓜𝓜5-T) and to the nearest 10

percent or finer degree in the center (𝓜𝓜10-C).

      We now discuss additional cases to further illustrate the logic of our proposed algorithm. Let us first

consider an alternative scenario where the respondent is asked an additional question in the domain of

personal finances and answers it with a value in the center that is either a multiple of 10 percent or 50

percent. Under this scenario, our conclusion about the respondent’s rounding type in the center for the

finances domain does not change. If, on the other hand, the respondent were to answer the additional

question with a multiple of 5 percent in the center, our conclusion might change as it would depend on

the respondent’s response pattern in the two domains other than personal finances. For example, if in a

second domain (say personal health), the respondent gave at least one center response that is a multiple


                                                      13
of 5 percent or finer (i.e., a multiple of 1 percent), then the respondent would be classified as rounding to

the nearest 5 percent (rather than 10 percent) in the center within the personal finances domain.

    Moving now to the tails, let us imagine that the respondent is asked an additional question in the

class of personal finances and answers it with a value in the tails that is a multiple of 5 percent, a

multiple of 10 percent, or a focal response of 0 or 100. In this case, our conclusion about the

respondent’s rounding type in the tails for the finances domain does not change. If, on the other hand,

the respondent were to answer the additional question with a multiple of 1 percent in the tails, our

conclusion might change depending on the respondent’s response pattern in the other two domains.

Specifically, if in a second domain (say general economic conditions), the respondent gave at least one

response — either in the tails or in the center — that is a multiple of 1 percent, then the respondent

would be classified as rounding to the nearest 1 percent in the tails within the personal finances domain.

    Building on the example introduced in Section 3.1, in Section 3.3 we explain how to assign

probability intervals to the respondents’ point responses. Here we discuss additional cases to further

illustrate the logic of our algorithm, particularly the application of the boundary conditions in

construction of the intervals.

    Let us first consider a case where the respondent is asked an additional question (relative to the

example discussed in Section 3.1) and were observed to answer with a multiple of 1 percent in the tails

(say 2 percent). The respondent is still classified as 𝓜𝓜5-T in the tails, as long as they did not use any

multiple of 1 percent to answer questions in the remaining domains. Under this scenario, construction of

the interval around 2 percent requires a “boundary condition,” whereby the lower bound of the assigned

interval cannot be smaller than 0 percent. Hence, if the respondent were observed to respond with 2

percent to one question in the finances domain, while still being classified as 𝓜𝓜5-T, 2 percent would be

assigned the interval [0, 4.5] or [max(0, 2 - 2.5), 2 + 2.5]. In the right tail of the scale, a response of 98




                                                       14
percent would be handled symmetrically and would be assigned a range of [95.5, 100] or [98 - 2.5,

min(100, 98 + 2.5)].

   Let us now consider an alternative scenario where the respondent is asked two additional questions

in the personal finances domain and is observed to answer both of them with a multiple of 1 percent in

the tails (say 2 percent and 98 percent). We now classify the respondent as 𝓜𝓜1-T. Under this scenario,

all of the respondent’s tail answers in the personal finances domain are taken at face value. Hence, 2

percent is assigned the range [2, 2], 5 percent is assigned the range [5, 5], and so on. Finally, regardless

of the respondent’s rounding type, any NR is assigned an interval of [0, 100].

   Let us now entertain a final situation where the respondent’s highest response in the left tail is 24

percent. In this case, the boundary condition to the left of 30 might bind, depending on the respondent’s

rounding type in the tails. Specifically, if the respondent is still 𝓜𝓜5-T — as it would happen if 24

percent were the only multiple of 1 percent (but not of 5 percent) used by the respondent in any domain

— then the boundary condition to the left of 30 percent would bind, since 24 + 2.5 > 30 – 5. In this case,

the probability interval assigned to the response of 30 percent in the center would be [26.5, 35] instead

of [25, 35]. On the other hand, if the respondent were classified to be 𝓜𝓜1-T — as it would happen if

they gave a second response, in addition to 24 percent, that is a multiple of 1 percent (but not of 5

percent) in any domain — then the boundary condition to the left of 30 percent would not bind, since 24

< 30 – 5.

SA3.3 Variation of Rounding Types with Respondent Characteristics

   Before describing how probability intervals are formed based on respondents’ point responses and

their inferred rounding types, we investigate whether the latter vary systematically by respondents’

characteristics. To this end, in Section 3.3 we estimate three bivariate ordered probit models, one per

question domain, where the outcome variables are the respondent’s bivariate vectors of tail and center

rounding categories in the corresponding domains and the predictors are respondent’s gender, age,

educational attainment, race, and cognitive score.

   Here we provide additional estimates from a specification that excludes cognitive scores. These

estimates are shown in Table S6. We do so as we believe that this part of our analysis may yield useful

information about likely characteristics of respondents that are associated with coarser or more refined

rounding behavior to researchers who analyze survey expectations but do not have access to: (a) a

sufficiently large number of expectations questions per respondent to directly apply our method; (b) a

sufficiently rich or specialized set of relevant covariates as in the HRS.

   The main patterns are analogous to those observed in the specification including cognitive scores. In

particular, higher levels of educational attainment are still unambiguously and statistically significantly

associated with a tendency to give more refined responses (less rounding) across all scale segments and

question domains. Similarly, the dummies continue to display a non-linear effect. Respondents

belonging to the oldest age category (80+) have a statistically significant tendency to give more rounded

responses than respondents belonging to the youngest one (50-59) across all scale segments and

questions domains. On the other hand, respondents in the two intermediate age groups (i.e., 60-69 and

70-79) belong to rounding categories that may be more refined, coarser, or statistically indistinguishable

from those characterizing younger respondents, depending on the specific domain or scale segment.

Gender and race continue to features a somewhat mixed pattern. As before, rounding tendencies are




                                                     19
positively correlated across scale segments. Hence, respondents who give coarser responses in the tails

are more likely to do so in the center and vice versa.

SA3.4 Using Survey Responses and Rounding Types to Form Expectations Intervals

   Table S7 (making use of the partition of the 0-100 scale described in Table S5) presents in a formal

and compact way the complete portion of the algorithm used to assign intervals to observed point

responses in the scale tails (panel A) and in the its center (panel B) within a given domain. Specifically,

Table S7A maps all logically possible rounding types and responses that may be observed in the tails of

the 0-100 scale into corresponding tail intervals. Similarly, Table S7B maps all logically possible

rounding types and responses that may be observed in the center of the 0-100 scale into corresponding

center intervals.

   We apply the algorithm described in Table S7 to all responses by HRS respondents who responded

to at least one expectations question in any question domain and in any wave between 2002 and 2014.

For the purpose of constructing the intervals, respondents who were classified as rounding more

coarsely in the tails than in the center are now treated as respondents who were classified as rounding to

the same degree in the tails and in the center.

   Table S8 reports the distributions of interval width for the responses given in wave 2014 to the

following three questions: the percent chance that the respondent will live to be 75 or older (P28), the

percent chance that the respondent will work full time past age 62 (P17), and the percent chance that a

mutual fund will increase in value within the next year (P47).

   The distribution of interval width for the probability of working past 62 displayed in the middle

column of the table displays higher frequencies at lower width values than the distributions shown in the

remaining columns, consistent with the pattern shown in Table 5 of the main text.
