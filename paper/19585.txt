                                             ABSTRACT

In this paper we investigate the relationship between loose monetary policy, low inflation, and easy
bank credit with asset price booms. Using a panel of up to 18 OECD countries from 1920 to 2011
we estimate the impact that loose monetary policy, low inflation, and bank credit has on house, stock
and commodity prices. We review the historical narratives on asset price booms and use a deterministic
procedure to identify asset price booms for the countries in our sample. We show that “loose” monetary
policy – that is having an interest rate below the target rate or having a growth rate of money above
the target growth rate – does positively impact asset prices and this correspondence is heightened during
periods when asset prices grew quickly and then subsequently suffered a significant correction. This
result was robust across multiple asset prices and different specifications and was present even when
we controlled for other alternative explanations such as low inflation or “easy” credit.

I. Introduction

Does expansionary monetary policy lead to asset price booms? There is an extensive theoretical

empirical and policy literature on this topic. The traditional view sees expansionary monetary

policy as raising asset prices as part of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. It works

through the adjustment of the community’s portfolio as agents substitute from cash to

government securities to corporate securities; to equities; to real estate; old masters and

commodities—eventually leading to overall inflation. Another view attributed to the Austrian

economists in the 1920s and more recently to the BIS sees an environment of low inflation and

accommodative monetary policy as creating an environment conducive to asset booms and

consequent busts.2

          Asset booms (especially those leading to bubbles) are often followed by busts which can

have serious economic effects. There is a long historical incidence of infamous boom busts

ranging from the South Sea bubble in the early eighteenth century, many famous stock market

crashes in the nineteenth century, the 1929 Wall Street Crash, the UK housing boom bust of

1973, the Nordic crises of the 1980s, the Japanese housing and equity bubble and crash of 1990

and the more recent dotcom and subprime mortgage boom busts. This history keeps repeating

itself.

          The policy implications of asset booms are significant, especially since asset busts have

often tended to lead to banking crises and serious and prolonged recessions. To the extent

monetary policy is a contributing factor, the question arises whether the monetary authorities

should use their policy tools to defuse booms before they turn into busts. A vociferous debate

 Related approaches emphasize financial liberalization and innovation accommodated by loose monetary policy as
conducive to creating booms.

raged in the early 2000s and until the aftermath of the recent financial crisis over the subject of

preemptive policy action. Central banks were unwilling to divert much attention away from their

traditional concern over price and overall macro stability. However the tide has recently turned

and the new emphasis on macro prudential monetary policy suggests that asset price booms have

been elevated to the top level of interest.

       Finally, the issue still remains that asset price booms in addition to sometimes ending

with damaging busts can be the precursors to a future run up in inflation. This then leads to the

question of when central banks should tighten their policies to prevent inflation from becoming

embedded in expectations.

       In this paper we develop a method to demarcate asset price booms. We focus on house

price booms, stock market booms and commodity booms for 18 OECD countries from 1920 to

the present. We then ascertain whether our set of boom events can be related to different

measures of expansionary monetary policy; deviations from Taylor rules and monetary aggregate

growth. Finally we use panel regression techniques to control for other determinants of asset

booms including: inflation, credit growth, output growth, financial liberalization, and the current

account deficit.

       Section II discusses the debate over the linkage between monetary policy and asset price

booms. Section III contains historical narratives on some of the salient asset price booms in

history. We discuss some booms in nineteenth century Great Britain, the Wall Street stock

market boom in the 1920s and the US housing boom of the 20s, the commodity price boom of

the 1970s, the UK housing booms in the 1970s and 1980s, the Nordic asset booms in the 1980s,

the Japanese boom of the late 80s, the dotcom boom of the 90s, and the recent subprime

mortgage boom bust. Section IV discusses our methodology of identifying asset price booms and
                                                  4
presents a chronology from 1920 to the present of the booms so identified. Section V uses

econometrics to isolate the links between expansionary monetary policy and asset price booms,

controlling for other factors. Section VI concludes with the implications of our findings for

monetary policy.



Section II: The Issues

Debate swirls over the causes of the subprime Mortgage Crisis of 2007-08 and the Great

Recession of 2007-2009 and the subsequent slow recovery. Two views predominate; the first is

that it was caused by global imbalances: a global savings glut in Asia which financed a

consumption boom, persistent budget deficits and current account deficits in the U.S and other

advanced countries. The second that it reflected domestic imbalances in the U.S. leading to an

unprecedented nationwide housing boom which burst in 2006 precipitating the crisis. This paper

focuses on the second view.3

         A key element of the domestic U.S. story is that the Federal Reserve kept monetary

policy too loose from 2002-2006 which fueled a housing boom that had its origins in a long

tradition of policies to encourage home ownership in succeeding administrations, financial

innovation, lax regulatory supervision and oversight and corporate malfeasance. John Taylor

(2007) (2009) has led the indictment of the Fed for fueling the housing boom in the early 2000s.

Based on the Taylor Rule (1993) he shows that the Federal Funds rate was as low as 3


3
  The possibility that monetary policy can produce asset price bubbles has also been studied extensively in
equilibrium rational expectations models. In such models, poorly designed monetary policies, such as the use of
interest rate rules without commitment to a steady long-run inflation rate, can lead to self-fulfilling prophecies and
asset price bubbles. Such outcomes are less likely, Woodford (2003) argues, if monetary policymakers follow a clear
rule in which the interest rate target is adjusted sufficiently to stabilize inflation. The theoretical literature thus
suggests that consideration of the monetary policy environment may be crucial to understanding why asset booms
come about.
                                                          5
percentage points below what a simple Taylor rule would generate for the period 2002-2005.

Taylor then simulated the path of housing starts had the Fed followed the Taylor rule over the

period 2000 to 2006. His calculations suggest that most of the run up in housing starts from 2002

to 2005 would not have occurred.

       An earlier OECD study by Ahrend et al (2005) found a close relationship between

negative deviations of the Taylor rule and several measures of housing market buoyancy

(mortgage lending, housing investment, construction investment and real house prices) for a

number of OECD countries in the early 2000s. The principal examples are the U.S. (2000-2006),

Canada (2001-2007), Denmark (2001-2004) and Australia (2000-2003). For the euro area as a

whole, they find that ECB policy rates are not far below the Taylor rule but for a number of

individual members (Portugal, Spain, Greece, Netherlands, Italy, Ireland and Finland) they are

well below it. This evidence as well as evidence in several other papers (Hott and Jakipii 2012,

Gerlach and Assenmacher- Wesche 2008a) suggests that expansionary monetary policy had a

key role to play in fostering recent housing booms, some of which led to devastating busts. Other

literature finds evidence linking expansionary monetary policy to equity booms and commodity

price booms (Gerlach and Assenmacher Weshe 2008b, Pagano, Lombardi, Anzuini 2010).

Expansionary monetary policy can also generate booms in commodity prices which can presage

a run up in global inflation. The Great Inflation of the 1970s was first manifested in commodity

prices before feeding into overall inflation. This reflected the basic distinction first pointed out

by Okun (1975) between goods that are traded in auction markets and whose prices react quickly

to both nominal and real shocks and goods traded in customer markets ( manufactured goods and

services) whose prices are relatively sticky. In the long-run, the paths of prices for both types of

goods are determined by the long-run growth of the money supply (reflecting monetary

                                                  6
neutrality). What happens in episodes of expansionary monetary policy characterized by falling

real interest rates is that real commodity prices rise much more quickly than the prices of other

goods and according to Frankel (2008) they overshoot the long-run equilibrium price level. At

the same time the prices of other goods react slowly to the monetary pressure. Frankel (2008)

finds that commodity prices are a good predictor of future inflation. Browne and Cronin (2007)

use time series techniques for the US (1959- 2005) to show that the growth of M2 and headline

inflation are cointegrated but that the adjustment mechanism to the long-run equilibrium involves

considerable overshooting by commodity prices. Moreover the deviation of commodity prices

from their long-run equilibrium values explains the subsequent path of the CPI.

        There is an extensive earlier literature on the relationship between monetary policy and

asset prices. Asset prices are viewed as a key link in the transmission mechanism of monetary

policy. The traditional view argues that added liquidity causes asset prices to rise as a link in the

transmission mechanism of monetary policy actions to the economy as a whole. Another view,

the Austrian/BIS view argues that asset price booms are more likely to arise in environments of

low and stable inflation and thus asset price booms can arise because monetary policy is geared

to credibly stabilizing prices.

        The traditional view has a long history. Early Keynesian models like Metzler (1951) had

central bank operations affecting the stock market directly. Friedman and Schwartz (1963a) and

later Tobin (1969) and Brunner and Meltzer (1973) spelled out the transmission mechanism

following an expansionary Fed open market purchase. It would first affect the prices ( rate of

return) on short –term government securities, then via a portfolio balance substitution

mechanism, the price (rate of return) of long-term government securities then corporate

securities, equities ,real estate, old masters and commodities including gold would be bid up (

                                                  7
their returns lowered). Thus substitution from more to less liquid assets would occur as returns

on the former decline relative to the latter. Thus the impact of expansionary monetary policy will

impact securities, assets and commodities and finally the overall price level. This view sees asset

prices as possible harbingers of future inflation.

           The Austrian/BIS view which goes back to Hayek, von Mises, Robbins4 and others in the

1920s posits that an asset price boom whatever its fundamental cause, can degenerate into a

bubble if accommodative monetary policy allows bank credit to rise to fuel the boom. This view

argues that unless policy-makers act to defuse the boom, a crash will inevitably follow that in

turn may cause a serious recession. The Austrians equated rising asset prices with a rise in the

overall price level. Although the level of U.S. consumer prices was virtually unchanged between

1923 and 1929, the Austrians viewed the period as one of rapid inflation fueled by loose Federal

Reserve policy and excessive growth of bank credit (Rothbard 1983).

           The Austrian view has carried forward into the modern discussion of asset price booms.

It has been incorporated into the BIS view of Borio and Lowe (2002), Borio and White (2003)

and others. They focus on the problem of “financial imbalances” defined as rapid growth of

credit in conjunction with rapid increases in asset prices and possibly investment. Borio and

Lowe (2002) argue that a build-up of such imbalances can increase the risk of a financial crisis

and macroeconomic instability. They construct an index of imbalances based on a credit gap

(deviations of credit growth from trend), an equity gap, and an output gap, to identify incipient

asset price declines that can lead to significant real output losses, and advocate its use as a guide

for proactive action. In this vein Borio (2012) discusses a financial cycle based on property

prices and credit growth which has much greater amplitude than the business cycle and when its

4

                                                     8
peak coincides with a business cycle peak, a housing bust, banking crisis and deep protracted

recession can follow, as occurred in 2007.

         Borio and Lowe argue that low inflation can promote financial imbalances regardless of

the cause of an asset price boom. For example, by generating optimism about the

macroeconomic environment, low inflation might cause asset prices to rise more in response to

an increase in productivity than they would otherwise would. Similarly, an increase in demand is

more likely to cause asset prices to rise if the central bank is credibly committed to price

stability. A commitment to price stability that is viewed as credible, Borio and Lowe (2002)

argue, will make product prices less sensitive and output and profits more sensitive in the short-

run to an increase in demand. At the same time, the absence of inflation may cause policy

makers to delay tightening as demand pressures build up. 5Thus they contend (pp. 30-31) “these

endogenous responses to credible monetary policy (can) increase the probability that the latent

inflation pressures manifest themselves in the development of imbalances in the financial

system, rather than immediate upward pressure in higher goods and service price inflation.”6

         Christiano et al (2010) present historical evidence showing that stock price booms in the

U.S. and Japan often occurred in periods of low inflation. Productivity shocks which raise the

natural rate of interest are accommodated by expansion in bank credit which pushes up stock



5
  A related issue to the impact of expansionary monetary policy on asset prices is whether the price index targeted by
the central bank should include asset prices. Alchian and Klein (1973) contend that a theoretically correct measure
of inflation is the change in the price of a given level of utility, which includes the present value of future
consumption. An accurate estimate of inflation, they argue, requires a broader price index than one consisting only
of the prices of current consumption goods and services. To capture the price of future consumption, Alchian and
Klein (1973) contend that monetary authorities should target a price index that includes asset prices. Bryan et al
(2002) concur, arguing that because it omits asset prices (especially housing prices), the CPI seriously understated
inflation during the 1990s.

 For evidence that low inflation contributed to the housing booms of the 1990s and 2000s see Frappa and
Mesonnier (2010).

prices. According to their analysis based on a DSGE model, following a Taylor type rule in the

face of low inflation will lead to lower interest rates which will further fuel the asset boom.

        In section V below we present some evidence consistent with the loose monetary policy

explanation for asset price booms and also the Austrian BIS view that regards monetary policy

dedicated to low inflation and bank credit expansion as creating an environment conducive to an

asset boom.



III Historical narrative

III.1 The Nineteenth Century

Asset booms and busts have been a major part of the economic landscape since the early

eighteenth century. Classic stock market booms followed by wrenching busts were the South Sea

Bubble in England and John Law’s Mississippi scheme in France (see Neal 2011 and Velde

2003). In the nineteenth century there were major stock market boom busts across the world

which accompanied the advent of equities to finance the rapid economic development that

followed the industrial revolution. Two famous stock market booms and busts in England

occurred in the 1820s and the 1840s.

       The earliest and probably most famous stock market boom-bust in the modern era ended

with the 1824-25 stock market crash (Bordo 1998, Bordo 2003, Neal 1998). After the

Napoleonic wars and the successful resumption of the gold standard in 1821, the British

economy enjoyed a period of rapid expansion, stimulated by an export boom to the newly

independent states of Latin America and investment in infrastructure projects ( e.g. gas lighting,

canals and railroads). The sale of stocks to finance those ventures, in addition to gold and silver


                                                 10
mines (some real, some fictitious) in Latin America propelled a stock market boom fueled by the

Bank of England’s easy monetary policy. Prices rose by 78% in the boom. Indications are that

the April 1825 collapse in stock prices was related to the prior tightening of the Bank of

England’s monetary policy stance in response to a decline in its gold reserves. The collapse in

which stock prices fell by 34% triggered bank failures, which, once they reached important City

of London banks, precipitated a fully-fledged panic in early December. Only then did the Bank

of England begin to act as a lender of last resort but it was too late to prevent massive bank

failures, contraction of loans, and a serious recession.

       The 1840s railroad mania was a precedent to the 1990s dot com boom. After the first

successful railroad was established in 1830, optimistic expectations about potential profits that

later turned out to be overly optimistic led to massive investment in rails and rolling stock, which

extended the network across the country. The boom was accommodated by expansionary

monetary policy in response to gold inflows. The end of the railroad boom was associated with

the banking panic of 1847—one of the worst in British history. The crash, in which stock prices

fell by 30% and the panic, as in earlier episodes, may have been triggered by tightening of the

Bank of England’s monetary policy stance, reflecting its concern over declining gold reserves

(Dornbusch and Frankel 1984). The panic led to many bank failures and a serious recession.

The U.S. had many stock market booms and busts in its history. Several of them were associated

with banking panics and serious recessions. One of the classic boom busts was the railroad boom

in the 1870s which opened up the west. The post-civil war era experienced one of the most rapid

growth rates in U.S. history. Much of the financing of railroad investment came from British

capital inflows which in turn accompanied by gold inflows permitted monetary expansion. The

boom was also accompanied by corporate malfeasance and corruption (Bordo and Benmelech

                                                 11
2008). The boom ended with a stock market crash in 1873 once the extent of the corporate fraud

was revealed. The stock market crash was followed by a banking panic and a recession which

only ended in 1879.


III.2 The 1920s

The most famous episode of an asset price boom is the Wall Street Boom beginning in 1923 and

ending with the Crash in October 1929.During the boom stock prices rose by over 200%, the

collapse from 1929 to 1932 had prices decline by 66%.The boom was associated with massive

investment that brought the major inventions of the late nineteenth century, eg electricity and the

automobile, to fruition. In addition, major innovations also profoundly changed industrial

organization and the financial sector, including the increased use of equity as a financial

instrument. The economy of the 1920s (following the sharp recession of 1920-21) was

characterized by rapid real growth, rapid productivity advance and slightly declining prices,

punctuated by two minor recessions. Irving Fisher and other contemporaries believed that the

stock market boom reflected the fundamentals of future profits from the high growth industries

that were coming on stream and that it was not a bubble. Recent work by McGrattan and

Prescott (2003) concurs with that view although many others regard it as a bubble (Galbraith

1955, White and Rapoport 2004).

       Debate continues over the role of expansionary Federal Reserve policy in fueling the

boom. In 1932 Adolph Miller, a member of the Federal Reserve Board blamed the New York

Fed and its President Benjamin Strong for pursuing expansionary open market purchases to help

Britain restore the pound to its prewar parity in 1924 and then again in 1927 to protect sterling

from a speculative attack. In both occasions, the U.S. economy was in recession justifying

expansionary policy (Friedman and Schwartz 1963). Miller indicted Strong (who died in 1928)
                                                 12
for fueling the stock market boom and the resultant crash. His views were instrumental in

legislation in 1933 which prohibited Reserve banks from engaging in international monetary

policy actions.

       As mentioned in Section II above the Austrian economists later followed by economists

at the BIS saw the 1920s as a credit boom accommodated by monetary policy. Eichengreen and

Michener (2004) present evidence for the BIS view for the 1920s as a credit boom gone wild,

based on their measures of a credit boom (deviations from trend of the ratio of broad money to

GDP, the investment ratio and real stock prices) for a panel of 9 countries.

       The 1920s also witnessed a major house price boom in the U.S. from 1923 to 1925.

White (2009) argues that the boom was in part triggered by expansionary monetary policy. He

finds that deviation from a Taylor rule has some explanatory power for the run up in real housing

prices. He also argues that the Fed, established in 1914 to act as a lender of last resort and to

reduce the seasonal instability in financial markets, created some elements of a “Greenspan Put’

– the view that emerged after Chairman Greenspan engineered a massive liquidity support for the

New York money center banks during the October 1987 Wall Street Crash – that the Fed would

bail out the financial sector in the event of a crash. Unlike the Wall Street stock market boom,

the housing boom bust in the 1920s had little impact on the economy as a whole or on the

financial system.




III.3 Post World War II

The post war period has exhibited a large number of housing and stock market boom busts.

Many of these episodes occurred in an environment of loose monetary policy. In addition,

expansionary monetary policy across the world in the 1960s and 1970s led to a global
                                                  13
commodities boom which presaged the Great Inflation. We briefly discuss a number of salient

episodes.




III.3.1 Asset Booms in the UK.

The UK had a massive house price and stock market boom in 1971-1974, referred to by Tim

Congdon (2005) as the Heath Barber Boom after the then Prime Minister and Chancellor of the

Exchequer. Congdon documents the rapid growth in broad money (M4) after the passage of the

Competition and Credit Control Bill in 1971 which liberalized the UK financial system and

ended the rate setting cartel of the London clearing banks. He shows both rapid growth in M4

and a shift in its composition towards balances held by the corporate and financial sectors away

from the household sectors. Following the Friedman and Schwartz (1963a) transmission story,

the excess cash balances went into equities first and properties second, greatly pushing up their

prices. The big asset price booms were soon followed by an unprecedented rise in inflation to

close to 20% per year by the end of the 1970s. Congdon also shows a tight connection between

expansion in broad money supply in 1986/87 and subsequent asset price booms which he calls

the Lawson boom after the Chancellor of the Exchequer. As in the 1970s boom, rapid growth in

M4 and in its holdings by the corporate and financial sectors fueled a stock market boom which

burst in 1987 and a housing boom which burst in 1989.Finally he attributes a big run up in

financial sector real broad money holdings in 1997/98 to an equities boom in the late 90s and a

housing boom which peaked in 2006.




                                                14
III.3.2 Nordic Asset Booms in the 1980s

The Nordic countries, Norway, Sweden and Finland all experienced major asset booms and busts

in the 1980s. In each country the run up in asset prices followed liberalization of their financial

sectors after 5 decades of extensive controls on lending rates and government control over the

sectoral allocation of bank lending. Asset booms were accommodated by expansionary monetary

policy as each country adhered to pegged exchange rates which tended to make monetary policy

pro-cyclical.

       In the case of Norway, quantitative restrictions on bank lending were lifted in 1984

without allowing interest rates to rise. Real interest rates were low and sometimes negative.

Banks used their newborn freedom to expand lending on a large scale, all of them with a firm

desire to increase their market shares. This stimulated a massive real estate boom until 1986. The

boom ended with tighter monetary policy in 1986. The legacy of the collapse of the real estate

boom and the buildup in bad assets in the commercial banks was a banking crisis in 1991 and a

recession (Steigum 2009).

       Similar stories occurred in Finland and Sweden (Jonung et al 2009). Their crises and

recessions were much worse than in Norway largely because their currencies were pegged to the

DM in the EMS system and they were hard hit by tight German monetary policy in reaction to

the high fiscal costs of German reunification.




III.3.4 Japan in the 1980s

The Japanese boom-bust cycle began in the mid-1980s with a run up of real estate prices fueled

by an increase in bank lending and easy monetary policy. The Bank of Japan began following a

                                                 15
looser monetary policy after the Plaza Accord of 1985, to attempt to devalue the yen and ease the

upward pressure on the dollar. The property price boom in turn led to a stock market boom as the

increased value of property owned by firms raised future profits and hence stock prices

(Iwaisako and Ito 1995). Both rising land prices and stock prices in turn increased firms’

collateral encouraging further bank loans and more fuel for the boom. The bust may have been

triggered by the Bank of Japan’s pursuit of a tight monetary policy in 1989 to stem the asset

market boom.

       The subsequent asset price collapse in the next five years led to a collapse in bank

lending with a decline in the collateral backing corporate loans. The decline in asset prices

further impinged on the banking system’s capital, making many banks insolvent. This occurred

because the collapse in asset prices reduced the value of their capital. Lender of last resort policy

prevented a classic banking panic but regulatory forbearance propped up insolvent banks. It took

over a decade to resolve the banking crisis and Japan is still mired in slow growth.




III.3.4 The 1994-2000 U.S. Dot Com Stock Market Boom

The stock market of the 1990s in the U.S. (and other countries) had many of the elements of the

railroad boom in England in the 1840s and the 1920s Wall Street boom, including rapid

productivity growth and the dissemination and marketing of technologies that had been

developed earlier. Massive funds flowed from IPOs and the stock market to finance companies

using the new high tech personal computer and internet based technologies. Significant run ups

in the market value of leaders like AOL and Microsoft (even before they reported profits) led




                                                 16
others to join in the game. The investment boom in the IT industry led to a stock price boom in

the late 1990s which burst in 2000.

       As in earlier booms, easy bank (and non-bank credit) finance was crucial, as well as

accommodative monetary policy. As in the 1920s boom the question arose whether the rise in

stock prices reflected underlying fundamentals (referred to as the “New Economy”) or a

speculative bubble. The BIS view attributed the boom to the environment of low inflation and

credibility for low inflation produced by the Federal Reserve and other central banks during the

Great Moderation of the 1980s and 1990s. In this opinion, central banks focused on low inflation

did not see the risks that the benign environment had of fostering an asset boom.




III.4.1 Commodity Price Booms: the 1930s

The recovery from the Great Contraction after 1933 witnessed a global commodity boom.

Friedman and Schwartz (1963b) document the policies of Franklin Roosevelt and his Secretary

of the Treasury, Henry Morgenthau, to purchase gold and silver in the London market to reflate

the U.S. economy. They were following the approach suggested by George Warren and Frank

Pearson (1935). The Treasury gold and silver purchases succeeded in pushing up gold and silver

prices in the London commodity market and may have also helped produce the general

commodity boom of the mid-1930s. Other factors would have been global recovery and the

looming threat of World War II.

III.4.1 Commodity Price Booms: the 1970s

The massive commodities boom in the 1970s has been viewed as a precursor of the Great

Inflation. Following the monetarist transmission mechanism, expansionary monetary policy

pushed up highly inelastic raw materials prices which then later fed into the prices of

intermediate goods and final goods (Bordo 1980). An alternative widely held view at the time

was that there were a series of negative supply shocks in the 1970s which accounted for the

boom (Blinder and Rudd 2013). The most memorable events of the time were the two OPEC Oil

price shocks of 1974 and 1978. However Barsky and Killian (2001) present evidence that what

led to the formation of the OPEC cartel and its constriction of supply was an attempt to

compensate the oil producers for a decline in the real value of oil prices in terms of dollars. This

reflected global inflation aided by expansionary U.S. (and other countries ) monetary policies

beginning in the mid-1960s.




III.4.2 Commodity Price Booms: the 2000s

A run up in commodity prices in the 2000s has popularly been attributed to globalization and the

rapid growth of emerging market economies, especially China, which pushed up the prices of

commodities like copper crucial to their economic development. However there is also an

argument that the boom reflected expansionary monetary policy in the U.S. and other advanced

countries concerned over the threat of deflation after the dot.com boom burst (Frankel 2008).

The rise in commodity prices then fed into global inflation (Browne and Cronin 2007, Ciccarelli

and Mojon 2010).

III.5 Summary

The wide history of asset price booms displays evidence of a connection between monetary

expansion and booms. However the circumstances of the different episodes varied considerably.

In the case of some famous stock price booms, e.g. the 1840s, 1870s 1920s and 1990s the

fundamental drivers were productivity shocks such as the advent of the railroads, consumer

durables and the internet. The run up in asset prices was fueled by bank credit in an environment

of accommodative monetary policy.

       House price booms on some occasions reflected real shocks such as rapid immigration

and financial liberalization as well as expansionary monetary policy. Commodity price booms

also reflected both real shocks and highly expansionary monetary policy. In the rest of the paper

we provide some empirical evidence on the contribution of monetary policy and several other

factors to a large sample of asset price booms.




IV. Identifying Asset Price Booms




Before outlining our econometric approach we first identify asset price booms for real house

prices, real stock prices and real commodity prices. Our approach to identifying boom/bust

periods is a mixture of the formal and the informal. We first use a well-known dating algorithm

to find turning points of our asset price series and then use our discretion to select those

expansions/contraction pairs that meet our criteria. We do this to avoid some well-known

problems that dating algorithms can have in identifying cycles when the underlying data is

purely random (see for example Cogley and Nason (1995)).

                                                  19
        The first step of the process is to date the turning points of our asset price series. We do

this using the method described in Harding and Pagan (2002) and Pagan and Sossounov (2003).

In these two related papers the authors use the method of Bry and Boschan (1971) to date turning

points of time series. The dating algorithm of Bry and Boschan (1971) was formulated to mimic

the NBER dating process and is successful in dating turning points in time series. For real house

prices and real commodity prices we look for peaks (troughs) that are higher (lower) than the two

nearest observations on each side of the turning point under the constraint that peaks and troughs

must alternate. For real stock prices, because of the higher volatility of stock prices and the lower

duration that is found for cycles in stock prices we use a modified rule where a turning point is

declared if the observation on each side of the peak (trough) is lower (higher) than the candidate

turning point. Note however that this is the first stage of our process. It is possible that the rule

for the stock price series may identify expansion/contraction pairs that are nothing more than

short-term “blips”. This is the reason why in the second stage of the process we inspect the

cycles found by the algorithm and reject those that do not meet our criteria.

        The second stage of our process we do the following: Once turning points are identified

we inspect each expansion (defined as the period from a trough to the next peak) to see if it fits

our definition of an asset price boom. To identify asset price booms we take a “holistic”

approach. That is we first look for expansions that meet our criteria and then we visually inspect

each prospective boom to check whether the dates for the boom should be corrected. For

example, starting dates are moved to the point where the gradient of the asset price series first

significantly picks up if the initial periods of the expansion are relatively flat.

        The definition of a boom that we use is that a boom is a sustained expansion in asset

prices that ends in a significant correction. The expansion is such that the rate of growth is higher

                                                   20
than what would be considered usual based on previous cycles. For an expansion to meet the

definition of a sustained expansion the expansion must last at least two years and average at least

5% per year for real house and commodity prices and average at least 10% per year for real stock

prices. This is similar to the criteria used in Bordo and Wheelock (2009). The second screening

that we use is that the price correction that follows the expansion in prices must be greater than

25% of the expansion in price that occurred during the expansion. We believe that this definition

rules out secular trends where there can be large increases in asset prices followed by small

corrections followed by another large expansion. The booms that we identify all are followed by

significant price corrections which suggest that the price expansion was not sustainable and

hence a boom/bust period

           The identified asset prices booms are reported in Tables 1, 2 and 3 and are depicted in

Figures in the Appendix. We have annual data on real house prices, real stock prices for 18

countries from 1920 to 2010. We also have a single real global commodity price index for that

period. 7 The approach we follow is similar to that used in IMF WEO (2003), Helbling and

Terrones (2004), and Bordo and Wheelock (2009). All of these studies used monthly data for a

smaller set of countries. Only the Bordo and Wheelock study covered the pre-World War II

period. As in the earlier studies we identify many more stock price booms than house price

booms.




IV.1 Housing Booms

With the exception of France in the 1930s and the U.S. in the 1920s in Table 1 we did not

identify any house price booms before World War II. In the post-World War II period most

countries had house price booms in the 1970s and 1980s. The literature at the time associated

them with the liberalization of financial markets that occurred after the breakdown of the Bretton

Woods system. Many of the boom-busts were dramatic, especially in Japan, the Scandinavian

countries, Netherlands and Switzerland. The U.S. only experienced mild booms and corrections

in that period. Several dramatic episodes occurred in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The U.S.

housing boom of 1997-2006 when real prices rose by 79% and fell by 33% and the Irish boom of

1996-2007 when real prices rose by 195% and then fell by 40% really stand out.

IV.2 Stock Price Booms

Stock prices show considerably more volatility than house prices and many more booms and

busts (See Table 2). In the pre-World War II period most countries had major stock market

booms and busts. In the 1920s many countries had booms similar to that on Wall Street. The

Wall Street boom saw real prices rising by 183% 1923-28 and collapsing by 63% 1928-1932.

The U.S. was surpassed by Canada and Switzerland but Australia, Finland and Sweden were not

far behind. This pattern of international concordance of stock prices is well known (Goetzman,

Rouwenhorst and Li, 2000).The recovery from the Great Contraction in the mid-1930s also

displayed some major booms , especially in Australia, Canada, Finland, the UK, Sweden,

Switzerland and the U.S.

        In the post-World War II era, booms reflecting Europe’s recovery and catch up in the

1950s occurred in France, Italy and Switzerland. Japan also had a major boom in the 1950s. The

Marshall Plan and the Dodge Plan may have been keen drivers of both rapid real growth and the

rise in asset values in those years (Bordo and Wheelock 2009).




                                                24
       The next big wave of stock market booms occurred in the 1980s and especially the 1990s.

The growth of the high tech industry led to dramatic booms in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Ireland

Italy, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.




IV.3 Commodity Price Booms



       As discussed in section III above, Table 3 shows the post Great Contraction commodity

price boom in the mid-1930s. The boom in the 1970s associated with the oil price shocks and

the Great Inflation is also evident. The last big boom in the 2000s associated with the rapid

growth of emerging markets and expansionary monetary policy is also very visible in the table.

V. Empirical Analysis


In this analysis we pool data from across the 18 countries in our data set to investigate the impact

of loose monetary policy and low inflation on asset prices.8 By pooling the data across the

  The countries in our sample are Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain,
Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the USA. Countries are

twentieth century we are in a sense calculating the impact each of our control variables have on

asset prices averaged across all the boom periods that we have identified. Low inflation could

reflect the credibility for low inflation that occurred in the 1980s and 1990s and 1920s according

to Borio and Lowe (2002) and Eichengreen and Michener (2004). In this environment,

endogenous asset price booms could arise, financed by easy credit, accommodated by the central

bank. Loose monetary policy refers to deliberately expansionary monetary policy (as evidenced

in the policy rate being below the Taylor rule rate) done for example to prevent deflation as in

the 2000s or to stimulate recovery from a recession.

         The asset price data that we use in the analysis are real house prices, real stock prices,

and real commodity prices. We include two different measures of monetary policy – the

deviation of a short term interest rate from the optimal Taylor rule rate and the deviation of the

money growth rate from 3%. The optimal Taylor rule rate is given by the following equation:




                                 r Taylor   t  r * 0.5  yt  yt*   0.5  t   *                           (1)




where the output gap term is given by the deviation in log real GDP from its long run trend (as

determined by the Hodrick-Prescott filter with a smoothing parameter equal to 100 since the data

are annual time series) and the inflation target is 2%. It should be noted that we do not use policy

rates in this analysis and that we use for all countries a target interest rate ( r * ) of 2% with

coefficients of 0.5 and 0.5 as in Taylor (1993). Thus the optimal Taylor rule rate that we use is a



included in our regressions if data is available. When the number of countries reported for a regression is less than
18 it is because data for a country is missing.

very rough measure of the optimal policy rate for each country. 9 The same goes for our measure

of monetary policy using the growth rate of broad money. We use the deviation of the growth

rate of money from 3% as a simple measure of the stance of monetary policy present at the time.

It also represents Milton Friedman’s original (1960) monetary rule – to set money growth equal

to the underlying trend growth rate of real output.10 If we assume the trend growth rate in

velocity is constant, this rule would give stable prices.11 Money growth is also a useful measure

of the stance of monetary policy in earlier periods when central banks engaged in monetary

targeting or in episodes when it is more difficult to estimate a Taylor rule

         The three main controls that we use in our regressions are the deviation of monetary

policy from the “optimal” policy rule, either the Taylor rule or the Friedman money growth rule,

a measure of the inflationary state of the economy – a measure of the deviation of inflation from

its long run trend – and a measure of the credit conditions present as measured by the deviation

of the share of bank loans to GDP from its long run mean.

         The deviation of the short-term interest rate (money growth rate) from the optimal rate is

included to control for possible correlations between “loose” monetary policy and asset booms.

The inflation control is included to control for possible correlations between low inflation policy

and booms and the credit control variable is included to determine if loose or “easy” credit has a

role in asset booms. These variables are consistent with the Austrian BIS story as well as recent

 As we collect more data, in particular data on policy rates, we will check the sensitivity of our results to this rough
measure of the optimal policy rate.

  The trend growth rate of real output would roughly hold for the U.S.1920-2010 but may be too high for some
countries like the UK and too low for others.
11
  Over the 1920-2010 period the trend growth rate of velocity was close to zero, averaging a decline to the 1960s
and an increase since (Bordo and Jonung 1987).

papers by Schularick and Taylor (2012) , Jorda, Schularick and Taylor ( 2012) and Christiano et

al (2010).

           These are the three main alternative variables that have been argued to play a role in asset

booms and the aim of this paper is to use data over the whole twentieth century to shed light on

their roles. Of course these are not the only determinants of asset prices so we also include other

controls such as the growth rate of GDP, a measure of current account imbalances and a measure

of financial liberalization.12

           The data in their raw form are non-stationary, either through the presence of a unit root or

a time trend. In this paper we are mainly interested in the role that our three main controls play in

boom/bust periods. These periods are identified earlier as periods where there were sustained

run-ups in asset prices followed by significant corrections. That is, these asset price booms are

periods in which asset prices move away from their long-run trends. Our interest is to see

whether there is a systematic relationship between deviations of our three main variables from

their long-run trend, or in the case of the policy variable the optimal rate, and the deviation of

asset prices from its long-run trend. Thus we are not focusing on secular movements and the

relationship between asset price levels and the rate of inflation, interest rates, or the amount of

credit available in the economy but rather we are focusing on examining the departures from the

normal.

           Because of this we convert all variables to deviations from a long-run trend. The policy

variables, the short-term interest rate and the growth rate of M2, are deviated from the “optimal”

rate. We do this using the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter with a smoothing parameter set to 100

since our data are collected at the annual frequency. 13

         The variables used in our regression analysis are therefore negative when the value is

below the long-run trend and positive when the variable is above the long run trend. Our

regression analysis then investigates the relationship between the deviation from the long run

trend of asset prices and the deviation of inflation and credit from their long term trend and the

deviation of the short term interest rate from the “optimal” Taylor rule rate (or deviation of the

growth rate of money from 3% in the case where we use money growth rates in our regression).

When the short term rate is below the “optimal” Taylor rule rate or the money growth rate is

above 3% then the monetary policy conditions are “loose”.

         The model that is used is an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model given by

                                                  p               3    q

Here variables in “hats” refer to deviations from trend or in the case of the monetary policy

variables the “hats” refer to deviations from the optimal policy – the Taylor rule for interest rates

and the Friedman rule for money growth. We include the three main control variables into the

regression with lags in order to investigate the dynamic structure of low inflation, “loose”

monetary policy, and relatively abundant or “easy” credit on asset prices. In determining the

number of lags to include of each variable in our regression equation sequential likelihood ratio



13
  In order to make the current account variable stationary we use deviations from its long-run (HP) trend. Thus if
the deviation is negative the current account has worsened relative to its recent past and if the value of this gap is
positive the current account has improved relative to its recent past. A positive value does not necessarily mean the
current account is in surplus and a negative value does not necessarily mean the current account is in deficit.

tests are used. For simplicity we do not allow for different numbers of lags for each of the right

hand side control variables.

       Tables 4, 5 and 6 show the results for real house prices, real stock prices and real

commodity prices for each of the monetary variables respectively. The first two sets of

regressions – the ones with house and stock prices as dependent variables – are panel regressions

and in these two regression equations country specific fixed effects are included. For the

regression for real commodity prices, because the market for commodities is a global market,

lacking measures of global monetary policy, we use US data as covariates.




V.1 Real House Prices

Table 4a and 4b report the results from our panel regressions where real house prices are the

dependent variable. In all tables the numbers in parentheses are p-values. Country specific fixed

effects are included but their estimates are not reported for space considerations. There are four

regressions reported in each table. The first regression is the basic ARDL model with only

current and lagged deviations of trend of the three main control variables included. In Table 4a

the “policy” variable that is included is the deviation of the short-term interest rate from the

“optimal” rate given by the Taylor rule in (1). Table 4b includes the deviation of the growth rate

of M2 from 3%. In both regressions it was determined that one lag of the dependent variable

should be included and the current value and two lags of the control variables should be

included. In order to allow for the possibility that the three main covariates are only important

during the boom periods we include interactions between a dummy variable, D, that for each

country takes a value of 0 if period t is not in a boom and a value of 1 if period t is in a boom.


                                                 34
Thus we are able to tell if there are any non-linearities present in the relationship between the

controls and asset price deviations.

         Regression (1) reported in Table 4a reports the estimates of (2) when we include the

policy variable, the inflation variable, and the credit variable. For the policy variable, which is

the deviation of the short-term interest rate from the Taylor rule rate, the coefficient on the first

lag is significant and negative. This means that for every 1 percentage point you lower the short-

term interest rate below the implied Taylor rule rate real house prices would increase by 0.40%

in the next period. 14 This is obviously a very small impact and given that the second lag is

significant and positive the overall impact of a sustained period with the short-term interest rate

below its target would not have a large initial impact on house prices.

         As for the deviation of inflation from its long-run trend, again the first lag is significant

and negative. Thus a negative deviation of 1 percentage point in the inflation from its long-run

tend would lead to an increase in house prices of 0.85%. Again this initial impact is small. As for

the variable that measures the deviation of credit from its long-run trend there are no significant

terms.

         The results above are what you would expect in “normal” situations; that is when D=0.

During boom periods, when D=1, the impacts of deviations from trend are more striking. For the

policy deviation variable,  r s  r Taylor t , there is a significant and large negative coefficient on the

second lag. Thus when in a boom period the initial impact of a negative deviation from the

Taylor-rule rate of one percentage point leads to a 2.15 percent increase in house prices two

periods later. This large and significantly negative estimate is consistent across all specifications
14
  Note that all variables are in decimals so that a 1 percentage point change is equivalent to a change of 0.01. Also
note that the presence of a lagged dependent variable means that the long-run cumulative impact of this change can
be higher than the initial impacts but for the purposes of this discussion we will discuss only the initial impacts.
                                                         35
of our regression models and indicates that “loose” monetary policy is associated with increases

in house prices during the identified boom periods.

       The same results are apparent for the inflation deviation and the credit deviation. For

inflation during boom periods there are significant and negative coefficients on the current

period and the second lag. The first lag is also significant but is positive which means that the

impact of a sustained one percentage point fall in inflation will be negative and in the range of

2.5% initially.

        The credit variable showed little impact during normal periods but during the identified

boom periods the coefficients are significant and positive for the current period and significant

and negative for the second lag. This suggests that a one percent increase in loans as a proportion

of GDP would lead house prices increasing in the short term but that this increase would be
                                                                       37
small and of the order of 0.25% to 0.5%. It should be noted that the modest size of this effect is

in contrast to results reported in Jorda et. al. (2012) and Christiano et. al. (2010). Our estimates

are based on panel estimates using evidence for booms across most of the twentieth century and

so the estimates we report are essentially averages of the impact of credit expansion for each of

the booms. It could be that the credit expansion story is appropriate for the most recent boom but

not for earlier booms. The fact that we get a lower impact on average does not necessarily

contradict the results from these authors.

         As in the case of the policy variable the evidence points to there being a bigger effect

during booms than in calmer periods. This result that “loose” monetary policy, low inflation, and

“easy” credit is associated with increases in house prices during boom periods is consistent

across the other specifications and the impact of these variables is higher in magnitude than

GDP growth and the measure of current account imbalance. The financial liberalization variable

does not have any impact.15

         Thus there is evidence that during boom periods the relationship between interest rates,

low inflation and credit conditions and house prices is heightened and conducive to fueling even

higher prices.

         Table 4b reports the same regression results as above except this time the deviation of

money growth (M2) is used as our measure of expansionary monetary policy instead of the

deviation of the short term interest rate from the optimal Taylor-rule rate. The results are

reasonably consistent with the one reported above. A “loose” monetary condition, which in this

case means having a growth rate of money larger than the Friedman rule rate of 3%, is associated


15
  Data for the financial liberalization variable is only available from 1970 onwards so this regression only includes
data after 1970.

with an increase in house prices and this impact is greater during the identified boom periods

than during normal periods. The same for credit in that “easy” credit is associated with higher

house prices and again this is heightened during boom periods.

       The one result, however that is different from the results reported in Table 4a for the

interest rate variable is that low inflation does not appear to have a heightened impact during

boom periods. Low inflation does have a significant and negative effect in normal times but the

interaction term where the boom dummy is interacted with the deviation of inflation from its

long-run trend is not significant. Our conjecture is that money growth and inflation have been

correlated in the past, for example during the 1960’s and 1970’s, and this is why the impact of

inflation in the money growth regressions is reduced.

       Overall though, the results reported in Table 4b does indicate that the impact of the three

variables is to increase house prices and this impact is heightened during the identified boom

periods. Again the results are reasonably consistent across the different specifications.

       Another reason why there might be differences between the two approaches is that some

of the bigger booms occurred in the late 1980s and early 1990s, in a period when the use of

interest rates became more prevalent than money growth rates as policy instruments for the

countries in our sample. This is obviously only speculation but does warrant further

investigation.

V.2 Real Stock Prices

Tables 5a and 5b repeat the analysis for real stock prices. The specification used in his regression

was to include one lag of the dependent variable and the current value and one lag of the three

control variables. The results for the case when the interest rate deviation is used as a measure of

the looseness of monetary policy are reported in Table 5a.

        For the “normal” periods, that is for periods that are not designated to be boom periods,

the interest rate deviation and the inflation deviation variables have significant coefficients. For

the interest rate deviation the results are mixed in that while the coefficient on the current value

of the interest rate deviation is negative and highly significant the coefficient on the first lag of

the interest rate deviation is equally large and positive. In fact the sum of the two estimates is

slightly positive. The same qualitative result also occurs for the inflation deviation but this time

the sum of the two estimates is negative. For the normal period, at least, “easy” credit does not

appear to be associated with increases in stock prices.

        As in the case of house prices there is evidence of non-linearity in the results in that there

are significant coefficients on the interaction terms. In fact, the coefficient on the lag of the

interest rate deviation is very negative and significant. Given that the regular coefficients on the

interest rate deviation “wash out”, there only appears to be a relationship between “loose”

monetary policy and higher stock prices during the identified boom periods. The initial impact of

the interest rate being one percentage point below the optimal rate is between 1.5% and 1.75%

on stock prices. This negative and significant result is not consistent across all specifications.

Once the current account variable is added the significance disappears but we must be careful to

point out that the data for the current account variable is limited and only goes back to the



                                                          43
1950’s. Because of these data limitations all the stock market booms before World War II are not

included in regression (3) or (4).

       For the inflation variable there is some evidence of an extra kick during the booms. The

impact is quite large – to the order of +2.5% in the case of regression (2) – but the significance is

marginal. As for the credit variable, except for regression (1), where the coefficient is significant

and positive for the interaction term, there is little evidence that “easy” credit has any impact on

stock price booms.

       Overall there is again evidence that “loose” monetary policy and low inflation acts to

boost stock prices and that this boost was heightened during the identified boom periods.

       Next we re-estimate our model using the other measure of monetary policy, namely the

deviation of the growth rate of M2 from the Friedman 3% rule. The results are reported in Table

5b. The results are qualitatively similar to the ones reported in Table 5a. The monetary variable

has inconsistent signs during “normal” periods but is large and, in this case, positive during the

boom periods. This again suggests a relationship between “loose” monetary policy and increases

in stock prices, especially during boom periods.

       Interestingly, just as in the house price regressions, the impact of low inflation is only

significant during the “normal” periods and there is no added “boost” during the boom periods.

What is different, however, is that credit is not significant and positive. As in the case with the

inflation variable this positive impact on prices from “easy” credit – a value of the loans to GDP

ratio that is above trend – is only evident during the “normal” periods. There is again no

heightened effect during the booms.




                                                 44
       This is an interesting result and one conjecture could be that the results when we use the

money growth variable is being driven by the early periods where it is more likely that there is a

strong relationship between credit conditions and the growth rate of money (see Schularick and

Taylor, 2012). It may be that the low inflation and credit story is more relevant during the latter

part of twentieth century than in the early part.

V.3 Real Commodity Prices

Tables 6a and 6b report our estimation results for real commodity prices. Because of the global

nature of the commodity price market in lieu of global monetary policy measures we use US data

in these regressions. This means that we are unable to use a panel for this estimation and so the

number of observations available to us for these regressions is quite small.

          As in the previous two subsections, the first set of results, reported in Table 6a, are for the

case where we use the interest rate deviation as a measure of monetary conditions. It was found

that one lag of the dependent variable and the current value and the first and second lag of the

three control variables are included in the regressions. The results in general are not as stable as

before.

          For the interest rate deviation there are mixed results for the “normal” period in that the

coefficient on the current period is significant and positive while the coefficient on the first lag is


                                                           46
negative and significant. Thus during normal periods the cumulative impact of a sustained

decrease in the interest rate below the Taylor-rule rate would have a positive but small impact

on commodity prices. However during the boom periods the impact of the interest rate deviation

is significant and negative. Again there appears to be a heightened impact on commodity prices

of “loose” monetary policy during boom periods.

                      There is some evidence that low inflation also has a positive impact on

commodity prices but there is no “boost” during the boom periods while there is no evidence that

“easy” credit has a positive impact on commodity prices.

V.4 Discussion

The results presented above do show that “loose” monetary policy – that is having an interest

rate below the target rate or having a growth rate of money above the target growth rate – does

positively impact asset prices and this correspondence is heightened during periods when asset

prices grew quickly and then subsequently suffered a significant correction. This result was

robust across multiple asset prices and different specifications and was present even when we
                                                       50
controlled for other alternative explanations such as low inflation or “easy” credit. The initial

impacts are relatively small, especially when you consider that the run up of asset prices in the

boom periods are almost all greater than 5% per year with some much higher than that.

         It should also be noted that in alternative specifications, not reported here for reasons of

brevity but available upon request, the result that “loose” monetary policy is associated with

increases in asset prices was found in different sub-periods of the data and when the first

difference of the variables was used instead of the deviations from trend. The size and

significance of the estimates were very similar across all specifications.

         We also found that low inflation and, to a lesser degree, “easy” credit are also associated

with increases in asset prices. There does not appear to be one variable that is associated with

increases in asset prices more than another. Whereas the monetary variable was consistently

important during the boom periods the other two controls were not always important. The initial

impacts were again quite small relative to the sizes of the overall price increases during the

booms.

         Before moving to our policy lessons that we draw from this exercise we must note the

limitations of the empirical exercise we undertook. The regression model that we estimated is not

a structural model and so we cannot draw any conclusions about causality from these results. In

fact we try very hard to only say that we found associations between asset prices and the three

control variables we use. The model, because of its a-theoretical nature, does not have any

explicit statement of the channel with which the three control variables impact asset prices. We

do find evidence of non-linear effects but that is as far as we go. We also do not model the

feedback of each of the three variables upon each other. This is obviously very important if we

were to try to contrast the magnitudes of the effects these three controls had on asset prices
                                                   51
during the identified boom periods. This last point is an important consideration and it is part of

our ongoing and future research on this topic.




VI. Policy Lessons

Our evidence that loose monetary policy (along with low inflation and credit expansion) does

contribute significantly to booms in house prices, stock prices and commodity prices leads to the

question about what central banks should do about it. Should they use their policy tools to target

housing prices, stock prices or commodity prices directly? Or should they give an important

weight to asset prices when setting their policy instruments as a possible contingency to depart

from their core low inflation (high employment) targets? This subject received considerable

attention during the tech boom of the late 1990s and again during the housing boom in the mid-

2000s (Bordo and Wheelock 2009). Since periods of explosive growth in asset prices have often

preceded financial crises and contractions in economic activity, some economists have argued

that by defusing asset price booms, monetary policy can limit the adverse impact of financial

instability on economic activity.

       The likelihood of a price collapse and subsequent macroeconomic decline might,

however, depend on why asset prices are rising in the first place. Many analysts believe that asset

booms do not pose a threat to economic activity or the outlook for inflation so long as they can

be justified by realistic prospects of future earnings growth in the case of stock prices or reflect

real fundamentals such as population growth in the case of housing booms or real side shocks or

changing conditions of supply like natural disasters or demand (like the growth of China) in the

case of commodity price booms.


                                                  52
           On the other hand, if rising stock prices reflect “irrational exuberance” or rising house

prices reflect a bubble, they may pose a threat to economic stability and justify a monetary policy

response to encourage market participants to revalue equities more realistically or to deter

speculation in real estate. In the case of commodity prices, to the extent a boom does not reflect

fundamentals then policy tightening could defuse the real effects of a sudden bust.

The traditional view holds that monetary policy should react to asset price movements only to

the extent that they provide information about future inflation. This view holds that monetary

policy will contribute to financial stability by maintaining stability of the price level (Bordo et al

2002,2003, Schwartz 1995), and that financial imbalances or crises should be dealt with

separately by regulatory or lender of last resort policies (Schwartz, 2002). Bernanke and Gertler

(1999, 2001) presented the traditional view in the context of a Taylor rule.

           Many economists do not accept the traditional view, at least not entirely. Smets (1997),

for example argued that monetary policy tightening is optimal in response to “irrational

exuberance’ in financial markets. Similarly, Cecchetti, et al (2000) contended that monetary

policy should react when asset prices become misaligned with fundamentals. Bernanke and

Gertler (2001) expressed doubts that policymakers can judge reliably whether asset prices are

being driven by ‘irrational exuberance”, or that an asset price collapse is imminent. Cecchetti

(2003) replied, however, that asset price misalignments are no more difficult to identify than

other components of the Taylor rule, such as potential output.16

           Bordo and Jeanne (2002a, 2002b) offered a different argument in support of a monetary

policy response to asset price booms. They argued that preemptive actions to defuse an asset

price boom can be regarded as insurance against the high cost of lost output should a bust occur.

They contended that policy makers should attempt to contain asset price misalignments when the

risk of a bust (or the consequences of a bust) are large, or when the cost of defusing a boom is

low in terms of foregone output. Bordo and Jeanne showed that a tension exists between these

two conditions. As investors become more exuberant, the risks associated with a reversal in

market sentiment increases, but leaning against the wind of investor optimism requires more

costly monetary actions. Thus the monetary authorities must evaluate both the probability of a

costly crisis and the extent to which they can reduce this probability.

        Since this earlier debate, where the warnings of Bordo and Jeanne and others were not

largely heeded, the housing bust of 2006 in the U.S. and the subsequent financial crisis and Great

Recession led many policy makers to decide that financial stability should be an important goal

of central banks along with low inflation (and overall macro stability). The new view argued that

central banks should be closely monitoring asset price developments and the state of the financial

system (including non-banks and banks) and be willing to use policy to defuse threatening

imbalances. This became known as the case for macro prudential regulation which promoted the

use of policy tools such as countercyclical capital requirements and liquidity ratios (Kashyap

Rajan and Stein 2008). This case, fostered by the BIS and many others, has led to important

changes in the central banking and financial regulatory landscape including the 2010 Dodd Frank

Bill in the U.S. which has given the Federal Reserve greatly expanded powers over the financial

system as a whole, and in the UK where the Bank of England has taken over some of the

responsibilities of the Financial Stability Authority.

        The question arises whether the new financial stability powers of central banks will work

to prevent the next crisis? Also whether the new impetus has gone too far in encroaching on the

traditional role of central banks to maintain price stability, act as lenders of last resort to the

                                                   54
banking system and protectors of the integrity of the payments system. The history of financial

regulation after big financial crises, e.g the Great Depression, suggests that often the government

overreacts and in the name of safety suppresses financial development and the price discovery

mechanism of financial markets. The regime of the 1930s to 1970s gave us financial stability at

the expense of unworkable firewalls between complementary financial functions (Glass-Steagall)

and price controls and ceilings like regulation Q in the U.S. and the prohibition of the payment of

interest on demand deposits. Similar regulations were put in place across the world. These

regulations and controls broke down in the face of the Great Inflation and financial market

arbitrage and financial innovation. In addition in this immediate post World War II period central

banks lost their independence to the fiscal authorities who had other, politically driven,

objectives in mind. It would not be surprising if that happened again.

       More fundamentally many of the recent institutional changes pose threats to the

independence of central banks and their ability to perform their core mission which is to

maintain the value of money (Bordo 2010, Svennson 2010). Central banks were also supposed to

act as lenders of last resort—providing emergency liquidity-- to the banking system. They were

not responsible for the solvency of banks or any other entities or the financing of government

deficits (except in wartime) (Bordo 2012). These issues pose challenges for the future of central

banking.
