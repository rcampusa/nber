                                           ABSTRACT

Research which explores unchartered waters has a high potential for major impact but also carries
a higher uncertainty of having impact. Such explorative research is often described as taking a
novel approach. This study examines the complex relationship between pursuing a novel
approach and impact. Viewing scientific research as a combinatorial process, we measure
novelty in science by examining whether a published paper makes first time ever combinations of
referenced journals, taking into account the difficulty of making such combinations. We apply
this newly developed measure of novelty to all Web of Science research articles published in
2001 across all scientific disciplines. We find that highly novel papers, defined to be those that
make more (distant) new combinations, deliver high gains to science: they are more likely to be a
top 1% highly cited paper in the long run, to inspire follow on highly cited research, and to be
cited in a broader set of disciplines. At the same time, novel research is also more risky, reflected
by a higher variance in its citation performance. In addition, we find that novel research is
significantly more highly cited in “foreign” fields but not in its “home” field. We also find strong
evidence of delayed recognition of novel papers and that novel papers are less likely to be top
cited when using a short time window. Finally, novel papers typically are published in journals
with a lower than expected Impact Factor. These findings suggest that science policy, in
particular funding decisions which rely on traditional bibliometric indicators based on short-term
direct citation counts and Journal Impact Factors, may be biased against “high risk/high gain”
novel research. The findings also caution against a mono-disciplinary approach in peer review to
assess the true value of novel research.

1. Introduction

Scientific breakthroughs advance the knowledge frontier. Research underpinning breakthroughs
often is driven by novel approaches. While research that takes a novel approach has a higher
potential for major impact, it also faces a higher level of uncertainty of impact. In addition, it
may take longer for novel research to have a major impact, either because of resistance from
incumbent scientific paradigms (Kuhn, 1962; Merton, 1973; Planck, 1950) or because of the
longer time required to incorporate the findings of novel research into follow-on research
(Garfield, 1980; Wyatt, 1975). The “high risk/high gain” nature of novel research makes it
particularly appropriate for public support (Arrow, 1962). Delayed recognition may, however,
lead novel research to be undervalued in research evaluations which use classic bibliometric
indicators based on short term citations.

This bias in classic bibliometric indicators against novel research, to the extent it exists, is of
concern given the increased reliance funding agencies and hiring institutions place on
bibliometric indicators to aid in decision making and performance evaluation (Butler, 2003;
Hicks, 2012; Hicks, Wouters, Waltman, de Rijcke, & Rafols, 2015; Martin, 2016; Monastersky,
2005). Such heavy reliance may explain in part the perception that funding agencies and their
expert panels are increasingly risk-averse and the charge that competitive selection procedures
encourage relatively safe projects, which exploit existing knowledge, at the expense of novel
projects, that explore untested approaches (Alberts, 2010; Azoulay, Graff Zivin, & Manso, 2011;
Kolata, 2009; NPR, 2013; Petsko, 2012; Walsh, 2013).

The goal of this paper is to develop a measure of novel research and compare the citation profile
of novel research with that of non-novel research as well as the Impact Factor of the journals in
which novel research is published. We are particularly interested in whether characteristics of
novel research match the “high risk/high gain” profile associated with breakthrough research and
whether bibliometric measures are biased against novel research. To this end, we define research
that draws on new combinations of knowledge components as novel and develop an ex ante
measure of combinatorial novelty at the paper level, where novelty is operationalized as making
new combinations in referenced journals. Utilizing this newly-minted measure of novelty, we
explore the complex relationship between novelty and citation impact, using the life-time citation

                                                   1
trajectories of 773,311 research articles across all scientific disciplines published in 2001 and
indexed in the Web of Science (WoS), as well as the profile of papers citing them.

We find novel papers to have a larger variance in their citation distribution and be more likely to
populate both the tail of high impact as well as the tail of low impact, reflecting their “high risk”
profile. At the same time, novel papers also display a “high gain” characteristic: They have a
much higher chance of being a top cited paper in the long run, a higher likelihood of stimulating
follow-on top cited research, and a broader impact transcending disciplinary boundaries and
reaching more scientific fields. We further scrutinize the impact profile of novel research and
uncover intriguing characteristics associated with novelty. First, we distinguish between impact
in “home” and “foreign” fields and find that novel papers are significantly more likely to be
highly cited in foreign fields but not in their home field. Second, an examination of time
dynamics in the citation accumulation process reveals delayed recognition for novel research.
Specifically, although novel papers are highly cited in the long run, they are less likely to be top
cited in the short run. We also find that novel papers are less likely to be published in high
Impact Factor journals. These findings suggest that over-reliance on standard bibliometric
metrics, in particular Journal Impact Factor and short-term citation counts, may bias against
novel research.

2. Combinatorial novelty in science

We view the process of research as one of puzzle solving, whereby researchers work with pieces
of knowledge and combine them to generate new scientific knowledge. Some of these existing
knowledge pieces are embedded in the literature, some in equipment and materials, which
themselves are embedded in the literature, and others in the tacit knowledge of individuals
engaged in the research. Using knowledge pieces in well-understood ways corresponds to a
search process labeled as exploitation. Using existing knowledge pieces in new ways
corresponds to an explorative search process, which is more likely to lead to major
breakthroughs but also comes with a substantial risk of no or low impact (March, 1991). From
this perspective, novel research is more closely associated with exploration.

Drawing on this combinatorial perspective of the research process, novelty can be defined as the
recombination of pre-existing knowledge components in an unprecedented fashion. This

                                                  2
combinatorial view of novelty has been embraced by scholars in various disciplines (Arthur,
2009; Burt, 2004; Mednick, 1962; Schumpeter, 1939; Simonton, 2004; Weitzman, 1998). For
example, Nelson and Winter (1982) state that “the creation of any sort of novelty in art, science
or practical life – consists to a substantial extent of a recombination of conceptual and physical
materials that were previously in existence.” Romer (1994) and Varian (2009) also argue that
new combinations of existing components provide a potentially huge source of important new
discoveries. The ability to make new combinations of existing knowledge pieces is one reason
that “outsiders” from other disciplines arguably can provide exceptional insights when they
move from one field to another, as physicist Leo Szilard did, when he switched from physics to
biology in the 1950s (Carroll, 2013, p. 352).

It is important to note that not all breakthroughs result from combinatorial novelty, and certainly
not all novel research leads to breakthroughs. It is also important to note that there is strong
anecdotal evidence that research of a novel nature not only has the potential to become a
breakthrough but also contributes to subsequent breakthroughs. The diagrams that Feynman
produced in the late 1940s provided physicists with an entirely new way of understanding the
behavior of subatomic particles and, according to the historian of physics David Kaiser, “have
revolutionized nearly every aspect of theoretical physics” (Kaiser, 2009, p. 4). The creation of
transgenic and knockout mice in the late 1980s revolutionized research on any number of
diseases. Or, consider the research of Sebastian Seung that has received considerable attention
and aims at mapping the human brain, something that no one to date has done (Cook, 2015).
Seung’s course is heavily influenced by applying a method described in a highly-cited paper
published in PloS BIOLOGY (Denk & Horstmann, 2004) that used a novel approach in human
connectome (cf infra).

The combinatorial view of novelty has been studied in the technological invention literature and
operationalized using patent information. Fleming (2001) takes the technology subclasses in
which patents are classified as representing the components of technological know-how.
Fleming (2007) looks at the occurrence of new combinations of subclasses to which a patent is
assigned and uses this as a measure of the generative creativity of inventors of the patent.
Verhoeven, Bakker, and Veugelers (2016) combine this combinatorial novelty measure with a
measure of novelty in technological and scientific knowledge origins, based on whether the focal

                                                  3
patent cites other technological inventions or scientific literature from areas that were never cited
before in its patent class. They find that the combination of the combinatorial novelty and the
novelty in knowledge origins is a powerful identifier of breakthrough inventions.

Uzzi, Mukherjee, Stringer, and Jones (2013) apply a conceptually similar approach to scientific
publications. They propose to trace the combinatorial process underlying the research from the
references of the published paper. Operationally, they view journals as bodies of knowledge
pieces and calculate the relative commonness for each pair of journals referenced by a paper.
For this individual paper, they then use the lowest 10th percentile commonness score of its series
of commonness scores as an indication of its “novelty” and the median commonness score as an
indication of its “conventionality.” They find that papers with both high novelty and
conventionality are more likely to become top cited. Lee, Walsh, and Wang (2015) adapt the
Uzzi et al. (2013) measure for their study of creativity in scientific teams and find that team
characteristics, i.e., size, and field and task variety, have different effects on novelty than on
impact of the publication produced by the team.

Other approaches to assess combinatorial novelty in science also exist in the literature.
Boudreau, Guinan, Lakhani, and Riedl (forthcoming), for example, identify whether a proposal
to the NIH departs from the existing literature, by examining all possible pairs of MeSH
(Medical Subject Headings) terms in the proposal and then calculating the fraction of the pairs
which have not appeared in all the previous literature in PubMed. They find that evaluators
systematically give lower scores to highly novel research proposals. Azoulay, Güler, Koçak,
Murciano-Goroff, and Anttila-Hughes (2012) measure the recombinative character of a
publication in a similar manner, examining the extent to which pairs of its MeSH descriptors are
unusual. Using this measure, they find a positive relationship between the recombinative nature
of a paper and the breadth of its citations but a negative relationship between the measure and
citation volume.

Following the combinatorial novelty approach, we assess the novelty of a research article by
examining the extent to which it makes novel combinations in prior knowledge components. In
operationalizing the combinatorial novelty approach, we follow Uzzi et al. (2013) and use
journals as bodies of knowledge components. Rather than looking at the atypicality of


                                                   4
referenced journal pairs as do Uzzi et al. (2013), we focus specifically on the novelty of
referenced journal pairs by examining whether a pair has never been made in prior publications
and is thus new. Furthermore, we take into account the knowledge distance between the newly-
combined journals based on their co-cited journal profiles, i.e., their common “friends”, to assess
the difficulty of making the new combination. More precisely, we measure the novelty of a
paper as the number of new journal pairs in its references weighted by the cosine similarity
between the newly-paired journals.

3. Measuring novelty of scientific publications

    3.1.Procedure

We construct our novelty indicator for research articles published in 2001 and indexed in the
Thomson Reuters Web of Science Core Collection (WoS), based on their references.

    •   For each paper, we retrieve all of its referenced journals and pair them up (i.e., J1-J2, J1-J3,
        J1-J4 …).
    •   We examine each journal pair to see whether it is new, i.e., has never appeared in prior
        literature starting from 1980 1.
    •   For those new journal pairs (e.g., J1-J2), we assess how easy it is to make this new
        combination, by investigating how many common “friends” the paired journals have.
        More precisely, we compare the co-citation profiles of the two journals (J1 and J2) in the
        preceding three years (between year t-3 and t-1).
            o We use the following matrix where each row or column provides the co-citation
                profile for a journal. The i,j-th element in this symmetric matrix is the number of
                times that Ji and Jj are co-cited, that is, the number of papers published between
                year t-3 and t-1 that cite the two journals together. For example, in the preceding
                three years, the pair J1 and J2 have never been cited together by any papers (as
                this pair is new), but J1 and J3 have been cited together by 3 papers, and J2 and J3

 The 1980 cut off is because of data-availability reasons. It assumes a window of 20 years before
obsolescence.

                                                   5
             have been cited together by 6 papers, making J3 a common friend of J1 and J2, as
             is journal J5.


                                      J1   J2     J3    J4    J5      …
                                J1    /    0      3     0     5       …
                                J2    0    /      6     2     3       …
                                J3    3    6      /     5     4       …
                                J4    0    2      5     /     0       …
                                J5    5    3      4     0     /       …
                                …     …    …      …     …     …       /

        o The ease of combining J1 and J2 is then defined as the cosine similarity between
             their co-citation profiles:
                                                      𝐽1 ∙ 𝐽2
                                       𝐶𝑂𝑆1,2 =
                                                    ‖𝐽1 ‖‖𝐽2 ‖

             where J1 and J2 are row (or column) vectors. Cosine similarity is a classic
             measure of similarity between two vectors and is widely used in bibliometrics.
        o Correspondingly, the difficulty score of combining J1 and J2 is: 1 − COS1,2 .
•   For each paper, we construct a continuous measure of combinatorial novelty as the sum
    of the difficulty scores of making the new combinations. Papers without new
    combinations get 0 by definition.

                              𝑁𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑙𝑡𝑦 = �                            �1 − 𝐶𝑂𝑆𝑖,𝑗 �
                                                𝐽𝑖 −𝐽𝑗 𝑝𝑎𝑖𝑟 𝑖𝑠 𝑛𝑒𝑤

•   We also construct two alternative measures for robustness tests (details in Appendix III):
    the maximum novelty score which focuses exclusively on the novelty score of the most
    distant new journal pair and the weighted share of new journal pairs in all pairs, which is
    essentially a means of normalizing our novelty measure for the number of all journal
    pairs.
•   In addition, to avoid trivial combinations, we focus only on the most important journal
    combinations, i.e., we exclude 50 percent of the least cited journals (as measured in the
    preceding three years). To further reduce the likelihood of picking up trivial
    combinations, we impose as a condition that the new combination must be reused at least



                                                   6
       once in the next three years. We check the robustness of the main results to these choices
       in Appendix III.

   3.2.Illustration

We use the paper coauthored by Denk and Horstmann (2004), “Serial Block-Face Scanning
Electron Microscopy to Reconstruct Three-Dimensional Tissue Nanostructure” published in
PLOS Biology to illustrate and validate our novelty measure.

Denk’s team developed a method called Serial Block-Face Scanning Electron Microscopy
(SBFSEM), which combines slicing and imaging by placing an ultra-microtome inside the
chamber of a scanning electron microscope. The microscope scans the surface of the tissue
block, and then the microtome shaves a thin slice off and exposes the next layer for a subsequent
round of imaging. The researchers made a new and effective combination between an
environmental scanning electron microscope and a special-designed ultra-microtome. While
both components already existed and were in use, the combination is new. This new
combination not only provides an automated method to collect serial images with sufficient
resolution to trace even the thinnest axons and to identify connections between individual
neurons but also overcomes many other problems. For example, it produces uninterrupted series
of aligned images without section loss, contamination, or distortion, which often arise from
manual sectioning and imaging. This work has opened the possibility of automatically
generating serial images for reconstructing the neural network. It has also revitalized the dream
of mapping the human brain and is contributing to the research of a number of scientists,
including that of Sebastian Seung, mentioned supra.

The PLOS Biology paper cites 19 WoS-indexed journals. Of all possible journal pairs (171), 9
journal pairs are new, using the procedure described supra. Each of these new journal pairs
involves an article from Nature Materials (subject categories: Chemistry, Physical; Materials
Science, Multidisciplinary; Physics, Applied; and Physics, Condensed Matter), which is
combined with articles from journals in subject categories of Neurosciences; Cell Biology; and
Physiology. The cosine similarity for each of the 9 combinations is extremely low, indicating
that each of the new combinations have few common friends and are therefore relatively difficult



                                                7
to make. This leads to an overall score on novelty of 8.9891 for the Denk and Horstmann paper,
which places the paper in the top 1% of novel papers in its field.

PLOS Biology (where the paper was published) had an Impact Factor of 13.868 in 2004, which
ranked it in the upper quartile (Q1) in both of its subject categories: Biology and Biochemistry &
Molecular Biology. The paper was not among the top 1% highly cited papers in the subject
category of Biology until 2012 and in the subject category of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology
until 2013. Papers citing it include several articles published in Nature and Science, some of
which are top cited papers. Appendix I describes the calculation of the novelty score for the
Denk and Horstmann paper in more details.

The Denk and Horstmann paper thus illustrates how research that is combinatorially novel has
reference pairs that are new.

4. Data and descriptive statistics

To explore the properties of novelty and its relationship with impact, we use a dataset consisting
of all research articles 2 in WoS published in 2001 from all the 251 subject categories. There are
773,311 articles in total, and 674,546 of them have at least two references to WoS journals.
Among these 674,546 articles, 203 have no subject category information and therefore are also
excluded, and 274,072 articles have more than one subject category (up to six subject categories)
and are counted multiple times. The final 2001 dataset used has 1,056,936 observations.

We expect our measure to identify only a small minority of papers as novel, since the majority of
research is of an exploitative rather than an exploratory nature. Indeed we find that relatively
few papers make new referenced journal combinations. To be more specific, 89% of all papers
in our sample make no new combinations of referenced journal and therefore do not score on the
novelty measure. Of the 11% that make new journal combinations, most (55%) make only one
new combination, and only 7% have more than 5 new combinations. Most of the novel papers
score only modestly on our distance-weighted novelty indicator. At the other end of the distance




2
 Since we are interested in original research, we keep only publications labeled as “article” in WoS but
exclude other document types such as “review” and “letter.”

                                                    8
distribution, we find the top 10 percentile to have a score on our distance weighted indicator in
the range of the interval (5-248).

                                           Insert Table 1 here

Overall, our measure of novelty displays a highly skewed phenomenon of novelty in scientific
publications. We are particularly interested in papers which are highly novel. Therefore, we
construct a categorical novelty variable NOV CAT: (1) non-novel, if a paper has no new journal
combinations, (2) moderately novel, if a paper makes at least one new combination but has a
novelty score lower than the top 1% of its subject category, and (3) highly novel, if a paper has a
novelty score among the top 1% of its subject category.

Highly novel papers not only make more but also more distant new combinations. The median
number of new combinations they make is 7, while the median for moderately novel papers is 1.
In addition, the new combinations that highly novel papers make are more distant, as suggested
by their lower cosine similarity scores compared with that of moderately novel papers (Table 1).

In addition, fields differ in their propensity to make new combinations. The Life Sciences score
relatively higher, especially Neurosciences, Pharmacology and Biology & Biochemistry. The
Physical Sciences score relatively low on novelty, especially Space Sciences and Physics. Social
Sciences, especially Psychology, score above most fields 3. Field difference in the novelty
intensity may be partly explained by their heterogeneous patterns of publishing and referencing.
In the econometric analysis we control for scientific field (i.e., WoS subject category) specific
effects.

5. Novelty and impact

    5.1.High risk of novel research

In view of the risky nature of novel research, we expect novel papers to have a higher variance in
their citation performance. Following Fleming (2001), the Generalized Negative Binomial



3
 By construction, there is no field differences in the relative share of highly novel (i.e., NOV CAT = 3)
papers: NOV CAT3 is defined as the top 1% novel papers within given subject categories.

                                                     9
(GNB) model is adopted to estimate the effects of novelty on the distribution characteristics of
received citations. Specifically, GNB assumes that the number of citations (i.e., the dependent
variable) follows a negative binomial distribution and allows us to model the natural logarithm of
the mean 𝜇 and the natural logarithm of the dispersion parameter 𝛼 each by a linear equation of
novelty and other control variables. The variance of the distribution is 𝜎 2 = 𝜇 + 𝛼𝜇2 . For
fitting the model the STATA function gnbreg is implemented (StataCorp, 2016).

We use a 14-year time window to count citations for our set of 2001 papers, which is deemed
sufficiently long across fields (Wang, 2013). We control for other confounding factors with
potential influence on the relationship between novelty and impact. First, we control for specific
scientific field effects (cf supra), by including the complete set of dummies for the 251 WoS
subject categories. Second, we control for the number of references made in the focal paper,
which might increase both the likelihood of having new combinations and the number of
received citations (Bornmann, Leydesdorff, & Wang, 2014; Lee et al., 2015) 4. Third, we take
into account the size and nature of the collaborative effort, which might affect both novelty and
impact (Adams, Black, Clemmons, & Stephan, 2005; Katz & Hicks, 1997; Lee et al., 2015;
Wang, Thijs, & Glänzel, 2015). Specifically, we include the number of authors and whether the
paper is internationally coauthored as additional controls.

GNB model estimates are reported in Table 2 and illustrated in Figure 1A. Compared with non-
novel papers, ceteris paribus, moderately novel papers receive on average 2.78% more citations,
and highly novel papers receive 12.04% more citations. At the same time, the higher average
impact of novel papers is accompanied by a higher dispersion in citation performance. This
holds however for only the highly novel papers. The dispersion of the citation distribution is
14.90% higher for highly novel papers than non-novel papers.

 Controlling for the number of references is particularly important, as our measure of novelty is not
expressed as a share of all references.

                                                    10
A higher dispersion in impact can be driven by more extreme successes and/or more cases of
uncited or rarely cited papers. Therefore, we examine in which tail of high and low impact the
highly novel papers are more likely to be. We do this using multinomial logistic regression
(Table 3). We classify papers, within the same WoS subject category and publication year, into
three citation classes based on their citations in the 14-year time window: the top 10%, the
lowest 10%, and the middle 80%. There is clear evidence that highly novel papers, which have a
higher dispersion in their citations, are more likely to be in the tail of high impact, specifically,
the odds of being the top 10% cited versus being the middle 80% cited are 16.80% higher for
highly novel than non-novel papers. There is equally strong evidence that highly novel papers
are more likely to be in the tail of least cited papers: the odds of being in the lowest 10% cited
versus being in the middle 80% cited are 16.76% higher for highly novel than non-novel papers.
In other words, the higher dispersion in citations for highly novel papers is driven by both tails of
high and low impact and therefore reflects their higher level of uncertainty. On the other hand,
moderately novel papers are only more likely to be in the top tail but not in the lower tail,
displaying a lower level of uncertainty compared with highly novel papers, in line with the GNB
results.

    5.2.High gain from novel research

While novel research faces a higher level of risk, we also expect, as argued supra, novel research
to have a higher probability of making a significant contribution to research. We first examine
whether novel papers are more likely to become “big hits,” i.e., receive an exceptionally large
number of citations, defined here, following the bibliometric convention, as being top 1% highly
cited in the same WoS subject category and publication year. Logistic regression controlling for
previously mentioned other potential confounding factors reveals that the odds of a big hit are
39.82% higher for highly novel papers and 11.22% higher for moderately novel papers,
compared with comparable non-novel papers (Table 4 column 1 and Figure 1B).

                                         Insert Table 4 here




                                                  11
Second, we find that novel papers are more likely to be cited by other big hits. Novel research is
therefore not only more likely to become a big hit itself but also more likely to stimulate follow-
on research which generates major impact. Specifically, we find that papers that cite novel
papers are more likely to themselves receive more citations, compared with papers citing non-
novel papers (Appendix II Table A3). Likewise, the probability of being cited by an article which
itself becomes a big hit is also higher for highly novel papers than for non-novel papers. We use
a logistic model to estimate the probability of a paper being cited by big hits, teasing out any
contamination from direct citations received, in addition to controlling for previously mentioned
other confounding factors. We observe that the odds of being cited by big hits are 26.20%
higher for a highly novel paper than for comparable non-novel papers receiving the same number
of citations (Table 4 column 2 and Figure 1C) 5. Compared with highly novel papers, moderately
novel papers demonstrate a much smaller advantage over non-novel papers. The odds of being
cited by big hits are 3.56% higher for a moderately novel paper than a comparable non-novel
paper.

    5.3.Transdisciplinary impact of novel research

We explore the breadth of impact, that is, whether novel research is cited across more scientific
fields than is non-novel research. We use the number of subject categories citing the focal paper
in the14 years after publication as the dependent variable and estimate a Poisson model. The
Poisson model additionally controls for the number of citations, given that papers with more
citations are more likely to be cited by more fields. Results show that, compared with non-novel
papers receiving the same number of citations and having the same values on all other control
variables, highly and moderately novel papers are cited by 16.56% and 10.05% more subject
categories, respectively (Table 4 column 3 and Figure 1D).




5
  In this analysis, big hits, which cite the focal paper, are identified as the top 1% highly cited papers in
the same subject category and publication year, based on their cumulative citations till the end of 2014.
Given that we do not have a sufficiently long time window to count citations for very recent papers, we
only account for big hits between 2001 and 2009 and accordingly test whether novel papers are more
likely to be cited by big hits in the 9-year period from 2001 to 2009. Correspondingly, we control for the
number of direct citations in the same 9-year period.

                                                     12
We examine whether the impact of a novel paper is more likely to be outside its own field than
within its own field. To this end, we partition a paper’s forward citations into two types: “home”
and “foreign” field citations, that is, citations received from subsequent publications that share at
least one common WoS subject category (home field citations) and citations from publication
that share no common WoS subject categories (foreign field citations). Then we calculate, for
each paper, the proportion of its citations that are foreign field citations. An OLS model (Table 4
column 4) shows that novel papers have a larger ratio of citations from foreign fields, suggesting
that novel research has a greater transdisciplinary impact than does non-novel research 6.

The broader and more transdisciplinary impact of novel research raises the question of whether
the major impact that novel papers generates is driven by their impact within and/or outside their
own field. To answer this question we examine separately whether novel papers are among the
top 1% highly cited in their home field and in foreign fields (Table 4 columns 5-6 and Figure
1E)7. We find that the odds of being top cited in home fields are not significantly larger for
highly novel papers than non-novel papers, and for moderately novel papers they are even 8.37%
lower compared with that of non-novel papers. The lower chance for novel papers to be highly
cited in their home field is consistent with resistance from existing paradigms against novel
approaches. At the same time, novel papers, compared with non-novel ones, have higher odds of
being highly cited in foreign fields. Although this holds for moderately novel papers, it
especially holds for highly novel papers, i.e., the odds of being highly cited in foreign fields are
29.39% and 62.37% higher for moderately and highly novel papers respectively, compared with
that of non-novel papers. The finding that the overall high impact of novel research is due to its
success in foreign fields rather than in its home field calls to mind the passage from Luke 4:24:
“Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in his own country.”




6
 The findings that novel papers has an impact which is broader and more transdisciplinary (i.e., are cited
by more fields and have a larger ratio of foreign field citations) are robust when we additionally control
for the number of WoS subject categories that the focal paper itself is affiliated with (Appendix II Table
A4).
7
  It is important to note that a paper being highly cited in foreign fields means that, compared with other
papers in the same WoS subject category and publication year, its number of citations from foreign fields
is among the top 1% highest. It does not mean that this paper is among the top 1% highly cited in a
specific foreign field compared with all other papers based on their citations in this specific field.

    5.4.Delayed recognition for novel research

The major impact of novel research may take longer to realize, for instance, because of
resistance from existing paradigms. To explore the extent to which delays in recognition occur,
we estimate the probabilities of being a top 1% highly cited paper for non-, moderately-, and
highly- novel papers for citation windows ranging from 1 to 14 years. We find that highly novel
papers are less likely to be top cited when using citation time windows shorter than 3 years
(Table 5, Figure 1F, and Figure 2A). As of the fourth year after publication, highly novel papers
are significantly more likely to be top cited, and their advantage over non-novel papers increases
with the length of the time window. Moderately novel papers suffer even more from delayed
recognition. They are less likely to be top cited when using citation windows shorter than 5
years, and they only have a significantly higher chance of being a big hit with windows of at
least 9 years.

                                         Insert Table 5 here

                                        Insert Figure 2 Here

The well-known fact that it takes longer for papers in one field to be cited in another field (Rinia,
Van Leeuwen, Bruins, Van Vuren, & Van Raan, 2002) raises the question of whether the finding
of delayed recognition for novel research is driven by their large share of citations that come
from foreign fields. We unravel the delayed recognition results further by comparing the time
profile in recognition separately for home and foreign fields. A number of interesting results
emerge.

First, the lower impact which novel papers face in their home field compared with non-novel
papers shrinks over time, showing that delayed recognition for novel papers exists in their home
field (Appendix II Table A5 and Figure 2B). More specifically, we find that highly novel papers,
compared with non-novel papers, are significantly less likely to be top cited in their home field
in the first five years, but this disadvantage disappears when using a longer window. Moderately
novel papers, however, are consistently, over time, significantly less likely to be top cited in their
home field compared with non-novel papers. Nevertheless, the gap with non-novel papers in the



                                                 14
probability of being top cited in the home field shrinks over time for moderately novel papers,
just as it does for highly-novel papers.

Second, the higher impact of novel papers in foreign fields compared with non-novel papers
magnifies over time, suggesting the delayed recognition for novel papers also exists in foreign
fields (Appendix II Table A6 and Figure 2C). We find that both moderately and highly novel
papers are more likely to be highly cited in foreign fields than non-novel papers, but this
advantage requires a citation time window of at least three and four years for highly and
moderately novel papers, respectively. Moreover, the foreign advantage of novel papers clearly
increases over time.

Third, as Appendix II Figure A1 shows, impact in foreign fields takes longer to materialize than
that in home fields. For all papers, regardless of novelty, the average number of annual citations
in foreign fields, compared with that of home fields, is smaller in the first seven years but greater
in later years. This implies that it takes time for larger success of novel papers in foreign fields
to compensate for their lack of advantage in their home fields. This is illustrated by Appendix II
Figure A2 which shows that it takes time for the advantage that novel papers enjoy in foreign
fields to cancel out any disadvantage they have in home fields. In sum, the overall delayed
recognition for novel papers is a composite effect consisting of a delayed recognition both in
home as well as in foreign fields and a delayed process in knowledge diffusion to other fields.

   5.5.Bias against novelty

The finding of delayed recognition for novel research bears direct implications on the use of
bibliometric indicators in science policy. As novel papers suffer from delayed recognition and
need a sufficiently long citation time window before reaching the status of big hit, standard
bibliometric indicators which use short citation time-windows (typically two or three years) are
biased against novelty.

In this section, we explore further how novel research performs on standard bibliometric
indicators, beyond the bias generated by short citation windows. Specifically, we examine the
Journal Impact Factor, probably the most commonly used and influential bibliometric indicator
for assessing the quality of journals and their articles. We investigate whether novel papers, with


                                                  15
their “high risk/high gain” nature, are more or less likely to be published in high Impact Factor
journals. We find that although novel papers are published on average in journals with higher
Impact Factors, compared with non-novel ones (Appendix II Table A2), the Poisson regression,
controlling for other confounding factors such as field differences, reveals that the Journal
Impact Factor of moderately- and highly-novel papers is significantly and substantially lower
(approximately 10.55% and 18.11% respectively) than comparable non-novel papers (Table 6
and Figure 3). This finding – that novel papers are published in journals with Impact Factors
below their potential – suggests that novel papers encounter obstacles in being accepted by
journals holding central positions in science. Moreover, the negative association between
novelty and Journal Impact Factor is not due to novel papers being more likely to be published in
new journals. Regression analyses which additionally control for journal age or whether the
journal is new confirms that novel papers are published in lower Impact Factor journals than
expected (Table 5). The increased pressure journals are under to boost their Impact Factor
(Martin, 2016) and the fact that the Journal Impact Factor is based on citations in the first two
years after publication 8 suggests that journals may strategically choose to not publish novel
papers which are less likely to be highly cited in the short run.

                                           Insert Table 6 here

                                           Insert Figure 3 here

Another question is whether the negative association between novelty and Journal Impact Factor
is responsible for the delayed recognition faced by novel research. To address this question, we
examine whether the novelty effect on the probability of big hits is contingent on the Journal
Impact Factor. If publication in a low Impact Factor journal is responsible for the delayed
recognition encountered by novel papers, we expect that novel papers which succeed in getting
in high Impact Factor journals would not suffer from delayed recognition. Therefore, we re-
estimate the models in Table 5, additionally controlling for the Journal Impact Factor and
incorporating interaction effects between novelty and whether the journal in which the focal
paper is published has a top 10% Impact Factor in its subject category. As shown in Appendix II


8
 Journal Impact factor is essentially the average number of citations received in the current year by
papers published in the preceding two years. http://wokinfo.com/essays/impact-factor/

Table A7 and Figure 4, novel papers published in high Impact Factor journals still have a
delayed citation accumulation process compared with non-novel papers in high Impact Factor
journals. We conclude that delayed recognition is not entirely due to publication of novel works
in journals with lower than expected Impact Factors.

   5.6.Novelty and quality

Our research demonstrates that standard bibliometric indicators, especially short-term citation
windows and the Journal Impact Factor, are biased against novel papers. One might argue that
such “bias” simply reflects the low quality associated with novel research. This raises the
potential issue concerning unobserved and uncontrolled heterogeneity in paper quality. If novel
research is associated with low quality, this would indeed explain the observation that novel
papers are less likely to be highly cited in the short run and are less likely to be published in high
Impact Factor journals, but it cannot explain why novel papers are more likely to eventually
become highly cited and be cited in broader fields. On the other hand, if novel research is
associated with high quality, then it would explain its long-term big impact but not its delayed
recognition, or its lower Journal Impact Factor, or the fact that novel papers which are published
in high Impact Factor journals still display a delayed recognition. Although we cannot
completely rule out the possible link between novelty and quality, due to the lack of a proper
measure for the true ex ante quality of a paper, the citation patterns of novel research that we find
in this paper suggest something different than a clear association between novelty and quality.
Therefore, we can at least conclude that novelty affects ex post impact in a non-trivial fashion
which is difficult to explain by ex ante quality.

   5.7.Robustness analysis

We ran a set of robustness tests on our findings. Details are reported in Appendix III. First, we
tested whether our findings are robust across scientific fields. All our findings are robust for
hard sciences and engineering, but several findings are not robust for social sciences and
humilities. Although this may suggest that our findings hold only for hard sciences, it is more
likely due to the insufficient coverage of WoS for humanities and social sciences (Hicks, 2004).


                                                    17
Second, we examined whether our findings are sensitive to variations of our novelty measure.
Our novelty measure is essentially a distance-weighted number of new combinations, and we
tested two alterative formulations, i.e., the maximum novelty score which focuses exclusively on
the novelty score of the most distant new journal pair and the weighted share of new journal
pairs in all pairs, which is essentially a means of normalizing our novelty measure for the
number of all journal pairs. Results are consistent when using these alterative formulas.

Our novelty measure excluded 50% of the least cited journals and required that the new
combination of journals is reused in the next three years. Relaxing these constrains yielded
robust results. Our results are also robust to additional constraints, such as excluding top 10%
highly cited journals and multidisciplinary journals.

We used categorical novelty measures in our regression analysis (i.e., highly-, moderately-, and
non-novel). We duplicated the results using the natural logarithm transformed continuous
novelty score in the regression and obtained robust results. We classified papers with the highest
1% novelty score as highly novel. Using alterative thresholds, i.e., top 0.1% and 5%, also
yielded consistent results.

Third, all our findings remain consistent and significant when we additionally control for the
Uzzi et al. (2013) measure of atypicality in the regressions. More importantly, compared with
Uzzi et al. (2013) measure of atypicality, our novelty measure behaves more reliably and
captures more the “high risk” nature of novel research.

6. Discussion

We propose that a way to measure the potential an article has to advance the knowledge frontier
is to examine the combinatorial novelty of its references. To this end, we apply a newly minted
measure of novelty to all WoS research articles published in 2001 across all scientific
disciplines. We find that novel papers, in particular highly novel papers, exhibit citation patterns
consistent with the “high risk/high gain” profile associated with breakthrough research. Novel
papers have a higher variance in citation performance than do non-novel papers, confirming their
risky profile. At the same time, novel papers are associated with big hits. They have a much
higher chance of being top 1% highly cited, and are more likely to lead to follow-up high impact


                                                 18
research. Novel papers also have a broader impact across scientific fields, and are more likely to
be highly cited in foreign fields compared with non-novel papers but not more likely to be highly
cited in their home fields. Furthermore, novel papers require a sufficient period of time before
their important contribution is recognized. This delayed recognition is suggestive of reluctance
from incumbent scientific paradigms to recognize novel approaches and the longer time period
needed to incorporate novel research into subsequent research. Part of the delayed recognition is
due to the time it takes for novel research to diffuse to other fields, where they have their greatest
impact.

Delayed recognition leads novel research to perform poorly on classic bibliometric measures
which use short citation windows. Novel research is also published in journals with lower than
expected Impact Factors, another classic bibliometric measure. Moreover, even if novel research
succeeds in being published in high impact factor journals, it still suffers from delayed
recognition.

Taken together, our results suggest that standard bibliometric measures are biased against novel
research and thus may fail to identify papers and individuals doing novel research. This bias
against novelty imperils scientific progress, because novel research, as we have shown, is much
more likely to become a big hit in the long run in fields outside its own, as well as to stimulate
follow-up big hits.

The bias against novelty is of particular concern given the increased reliance funding agencies
place on classic bibliometric indicators in making funding and evaluation decisions. The bias
against novel papers may also help explain why funding agencies which increasingly rely on
bibliometric measures are widely perceived as being more and more risk-averse, choosing “safe”
projects over those that involve a higher level of uncertainty with regard to possible outcomes.
In this respect, our research is consistent with that of Boudreau et al. (forthcoming) who find that
evaluators give lower scores to proposals that are highly novel where novelty is measured in
terms of the proposal’s use of novel combinations of MeSH terms relative to the underlying
literature.

The bias against novelty applies not only to funding decisions but to science policy more
generally. The prevailing use in various decisions (e.g., hiring and tenure of researchers) at

                                                 19
various levels (i.e., department, university, and national) of standard bibliometric indicators
which rely on short citation time windows and Journal Impact Factor is likely to disincentivize
novel research. We advocate the awareness of such potential bias and suggest, when relying on
bibliometric indicators, to use a wider portfolio of indicators and, when using standard measures,
time windows beyond two or three years.

In addition, the finding that novel papers are highly cited in foreign fields but not in their home
field highlights the importance of avoiding a monodisciplinary approach in peer review. Peer
review is widely implemented in science decision-making. It is typically organized along
disciplinary lines, with peers within the same discipline making a judgment on the value of the
research that is being evaluated. Studies of interdisciplinary research demonstrate that a
discipline-based science system is detrimental to the advancement and societal accountability of
science (Gibbons, 1994; The National Academies, 2004). This paper contributes to this
discussion, suggesting that peer review which is bounded by disciplinary boarders may fail to
recognize the full value of novel research which typically lies outside its own field.

Data consist of all WoS articles published in 2001 and are sourced from Thomson Reuters Web
of Science Core Collection. We classify papers, within the same WoS subject category and
publication year, into three classes based on their 14-year citations: low 10%, middle 80%, and
top 10%. For the multinomial logit regression, the middle 80% is used as the reference group.

Data consist of all WoS articles published in 2001 and are sourced from Thomson Reuters Web
of Science Core Collection. Top 1% cited (column 1) means being among the top 1% highly
cited within the same WoS subject category and publication year, based on the number of
citations in a 14-year time window between 2001 and 2014. Cited by big hit (column 2) means
cited by an article, which is published in between 2001 and 2009 and among the top 1% highly
cited articles within the same WoS subject category and publication year, based on their
cumulative citations up to 2014. Big hits published after 2009 are not analysed because their
available time windows are too short to identify big hits reliably. # citing fields (column 3) is the
number of WoS subject categories citing the focal paper. Ratio foreign field citations (column 4)
is the proportion of all citations that are from papers sharing no common WoS subject categories
with the focal cited paper. Top 1% cited home field (column 5) means being among the top 1%
highly cited within the same WoS subject category and publication year, based on 14-year
citation received from papers that share at least one common WoS subject category with the
focal cited paper. Top 1% cited foreign field (column 6) means being among the top 1% highly
cited within the same WoS subject category and publication year, based on 14-year citation
received from papers that share no common WoS subject category with the focal cited paper.

Each of these new journal pairs involves an article from Nature Materials (subject categories:
Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Physics, Applied; and Physics,
Condensed Matter), being combined with articles from journals in subject categories of
Neurosciences; Cell Biology; and Physiology. In the next step we calculate the cosine similarity
for each journal pair, based on their profile of co-cited journals in the preceding three years (i.e.,
2001-2003).

The co-citation matrix between all journals in the database is reported in the following table,
based on the co-citation information in the preceding three years, i.e., 2001-2003. One entry
represents the number of times that two corresponding journals are co-cited in the preceding
three years. For example, NATURE MATERIALS has not been cited together with CURRENT
OPINION IN NEUROBIOLOGY by any papers published between 2001 and 2003, but has been
cited together with SCIENCE by 331 papers.

Using the cosine similarity score, the ease of combining NATURE MATERIALS and CURRENT
OPINION IN NEUROBIOLOGY is:

                 J1 ∙ J2        ∑ J1,i × J2,i
    COS1,2 =              =
               ‖J1 ‖‖J2 ‖         2        2
                              �∑ J1,i × ∑ J2,i

                                          331 × 9691 + 110 × 0 + 0 × 9959 + ⋯
                    =
                        �(02 + 3312 + 1102 + 02 + ⋯ ) × (02 + 96912 + 02 + 99592 + ⋯ )
                    = 0.0008

Correspondingly, the difficulty of making this combination is: 1 − COS1,2 = 0.9992. We
calculate the difficulty of all the other journal combinations following the same procedure. At
the paper level, we sum up these difficulty scores and get a novelty measure, novelty = 8.9891,
which places the paper in the top 1% of novel papers in its field.

Data consist of all WoS articles published in 2001 and are sourced from Thomson Reuters Web
of Science Core Collection. # citing fields (column 1-3) is the number of WoS subject categories
citing the focal paper. Ratio foreign field citations (column 4-6) is the proportion of all citations
that are from papers sharing no common WoS subject categories with the focal cited paper. #
own fields is the number of WoS subject categories that the focal paper itself is affiliated with. #
own fields > 1 is a dummy variable, which takes 1 if the focal paper has more than 1 WoS
subject categories and 0 if only one subject category. Field (WoS subject category) fixed effects
incorporated. Robust standard errors in parentheses. *** p<.001, ** p<.01, * p<.05, + p<.10.

In summary, we find that novel papers have (1) a higher dispersion in citations, (2) a higher
chance of being a big hit in the long term, (3) a higher chance of being cited by big hits, (4) a
broader impact across scientific fields, (5) a larger share of citations from foreign fields, (6) not a
higher chance of being highly cited in home field, (7) a higher chance of being highly cited in
foreign field, (8) a lower chance of being a big hit in the short term, and (9) are published in
journals with lower Impact Factors. In this section we test the robustness of these nine findings.

III.1. Scientific field heterogeneity

Although we control for scientific field effects, and some of our measures for novelty (i.e.,
highly novel) and impact (e.g., big hits) are field specific, it is nevertheless possible that the
relationship between novelty and impact is field specific. To test this possibility, we examine
whether our main findings are robust across scientific fields, replicating the whole set of analyses
separately by field. We use four groups: AH (Arts and Humanities), LS (Life Sciences), PSE
(Physical Sciences and Engineering), and SS (Social Sciences). We also distinguish between
LS2 (Medicine) and the rest (LS1) within LS and distinguish between PSE2 (Computer
Sciences; Engineering) and the rest (PSE1) within PSE. Both LS2 and PSE2 are the more
applied counterparts of LS1 and PSE1. In total, we run separate regressions for the following
eight groups: AH, LS, LS1, LS2, PSE, PSE1, PSE2, and SS. While our findings are robust for
LS and PSE fields, they are less robust for AH and SS fields. Specifically, findings, (1) higher
dispersion, (8) fewer short-term big hits, and (9) lower JIF for novel papers, are not robust for
AH, and finding (1) higher dispersion is not robust for SS. This may suggest that the
relationship between novelty and impact varies across fields and our findings hold most
specifically for hard sciences and engineering. However, it may also be an artifact of data
limitations. The WoS coverage for humanities and social sciences is much smaller than hard
sciences, so we have much fewer observations for AH and SS than for the hard sciences. More
importantly, because of this coverage issue, using the WoS data does not capture sufficiently all
the publishing and referencing transactions in humanities and social sciences (Hicks, 2004),
which is required for constructing measures of novelty and impact.



                                                  44
III.2. Novelty measure variations

First, we test whether our findings hold when we use alternative formulas for our novelty
measure. As explained in section 3.1, our novelty measure is essentially the number of new
referenced journal pairs, weighted by the distance between the newly paired journals (i.e.,
weighted sum). Alternatively we can use the novelty score of the most distinct pair among all the
new pairs (i.e., max score) or the proportion of all journal pairs that are new, weighted by the
distance (i.e., weighted share).

The maximum novelty score,

                          𝑁𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑙𝑡𝑦max 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 =            max           �1 − 𝐶𝑂𝑆𝑖,𝑗 �
                                                 𝐽𝑖 −𝐽𝑗 𝑝𝑎𝑖𝑟 𝑖𝑠 𝑛𝑒𝑤



focuses exclusively on the novelty score of the most distant new journal pair instead of mixing
both the number and the difficulty of new journal pairs. We find using the max score approach
that all our findings hold, except finding 6, specifically, while max score CAT2 also has a
significantly negative effect on being highly cited in the home field, max score CAT3 has a small
but significantly (p = 0.09) positive effect. One possible explanation is that papers with a small
number of very distant new combinations but at same time a large number of conventional
combinations within the home field are likely to score high on the max score measure, and the
large number of home field combinations makes the paper more likely to be accepted by the
home field. For a further assessment we compare the size of the effect. Highly novel defined by
max score, compared with defined by weighted sum, has a larger effect on the likelihood of being
a long-term big hit (i.e., finding 2) but smaller effects for all other findings, i.e., all nine findings
except 2 and 6. We conclude that our weighted sum approach captures at least more of the “high
risk”, if not also the “high gain,” nature of novel research.

Because of the concern that our weighted sum measure of novelty might be over-dependent on
the number of references in the focal paper, which including the number of references in the
regression analysis may not sufficiently control for, we also inspect the weighted share approach,
which essentially normalizes our novelty measure for the number of journal pairs. It can also be




                                                   45
viewed as a reversed and weighted network density 9 measure with the number of missing ties
(i.e., new ties which did not exist in previous years, weighted by the distance) in the numerator
and the size of the network (i.e., the number of all journal pairs regardless new or not) in the
denominator. Specifically,

                                                     1
                        𝑁𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑙𝑡𝑦𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒 =        �                   �1 − 𝐶𝑂𝑆𝑖,𝑗 �
                                                     𝑛  𝐽𝑖 −𝐽𝑗 𝑝𝑎𝑖𝑟 𝑖𝑠 𝑛𝑒𝑤


where n is the number of all co-cited journal pairs. All findings hold using this weighted share
approach. In terms of the size of the effect, highly novel defined by weighted share, compared
with defined by weighted sum, has larger effects on finding 8 (i.e., fewer short-term big hits) and
on finding 9 (i.e., lower JIF) but smaller effects for all other findings. The weighted share
measure imposes a penalty on papers with a large number of referenced journals, in other words,
papers with a larger network of referenced journals. We believe that network size is also an
important aspect of combinatorial novelty and therefore should not be eliminated from the
analysis. Specifically, a larger network making the same number of new connections should not
be evaluated as less novel than a smaller network. Furthermore, the weighted share measure is
very sensitive when a paper has very limited number of referenced journals. Therefore, we
prefer our weight sum measure to the weighted share approach.

Second, our novelty indicator used in the analysis excluded the 50% least cited journals and
required reuse of the new combination in the next three years. To check the sensitivity of the
analysis to these choices, we replicate the analysis without these restrictions. In addition,
although most new journals are already excluded in the analysis because they are typically
among the lower cited journals, we also checked the results excluding new journals from the
calculation of novelty. Moreover, Boyack and Klavans (2014) warned that the atypicality
measure in Uzzi et al. (2013) is confounded with citing star journals, such as Science and
Nature. Our novelty measure is unlikely to be confounded with citing star journals, which are so
highly cited that combining them with any other journals is very unlikely to be new.
Nevertheless, we check results excluding the top 10% highly cited journals, as well as

    Network density is the proportion of all possible ties that are actually present in the network.

                                                        46
multidisciplinary journals. In summary, we test robustness of our findings using the following
variations of the novelty measure: (a) no restrictions, (b) only exclude the 50% least cited
journals, (c) only require reuse in 3 years, (d) only exclude new journals, (e) exclude the 50%
least cited journals, require reuse in 3 years, and exclude the 10% top cited journals, and (f)
exclude the 50% least cited journals, require reuse in 3 years, and exclude the 10% top cited and
multidisciplinary journals. Our findings are robust using all these alternative specifications.

Third, to accommodate the skewness of the indicator, we created three novelty categories. When
we duplicate the results using the natural logarithm transformed continuous novelty score in the
regression, all results are robust.

Fourth, we classified highly novel papers as the top 1% novel papers in the same subject
category. We also use different thresholds for the categorization, specifically, classifying the top
5% or 0.1% papers as highly novel. All results are robust, and the changes in effect size are
consistent with what we would expect from comparing the coefficients on highly and moderately
novel classes in our reported results. For example, compared with our reported results for
classifying the top 1% papers as highly novel, highly novel would have a larger effect on the
likelihood of big hits when classifying top 0.1% papers as highly novel but a smaller effect when
classifying top 5% papers as highly novel.

III.3. Novelty versus atypicality

We compare our novelty indicator with the Uzzi et al. (2013) measure of atypicality. For a
scientific publication, Uzzi et al. (2013) calculated the commonness score for all its referenced
journal pairs, where the commonness score is a z-score, (i.e. the number of observed co-citations
between the pair – the number of expected co-citations) / standard deviation of the co-citations)
and labelled the lowest 10th percentile of this series of commonness scores as their indicator of
novelty. To distinguish it from our measure of novelty, we label their indicator as atypicality.
Lee et al. (2015) used an adapted version in their study. Specifically, they used the ratio between
the number of observed co-citations and the number of expected co-citations as the commonness
score of a journal pair, instead of the z-score. In addition, they take the natural logarithm of the
commonness score and add a negative sign, obtaining a roughly normally distributed variable
positively associated with atypicality, while the commonness score is negatively associated with

                                                 47
atypicality. Here we follow this adapted version to calculate the Uzzi et al. (2013) indicator for
our sampled papers. To make the comparison, we categorize the continuous atypicality indicator
into three classes with the same proportion of papers in each of the three classes, specifically,
ATP CAT = 3 if top 1% in the same WoS subject category and publication year, 2 if below top
1% but above top 10%, and 1 for all others. In addition, we also compare the continuous
versions of both atypicality and our novelty scores. Specifically, we assess results of six sets of
regressions using the following independent variables: (a) novelty categories (NOV CAT), i.e.,
main results reported in the text, (b) atypicality categories (ATP CAT), (c) NOV CAT and ATP
CAT together, (d) novelty score, (e) atypicality score, (f) novelty and atypicality scores together.

We focus on two criteria for assessing the results: the size of the effect and the consistency of the
results across these six settings. When both categorical novelty and atypicality are in the
regression, i.e., in setting (c), all effects of novelty (i.e., NOV CAT2 and NOV CAT3 on findings
1-9) remain consistent. Atypicality classes, compared with novelty classes, have smaller and
insignificant effects on (1) higher dispersion and (8) fewer short-term big hits; smaller but
significant effect on (3) higher indirect impact; larger effect on (2) more long-term big hits and
(4) broader impact, (5) higher share of foreign field citations, (6) fewer big hits in home field,
and (7) more big hits in foreign field; and reversed effect on (9) low JIF 10. When having both
continuous novelty and atypicality scores in the regressions, i.e., in setting (f), again all the
effects of novelty remain consistent, while the atypicality score, compared with the novelty score,
has reversed but insignificant effect on (1) higher dispersion; reversed and significant effect on
(8) fewer short-term big hits and (9) lower JIF; smaller and insignificant effect on (6) fewer big
hits in home field; smaller and significant effect on (3) higher indirect impact; and larger effect
on (2) more long-term big hits, (4) broader impact, (5) higher share of foreign field citations, and
(7) more big hits in foreign field. Based on the comparison of effect size, it seems that our
novelty indicator better captures the “high risk” nature of novel research than does the atypicality
score. In terms of “high gain,” atypicalty better captures the higher direct impact and broader
impact, while novelty better captures the indirect impact of stimulating follow-on breakthroughs.




10
  Specifically, ATP CAT2 has a positive and significant effect, while ATP CAT3 has a positive but
insignificant effect on JIF.

                                                   48
In terms of consistency across these six settings, our novelty measure has considerably more
reliable and robust behavior than atypicality. While effects of our novelty measure are robust
across all six setting, the results of atypicality are not consistent across settings. For example,
ATP CAT3 has a significantly negative effect on short-term big hits, but atypicality score has a
significantly positive effect; atypicality has a significantly negative effect on JIF in setting (b)
but a positive effect in other settings; and atypicality has a significantly negative effect on big
hits in home field when treated alone in setting (e) but an insignificantly negative effect when
treated together with novelty in setting (f). Overall, we conclude that our novelty indicator
behaves more reliably, captures more the “high risk” nature of novel research, and measures
aspects of research not captured by the atypicality measure.
