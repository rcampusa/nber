                    Lessons on Monetary Policy from the 1980s



                                     ABSTRACT



     Monetary policy events in the United States during the 1980s have led to
important changes in thinking about monetary policy and in the actual conduct
of policy. The central event in this regard has been the collapse of
relationships connecting familiar money to both income and prices. The fastest
money growth since World War II, maintained for fully half a decade, occurred
in conjunction with the greatest post-war reduction in inflation. Inflation
predictions based on money growth during this period therefore failed
altogether to anticipate what many observers have regarded as the most
significant monetary policy success of the post-war period. Predictions based
on credit aggregates would have fared no better.

     Other important changes have resulted from the increased openness of the
U.S. economy and the U.S. financial markets. International considerations that
previously could have mattered in a policy context, but typically did not, have
reached macroeconomically meaningful magnitudes in the l980s.   The sharp
decline in U.S. competitiveness, following the rise in dollar exchange rates
early in the decade, powerfully affected U.S. nonfinancial economic
                                                                     activity.
The borrowing that the United States has done to finance the resulting trade
deficit has greatly enhanced the role of foreign investors in U.S. markets.
Exchange rates have therefore assumed new importance in the conduct of U.S.
monetary policy.

     Along with exchange rates, short-term interest rates have again emerged as
the principal focus of policy. Economic research would probably prove more
useful in a policy context if economists turned at least some of the efforts
they have devoted to trying to resurrect money-income and
                                                           money-price
relationships to analyzing how to conduct monetary policy without them.

     The half-decade running from mid 1982 to mid 1987 was a pretty good era

for U.S. monetary policy, as these things go. A sharp easing of policy,

beginning some time around midyear 1982, helped set in motion a recovery from

the most severe business downturn the United States had experienced since the

l930s -   -a   downturn that tight monetary policy earlier on had deliberately

brought about in order to slow the alarming acceleration of prices. The

recovery that ensued developed into a sustained expansion that continued

without interruption through the end of 1987, thereby setting a new record for

the longest recorded business expansion in U.S. peacetime experience. A fiscal

policy based on unprecedentedly large (and continually growing) structural

budget deficits was a major factor underlying this record-length expansion, but

at least monetary policy did not stand in the way. Just as importantly, the

severe 1981-82 recession served its intended purpose of substantially restoring

price stability, and even after five years of expansion inflation remained

modest by recent historical standards. At least as judged by these outcomes

for the standard objectives of macroeconomic policy, U.S. monetary policy was a

distinct success during these years.

     Economists hoping to say something useful about monetary policy have had a

tougher time. The quantitative relationships connecting income and price

movements to the growth of familiar monetary aggregates, including especially

the Ml measure of the money stock that had been the chief focus of monetary
                                        -2-

 policy during 1979-82, utterly fell apart during this period.1 Moreover, the

 collapse of these long-standing empirical regularities was riot merely a matter

 of larger than usual quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year variances around

 longer-run benchmarks that otherwise continued to be reliable. Double-digit Ml

 growth, sustained on average over fully five years, repeatedly led prominent

 economists who had relied on these relationships in the past to offer widely

publicized warnings of an immanent re-acceleration of prices. Yet the

 inflation rate fell dramatically, and then remained low. The presumption that

 "inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon" became progressively

less compelling as a substantive rather than merely tautological description of

the determination of prices.

     Economists who preferred to think about monetary policy in different terms

had no more success in fitting the major developments of this   period into some

alternative conceptual framework. Relationships connecting income and prices

to the monetary base, or to measures of credit, fell apart just as   visibly as

did those centered on Ml. Although real interest rates declined somewhat from

the record levels posted in 1981 and early 1982, they nevertheless   remained

historically high throughout the next five years. Yet the economy's rate of

growth in after-inflation dollars was about average for post-war business     cycle
expansions, and in this case the expansion continued on for five years without

even a single negative quarter.

     In the meanwhile, the rapidly changing structure of the United States'

international economic position brought importance of a whole new magnitude to

complications that most economists addressing questions about U.S.   monetary
policy had acknowledged often enough in the past, but nonetheless had usually

ignored in substance. The U.S. current account balance, which had
                                                                     frequently
                                           -3-

 changed sign since World War II but had always remained trivially small in

 comparison to the economy's size, suddenly became large enough to matter in a

 domestic macroeconomic context. The dollar exchange rate therefore emerged as

 a primary focus of U.S. macroeconomic policy. In addition, just within these

 few years the steady string of mounting current account deficits transformed

 the United States from the world's largest creditor country to the
                                                                      largest
debtor. The exchange rate therefore acquired a new importance in the U.S.

financial markets as well.

     In the eyes of many economists, the Federal Reserve System has been

steering without a rudder ever since it effectively abandoned its commitment to

monetary growth targets in 1982. The visible success of monetary policy during

the past half-decade is therefore all the more puzzling. In fact, over the

course of this period the Federal Reserve's conduct of monetary policy appears

to have centered ever more closely on controlling short-term interest rates.

Whether this development really means that U.S. monetary policy has now

returned to the conceptual basis of a quarter-century ago, when short-term

nominal interest rates (or their equivalent) were practically the only focus of

the policy process, remains unclear. At the very least, it raises the issue of

whether the blatant flaws that crippled this policy strategy in the past were

inherent and unavoidable. The other side of the same question is what will

happen if the Federal Reserve continues to pursue what is basically an interest

rate strategy, if and when inflation again becomes a major problem.



The 1979-82 Experiment and Its Aftermath

     The basic facts describing the conduct of U.S. monetary policy in recent

years are well known, although their interpretation has been the subject of
                                       -4-

much disagreement. In October 1979, the Federal Reserve System announced that

it was adopting a new policy strategy placing primary emphasis on reducing over

time the growth of the money stock. Further, to gain better control over money

growth the Federal Reserve would be implementing new operating procedures,

based in the first instance on the stock of nonborrowed reserves rather than

the federal funds rate or some other short-term interest rate. The bands

within which the federal funds rate would be free to fluctuate in the interval

between meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee were accordingly widened

by more than an order of magnitude. Several more narrowly technical measures,

designed in principle to enhance control over money growth, were also part of

the overall package.

     The immediate motivation underlying this dramatic move was the rapidly

deteriorating inflation situation, together with growing concerns about the

dollar exchange rate. The overall U.S. inflation rate, as measured by the GNP

deflator, had risen from a post-recession low of 6.4% in 1976 to 8.9% in 1979.

The comparable rise measured by consumer prices was from 4.8% to 13.3%, the

highest rate since 1946. At the same time, dollar exchange rates declined

between 1976 and 1979 by 16.4% on a trade-weighted basis (14.5% after

correcting for differential inflation). Especially once the OPEC cartel

announced yet another major hike in crude petroleum prices, fears of an

uncontrollable inflation spiral or a precipitous decline in the dollar, or

both, began to spread.

    Although the Federal Open Market Committee had at least mentioned money

growth targets in its formal policy directives ever since 1970, and had

formally reported money growth targets to Congress since 1975, in practice

there was little correspondence between the stated targets and actual money
                                       -5-

growth. Evidence from the 1970s shows that the Federal Reserve did

systematically adjust the federal funds rate in the direction required to

offset deviations of actual money growth from the targets, but that the

magnitude of these adjustments was far too small to be effective for plausible

estimates of the interest elasticity of money demand.2 Perhaps more

importantly, the Committee typically did not set the coming year's targets so

as to make up for past deviations, but instead let bygones be bygones and so

treated each year as independent of the past. As the years rolled on, the

difference between actual and targeted money growth was usually positive, and

the average difference was positive. As a result, the actual rate of Ml growth

gradually drifted upward, from 4.9% per annum during 1965-69 to 6.1% per annum

during 1970-74, and then 7.1% per annum during 1975-79 (although the fastest

growth for any year during this period, 8.4%, occurred during 1972).

     The effects of the new combination of policy strategy and policy tactics

implemented in October 1979 were immediately visible, and they continued to be

so for tho next several years, although in some aspects they ran counter to the

new policy's declared intent. At the most basic level, the Federal Reserve did

carry through on its commitment to contain, and then reduce, the growth rate of

the Ml money stock. The rate of Ml growth, measured from the fourth quarter of

one year to the fourth quarter of the next (the same basis used for officially

reporting money growth targets to Congress) had been 8.2% in 1978. The

"gradualist" objective of reducing the money growth rate by one percent each

year, until it reached a level consistent with price stability, would imply

targets of roughly 7% for 1979, 6% for 1980, 5% for 1981, and so on.3

Although Ml had grown at   9.0% per annum rate in the first three quarters of

1979, with the sharp policy shift in the final quarter the growth for 1979 as a
                                           -6-

whole was 7.9%. A continuation of the new policy delivered 7.3% Ml growth in

1980, and 5.1% in 1981 (see Figure 1). For this three-year period viewed as a

whole, the new policy did manage to achieve results roughly consistent with the

objective of reducing the money growth rate by one percent per year.

     Not surprisingly, delivering on this objective involved interest rates

that were both higher on average and also more volatile.4 Nominal interest

rates immediately rose to record highs, and then declined sharply as the

economy entered a recession and the Federal Reserve Board also imposed credit

controls as authorized by President Carter under the Credit Control Act of

1969. Nominal interest rates then rose to yet new record highs in 1981

after business began to recover and credit controls were no longer in effect.

Interest rates were high in real terms as well. The difference between the

three-month Treasury bill rate and the next quarter's inflation rate, which had

averaged close to zero during the post World War II period up until then,

fluctuated in the 4-8% per annum range throughout 1981 and 1982. Short-run

volatility of interest rates -     - month-to-month, day-to-day, and even within the

trading day --    increased   by what for most measures were large multiples.

     The most striking respect in which the results of the new monetary policy

did not correspond to its declared intent was that the short-run volatility of

money growth increased sharply too. The Federal Reserve's success in gradually

reducing the yearly Ml growth rate -- 8.2% in 1978, 7.9% in 1979, 7.3% in 1980,

5.1% in 1981 --   did   not carry over to the quarterly growth rate, which varied

in the immediate post-1979 period from a high of 21.1% per annum in l980:Q3 to

a low of minus 5.8% per annum in l980:Q2, nor to any finer time calibration.

The standard deviation of Ml growth from one quarter to the next jumped from

2.37% per annum during l970:Ql-1979:Q3 to 6.64% per annum during

l979:Q-4-l982:Q2 (although omitting the two back-to-back extreme quarters

during the 1980 credit control episode, the increase was only to 3.00% per

annum.) Although the Federal Reserve had never formally acknowledged any

commitment to stabilize money growth on a within-year basis, critics of

monetary policy, both at the time and subsequently, focused on this increase in

short-run volatility as casting doubt on the strength of the central bank's

commitment to money growth targets in a broader perspective.

     The monetary policy experiment that commenced in October 1979 ended almost

as abruptly as it had begun. By the summer of 1982 the slowdown in U.S.

business activity had developed into what was, by many measures, the most

severe recession since the great depression of the 193Os. Unemployed labor,

idle industrial capacity and business bankruptcies were all at post-war record

levels. At the same time, bank failures had also reached record levels, and

there were increasing signs of fragility throughout the financial structure.

In August 1982 an impasse over Mexico's ability to meet its dollar-denominated

external obligations called widespread attention for the first item to the debt

problems not just of Mexico but of developing countries throughout Latin

America and sub-Saharan Africa.

     Yet   the   demand for money balances continued to be strong. Following the

5.1% growth in 1981, the Federal Reserve had set a 2 1/2 - 5 1/2% target range

for Ml growth in 1982. The revised data now available show that actual Ml

growth was within this range (4.6% per annum) during the first half of 1982;

but the data available at that time showed Ml growth running consistently above

the stated target range, despite continuing high interest rates and contracting

real economic activity. In August the Federal Reserve allowed short-term

interest rates to drop by almost three percentage points notwithstanding the

emergence of still more rapid money growth. In October, within less than a
                                       -8-

week of the third anniversary of the announcement that had proclaimed the new

dedication to money growth targets, Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Voicker

publicly acknowledged that the Ml growth target was no longer in effect. With

a further speed-up in the fourth quarter, Ml growth for the year 1982 came to

8.6% -- above the target range, above the 1978 growth rate from which the

program of cutting back on money growth had originally begun, and even above

the post-war record growth rate set back in 1972.

     The experience of the next five years largely continued the course set in

the latter half of 1982. The yearly Ml growth rate was in double digits in

each of 1983, 1985 and 1986 (see again Figure 1). For the five-year span

ending at mid 1987, the average Ml growth was 10.8% per annum. Only in 1984

did actual money growth fall within the stated target range. In both 1983 and

1985 the Federal Reserve officially changed the target range at midyear, once

the difference between actual and targeted Ml growth became obvious. In 1986

the Federal Reserve suspended its Ml target range without setting a new one.

In 1987 the Federal Reserve simply set no target range for Ml growth at all.

     Throughout the post-1982 period the Federal Reserve's official

pronouncements continued to emphasize targets for broader monetary aggregates

in place of Ml, but it is not clear to what extent these measures genuinely

guided monetary policy. Actual M2 growth did fall within the stated target

range in every year between 1983 and 1986.6 Actual M3 growth exceeded the

stated target range in 1983 and 1984, but fell within it in 1985 and 1986. In

1987, until the October drop in stock prices, the Federal Reserve either

instigated or accepted (depending upon one's perspective) rising market

interest rates, and also raised the discount rate, despite the fact that both

M2 growth and M3 growth were falling short of the stated target range; and the

decline of market interest rates immediately after the stock market crash
                                              -9-

appeared to have little to do with money growth patterns in any direct way.

     By contrast, short-term nominal interest rates since 1982 have resumed the

smooth pattern characteristic of the pre-1979 era, thereby suggesting a renewed

role for interest rates -   - as   before -   - at   the center of the monetary

policymaking process. The standard deviation of the month-to-month change in

the three-month U.S. Treasury bill rate, for example, had risen from .42% per

annum between January 1970 and September 1979, to 1.54% per annum between

October 1979 and September 1982. It dropped back to .32% per annum between

October 1982 and June 1987. The standard deviation of the month-to-month

change in the federal funds rate rose from .50% to 1.92%, and then fell to

.38%, over the same three periods.

     Although some of this return to interest rate smoothness on a

month-to-month basis may simply have reflected the continuity of the business

expansion and the absence of a re-acceleration of prices during this period,

the pronounced stability of short-term interest rates over a substantial span

of time more likely indicates the return to a monetary policy approach based on

closely controlling interest rate movements. At the least, it presents a

strong contrast to the behavior that the Federal Reserve has accepted for the

monetary aggregates.



CollaDse of the Money-Income and Money-Price RelationshiDs

     What makes this unusual record of monetary policy actions look so

successful in retrospect is that the bizarre behavior of money growth in no way

corresponded to the behavior of income or prices. The familiar relationships

that had characterized prior experience simply disappeared.

     Instabilities in the money-income relationship -          - or,   in more

sophisticated forms, the money demand function -- had actually begun to become
                                       -10-

more pronounced as early as the mid l970s, and their appearance had already

spawned a substantial new body of empirical literature even before the new

monetary policy experiment had commenced in October l979. By 1980 the

Federal Reserve System had already adopted a whole new set of definitions of

the monetary aggregates, designed in part to overcome just such difficulties.

A survey paper bearing the suggestive title "The Search for a Stable Money

Demand Function: A Survey of the Post-1973 Literature," and including more

than eighty references, was already in print in the Journal of Economic

Literature before Paul Volcker acknowledged in October 1982 that the Federal

Reserve was suspending its Ml growth target.8

     As Figure 2 makes clear, however, the instability that generated so much

concern and research in the pre-1982 period was small stuff in comparison to

what followed. The figure plots the ratio of the Ml money stock to CUP for

each quarter since the start of the redefined Ml series in 1959:Ql.9 Through

the end of 1980, the Ml-to-CNP ratio displayed the familiar downward trend of

roughly 3% per annum that most students of the money-income relationship had

come to see as inevitable in the post-war period, with a standard deviation

around this trend of only .0044 (in comparison to a l980:Q4 value of .1466).

After 1980 the Ml-to CUP ratio not only experienced wider fluctuations but even

reversed course. A simple extrapolation of the 1959-80 trend implies a ratio

of .1007 by 1987:Q2 (the last quarter plotted). The actual value in l987:Q2

was .1686, different from the trend extrapolation by more than 15 times the

1959-80 standard deviation.

     Discussion of this phenomenon at the popular level has typically offered

as an explanation the fact that "velocity" has declined. Because the so-called

income velocity of money is nothing other than the ratio of GNP to money (the

reciprocal of the ratio plotted in Figure 2), however, such explanations are

completely empty of content. Given the definition of "velocity" in this

context, the fact that velocity declined is simply identical to the fact that

money grew rapidly while income did not. Saying that money growth outpaced

income growth because velocity declined is like saying that the sun rose

because it was morning.10

    The mere fact of instability in the simple money-income ratio need not, of

course, imply instability in more fully specified behavioral representations of

the money-income relationship. The impression that stands out on a first

glance at Figure 2 is representative of the results that researchers employing

a variety of statistical strategies have found, however. A standard

Goldfeld-type money demand function, estimated for quarterly data spanning

1952:Q3-1979:Q3, indicates a standard error of .42%. Extending the sample to

1986:Q4 raises the standard error to .61%. Deleting the earlier data, so that

the sample is 1974:Q2-1986:Q4, further raises the standard error to .84%.

Dynamic out-of-sample simulations of such equations deliver cumulative errors

with root mean squares in the range of 4-8% for different parts of the

post-1982 period, in comparison with 0.5-1.5% for different parts of the

pre-1974 period. Attempts to do better with alternative specifications have

met at best only very limited success.11

     The story is approximately the same for efforts to investigate the

money-income relationship from the perspective of determining income rather

than money. A "St. Louis" type equation relating nominal GNP to four-quarter

lags on both Ml and high-employment government expenditures, estimated in

logarithmic differences for quarterly data spanning 1960:Ql-l979:Q3, indicates

an adjusted coefficient of determination (R2) of .32. Extending the sample to

l986:Q4 reduces the 2 to .11. Deleting the earlier data, so that the sample

autogression methods testing for a significant role of money in "causing"

either nominal or real income, in the sense of accounting for income

fluctuations not already accounted for by prior fluctuations in income itself,

have produced results that are sufficiently varied to generate more skepticism

than confidence in any strong conclusion on the subject, either positive or

negative.12

     Finally, in considering the money-price relationship it is even necessary

to be on guard against results that are strongly statistically significant but

with the wrong sign to make any sense in economic terms. The double-digit

average growth rate maintained for five years following mid 1982 represents the

most rapid sustained money growth the United States has experienced since World

War II, yet these same years also saw the strongest sustained deceleration of

prices in the post-war period (see again Figure 1). Price inflation as

measured by the GNP deflator peaked at 9.7% in 1981 and declined in each of the

next five years, reaching 2.6% in 1986. The rate of increase of consumer

prices peaked at 13.3% in 1979 and declined in all but one of the next seven

years, reaching 1.1% in 1986. Given the role that high-variance observations

play in dominating results based on the least-squares methodology, as of the

late 1980s it is necessary to take care not to find results indicating that

faster money growth implies slower inflation.

     Two examples, both drawn from the same paper, readily illustrate the

pitfalls that confronted anyone who continued to rely closely on

straightforward money-income and money-price relationships during this period.

First, Figure 3 is an expansion, both backward in time and forward, of a figure

included in a 1984 paper by Milton Friedman in the American Economic

Review.13 The figure plots the respective annualized quarter-to-quarter

growth rates of GNP and, with a one-quarter lag, Ml. The figure covers

1960:Ql-1987:Q2 and distinguishes three time intervals. The middle one,

1979:Q4-1983:Q4, is identical to that plotted by Friedman. It spans the period

from the October 1979 inception of the new monetary policy experiment through

what was presumably the most recent observation available as of his time of

writing.

     After pointing out that the correlation between these two series during

1979:Q4-l983:Q4 was .46, or .71 after eliminating the two quarters affected by

the credit control episode, Friedman wrote, "Two things are notable about the

relation between money and income in these years: first, the lag is both

shorter on the average and less variable than in earlier years, second, the

relation is unusually close. I believe that both are a consequence of the

exceptionally large fluctuations in Ml growth. The effect was to enhance the

importance of the monetary changes relative to the numerous other factors

affecting nominal income and thereby to speed up and render more consistent the

reaction."

     Table 1 summarizes the record of the GNP-to-lagged-Ml growth correlation

and the variability of Ml growth for the three intervals shown in Figure 3.

Money growth on a quarter-to-quarter basis (as used by Friedman in his paper)

was certainly more variable during l979:Q4-l983:Q4 than it had been during the

prior two decades. The GNP-to-lagged-Ml correlation was not "unusually close"

during 1979:Q4-l983:Q4 compared to the past, however. The correlation of .45

computed over these eleven quarters (Friedman reported .46) is essentially

identical to that for the previous 79 quarters: Excluding 1980:Q2 and 1980:Q3

reduces the variability of money growth, but does not materially affect the

GNP-to-lagged money correlation. (Subsequent data revisions have reduced the

 .71 correlation reported by Friedman to .47 as shown in Table 1 --   identical   to

the correlation for the earlier period.)

     More importantly, what stands out in both Table 1 and Figure 3, is the

change that occurred after 1983. Although the variability of money growth

remained high, the positive GNP-to-lagged-Ml correlation disappeared entirely.

In its place is a small negative correlation.

     Table 2, focusing on the money-price relationship, is simply an updated

version of a table that Friedman presented in the same 1984 paper. The

horizontal line in each column indicates entries not included in the original

version.14 In describing the data shown above the two lines, Friedman wrote,

"The long-period evidence suggests that inflation has much inertia and that the

lag between money and inflation is of the order of two years. Table [2] shows

that this relation has held in recent years as well. There is a one-to-one

relation between movements in monetary growth, and in the GNP deflator two

years later over successive two-year periods since 1971 .   .   . The increased
rate of monetary growth in the 1981-83 biennium suggests that we have passed

the trough in inflation and that inflation will be decidedly higher from 1983

to 1985 than it was from 1981 to l983.l5

     As the below-the-line entries in Table 2 show, quite the opposite

happened. Growth of Ml during 1981:Q3-l983:Q3 was the fastest for any of the

six biennia in Friedman's sample, but inflation in 1983:Q3-1985:Q3 turned out

to be the lowest. Rapid money growth continued in l983:Q3-1985:Q3, but

inflation slowed still further in 1985:Q3-l987:Q3. The simple correlation

between the two time series shown, calculated for the first five observations

only, is .70. Calculated for all seven observations, the correlation is

minus .23.

]base, nor the total debt of domestic nonfinancial borrowers has displayed a

consistent relationship to nominal income growth or to inflation during this

period. On a quarter-to-quarter basis,        standard relationships like

                                                       these aggregates to movements of

income and interest rates, or St. Louis-type equations

showed pronounced deterioration for each of these aggregates.            (The largest

   for any of these St. Louis equations, estimated for quarterly data spanning

l970:Q3-l986:Q4, is .09.) On a longer-term basis, the average growth rate for
                                                               mid 1982 to mid 1987 was

in excess of any prior post-war experience; yet

substantially, and the average growth of nominal income was hardly

extraordinary. By mid 1987 the ratio of each aggregate to nominal GNP was
                                                                           pre-198O trend

 to imagine how anyone could have successfully predicted

 income or prices during this period on the basis of foreknowledge             of the path


 of any --   or,   for that matter, all --   of     these aggregates.

      The manifest failure of the credit aggregate to perform satisfactorily in

 this context perhaps merits a special comment.            I had earlier advocated the use

 of a broad credit aggregate in conjunction with one or more monetary

 aggregates, in formulating U.S. monetary policy, precisely on the ground that

 credit might provide some safeguard against false signals given by the monetary

 aggregates under conditions of instability affecting the public's demand for

 rnoney)6 Because credit is a measure of activity on the liability side of
                                                                         various measures

                                         -16-

of the non-bank public's assets, it seemed (and to me still seems) reasonable

to think that expanding the information base explicitly underlying the monetary

policy process, to encompass both money and credit measures, would provide

potentially useful diversification in the context of portfolio behavior that is

at best imperfectly understood, and inevitably subject to a multiplicity of

shocks. In addition, empirical investigations relying on a variety of

statistical methods indicated little basis for concluding that the total debt

of all domestic nonfinancial borrowers was any less (or any more) closely

related to movements of income or prices than was any of the standard monetary

             17
aggregates
     In the event, the movement of credit during the post-1982 period bore no

more relation to income or prices than did that of any of the monetary

aggregates. Worse still, the false signals provided by the growth of credit

were in the same direction as those provided by the growth of money. Figure 4

plots the credit-to-CNP ratio for the same sample for which Figure 2 shows the

M1-to-GNP ratio.18 After decades of trendless stability, the credit ratio

began an unprecedented climb in 1982 which has not stopped as       of the time of

writing. Moreover, disaggregated data show that essentially all categories of

 domestic nonfinancial borrowers -   - including   the federal government, state and

 local governments, individuals, and businesses -- have played major roles in

 this extraordinary surge of indebtedness.19 Anyone who had relied on prior

 credit-based relationships to predict the behavior of income or prices during

                                                                 those derived from
 this period would have made forecasts just as incorrect as

 money-based relationships. Anyone who had derived additional confidence in
                                                               both money and credit
 such predictions because the respective signals given by

 confirmed one another would have found that confidence misplaced.

     I have speculated elsewhere on the causes of the breakdown of the

relationship between credit and income in the 1980s.2° For purposes of the

monetary policy issues under discussion here, it is sufficient to say that

attempts to "fix up" this relationship in any simple way are likely to be no

more successful than such efforts directed at parallel relationships for the

monetary aggregates have been.



A Relationship That Did Hold Up

     In sharp contrast to the collapse of relationships connecting the ultimate

objectives of monetary policy to standard quantity measures of policy actions,

the long-standing relationship between the two most prominent macroeconomic

policy objectives -   - inflation and   unemployment - -   remained   intact during this

period. The point is of some interest because one of the principal supposed

merits widely claimed in favor of the use of publicly announced money growth

targets for monetary policy was a potential lessening of the real costs of

disinflation. The idea was that public knowledge of such targets would affect

expectations in such a way as to minimize (according to some models, to

eliminate altogether) the usual negative impact of disinflationary monetary

policy on employment, output, incomes, and profits.

     What this idea should have led one to predict about the real costs of the

major disinflation achieved in the United States in the 1980s is far from

clear. For almost three years beginning in October 1979, the Federal Reserve

did approximately carry through on its widely publicized intention to reduce

the yearly rate of money growth by one percent per year - -       that    is, as long as

everyone understood that "money" meant Ml. because the familiar claim that

most measures of money move roughly together over time turned out to be false,

however, anyone who watched M2 or M3 instead of Ml would have seen no evidence
                                             -18-

of monetary deceleration.21 Moreover, on a within-year basis even Ml growth

became not more regular but less after October 1979 (see again Table 1). After

mid 1982 there was no reason for anyone to find the Federal Reserve's

commitment to its stated money growth targets credible.

     Regardless of whether any part of the policy experience of the 1980s

constituted a good test for an effect of pre-announced money growth targets in

reducing the real costs of disinflation, it is clear that no such reduction

occurred. Ten years ago Arthur Okun surveyed a variety of econometric

estimates of these costs, none of which incorporated any expectations effects

due to reliance on pre-announced money growth targets.22 Okun's survey

indicated that the cost of each percentage point reduction in inflation

achieved by monetary policy would be between two and six "point-years" of

unemployment, with a median estimate of three point-years.23 Table 3 shows

the annual rate of change of the GNP deflator and the annual average

unemployment rate beginning in 1978.         The table also shows, for years

beginning in 1980, the cumulative excess of the unemployment rate above 6% (the

approximate average for the two prior years, and a standard "full employment"

benchmark).

     The slowing of inflation from nearly 10% per annum in 1980-81 to roughly

3% per annum a half-decade later required approximately 14 point-years of

unemployment -   - right   at the lower end of the range implied by the econometric

models Okun surveyed. Especially in light of the evidence suggesting that

something like a third (and perhaps as much as a half) of this disinflation was

a product of the 74% appreciation of the dollar's trade-weighted exchange rate

between 1980 and early 1985 -     - an   appreciation which has been almost entirely

reversed as of the time of writing - -      this    result seems fully consistent with

Okun's prediction.24

     Everyone had always known    that   sufficiently tight monetary policy,

maintained for a sufficiently long time, could halt even the most deeply rooted

inflation. The reluctance to proceed in that fashion lay not in disbelief that

such a policy would do its job, but in concern for the resulting real costs.

What was new beginning in October 1979 was the willingness to bear those Costs.



International Complications

     The   United   States is not a small open economy. U.S. production and U.S.

incomes bulk sufficiently large in comparison to the combined economic scale of

all countries participating in the current free international trading system

that independent forces originating in this country can and do affect economic

conditions on a world-wide basis. The U.S. financial markets bulk sufficiently

large in comparison to world capital markets to exert analogous effects.

     The United States is an open economy, however, and the increasing

practical importance of this fact is perhaps the most interesting single

development of the 1980s from a monetary policy perspective. There are at

least two major aspects of the U.S. economy's openness that now matter, far

more than earlier on, for purposes of monetary policy. The more

straightforward of the two is simply the demonstrated ability of U.S. exports

and U.S. imports to differ by a margin large enough to affect the economy's

aggregate-level output and growth.

      The possibility of such an outcome had always been present, of course; but

throughout the post-war era, until the 1980s, the U.S. current account was

always approximately in balance over periods long enough to even out the ups

and downs of the business cycle. The current account was in surplus, albeit by

 less than $1 billion per annum (0.2% of CNP), on average during the l9SOs. In

 the l96Os the average annual surplus was $3 billion (0.4% of GNP). In the
                                           -20-

1970s the current account was in deficit on average, but by less than

$1 billion per year (not even 0.1% of GNP). In 1980 there was a $2 billion

surplus, compared to overall GNP of $2.7 trillion. It is little wonder that

many analysts of U.S. monetary policy during these decades practically ignored

potential effects on real economic activity via exchange rate channels.

     The 1980s have been starkly different. With a 74% appreciation of the

dollar on a trade-weighted basis between yearend 1980 and early 1985 (64% after

allowing for differential inflation rates), together with a host of other

factors that may have further compounded the problem, the ability of many U.S.

industries to compete in world markets all but collapsed. By 1986 the current

account deficit was $141 billion, or 3.3% of GNP. On an overall basis,

including the trade balance, real GNP in 1986 was up over the 1980 level by

16.5%. Excluding the trade balance --       that   is, focusing on domestic absorption

rather than production --      the increase over the six years was 23.3%. Not
surprisingly, exchange rate effects on export and import flows have now emerged

as a genuine focus of monetary policy concern, not just a subject for

obligatory mention.

     The more complex aspect of the newly enhanced importance of the U.S.

economy's openness from a monetary policy perspective is an outgrowth of the

first. A current account deficit means that a country is borrowing from abroad

to finance the excess of its imports over its exports (where both are broadly

defined) - -   or,   equivalently, to finance the excess of its domestic investment

and government deficit over its domestic saving. Since 1980 U.S. fiscal policy

has delivered an unbroken string of unprecedentedly large federal government

budget deficits, notwithstanding five years of business expansion beginning in

1983. At the same time, domestic saving has been below average despite the

introduction of a variety of supposed saving incentives. As a result, the
                                      -21-

United States has been borrowing from abroad in record volume even though the

share of GNP devoted to net investment in both business and residential capital

has been unusually small. Especially since 1984, the United States has

borrowed from abroad on a larger scale in relation to the economy's size than

the country did at any of the four peak periods of reliance on foreign capital

to finance its canals, then its railroads, then its steel and other industries,

and then its public utilities, during the nineteenth century.25

     This massive borrowing from abroad transformed the United States from the

world's largest creditor country to its largest debtor in just four years. The

U.S. net foreign asset position peaked at $141 billion at yearend 1981. It was

still $136 billion as of yearend 1982. The United States officially became a

net debtor again (for the first time since before World War I) in early 1985.

By yearend 1986 the U.S. net foreign debt was $265 billion -   - more than that of

Mexico, Brazil and Argentina combined.26 On a gross basis (that is, without

any balancing of U.S. holdings abroad) foreign holdings in the United States as

of yearend 1986 came to $1.3 trillion, including such readily liquefiable

assets as $267 billion of U.S. Treasury securities, $149 billion of corporate

bonds and other debt securities, $167 of corporate equities, and $477 billion

of bank deposits.27

     As a result of this surge in foreign holdings during the 198Os, foreign

investors have assumed an importance in the U.S. financial markets that was

previously unknown in modern times. Whether or not foreign investors will bid

in volume on any given day's auction of U.S. Treasury securities is now often

the paramount focus of atte'tion among participants not just in the U.S. bond

market but in the stock market too. Popular discussions frequently raise the

fear that foreign investors might decide to "get out" of dollar holdings, with

disastrous consequences for the dollar exchange rate as well as for the prices
                                      -22-

of dollar denominated securities. The notion that foreign investors in the

aggregate can sell their dollar holdings to anyone but each other is mistaken,

of course, but their attempts to do so can move both exchange rates and

securities prices. In particular, given the size of foreign holdings, a

widespread move to liquidate bond and equity portfolios as a preliminary to

selling dollars (even if only to other foreign buyers) could easily move

securities prices by a substantial margin. As a result, managing dollar

exchange rates so as to prevent such occurrences has added a whole new

dimension of U.S. monetary policy.

     The contrast between the rigid hands-off attitude toward the foreign

exchange markets that the Reagan administration espoused during its first four

years in office, and the series of ad hoc international agreements that it has

orchestrated beginning with the widely publicized meeting at New York's Plaza

Hotel in September 1985, is just the most visible part of the increased

importance of the exchange rate for the United States. Although there is

little hard evidence as yet, it appears that the change has affected U.S.

monetary policy in more ongoing, and more subtle, ways as well. For example,

even at the simplest level it is no longer so obvious that an open market

purchase which lowers short-term interest rates will necessarily lower

long-term interest rates as well. If dollar exchange rates fall as a result of

lower U.S. short-term rates, foreign investors may sell their long-term U.S.

assets as a preliminary to reducing (again, not collectively) their overall

dollar holdings, and domestic market participants may seek to do the same in

anticipation of the action by foreign investors.28

     If the net result of these developments amounts to an erosion of

sovereignty over U.S. monetary policy, that loss is no more than the inevitable

price of becoming a debtor country -- and the world's largest, at that. Losing
                                           -23-

control over one's affairs is part of what a mounting debt level is all about,

no less for a borrowing nation than for business or individual borrowers.          The

policy actions and public discussions that ensued after the October 1987 stock

market crash dramatically illustrated the tension that can arise under such

circumstances between a monetary policy designed to support the currency and a

monetary policy designed to prop up the domestic economy. At least thus far

the United States' situation in this regard is not yet so constraining as, for

example, Britain's was during the l95Os and 1960s, when repeated ad hoc

concessions were necessary to avert the eruption of a "sterling crisis." Even

so, the problem of formulating and implementing U.S. monetary policy is now

more complicated by one more dimension.



Vacuum at the Center?

     It is difficult to escape the conclusion that there is now a conceptual

vacuum at the center of the U.S. monetary policymaking process. The seemingly

endless quest from various quarters to impose some kind of simple rule on the

conduct of monetary policy is, at least for now, no longer a going concern.

The interactions among money, income and prices during the 1980s -       - including
the half-decade that followed the monetary targets experiment, even more than

what happened during 1979-82 -   - have   undermined it both intellectually and

practically. The claim that reliance on some kind of simple rule would open

the way to costless disinflation is at best unproven, and for practical

purposes dubious. The notion that some kind of simple rule would adequately

encompass the new complications due to the increased practical importance of

the U.S. economy's openness is dubious at best. In retrospect, the

contemptuous dismissal by some economists of the Federal Reserve's reluctance

to adopt the monetary policy rules they had proposed -     - and   the readily voiced
                                       -24-

assumption that that reluctance could have stemmed only from ignorance or a

faulty set of objectives on the part of Federal Reserve officials, or perhaps

even their self-aggrandizement at the public expense - -   stands   as a sorry

reminder that economists outside government can also make each of these errors.

     The most powerful element of what has happened in this regard in the l980s

is the collapse of the longer-run relationship between money on the one side

and income and prices on the other. In this decade the main event has been

very different from the quarter-to-quarter or even year-to-year irregularity

that was always the focus of debate about whether these relationships were

stable before. Proponents of simple monetary policy rules in the past could

and did claim that such rules failed to offset short-run economic fluctuations

that policy could probably not hope to eliminate anyway, but that over longer

horizons the anchor they provided would keep the economy on a steadier course

than an alternative policy that attempted to achieve "fine tuning." With

nominal GNP by mid 1987 more than 40% below the value implied by the long-run

relationship to Ml which prevailed during 1959-80, the problem is no longer in

the fine tuning but in the anchor itself.

     The relevant issue here for policy purposes is not whether for any time

interval there exists some abstract notion of "money" that conceptually bears a

stable and reliable relation to income and prices, and that statisticians can

seek to uncover after that interval ends, but whether policymakers can identify

and measure that quantity substantially in advance of their need to base

planing and operating decisions on it. Appeals to the tradition of the

"quantity theory" are of no use in this context in the absence of a clear

statement of what is the quantity and what is the theory. Especially       in a

world of institutions that increasingly blur the distinction between

transactions balances and saving balances, being precise about either the
                                           -25-

theory or the quantity is ever more difficult. The continuing (indeed

increasing) interest within the economics profession in some kind of

Constitutional constraint on monetary policy jars harshly against the

likelihood of what such constraints suggested (but not enacted) in years past

would have meant in the 1980s.

     Nor is the problem merely one of money (or credit) "targets." The more

flexible idea that such variables as money and credit, which are endogamous to

the monetary policy process in the short run, should be used as "information

variables" to guide the initial setting and ultimate readjustment of whatever

genuinely exogenous instrument the central bank is using, has always seemed

high attractive -   - at   least to me. The information-variable approach to

monetary policy makes no sense, however, in the absence of a reasonably compact

set of variables that reliable provide information about the macroeconomic

outcomes monetary policy is seeking to affect. After the experience of the

1980s, it is difficult to foresee any ready consensus on what that compact set

of variables should be. Subsequent experience may provide a new basis for such

a consensus, and new data to substantiate it; but that prospect remains a

matter for the future, if not later still.

     In the meanwhile, the Federal Reserve System has not ceased operations.

Nor should it be inclined to do so, in light of the performance of both income

and prices during the past half-decade. Five years of fairly steady economic

growth, with inflation consistently lower than at any time since before the

Viet Nam War, represents no small achievement by today's standards. In the

world of practical affairs, it is difficult to argue with success.

     Notwithstanding the Federal Reserve's continuing formulation of money

growth targets that it reports to Congress, as current law requires, and even

notwithstanding the relatively high success rate in meeting the target for M2,
                                      -26-

it seems clear enough that the Federal Reserve System since mid 1982 has

centered its monetary policy actions primarily around controlling short-term

nominal interest races.29 In so doing, Federal Reserve decision makers have

no doubt taken account of the movements of money (and perhaps credit, too); but

they have also taken account of many other potential information sources,

including longer-term asset prices and yields, dollar exchange rates, and

numerous aspects of nonfinancial economic activity. More to the point, they

have apparently proceeded in the absence of any well articulated conceptual

framework linking the interest rate as the chief policy instrument to the main

macroeconomic policy objectives, or linking the associated large and diverse

information base to either the policy instrument or the policy objectives.

Although procedures differ in various details, the overall approach is strongly

reminiscent of the practice of the l950s and l960s.3°

     It is therefore useful to ask why the policy approach followed at that

time failed. The voluminous investigation of this question, both at the time

and subsequently, supported three general conclusions: First, Federal Reserve

officials systematically confused the level of interest rates as the instrument

of monetary policy with the level of interest rates as an ultimate objective of

monetary policy. As a result, they usually delayed too long before raising or

lowering interest rate levels, and even then made changes of insufficient

magnitude. Second, with no nominal quantity at the center of the policy

process, the overall approach lacked an anchor to provide price stability.

Although inflation was not therefore inevitable, there was little protection

against it when various inflationary pressures arose. Third, once inflation

did emerge, Federal Reserve officials (and many other people too) often failed

to distinguish nominal from real interest rates. As a result, they often

associated higher observed interest rates with a tighter policy stance even
                                       -27-

when the increase in nominal interest rates merely kept pace with, or even fell

short of, rising inflation expectations.

     Are these three flaws inherent in the approach to monetary policy that the

Federal Reserve System followed a quarter-century ago, and that it has

apparently been following again since mid 1982? Or is it possible to design

and implement monetary policy along these lines, albeit in a way that has

learned from the still relatively recent past? Were the familiar failures of

monetary policy under this approach in the past inevitable? Or does the

experience of the last half-decade show that this kind of monetary policy can

work, and work well? Research on these questions may be the best contribution

economists concerned with U.S. monetary policy can now make.

    1. The Ml money stock consists of currency, checkable deposits (including
        both non-interest-bearing demand deposits and interest-bearing NOW
        accounts) and travelers checks; its value as of June 1987 was $747
        billion. 42 consists of Ml plus a much larger quantity of savings-type
        accounts, including ordinary passbook accounts and certificates of deposit
        (in amounts up to $100,000), money market deposit accounts and money
        market mutual funds (both of which can have limited checking facilities),
        and overnight repurchase agreements and Eurodollars; its June 1987 value
        was $2.8 trillion. M3 consists of M2 plus institutionally oriented
        instruments like certificates of deposit in amounts over $100,000 and
        money market mutual funds used by institutional investors, as well as
        repurchase agreements and Eurodollars extending beyond overnight; its June
        1987 value was $3.6 trillion.

    2. See, for example, De Rosa and Stern (1977) and Lombra and Moran (1980).

    3. The official Ml target range for 1979 was 5-8%.

    4. Increased short-run volatility of short-term interest rates, as a result
        of no longer accommodating temporary disturbances affecting money demand,
        is a straightforward implication of Poole's (1970) analysis of the money
        growth target strategy for monetary policy. Whether long-term interest
        rates should be expected to be more or less volatile is a more complicated
        question, however, involving changing risk factors and expectations of
        future inflation and interest rates.

    5. The 1969 legislation under which the Board acted was quite far reaching,
        empowering the Federal Reserve Board, whenever explicitly authorized by
        the President, to "prohibit or limit any extensions of credit under any
        circumstances the Board deems appropriate." In 1980 the Board proceeded
        under this authority to impose special reserve-type requirements on
        increases in certain kinds of consumer credit by all lenders (including
        non-banks), on increases in deposits at money market mutual
                                                                    funds, and on
        increases in non-deposit liabilities at banks that were not members of the
        Federal Reserve System.
                                                                         of the
    6. In 1983 the stated target range for M2 growth covered only part
           year.

    7. The standard reference to state first is the contrast between the findings
        in Goldfeld (1973) and Goldfeld (1976). The most widely read studies done
        at the time by the Federal Reserve's own staff include Enzler et al.
        (1976), Porter et al. (1979), and Simpson and Porter (1980).
 8. Judd and Scadding (1982).

 9. The series plotted is the ratio of Ml, as a quarterly average of monthly
     data (source: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) to
     quarterly GNP at annual rates (source: U.S. Department of Commerce).
     Both series are seasonally adjusted.

10. I owe the analogy to William Bennett.

11, The specific results cited here are from Goldfeld (forthcoming), which
     also provides an extensive survey. Roley (1985) also showed the results
     of experimenting with a wide variety of alternative specifications.

12. See, for example, the differing results reported in Friedman (1986),
     Eichenbaum and Singleton (1986), and Stock and Watson (1987).

13. Friedman (1984).

14.   The entries above the lines differ from Friedman's because of subsequent
      data revisions, but the differences are slight.

15. Friedman made the same prediction more forcefully in pieces directed at
     broader audiences. In a column in the September 26, 1983 issue of
     Newsweek, for example, Friedman wrote, "Inflation has not yet
     accelerated. That will come next year, since it generally takes about two
     years for monetary acceleration to work its way through to inflation
     The monetary explosion from July 1982 to July 1983 leaves no satisfactory
     way out of our present situation. . . The result is bound to be renewed
     stagflation - - recession accompanied by using inflation and high interest
     rates." A lengthy interview in the March 19, 1984 issue of Fortune
     indicated that Friedman "... also sees a strong possibility that by the
     end of [1984} inflation could reach an annual rate as high as 9%."

16.   See, for example, Friedman (1982, 1983).

17. There are several obvious problems with attempting to measure the relevant
     concept of credit in this way. One is simply that the available data
     measure long-term debts at par value rather than at market prices (or some
     equivalent for nonmarketable debts). Another is that although the
     category of "nonfinancial" borrowers excludes any entity explicitly set up
     as a financial intermediaries, there is inevitably some degree of
     double-counting due to what amounts to financial intermediation carried
     out by ordinary businesses and even individuals. Whether this problem is
     more or less severe than comparable problems affecting the monetary
     aggregates -- for example, the apparently widespread use of U.S. currency
     in black markets around the world, or even in the United States for a
     variety of purposes not related to familiar theories of demand for money
     -- is an empirical question.

18. The data are analogous to those in Figure 2 except that the numerator is
     end of quarter outstanding debt of domestic nonfinancial borrowers
     (source: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System).
19. The one exception is the farm sector.

20. Friedman (1987).

21. For the five years 1978-82, the simple correlations among the
     fourth-quarter-over-fourth-quarter growth rates of the major M's were each
                - .53 between Ml and M2, - .57 between Ml and M3, and - .12
     negative:
     between M2 and M3.

22. Okun (1978).

23. A "point year" of unemployment is one percentage point of unemployment in
     excess of the rate that corresponds to "full employment," maintained for
     one year. Some writers - - for example, Fischer (1985) - - have focused on
     real output rather than unemployment, and have argued on that basis that
     the post-1980 disinflation involved smaller costs than Okun's survey
     implied. The focus of the evidence that Okun surveyed was the
     inflation-unemployment relationship, however. His translation of the cost
     estimate into foregone real output simply relied on the usual
     three-for-one "Okun's Law" relation, which has not held up during the
     1980s.

24. See, for example, Sachs (1985) for an analysis of the importance of the
     dollar's appreciation in the U.S. disinflation.

25. See Solomon (1986) for a- review of the nineteenth century experience.

26. The official accounts include numerous obvious mismeasurements, but there
     is no ground for claiming that their sum is very different from zero. The
     largest adjustments in favor of the United States in a set of true
     accounts would be the revaluation of U.S. gold stocks, and of the net of
     U.S. direct investment abroad and foreign direct investment in the United
     States, to current market values. The largest adjustments against the
     United States would be the revaluation to market value of U.S. banks'
     loans to developing countries, and allowance for the accumulation over
     time of each year's "errors and omissions" flow.

27. These data are from Scholl (1987), Table 1.

28. The effect is analogous to that sometimes claimed along the lines that
     open market purchases would lead investors to sell long-term bonds Out of
     fear that the resulting increase in money growth would bring higher
     inflation. Market experience in the United States has not borne out this
     earlier line of reasoning, but there appears to be more evidence to
     support the effect operating via exchange rates.

29. See Wallich (1984) for a description in different but equivalent terms.

     Guttentag (1966).
