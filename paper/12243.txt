        Abstract. Disturbances a¤ecting agents’ intertemporal substitution
        are the key driving force of macroeconomic ‡uctuations. We reach this
        conclusion exploiting the bond pricing implications of an estimated gen-
        eral equilibrium model of the U.S. business cycle with a rich set of real
        and nominal frictions.




                                 1. Introduction

  Macroeconomic models imply two broad classes of optimization condi-
tions. On the one hand, intratemporal …rst order conditions equate the
marginal rate of substitution (MRS) between two goods consumed at the
same time to their relative price and, through this, to the marginal rate of
transformation (MRT). On the other hand, inter temporal …rst order con-
ditions equate the MRS of the same good across time to the relative price
and to the MRT.
  In a stochastic general equilibrium, macroeconomic ‡uctuations originate
from shocks hitting these equilibrium conditions. We refer to the shocks

that directly perturb the intratemporal …rst order conditions as intratempo-
ral disturbances. This distinguishes them from intertemporal disturbances,
which perturb instead the agents’intertemporal …rst order conditions.1
  This distinction is useful to state clearly the main result of this paper: in-
tertemporal disturbances are the key source of macroeconomic ‡uctuations.


  This …nding is quite surprising, at least if considered through the lens
of some prominent work in macroeconomics. The Real Business Cycle lit-
erature, for example, has been extremely succesful in demonstrating that
economic ‡uctuations can be largely accounted for by neutral shifts in the
production function (Prescott (1986), King and Rebelo (1999)).2 Similarly,
Hall (1997) found that most of the movements in employment over the busi-
ness cycle are due to intratemporal “preference”shocks. These results have
been con…rmed and extended by Mulligan (2002b), Mulligan (2002c) and
Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan (2005). Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan (2005)
in particular …nd that intertemporal shocks— investment wedges in their ac-
counting taxonomy— are a negligible source of business cycle ‡uctuations.
This is true in an unconditional sense, for the entire postwar period, as well
as more speci…cally when accounting for the Great Depression and the 1982
recession.
  What is the source of the discrepancy between our results and those in this
literature? We argue that the conclusion that intertemporal disturbances are
unimportant stems from the common practice of disregarding asset market
data in macroeconomics. In fact, the studies mentioned above share one
important characteristic: they concentrate on economies in which capital is
the only asset. As a consequence, their equilibrium conditions include only
one intertemporal Euler equation, that for the optimal choice of capital.
With only one Euler equation, only one intertemporal “residual”(or wedge)

  1
     This distinction is not necessarily a partition. Some shocks can perturb both the
intratemporal and the intertemporal …rst order conditions.
   2
     We classify neutral technology shocks as intratemporal disturbances, because they
directly perturb the contemporaneous relation between inputs and output. However, this
choice of label is inconsequential for the substantive results of the paper regarding the
sources of business cycle ‡uctuations.
                      INTERTEMPORAL DISTURBANCES                             3

is identi…ed in this economy. The results in the literature suggest that this
wedge is small.
  In contrast to this literature, we consider an economy in which a short-
term nominal bond is traded along with physical capital. In this economy,
the equilibrium conditions include two Euler equations, derived from the
optimal choice of each of the two assets. The key point is that with two
Euler equations we can identify two separate intertemporal disturbances,
as long as we include the short-term interest rate among the observables.
We model the …rst disturbance as a shock to the stochastic discount factor,
which captures exogenous ‡uctuations in preferences, as well as unmodelled
distortions in consumption choices. The second disturbance is a shock to
the rate of return on capital, which might be caused for example by changes
in the e¢ ciency of the investment technology.
  We …nd that both disturbances contribute substantially to ‡uctuations,
even if the contribution of the combined wedge is negligible in models with
only one intertemporal Euler equation. Intuitively, large exogenous varia-
tions in the stochastic discount factor are necessary to repair the very poor
bond pricing performance of the standard Euler equation. Unfortunately
though, the resulting discount factor does not price the capital stock cor-
rectly. Hence the need for large ‡uctuations in the disturbance to the rate
of return.
  This is not the …rst work in macroeconomics to emphasize the importance
of intertemporal shocks as sources of business cycles. Fisher (2005) identi…es
a sizable contribution to ‡uctuations of an investment speci…c technology
shock, one of the intertemporal shocks we include in our model, in the
context of a structural VAR. Greenwood, Hercowitz, and Krusell (2000)
show that such a shock could explain about a third of output ‡uctuations
in a calibrated real business cycle model, while Greenwood, Hercowitz, and
Krusell (1997) emphasize its role as a contributor to long-run growth. All
these studies use direct observations on the relative price of investment as
a proxy for the investment speci…c technological shock. On the contrary,
we measure the contribution of intertemporal disturbances to ‡uctuations
                          INTERTEMPORAL DISTURBANCES                                   4

indirectly, as the shocks needed to reconcile the Euler equations for bonds
and capital with data on quantities and interest rates. In this respect, the
paper closest to ours is Justiniano and Primiceri (2005), who work with a
very similar model, but focus on explaining the decline in volatility of U.S.
GDP.



  Our …ndings are consistent with a long line of research in …nance, dating
back at least to Hansen and Singleton’s (1982 and 1983) seminal studies
on the estimation of consumption Euler equations.3 This literature had
varying degrees of success in recovering “reasonable” estimates of taste pa-
rameters. For example, Eichenbaum, Hansen, and Singleton (1988) and
Mankiw, Rotemberg, and Summers (1985) reach opposite conclusions about
the implications of their parameter estimates for the plausibility of the im-
plied utility function. However, one result is remarkably robust across all
these studies. The overidentifying restrictions embedded in the Euler equa-
tion are consistently and overwhelmingly rejected. In other words, the Euler
equation errors are statistically large.
  Our work is in line with this result, but extends it in one important
direction. As in the …nance literature, we document the size of the statistical
errors in the model’s Euler equations. In addition, by embedding these …rst
order conditions into a general equilibrium framework, we can measure the
economic importance of the disturbances in terms of their contribution to
‡uctuations. We …nd that intertemporal disturbances account for a large
portion of the variation in U.S. output, consumption, investment and hours.
  One possible reaction to this …nding is simply to de-emphasize the pric-
ing implications of macro models, and focus instead on their success with
quantities. This approach is well established in macroeconomics, and has
proved fruitful in addressing many interesting questions. However, we …nd it
unsatisfactory, for at least two reasons. First, in a decentralized equilibrium,

     See Singleton (1990) for a survey of the early literature and Hall (1988) for a more
macroeconomic approach to the same issue. Campbell (2003) provides a more recent
rendition of the same results, as well as an extension to several countries.

prices are the signals that lead agents to align marginal rates of substitu-
tion and transformation. Models that achieve the correct alignment of those
rates, but with the wrong prices, should at least be “puzzling.” Trying to
solve this puzzle is a challenge squarely within the realm of macroeconomics,
as forcefully argued by Cochrane (2005).4 Second, disregarding asset prices
is not a viable approach, if we are interested in modeling the short-term
nominal interest rate as the main instrument of monetary policy, as in the
modern New Keynesian literature (Woodford (2003), Smets and Wouters
(2003a), Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005))
   The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the intuition behind
our results, in the context of a stylized model. Section 3 introduces a more
realistic model of the U.S. business cycle, with a rich set of nominal and
real frictions. Section 4 and 5 present the estimation results for the baseline
model and for several restricted versions of this model. Section 6 concludes.

         2. The Importance of Intertemporal Disturbances

   This section presents a stylized general equilibrium model, which is helpful
in illustrating the intuition behind our main results.
   Consider the problem of a representative household maximizing the famil-
iar utility function, which depends on consumption (C) and hours worked
(L):
                                 1
                                                  "                      #
                                 X                      1
                                                      Ct+s       L1+
                                                                  t+s
                                       s
                            Et             bt+s                              .
                                                      1          1+
                                 s=0
In this formulation, bt is an exogenous shock to the consumer’s impatience,
which a¤ects both the marginal utility of consumption and the marginal
disutility of labor. The household owns the …rms and the capital stock.
Therefore, its budget constraint is given by

           Ct + Tt + It + Bt           (1 + rt        1 ) Bt 1   +   t   + wt Lt + rtk Kt ,

where Tt represents lump-sum tax payments, It is investment, Bt is the
household’s holdings of government bonds, rt is the risk-free real interest
   4
     A possible solution to the “puzzle” lies in the observation that prices might not be
allocative. This is plausible in the case of wages, much less so in reference to asset prices.

rate,      t   is the pro…t earned from owning the …rms and wt is the real wage.
Capital, denoted by Kt , is rented to …rms at the rate rtk . Households accu-
mulate the capital stock according to the equation

                               Kt+1 = (1       )Kt +    t It ,

where          denotes the capital depreciation rate.       t    is an investment speci…c
technology shock, a random disturbance to the e¢ ciency with which con-
sumption goods are transformed into capital, as in Greenwood, Hercowitz,
and Krusell (1997) or Fisher (2005). Therefore, in a competitive equilibrium,
     1
 t       is equal to the relative price of investment.
     In this economy, …rms operate a Cobb-Douglas production function in
capital and hours. They maximize pro…ts, taking prices as given. We close
the model with a Government, which …nances its budget de…cit by issuing
the short term bonds held by households.
     Focusing on the intertemporal …rst order conditions of the consumer prob-
lem, we have

(2.1)                    1 = Et [Mt+1 (1 + rt )]
                                                k       1
(2.2)                    1 = Et Mt+1       t   rt+1 +                ;
                                                            t+1

with
                                           Ct+1        bt+1
                              Mt+1                          :
                                            Ct          bt
     Equations (2.1) and (2.2) can be interpreted as pricing equations for the
risk-free bond and the capital stock respectively. Mt+1 is the model’s sto-
chastic discount factor, which ‡uctuates endogenously with consumption,
and exogenously with the taste disturbance bt : The investment speci…c shock
 t;   on the other hand, acts as a disturbance to the rate of return on capital.
Both disturbances perturb the model’s Euler equations. Therefore, we clas-
sify them as intertemporal disturbances. Our surprising …nding is that these
two shocks together are responsible for a large fraction of macroeconomic
‡uctuations in the Unites States.
     Why are our results on the importance of these intertemporal disturbances
so di¤ erent from those in most of the macroeconomic literature? Because
                         INTERTEMPORAL DISTURBANCES                            7

most of that literature ignores equation (2.1) and its empirical implications.
For example, in Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan’s (2005) prototype econ-
omy, capital is the only asset. Therefore, equation (2.1) is redundant in the
characterization of the equilibrium allocation. Moreover, markets are com-
petitive, so that the rental rate in equation (2.2) can be substituted with the
marginal product of capital. These restrictions have two important conse-
quences. First, with only one Euler equation, it is possible to identify only
one intertemporal wedge, a combination of the intertemporal disturbances
bt and   t.   Second, this wedge is likely to be small, since equation (2.2) has
the best chance of …tting the data when the rental rate is measured by the
marginal product of capital (Mulligan (2002a) and Mulligan (2004)).
  Why does the explicit consideration of equation (2.1) make such a dra-
matic di¤ erence? Because this equation …ts the data very poorly when the
rate of return is measured on asset markets, either as a stock return or as an
interest rate on bonds (Hansen and Singleton (1982), Hansen and Singleton
(1983), Hall (1988) and Campbell (2003)). This lack of …t means that the
discrepancy between the discounted rate of return and one is statistically
large. Therefore, a large taste shock bt is necessary to reconcile the observed
market returns with the growth rate of consumption. This is true even un-
der much more general speci…cations for Mt+1 than the one adopted here
(Eichenbaum, Hansen, and Singleton (1988)). In fact, equation (2.1) is re-
soundingly rejected by tests of overidentifying restrictions, no matter what
the utility speci…cation, the measure of returns, the list of instruments, or
the frequency of the observations (see Singleton (1990) for a survey.)
  Figure 1 illustrates this argument quite e¤ectively. It compares the growth
rate of consumption with measures of the marginal product of capital and
of the short-term real interest rate. Although consumption growth is more
volatile than the marginal product of capital at high frequency, the two series
clearly comove over the business cycle. The real interest rate, on the other
hand, is signi…cantly more volatile than consumption growth, especially in
the second half of the sample, and there is hardly any comovement. Given
                         INTERTEMPORAL DISTURBANCES                            8

this picture, signi…cant di¤erences in …t between equations (2.1) and (2.2)
should not be surprising.
  In summary, looking at Euler equations (2.1) and (2.2) jointly, rather
than at (2.2) alone, leads to very di¤erent conclusions about the statisti-
cal size and the economic importance of intertemporal disturbances. The
model’s discount factor can price short-term bonds correctly only thanks to
exogenous movements in bt . But then, this same discount factor is unlikely
to also price the capital stock, which was instead priced reasonably well by
consumption growth alone. Hence the importance of the other intertemporal
shock,   t,   to realign the return on capital with the discount factor needed
to …t equation (2.1).
  But is it important to distinguish the contributions of the two intertem-
poral disturbances to ‡uctuations? We think the answer is yes, at least in
a world with frictions. In an e¢ cient economy,     t   and bt do not play eco-
nomically independent roles. They both induce substitution of current con-
sumption with investment, and therefore future consumption—          t   by mak-
ing investment cheaper, bt by making consumers more patient. Therefore,
in such an economy, a unique intertemporal wedge e¤ectively summarizes
their e¤ect. Not so in an economy with frictions, in which di¤erent shocks
will in general propagate through di¤erent mechanisms. Therefore, if we
wish to identify the sources of business cycles we need to model explicitly
the frictions that propagate them.
  Of course, modeling frictions explicitly has also some drawbacks, in par-
ticular because the identi…cation of the shocks relies crucially on the exact
speci…cation of those frictions. This is why Bayesian estimation is particu-
larly suitable in this context, since it allows an explicit formal comparison
of the …t of models with alternative sets of frictions.




  The aim of this section was to provide some intuition for our …ndings on
the role of intertemporal shocks in economic ‡uctuations. The rest of the
paper supplies the quantitative underpinnings of the arguments developed

here, in the context of an estimated DSGE model with a rich set of fric-
tions. We present this baseline model in section 3 and 4. Then, in section
5, we study the e¤ect of various restrictions on the model’s variance decom-
position. In particular, we show that in the baseline model intertemporal
shocks explain the bulk of macroeconomic ‡uctuations, only if we include
the short-term interest rate among the observables and equation (2.1) among
the constraints. Moreover, this result depends crucially on the inclusion of
the nominal and real frictions that our estimation procedure suggests are
important in …tting the data. In fact, the role of intertemporal shocks is
negligible in a version of the model restricted to resemble a prototypical
stochastic growth model. On the other hand, intertemporal shocks become
paramount again in a small monetary model with no investment, in which
output is equal to consumption and thus equation (2.1) is the only Euler
equation.




                 3. A model of the US business cycle

  This section outlines our baseline model of the U.S. business cycle. This is
a medium-scale DSGE model, with a host of nominal and real frictions, along
the lines of Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005). An important fea-
ture of this model is that its …t to U.S. data has been shown to be competitive
with that of Bayesian vector autoregressions (Smets and Wouters (2003b)
and Del Negro, Schorfheide, Smets, and Wouters (2004)). As Smets and
Wouters (2003a) and Del Negro, Schorfheide, Smets, and Wouters (2004),
we estimate this model with Bayesian methods, and use it to document the
quantitative importance of the qualitative insights discussed in section 2.
Moreover, in section 5 we consider several carefully restricted versions of
the baseline model, to highlight the source of the di¤erences between our
results and those in the literature.
  The model is populated by …ve classes of agents. Producers of …nal goods,
which “assemble” a continuum of intermediate goods produced by monop-
olistic intermediate goods producers. Households, who consume the …nal

where "p;t is i:i:d:N (0;     2 ).   Pro…t maximization and the zero pro…t condition
                              p
imply the following relationship between the price of the …nal good, Pt , and
the prices of the intermediate goods, Pt (i)

3.2. Intermediate goods producers. A monopolist produces the inter-
mediate good i according to the production function

                 Yt (i) = max At1                   Kt (i) Lt (i)1                              At F ; 0 ,

where Kt (i) and Lt (i) denote the capital and labor inputs for the production
of good i and F represents a …xed cost of production. At is an exogenous
stochastic process capturing the e¤ects of technology, whose growth rate
(zt       log At ) evolves according to

                             zt = (1                z)     +         p zt 1     + "z;t ,

where "z;t is i:i:d:N (0;     2 ).   Therefore, the level of technology is non station-

      As in Calvo (1983), a fraction                  p   of …rms cannot re-optimize their prices
and, therefore, set their prices following the indexation rule

                                                                     p        1   p
                                   Pt (i) = Pt            1 (i) t 1                   ,

                      Pt
where        t       Pt 1   and
                         denotes the steady state value of t . On the
other hand, re-optimizing …rms choose their price, P~t (i), by maximizing
the present value of future pro…ts, subject to the usual cost minimization
condition,

     s=0


where        t+s   is the marginal utility of consumption, and Wt and rtk denote
the nominal wage and the rental rate of capital.


3.3. Employment Agencies. Firms are owned by a continuum of house-
holds, indexed by j 2 [0; 1]. As in Erceg, Henderson, and Levin (2000),
each household is a monopolistic supplier of specialized labor, Lt (j): A large
number of “employment agencies”combines this specialized labor into labor
services available to the intermediate …rms, according to

                                         Z    1                               1+      w
                                                                 1
                                  Lt =            Lt (j) 1+          w   dj               .
                                          0

Pro…t maximization and the zero pro…t condition for the perfectly competi-
tive employment agencies imply the following relationship between the wage
paid by the intermediate …rms and the wage received by the supplier of labor
of type j; Wt (j)
                                             Z        1                           w

3.4. Households. Each household maximizes the utility function

                 X
                       s                                                Lt+s (j)1+

                                                                          1+
                 s=0

where Ct is consumption and h is the “degree” of habit formation.5 't is
a preference shock that a¤ects the marginal disutility of labor, while bt is a
“discount factor” shock a¤ecting both the marginal utility of consumption
and the marginal disutility of labor. These two shocks follow the stochastic
processes

                   log bt =         b log bt 1   + "b;t

                   log 't = (1              ' ) log '   +    ' log 't 1   + "';t .

Note that we work with log utility to ensure the existence of a balanced
growth path, as in the real business cycle tradition. Moreover, consumption
is not indexed by j because the existence of state contingent securities en-
sures that in equilibrium consumption and asset holdings are the same for
all households.
  The household’s budget constraint is

                                                                         k

where It is investment, Bt is holdings of government bonds, Rt is the gross
nominal interest rate, Qt (j) is the net cash ‡ow from participating in state
contingent securities, and          t   is the per-capita pro…t accruing to households
from ownership of the …rms.
  Households own capital and choose the capital utilization rate, ut ; which
transforms physical capital into e¤ective capital according to

                                         Kt = u t Kt        1.


E¤ective capital is then rented to …rms at the rate rtk . The cost of capital
utilization is a(ut ) per unit of physical capital. As in Altig, Christiano,

  5 We assume a cashless limit economy as described in Woodford (2003).
                              INTERTEMPORAL DISTURBANCES                                                            13

Eichenbaum, and Linde (2005), we assume that ut = 1 and a(ut ) = 0 in
steady state. The physical capital accumulation equation is
                                                                                It

                                                                              It     1

where     denotes the depreciation rate. The function S captures the presence
of adjustment costs in investment, as in Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans
(2005) and Altig, Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Linde (2005). We assume
that S 0 = 0 and S 00 > 0 in steady state.6                               t     is an investment speci…c
technological shock a¤ecting the e¢ ciency with which consumption goods
are transformed into capital. In equilibrium,                             t    can be interpreted as the
inverse of the relative price of investment. We assume that it follows the
exogenous process
                                log     t   =       log     t 1      +"       ;t ,

where "        is i:i:d:N (0;   2 ):
          ;t

   As in Erceg, Henderson, and Levin (2000), a fraction                                              w   of households
cannot re-optimize their wages and, therefore, set them according to the
indexation rule

                      Wt (j) = Wt       1 (j) ( t 1 e
                                                     zt          1
                                                                     ) w ( e )1           w

The remaining fraction of re-optimizing households maximizes instead

   6 Lucca (2005) shows that this formulation of the adjustment cost function is equivalent
(up to …rst order) to a generalization of time to build.

  Fiscal policy is fully Ricardian: the Government …nances its budget de…cit
by issuing short term bonds. Public spending is determined exogenously as
a time-varying fraction of GDP

3.7. Steady State and Model Solution. In this model, consumption,
investment, capital, real wages and output evolve along a stochastic balanced
growth path, since the technology process At has a unit root. Therefore,
we …rst rewrite the model in terms of detrended variables, compute the
non-stochastic steady state of the transformed model, and then loglinearly
approximate it around this steady state.
  Finally, we estimate the approximated model using as observables the
vector of variables
                                                                           Wt

where    log Xt      log Xt      log Xt    1.   A description of the data series used in
the estimation can be found in appendix A.

3.8. Bayesian inference and priors. We use Bayesian methods to char-
acterize the posterior distribution of the structural parameters of the model
(see An and Schorfheide (2005) for a survey). As in most of the litera-
ture, we assume that the model’s exogenous disturbances are independent.
This assumption is in contrast with that adopted by Chari, Kehoe, and Mc-
Grattan (2005), whose shocks are instead allowed to be correlated. Clearly,
our assumption imposes additional restrictions on the model. On the other
hand, independence is necessary for a meaningful structural interpretation
of the shocks.
                       INTERTEMPORAL DISTURBANCES                           15

  The parameters’ posterior distribution combines the likelihood and the
prior information. In the rest of this subsection we brie‡y discuss the as-
sumptions about the prior.
  First, we …x a small number of parameters to values commonly used in
the literature. In particular, we set the steady state share of capital income
( ) to 0:33, the quarterly depreciation rate of capital, , to 0:025 and the
steady state government spending to GDP ratio, 1          1=g, to 0:22, which
corresponds to the average value of Gt =Yt in our sample.
  Table 1 reports the priors for the remaining parameters of the model.
These priors are relatively disperse and are broadly in line with those adopted
in previous studies (Altig, Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Linde (2005), Del
Negro, Schorfheide, Smets, and Wouters (2004) or Levin, Onatski, Williams,
and Williams (2005)). We discuss the posterior estimates of the parameters
in the next section.


            4. Empirical results for the baseline model

  This section reports parameter estimates and the variance decomposition
for the baseline model of section 3. Here and in what follows we use the
fraction of the variance of the observables explained by each shock as a
measure of the shock’s contribution to ‡uctuations. Our objective is to
establish the importance of intertemporal disturbances as sources of those
‡uctuations.
  Table 2 presents posterior medians, standard deviations and 90 percent
posterior intervals for the estimated coe¢ cients of the baseline model. The
estimates are reasonable and in line with values obtained by previous studies
(Altig, Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Linde (2005), Del Negro, Schorfheide,
Smets, and Wouters (2004), Levin, Onatski, Williams, and Williams (2005),
Justiniano and Primiceri (2005)).
  Table 3 reports the variance decomposition for the baseline model. Two
points deserve particular attention.
  First, the disturbance to the stochastic discount factor is the most impor-
tant shock in explaining consumption ‡uctuations. The bt shock accounts
                       INTERTEMPORAL DISTURBANCES                            16

alone for almost 50 percent of the variance of consumption growth. Its
important role might be surprising, given that the baseline model features
habit formation in consumption. In fact, habits should help explain the
observed persistence in consumption, thus mitigating the empirical failure
of the Euler equation. However, the introduction of habits is also associ-
ated with high variability of the risk-free rate, as observed for example by
Boldrin, Christiano, and Fisher (2001) and Campbell and Cochrane (1999).
This might contribute to explain the importance of bt in our framework.
  The second important observation from Table 3 is that the investment
speci…c technology shock     t,   another intertemporal disturbance, is by far
the most important source of ‡uctuations in investment, as well as hours
and output. This disturbance explains about 60 percent of the variability
of investment growth, 57 percent of the variability of hours worked and
40 percent of the variability of output growth. Neutral technology shocks
account only for one forth of the variance of GDP growth and 12 and 15
percent of the variance of hours and investment growth respectively. Finally,
monetary policy shocks play a negligible role in generating ‡uctuations.
They account for only 5 percent of the variance of GDP.
  In summary, the empirical evidence from the baseline model clearly points
to the crucial role of intertemporal disturbances in business cycle ‡uctua-
tions, since they account for a very large portion of the variation in consump-
tion, investment, output and hours. This …nding is very consistent with the
results in Greenwood, Hercowitz, and Krusell (2000), Fisher (2005) and Jus-
tiniano and Primiceri (2005) and broadly in line with some recent work that
has dehemphasized the role of neutral technology as a source of business
cycles (Gali (1999), Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Vigfusson (2004), Francis
and Ramey (2005a and b)).
  On the contrary, the importance of intertemporal disturbances, espe-
cially as sources of ‡uctuations in hour, is at odds with the results of Hall
(1997), who attributes almost all those ‡uctuations to intratemporal prefer-
ence shocks ('t ). However, in Hall (1997), as well as in Chari, Kehoe, and
McGrattan (2005), who reach similar conclusions, the intratemporal wedge

can be extracted directly, as a function of the model’s observables (and some
calibrated parameters.) In our framework instead two frictions break this
link: habit formation and sticky wages. A closer inspection of their quan-
titative role reveals that habit formation is particularly important in this
respect. In fact, when habit formation is restricted to zero, the intratempo-
ral preference shock explains 77 percent of the variance of hours, a number
much closer to Hall’s (1997).
  We undertake a more systematic assessment of the relative role of the
various ingredients of the model in producing the results in the next section.

                  5. Assessing the role of frictions

  What features of the baseline model are responsible for amplifying the role
of intertemporal shocks as a source of ‡uctuations? In section 2 we argued
that the main di¤erence between an RBC model with wedges and our model
is the fact that the latter includes a pricing equation for the nominal bond
and observations on its interest rate. However, this is not the only di¤erence
between the two models. In fact, our baseline model includes a host of
real and nominal frictions, like sticky wages, variable capital utilization,
adjustment costs in investment and habit formation in consumption. All
these frictions modify the model’s representation of the relevant margins for
intertemporal substitution. They could therefore play an important role in
shifting the main source of ‡uctuations from intratemporal to intertemporal
shocks. To asses the relative contribution of di¤erent frictions to this shift,
this section compares the variance decomposition of the baseline model to
that of a prototypical real model and of two intermediate speci…cations.

5.1. A prototypical growth model. The real model we consider is the
stochastic growth core of the model of section 3. This is obtained by as-
suming perfectly ‡exible prices and wages, no habit in consumption, a …xed
capital utilization rate and no adjustment costs in investment. The shocks
we consider in this case are the neutral and investment speci…c technology
shocks, zt and   t;   the intratemporal preference shock, 't and the govern-
ment spending shock, gt . This is similar to the speci…cation adopted by
                         INTERTEMPORAL DISTURBANCES                                18

Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan (2005), and we follow them in including only
output, consumption, investment and hours worked as observable variables
in the estimation. The variance decomposition for this model is in table 4.
  The results are in line with the macroeconomic conventional wisdom. The
‡uctuations in output and hours are entirely explained by the intratempo-
ral shocks. The neutral technology shock explains 60 percent of output
variability, with the remainder almost exclusively due to the intratemporal
preference shock, which also accounts for 95 percent of ‡uctuations in labor,
an even more extreme result than Hall’s (1997). However, the intertem-
poral shock ( t ) does play a role in generating ‡uctuations in investment,
and especially in consumption, even in this simple economy. This suggests
that, although the standard Euler Equation prices capital better than bonds
(Mulligan (2002a)), its …t is far from perfect perfect.7
  The impulse responses in …gure 2 clarify the intuition behind this result.
In the prototypical growth model, the ‡uctuations in consumption and in-
vestment generated by the intertemporal shock o¤set each other, leaving no
role for this shock to explain output. This is because embodied technological
progress generates a negative conditional correlation between consumption
and investment, which leaves output almost unchanged. As a consequence,
the likelihood would rather load on other shocks to generate business cycles,
since consumption and investment are both procyclical.

5.2. The role of real frictions. Can real rigidities alone account for the
paramount role of intertemporal disturbances in the baseline model? The
answer is no, as clearly illustrated by the results in table 5. Here, we augment
the prototypical growth model described above with all the real frictions also
featured in the baseline model. They are habit in consumption, variable
capital utilization, investment adjustment costs and (real) wage rigidity.
  The variance decomposition for this model is virtually identical to that
of the previous model without frictions. Mechanically, the reason for the

   7 In fact, Mulligan (2002a) shows that the standard consumption Euler equation cor-
rectly prices the after-tax return on capital. Our estimated intertemporal disturbance
might therefore simply re‡ect the absence of taxes in our model.
                       INTERTEMPORAL DISTURBANCES                               19

similarity of the results is that the posterior estimates of the parameters
imply a small deviation from the frictionless model, with a limited degree
of habit persistence and wage stickiness, and low investment adjustment
costs. This is because the main role of rigidities is to generate a plausible
transmission mechanism for the intertemporal shocks, as we will see in more
detail below. But in a model with no bonds and only one Euler equation,
such a mechanism is unnecessary, because intertemporal shocks can still be
safely ignored when accounting for business cycles— the one Euler equation
does not need too much help from exogenous disturbances to …t the data.
We conclude that, from the vantage point of real models, intratemporal …rst
order conditions are the ones in need of more urgent work, as also suggested
by Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan (2005).

5.3. The role of interest rates and the bond Euler equation. The
next step is then to consider a model with nominal bonds and interest rates.
We do so by adding price stickiness to the stochastic growth model, or equiv-
alently by stripping the fully-‡edged model of the consumption, investment
and wage rigidities. Compared to the two real models described above,
this speci…cation has three more observables, price and wage in‡ation and
nominal interest rates, and three more shocks, to monetary policy ("M
                                                                    t
                                                                      P );

the price mark-up (   p;t )   and the discount factor (bt ): Of these changes, the
most important for our purposes is the inclusion of the nominal interest rate
among the observables, and of the corresponding Euler equation among the
optimization conditions. This is the equation often tested, and overwhelm-
ingly rejected, in the …nance literature.
  The decomposition of the sources of ‡uctuations in this model is presented
in table 6. Two results stand out. First, the sum of the two intertemporal
shocks now explains 82 and 61 percent of consumption and investment ‡uc-
tuations respectively, almost twice as much as in the simple growth model.
Moreover, 78 and 34 percent of the ‡uctuations in the nominal interest
rate and in‡ation are due to those same shocks. Our empirical procedure
can satisfy the restrictions imposed by the two Euler equations, in a way
which is compatible with the observed evolution of the nominal interest rate,
                      INTERTEMPORAL DISTURBANCES                           20

consumption and investment, only by loading signi…cantly on both the in-
tratemporal shocks. This is a result of the Euler equation’s failure as a
restriction on the returns measured in …nancial markets.
  The second important result emerging from table 6 is that the variability
of output and labor remains an overwhelmingly intratemporal phenome-
non. The e¤ect of the intertemporal shocks is con…ned to ‡uctuations in
consumption and investment, but these ‡uctuations still largely o¤set each
other, resulting in virtually no movement in output and hours. This is be-
cause the model’s transmission mechanism is not rich enough to propagate
the intertemporal shocks from consumption and investment to hours and
output. This propagation is achieved only with the inclusion of real fric-
tions, as illustrated by the variance decomposition for the baseline model
in table 3. Here, the intertemporal shocks together account for 41 percent
of the ‡uctuations in output and 58 percent of those in labor, with the
investment speci…c technology shock playing the key role.
  Figure 3 illustrates the economic mechanisms underlying this result. As in
all the models, an investment speci…c shock produces an investment boom.
Without frictions, this is mostly …nanced by a reduction in consumption,
with output almost unchanged. This is clearly not a business cycle (Green-
wood, Hercowitz, and Krusell (2000) and Greenwood, Hercowitz, and Hu¤-
man (1988)). In the model with frictions, on the other hand, the investment
boom is more gradual, due to the adjustment costs, and the reduction in
consumption is kept in check by habits. At the same time, the sensitivity of
the marginal utility of income to this change in consumption is high, ampli-
fying the positive shift in labor supply. Moreover, the increase in demand
triggered by the investment boom leads …rms to hire more labor. And since
wage stickiness ‡attens the labor supply curve, the result is a signi…cant
increase in hours. In addition, the drop in the relative price of new capital
makes it optimal to increase the utilization rate, which further supports the
increase in output. This increase in output in turn …nances some of the in-
vestment boom, relieving the pressure on consumption, which in fact turns
positive approximately two years after the shock.
                       INTERTEMPORAL DISTURBANCES                            21

  In sum, real and nominal frictions are complementary in attributing to
intertemporal shocks a paramount role as sources of ‡uctuations. Including
bond pricing among the criteria for judging a model’s ability to …t the data is
necessary to highlight the de…ciencies of the standard theory of intertempo-
ral substitution. These de…ciencies manifest themselves as the shocks needed
to explain investment and consumption ‡uctuations in the nominal model
with no real rigidities. In this model, however, the intertemporal shocks
are not viable sources of business cycle ‡uctuations, because they tend to
move consumption and investment in opposite directions. The real frictions
included in the baseline model reduce signi…cantly the negative comovement
between consumption and investment, contributing to the transmission of
the intertemporal shocks to the rest of the economy.
  Why should we believe the conclusions drawn from the baseline model
rather than from the model without real frictions? The reason is that the
baseline model …ts the data much better. In fact, the log marginal data
densities for the two speci…cations are equal to       2031:84 and     2224:53
respectively. These values imply huge posterior odds in favor of the baseline
model.



5.4. A prototypical New-Keynesian model. The last experiment we
conduct is with a prototypical New-Keynesian model. This is a model with-
out capital accumulation dynamics. We derive it as a restricted version
of the baseline model of section 3 with no investment, so that capital is
constant over time.
  Although it might not provide a particularly realistic description of the
economy, this model is interesting because it is the polar opposite of the
prototypical growth model of Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan (2005) and
section 5.1. In fact, the only intertemporal …rst order condition in our
New-Keynesian model is the bond pricing equation, while the growth model
only features the pricing equation for the capital stock. As expected, the
analysis of this model produces opposite conclusions to those reached by
Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan (2005) and Hall (1997).
                         INTERTEMPORAL DISTURBANCES                              22

  To compare our results with those in the New-Keynesian literature, we
estimate the model using only data on output, in‡ation and the short-term
nominal interest rate. These observables only allow us to identify a subset
of the shocks in the baseline model: the technology (zt ), monetary policy
("M
  t
    P ), mark-up (
                     p;t )   and discount factor (bt ) shocks.
  As expected, the analysis of this model produces opposite conclusions
to those reached by Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan (2005) and Hall (1997).
First, the introduction of the discount factor shock (bt ) improves the model’s
…t dramatically with respect to the case without that shock. The log mar-
ginal data density equals         872:64 for the model with variable bt , while it
decreases to    914:03 for the speci…cation with a constant discount factor,
implying very high posterior odds in favor of the baseline model.
  Second, the shock to the stochastic discount factor explains 75 percent
of the unconditional variance of GDP growth, as shown in table 7, while
the technology and monetary policy shocks only explain 23 and 2 percent
of that variance.8
  These results further corroborate our conclusion that intertemporal dis-
turbances play a crucial role in models that explicitly include a bond-pricing
equation among their constraints. This is the case, in particular, in models
of the monetary transmission mechanism in which the short-term interest
rate is the instrument of monetary policy.


                              6. Concluding remarks

        “If asset markets are screwed up, so is the equation of mar-
        ginal rate of substitution and transformation in every macro-
        economic model, so are those models’ predictions for quan-
        tities, and so are their policy and welfare implications. As-
        set markets will have a greater impact on macroeconomics if
        their economic explanation fails than if it succeeds”(Cochrane
        (2005), p.3).

  8 A similar result on the importance of the b shock is obtained by Justiniano and
                                               t
Preston (2005) in an open economy framework.
                      INTERTEMPORAL DISTURBANCES                          23

  In this paper we followed Cochrane’s (2005) advice, leveraging a well-
known failure of the standard consumption Euler equation to learn some-
thing new and surprising about the underlying sources of macroeconomic
‡uctuations. The conventional wisdom in macroeconomics, as expounded
for example by Hall (1997) and Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan (2005), is
that ‡uctuations derive in large part from intratemporal disturbances. We
showed instead that, in an estimated state-of-the-art model of the business
cycle, inter temporal disturbances are responsible for more than 40 percent
of output ‡uctuations, close to 70 percent of ‡uctuations in consumption
and investment, and about 60 percent of ‡uctuations in hours worked.
  The key to this surprising result is the inclusion of the pricing equation
for bonds among the model’s equilibrium conditions and of their return
among the observables. As documented by a long line of research in …nance,
this Euler equation …ts the data very poorly. In our general equilibrium
framework, this statistical statement is equivalent to the presence of large
intertemporal disturbances. We show that these disturbances are economi-
cally important, in the sense that they explain a large fraction of economic
‡uctuations. Models that ignore this basic pricing implication are likely to
reach the opposite conclusion.


                        Appendix A. The Data

  Our dataset spans a sample from 1954QIII to 2004QIV. All data are
extracted from the Haver Analytics database (series mnemonics in paren-
thesis). Following Del Negro, Schorfheide, Smets, and Wouters (2004), we
construct real GDP by diving the nominal series (GDP) by population (LF
and LH) and the GDP De‡ator (JGDP). Real series for consumption and
investment are obtained in the same manner, although consumption cor-
responds only to personal consumption expenditures of non-durables (CN)
and services (CS), while investment is the sum of personal consumption
expenditures of durables (CD) and gross private domestic investment (I).
Real wages corresponds to nominal compensation per hour in the non-farm
business sector (LXNFC), divided by the GDP de‡ator. We measure the
                      INTERTEMPORAL DISTURBANCES                            24

labor input by the log of hours of all persons in the non-farm business sector
(HNFBN), divided by population. The quarterly log di¤erence in the GDP
de‡ator is our measure of in‡ation, while for nominal interest rates we use
the e¤ective Federal Funds rate. We do not demean or detrend any series.

  Figure 1. Consumption growth is the growth rate of per-capita consumption. The return on capital is M P Kt+1            ; where
             Y
 MPK = K       is the marginal return on capital for a Cobb-Douglas production function. The series for the capital stock (K) is
constructed from the capital accumulation equation using observations on investment and K0 equal to the capital stock’s steady
 state value. The (ex-post) real interest rate is it  t+1 ; where i is the interest rate on three-month Treasury Bills and   is the
 growth rate of the GDP de‡ator. All variables are annualized and demeaned. Data sources and de…nitions are in appendix A.
