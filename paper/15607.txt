This paper advances the specification and estimation of models of retirement and saving in two earner
families. The complications introduced by the interaction of retirement decisions by husbands and
wives have led researchers to adopt a number of simplifications to increase the feasibility of estimating
family retirement models. Our model relaxes these restrictions. It includes the extended choice set
created when each spouse makes an independent retirement decision. It also includes the full range
of complexity found in dynamic-stochastic models of retirement decision making, so far analyzed
only in the context of single earner households. Retirement outcomes include full retirement, partial
retirement and full-time work. Reverse flows from states of lesser to greater work are also included.
The preference structure incorporates heterogeneity in time preference, varying taste parameters for
full-time and part-time work, and the possibility of changes in preferences after retirement. The opportunity
set reflects the full range of nonlinearities created by pensions and Social Security. Financial returns
are stochastic. Exogenous shocks such as layoffs are also included. Estimation is based on data from
the Health and Retirement Study.

The solution method is based on backward induction. We show that this method is superior to a method
based on a Nash equilibrium, providing plausible behavioral predictions when Nash equilibrium criteria
fall silent.

In contrast to some recent studies, the findings suggest the flow of wives into the labor force in the
last few decades has probably reduced the amount of husbands’ work. The model also provides plausible
responses to various policies. For example, we find that any effort to promote opportunities for partial
retirement as a means to increase overall work is likely to be unsuccessful as any induced decline in
full retirements is offset by a decrease in full-time work.

       I. Introduction

        As the baby boomers begin to swell the ranks of the retired and increase demands on our

retirement programs, retirement behavior and retirement saving are becoming an even more

central concern of policy makers. Researchers and policy makers must fully understand

retirement behavior if they are to determine how rules and regulations governing the Social

Security system and private pensions influence retirement and saving outcomes, program

participation and costs, and the welfare of retirees.

        Researchers continue to make progress toward a comprehensive econometric model of

retirement and saving. Our aim in this paper is to make contributions on two levels. First, we

contribute to the analysis of retirement and saving at the family level by introducing a level and

complexity in the decision making of each spouse not found in previous work. Second, we bring

together into a model of family retirement details regarding the choice set, preferences and

constraints previously found only in models of retirement in one earner households, and typically

not found together in a single model, even of one earner households.

        Among the features in our family retirement model: 1. Outcomes include full-time work,

partial retirement and full retirement. 2. People are forward looking in their decision making. 3.

Saving and retirement are jointly determined. 4. The analysis is structural. It specifies separately

the preferences and constraints guiding each individual’s behavior. 5. Saving and retirement are

modeled on the assumption that one cannot borrow on future income or Social Security. Thus

liquidity constraints are incorporated into the analysis. 6. There is heterogeneity in time

preference. This means that the response rates to future rewards from wages or from postponing

Social Security or pension claiming differ among members of the population. It also means,

consistent with the distribution of wealth, that some will be well prepared for retirement and



                                                                                                     1
others poorly prepared. 7. There are two utility functions, two decision makers, and one budget

constraint. Each spouse makes his or her own decisions. However, the decisions are made with

awareness of the other spouse’s decision making, preferences and opportunity set, implications

for the income and wealth of the household, for joint consumption, and for the welfare of the

spouse. 8. In this specification, the solution to the model is not as obvious as in the case with a

single (unitary) utility function. Household decision making is solved through backward

induction. We show that this set up often provides different results from a solution based on a

Nash equilibrium. That is, the Nash equilibrium, which assumes that each spouse takes the

decision of the other spouse as given, is not always equivalent to methods in which the choice of

each spouse takes into account the possible responses of the other spouse. For example, when

decisions arrived at independently by each spouse, including awareness of the responses of their

spouse, would leave both spouses worse off, the husband and wife are assumed to avoid this

outcome. 9. The interactions of the decisions of each spouse are fully integrated into the

estimation procedure. 10. The analysis is dynamic, following retirement outcomes from full-time

to part-time work and or retirement, and following saving over the life cycle. 11. The analysis is

stochastic. People may reduce their work effort over time, then subsequently increase it. Some

people may return to the labor force after retiring fully, or increase their hours of work after

partially retiring, as circumstances change, with some events foreseen and others not. Others may

change their decisions as they realize they have made an error, or as decisions of husbands and

wives interact in ways that have not previously been analyzed. 12. Incentives from pensions and

Social Security are included on an individual basis for each individual in the sample. The

analysis includes the effects of the very sharp, nonlinear incentives from defined benefit pensions

that still account for two thirds of the pension wealth of those on the cusp of retirement. To do



                                                                                                      2
this, the estimation makes use of linked data in calculating the opportunity set, including detailed

pension plan descriptions obtained from employers and Social Security records. It does not use

typical or representative pension incentives. 13. There are minimum hours constraints at work.

Many jobs typically held in the prime working years and paying higher wages require full-time

work or none at all. Partial retirement is not allowed on the main job unless specified. 14. The

wage offer depends on tenure and on hours of work. Typically when one leaves a full-time job,

the wage offer drops substantially, as it often does for part-time work. 15. Layoffs are

incorporated in the analysis.

        The paper contributes to the analysis of decision making at the family level. Alternative

rankings of husbands and wives among the many potential outcomes are modeled. This involves

a richer array of outcomes than has been considered in earlier models of family decision making.

Each spouse decides on full, partial or nonretirement, the path to be taken in future years, the

implications for the behavior of the spouse and responses to changes in that behavior.

        Econometric estimation of this model is based on the Health and Retirement Study. The

resulting model is sufficiently detailed to facilitate policy analysis, allowing researchers to

change the specification of the equations representing the incentives created by Social Security,

pensions, labor market opportunities, including the availability of partial retirement or spouse

employment opportunities, and other constraints on individual behavior. With this model it is

possible to judge the determinants of retirement and saving behavior, and to estimate the likely

effects on both retirement and saving of those at different parts of the income and wealth

distribution.

        We have conducted simulations to highlight important interdependencies that are lost in

models that ignore the interaction of decisions reached by husbands and wives. For example,



                                                                                                    3
given a certain juxtaposition of preferences, higher wealth at the beginning of the period, all

other things being equal, may cause the work effort of one of the spouses to increase, even if the

work effort of the other spouse remains the same. This is contrary to the usual implication from a

unified model where a pure wealth effect should cause a decline in labor supply. Interactions

between the decisions of husbands and wives also may induce a path where labor supply is first

reduced, then increased.

       In a longer paper of the same title written for the National Institute on Aging, we have

included simulations of the effects of a number of policy initiatives, including increasing the

early entitlement age to Social Security, the effects of the trend from defined contribution to

defined benefit plans, and a loss in assets of 25 percent, simulating the effects of the recent

recession. To limit the length of this paper, the empirical analysis focuses on a detailed

description of decision making at the household level. Simulations are then presented to

highlight the unique features of the model.

       Section II highlights the many gaps in the retirement literature that have motivated the

present study. Section III presents the stochastic, dynamic model of retirement where previously

omitted dimensions of retirement and saving are included in an econometric model of decision

making by the two earner family. The decision process in the two earner family is explored in

Section IV. Data and estimation are discussed in Section V. Section VI presents a number of

counter intuitive simulations designed to highlight the importance of specifying the full set of

interactions in the two earner family. Section VII concludes. Two appendices have been posted

with this working paper on the NBER web site. Appendix 1 describes the construction of the

variables used in this study. Appendix 2 explores a number of issues encountered in estimating

time preference from information on asset levels and retirement.



                                                                                                   4
                                  II. Gaps in The Retirement Literature

        Among the various dimensions of behavior that a retirement model should explain, a first

requirement is that it explain the major flows among the various retirement states, including

reverse flows. 1 In the process, it must also explain such major features of the retirement hazard

as the spikes in retirement at ages 62 and 65. Second, the model should explain the joint

distribution of retirement by husbands and wives. Retirement data clearly show that couples

coordinate their retirement decisions. 2 A third requirement is that model outcomes are consistent

with the wealth accumulated for retirement by each household.

        The majority of empirical retirement studies are reduced form or quasi reduced form.

The dependent variable typically is some measure of retirement or labor force activity.

Independent variables include a measure of incentives affecting labor-leisure choice, including

some type of pension and/or Social Security delta, measuring the change in the present value of

benefits if retirement is postponed. Typically these models assume that individuals are forward

looking (Coile and Gruber, 2000). Consequently, decision makers consider not only the

data documenting the various flows among retirement states.

 Couples coordinate their retirement despite age differences and differences in incentives to
retire (Hurd, 1990; Gustman and Steinmeier, 2000b, 2004; Maestas, 2001; and Michaud, 2003).
A general overview of bargaining within the family is provided by Lundberg (1999).
Bourguignon, Browning and Chiappori (2006) discuss decision making at the family level,
including the inconsistencies between the data and parameters estimated for a unified model in
which a single utility function is used to describe the consumption and labor supply of the
family. For a nonparametric analysis of the determinants of household consumption that focuses
on the problems of a unitary model in analyzing household consumption, but restricts the sample
of couples to those that are fully employed and thus does not include an analysis of the
determinants of labor supply, see Cherchye, De Rock and Vermeulen (2009).

                                                                                                     5
immediate change in benefits from postponing retirement (or benefit claiming), but also the

option value of being able to continue at work.

        One important limitation of reduced form models should be noted. They are unable to

explain a key feature of the retirement hazard, the spike in retirements at age 62. It is not that the

authors are unaware of the importance of the spike in retirement. Reduced form models often

include age specific dummy variables on the right hand side of a retirement equation. The

coefficient on a variable indicating the individual is age 62 is typically highly significant and

very large. This coefficient estimate indicates the height of the retirement spike and age 62, but it

does not explain the spike. The problem is that as soon as Social Security benefits become

available at age 62, those with high time preference claim their benefits. Because the Social

Security benefit structure is actuarially fair, the changes in the present value of benefits with

retirement typically included in reduced form retirement equations are zero. Nor can a reduced

form equation with an age dummy at 62 be used to analyze the effects of changing policies that

have generated the spike. More generally, reduced form models confound the effects of

unmeasured preferences with the economic incentives created by retirement programs, limiting

the ability to predict the likely effects of policy changes on retirement outcomes.

        A related approach uses difference-in-difference analysis to analyze the effects of

changes in government programs. Krueger and Pischke’s (1992) analysis of the effects of the

notch in Social Security on retirement is a well known early example. In cases, where there are

no unmeasured differences between the control group and the experimentals that affect

retirement, the difference-in-difference analysis will successfully indicate the effects of the

change being studied on retirement. However, this approach is not useful for analyzing the likely

effects of new and untried policies, such as raising the Social Security early entitlement age.



                                                                                                     6
        In view of inability of reduced form equations to explain the key features of retirement

outcomes and the related limitations of reduced form difference-in-difference analyses,

researchers have continued working to improve structural retirement models. These models

incorporate the separate influences of preferences and elements of budget constraint, including

incentives shaped by Social Security and related retirement policies. 3

        Although the specifications of structural models are much more complex than reduced

form equations, most structural models rely on simplifying assumptions to facilitate estimation.

Unfortunately, in many cases these simplifications are not innocuous. As we will see,

oversimplification frequently limits the ability of the model to explain key characteristics of

retirement behavior. Even worse, oversimplification sometimes confounds various causes and/or

creates biased estimates.

        Many structural retirement models ignore partial retirement and/or the complexity of

retirement dynamics. 4 Some models include partial retirement but ignore reverse flows

(Gustman and Steinmeier, 1986a), while other include retirement dynamics, but ignore partial

retirement. For example, while Blau and Gilleskie (2006) pay a great deal of attention to the

dynamic structure of the dependent labor market status measure, Cutler, Liebman and Smyth




        3
           The strength of reduced form studies is that they do not impose a rigid structure, so
they are not subject to the kind of specification error that can affect the interpretation of key
parameters in a structural model. Moreover, there is a fear that identification of structural models
is based on functional form. As will be seen when we discuss our estimated model, however,
estimation is based on many very different moments, while a standard specification is used for
the utility function, greatly loosening the relation between identification and the form of the
utility function. Moreover, identification is to a large part determined by nonlinearities in the
budget constraint caused by retirement programs. These nonlinearities are estimated from
original pension documents obtained from employers, as well as from Social Security rules.
4
  An important early study by Berkovec and Stern (1991) included reverse flows in their
analysis. That study ignored the role of pensions, as described below.

                                                                                                   7
(2006, p. 19) note they make a trade-off by eliminating partial retirement as an option in the

model.

         Another major problem is that until recently, structural models of retirement did not

explicitly consider the joint determination of retirement and wealth. Saving was something that

went on in the background and parameter estimates did not take account of the level of wealth

accumulated by the household. These shortcomings were addressed by Rust and Phelan (1997),

who estimated a structural model that jointly considered retirement and saving. But they greatly

oversimplified the budget constraint by assuming that capital and insurance markets were

inoperative. French (2005) estimates a model with joint saving and retirement, a line of research

that continues in French and Jones (2004). Van der Klaauw and Wolpin (2006) also make a very

useful contribution in their joint analysis of retirement and wealth.

         However, these and other structural models continue to oversimplify the relation

between retirement and saving. For example, French (2005) assumes the same time preference

parameter for all individuals. As Cutler, Liebman and Smyth (2006) note, “French’s approach

does not allow for heterogeneity in preferences or heterogeneity in the data generating process

for the state variables. Moreover, French uses non-separable preferences that constrain the

income and substitution effect of an increase in wage levels to cancel.”

         Returning to the complex retirement variable, as Gustman and Steinmeier (2005) show, a

model must be able to explain the spikes in retirement observed in the data at ages 62 and 65, as

well as the very wide distributions of wealth at each level of lifetime earnings. 5 However, other

simplifications found in recent contributions to the structural retirement literature also


         5
        Gustman and Steinmeier (1999) and Venti and Wise (1999) demonstrate the extent to
which asset accumulation varies among those who have the same lifetime earnings.


                                                                                                     8
importantly affect the ability of the model to reproduce retirement and wealth outcomes. For

example, Van der Klaauw and Wolpin (2006) allow for heterogeneity in the consumption

parameter, but not in the time preference rate. Heterogeneity in the consumption parameter is not

sufficient to simultaneously generate a reasonable wealth distribution and a spike in retirement at

age 62. Unless there is some arbitrary parameter in the utility function at age 62, we are

essentially back to the same problem that plagues the reduced form option value model.

        Some investigators who recognize the important effects of simplification resort to

estimating for limited subsamples to avoid having to include certain complexities in their

models. For example, a researcher whose model cannot address nonlinearities, such as those

created by discontinuities commonly found in defined benefit pension formulas, may limit the

sample to those who do not have a defined benefit pension. Rust and his colleagues (in Benitez-

Silva et al., 1999 and Benitez-Silva et al., 2004) limit the sample to exclude those who are

covered by a pension. Van der Klaauw and Wolpin (2006) eliminate from their sample those

who have a DB plan on their current job, as well as those who had a DC plan at any time. French

(2005) uses summary measures of pension incentives rather than the individual accrual profiles

relevant to the particular observation. Bound et al. (2006) assume, counterfactually, that all

defined contribution assets and nonpension wealth are paid out as an annuity. In addition, they

do not allow saving in their model. As a result, all payments are assumed to be immediately

consumed and there is too rigid a linkage between the timing of income, including the assumed

timing of income from assets, and the timing of expenses. Resulting parameter estimates are

highly unlikely to be representative of the population values, especially since a large majority of

couples approaching retirement age who are covered by a pension continue to be covered by a

defined benefit pension plan (Gustman, Steinmeier and Tabatabai, 2010a).



                                                                                                      9
        Gustman and Steinmeier (2005) models the joint determination of retirement and wealth,

while Gustman, Steinmeier and Tabatabai (2010b) allows reversals of flows from states of

greater to lesser retirement. These studies are able to reproduce spikes in the retirement hazard of

appropriate size at ages 62 and 65. However, these papers take the retirement decision of the

spouse to be exogenous.

        Some retirement studies include the effects of joint retirement decision making of

husbands and wives, but most do not. Most studies include families, both those with

single earners and those including two earners, but they either ignore spouse earnings, or

if included treat spouse earnings as exogenously determined. For example, Bound et al.

(2006) confine their estimation to single individuals, and thus do not deal with

interactions between spouses at the level of the family.

        Turning now to studies that do focus on joint retirement decision making, some models

such as Coile (1999) are clearly reduced form. They will be of only limited help in policy

analysis, and the parameters estimated cannot be directly related to the deeper parameters from

the utility function and separated from the elements of the budget constraint.

        There are a few structural studies of the determination of retirement within the

household. To simplify analysis to make room for considerations arising at the family

level, the studies currently available do not include many of the advances found in

structural retirement models of the behavior of individuals. For example, Gustman and

Steinmeier (2000) focuses on the joint determination of retirement, but the analysis does

not include partial retirement, reverse retirement flows, or the joint determination of

saving. In the absence of consideration of the joint determination of household wealth

together with the retirement decisions of each spouse, the models lose their ability to



                                                                                                  10
generate the key spike in retirement at age 62. Blau and Gilleskie (2006) pay a great deal

of attention to the dynamic structure of the dependent labor market status measure, but

again do not include saving or related behavior. Other studies of retirement suffering from

these or related limitations include Blau (1997, 1998) and Michaud (2003). Gustman and

Steinmeier (2004), a model that jointly addresses retirement and saving decisions in a

family context, nevertheless ignores partial retirement.

        Once independent decision making is allowed within the context of a family

model, it is useful to consider the various ways in which the retirement decisions of

spouses may be related. Gustman and Steinmeier (2000) estimate the separate effects of

correlation in budget constraints, correlation in preferences, and dependence of

preferences of one spouse on the retirement status of the other.

        A simple model for analyzing the retirement dates of the two individuals assumes

a household utility function which is a weighted average of the utility functions of the two

spouses. Blundell et al. (2001) uses a static, working life framework. There is no saving,

and the emphasis seems to be on the issue of whether consumption is private to the two

spouses or public between them. The analysis considers the relative weight in the decision

process given to each spouse. In this setting, the problem reverts to maximizing a single

function with respect to the budget constraint. The weights can be variable, as in Maestas

(2001), where the weights depend on the responses of the two spouses to questions

relating to which spouse has more influence on the financial decisions of the household. 6


6
 Blundell et al. (2001) use weighted utility functions, but in this model (and unlike Maestas) the
weights have an unobserved effects component. Since they eventually linearize virtually
everything, this does not have serious consequences, but it would introduce some large
difficulties in a more structural environment.

                                                                                                11
The weighting model can reproduce joint retirement in approximately the right amounts.

However, the weighting model does not reproduce the spike in retirements at age 62.7

        Consider another simplification in the basic specifications adopted in these

models. In modeling retirement within the family, Maestas (2001) attempts to distinguish

the effects of correlated preferences from bargaining power within the family and

introduces information from the HRS on the relative influence of each spouse on decision

making within the family. However, she assumes that husbands respond to leisure

complementarity while the wife does not, a relationship that should be a product of her

analysis.

        The models of family retirement also simplify their treatment of pensions. Even

though employer provided pension data are very useful in identifying the sources of

incentives independently affecting the behavior of husbands and wives, most family

retirement models do not include the separate incentives of pension plans held by each

spouse. Thus this important source of identification is not available to studies that

eliminate those with a pension from the sample, or who use files with imputed pension

wealth that by design cannot catch the nonlinearities creating the spike in DB accrual

profiles at early retirement age (e.g., Cutler, Liebman and Smythe, 2006). Taking an

analogous approach, Maestas (2001) throws out observations with DB plans so she can


7
  Note that it is in general never optimal for the standpoint of one spouse to have the remaining
spouse retire earlier, since this does not increase the utility of the first spouse’s retirement and
only reduces the income available for consumption. Since weighting means that the retirement of
each spouse is in effect a compromise between the desires of the two spouses, it tends to
eliminate the spikes in retirement that would otherwise be apparent. In our attempts to estimate
the model using weighted functions, the retirement spikes of the two spouses were small
fractions of 1 percentage point. Thus while we expect interdependence of spouse decision
making to reduce the age 62 spike somewhat, and to spread retirements to other years, using a
weighted function reduces the age 62 spike much too much, virtually eliminating it.

                                                                                                 12
ignore the pension spikes, losing an important potential source of model identification

between husbands and wives in the process. Michaud (2003) also ignores the spikes in

accruals. Turning once again to Maestas (2001), she also assumes there is a perfect capital

market and that one can freely borrow from Social Security and pension wealth. Once the

assumption of perfect capital markets is relaxed, as discussed previously, it is important to

allow for heterogeneity in time preference, something none of these models allows.

Gustman and Steinmeier (2000, 2004), precursors to the current paper, provide an

exception.

        All of these efforts by previous researchers have contributed to our understanding

of joint retirement behavior within the household, and suggest a number of basic

conclusions. They provide an important foundation for ongoing analyses. But the extent

of omissions and simplifications creates doubt about the reliability of their findings. To

address the remaining questions, we turn to a more comprehensive specification of the

family retirement model, and attempt to estimate it using all of the information available

in the HRS for describing retirement and saving behavior.

                                   III. The Dynamic, Stochastic Model

        The utility functions of the two spouses are fairly standard functions of consumption (a

public good within the household) and labor supply over the lifetime. For the husband, the

lifetime utility function is give by:

                                  ⎡ −ρt
                                                        (                                               ) ⎤
                              T            3

                             ∑            ∑s                    C αm,t + e X t β h + ε h VLh (Lht , Lwt ) ⎥ .
                                                                             h
                      Uh =        ⎢e             m, t
                                                            1
                                                            α
                             t =0 ⎣       m =1                                                            ⎦

In this function, Cm,t is consumption at time t in survival state m, where m is an indicator

whether both spouses are still living at time t, only the husband is living at time t, or only the



                                                                                                                13
wife is living. sm,t is the probability that the household will be in state m at time t. Lht and Lwt

are the leisure amounts of the husband and wife, respectively, at time t, and VLh is the value of

leisure to the husband. Note that the value of leisure to the husband may depend on the amount

of leisure of the wife in the same period. The exponential form preceding VLh is a multiplicative

factor for the value of leisure. It consists of a standard linear form Xβ plus an individual effect

ε which reflects the strength of the husband’s preferences for retirement over work. The

elements of X contain a constant, age, and health status. As age increases, work gradually

becomes more onerous and retirement more desirable. When the utility of retirement exceeds the

utility of consumption from the income earned from work, retirement occurs.

       Leisure can take on three values associated with full-time work, partial retirement, and

full retirement. The value of retirement for the husband can be modified if the wife is also

retired. For the case where the wife is working full-time, the basic value of leisure VLh for the

husband is normalized to zero if he is working full-time, unity if he is fully retired, and VPh if

he is partially retired. Note that if leisure is a normal good, which we assume that it is, the value

of VPh should fall between one-half and one if partial retirement is equated with approximately

half-time work. The closer the value is to one, the greater the value of partial retirement is

relative to full retirement, and the more frequently and longer should be the spells of partial

retirement.

       The model allows for the value of retirement to be increased if the husband prefers to

spend time with the wife, and the wife is also retired. In the case without partial retirement, this

can be accomplished simply by adding a term to the Xβ linear form that has whether the spouse

is retired as an additional variable. With partial retirement, however, the picture is a little more

complex. The general idea is that the wife’s retirement adds to the utility of the husband’s

                                                                                                       14
retirement only up to the point of the husband’s retirement. If the husband is partially retired, it

doesn’t matter whether the wife is fully retired or partially retired, since the additional leisure of

the wife if she is fully retired doesn’t add anything to the husband’s leisure during the time that

the husband is at work. If the husband is fully retired, however, it does make a difference

whether the wife is partially retired or fully retired, since only the part of his leisure that he

shares with the wife is augmented. If the augmentation factor is g, the values of the function

VLh as a function of its two arguments can be written as follows:

                                                        Husband’s Retirement Status

                                                Full-Time         Partial                 Full
                                                 Work            Retirement            Retirement

 Wife’s         Full-Time Work                      0                  VPh                  1
Retirement      Partial Retirement                  0                 g VPh           g VPh + (1 - VPh )
  Status        Full Retirement                     0                 g VPh                 g

        If the husband is working full time, he doesn’t have any leisure, and the value of the

leisure is zero regardless of the retirement status of the wife. If the husband is partially retired,

the value of leisure is VPh if the wife is working full-time, and this gets multiplied by a factor of

g if the wife is working at least part time. If the husband is fully retired, the value of leisure is

unity, and this again gets multiplied by a factor of g if the wife is also fully retired. If the wife is

partially retired, then we can divide the husband’s leisure into two parts. The partial retirement

leisure has a value of VPh , and this gets multiplied by g because the wife is also partially

retired. The remaining leisure has a value of 1 - VPh , but this leisure does not get multiplied

because the wife is not there for this leisure. The total value of the husband’s leisure is the sum

of these two parts.

        The utility function of the wife is symmetric:

                                                                                                        15

Where the superscripts and subscripts w refer to the wife’s utility and leisure. The budget

constraint for the family is given by the asset evolution equation:

            A t +1 = (1 + rt ) A t + (1 − Lht ) Wth + Bht + (1 − Lwt ) Wtw + B wt + I t − C m,t

All quantities in the equation are measured in real terms. Assets, which are constrained to be

non-negative, grow at the real interest rate rt. The second term on the right side is the husband’s

earnings, and the fourth term is the wife’s earnings. The third and fifth terms are the husband’s

and wife’s pension and Social Security benefits, respectively. Although not indicated by the

notation, these benefits depend on the past work and retirement decisions. In the case of Social

Security, these can even depend on the past work and retirement decisions of the spouse. The

term It is any inheritances that the household may receive, and the last term is household

consumption. Note that consumption is dependent on the survival state of the household, and that

the budget constraint must hold regardless of the mortality experience.

       The stochastic structure of the model is as follows. The real interest rate rt is stochastic

and is assumed to come from the actual distribution of asset returns, as documented by Ibbotson.

The time periods in this model are annual, and we assume that asset returns are uncorrelated over

time, which is approximately the case. The time preference parameter ρ is assumed to be

heterogeneous over the population of households, and we treat the value of this parameter as

being a fixed effect whose value is estimated for every household in the population. 8 The


8
 It would be preferable to allow time preference to have separate values for each of the two
spouses. However, allowing for separate time preference parameters for each spouse within the
household would introduce enough additional complexity to preclude our being able to estimate
the model.

                                                                                                               16
mortality outcomes reflected in the underlying the survival state probabilities sm,t are also

considered stochastic.

       The two epsilon terms in the linear forms multiplying leisure, εh and εw, are considered

to come from normal distributions with a mean of zero and standard deviations of σh and σw,

respectively, and with a correlation parameter ρε. These terms allow husbands and wives to have

different preferences for leisure vs. work, and the correlation allows for the possibility that one

reason that the spouses in households may retire at about the same time is that the two spouses

share the same attitudes toward leisure vs. work. For estimation purposes, the initial values of

these two epsilon terms are treated as random effects. After the individual first leaves full-time

work, the value of leisure may suffer an unanticipated change. For instance, it may fall if the

individual finds that leisure is not as pleasurable as anticipated. This may provide one reason

why individuals return to work after retirement. To provide for this possibility, the model allows

the value of the epsilons to change over time after the initial retirement, with correlation

parameters over time of ρh and ρw for the husband and wife, respectively. We considered the

possibility that the spouses might anticipate that the values of leisure might change after

retirement, but this led to problems that are discussed in Appendix 2. As a result, the model

assumes that these changes are completely unanticipated.

       The final stochastic elements, which are stochastic from the estimator’s point of view but

not from the individual’s point of view, are the values of partial retirement, VPh and VPw . These

                                                                          h   h
are assumed to come from an exponential distribution f ( VPh ) = c e γ t VP defined over the

interval 0.5 to 1, where c is a factor necessary to make the integral of the distribution over the

allowable range equal to 1, as must be the case for all distributions. The higher γ ht , the greater

the probability that the husband’s value of VPh will be close to 1, which would make it more

                                                                                                       17
likely that he will go through a period of partial retirement. Conditional on employment, the

probability of partial retirement increases with age. Accordingly, we allow the value of γ ht to

increase with age according to the equation γ ht = γ oh + γ1h a ht , where a ht is the husband’s age

at time t. We characterize the husband’s relative preference for partial retirement as not

changing. Consequently, the model assumes that the husband’s relative position within this

distribution does not change even as the entire distribution changes to higher values of VPh . The

values VPh for the wife are treated in a symmetric way.

       The sequence of events in the model is as follows. In every period, the couple starts with

a level of assets. If the husband was still in his career job in the previous period and if that job

had a defined contribution pension, he may also have a given level of defined contribution

pension assets. If he was not in the career job in the previous period but had a defined benefit

pension in that job, he may also have a pension benefit amount, which may or may not be

currently collectable. The same situation with regard to pension amounts also applies to the wife.

Further, the household may be eligible to collect a given level of Social Security benefits, either

currently or sometime in the future. Given their current situation, the spouses make their

decisions as to what their retirement status (working full-time, partial retirement, or full

retirement) will be during the current period, and how much they will save or spend down from

their accumulated assets. At the end of the current period, a random draw is taken from the

distribution of asset returns, and assets plus any defined contribution amounts are assumed to

grow at that rate of asset returns. One of the spouses may die, causing a transition between the

survival states. Depending on the retirement status decisions made in the current period, the

amount of future defined benefit pensions and Social Security amounts may also be increased.



                                                                                                       18
       The model assumes that before age 50, the spouses are working at whatever their

earnings were before age 50. After age 70, the spouses are assumed to be retired. These

assumptions are made in order to reduce computational burden somewhat. Between ages 50 and

70, the spouses make their decisions about working full-time, partially retiring, or fully retiring.

With two utility functions, two decision makers, and one budget constraint, the solution of the

model is not as obvious as in the case with a single utility function. The mechanism by which

they make these decisions is relatively complex and is described in detail in the next section.

Note that if one of the spouses is below 50 years of age or above 70, and the other is within the

50 to 70 age range, only the spouse within the age range will need to make a work/retirement

decision. At all ages, however, decisions are made as to how much to consume, given income in

the current period and the assets owned when the couple entered the period.

       The number of state variables depends on what period of life the spouses are in, and

whether they are still in their career jobs. For all ages, one of the state variables is the amount of

accumulated assets. Below age 50, the primary additional state variable is the amount

accumulated in defined contribution pension plans, if the career job had these kinds of pensions.

Up to age 70, each spouse has a value of ε, which relates to the preference for work vs.

retirement. After age 70, ε is irrelevant, since past that age individuals are presumed to be retired.

Between ages 50 and 70, the most important state variable is whether each spouse is still in his or

her career job. If so, the associated state variable is the amount in the defined contribution plan.

If the spouse has left the career job, there are two state variables associated with pensions and a

third associated with Social Security. One pension variable relates to the level of pension

benefits, and the other is a binary variable related to whether the individual can currently receive

the benefits or must wait until a later date, as would occur if the individual had left the career job



                                                                                                    19
before becoming eligible for early retirement benefits. The Social Security variable is one of a

pair of such variables (one for the husband and one for the wife) that define the level of joint

Social Security benefits that the couple is eligible for. The pension and Social Security variables

are initially set at the point the individual leaves the career job. For the pension variable, this

value is adjusted downward over time, since few pensions are fully indexed for inflation. For the

Social Security variable, the value for future periods may be increased if the individual returns to

full-time work or engages in partial retirement work, an increase that is due either to a reduction

in the early reduction amount or an increase in the delayed retirement amount. However, the

amount of the Social Security value that may be collected in the current period may be reduced if

the individual works either full-time or part-time and the earnings from that work exceed the

earnings test limit of Social Security. Past age 70, the pension amounts (except for the inflation

erosion) and the Social Security amounts are fixed at their levels at age 70.

        In the estimations and simulations, all continuous variables (assets, the epsilons, pension

and Social Security amounts) are broken down into a vector of discrete amounts. If required, any

amount between these discrete amounts is interpolated.



                                      IV. The Decision Process

        This section describes the process by which, in each period, the husband decides how

much he will work and the wife decides how much she will work. Each spouse is cognizant of

the possibility that their own decision may influence the decision of the spouse, and they take

account of these ramifications in making their own decision. Since these decisions are being

made in a backwards induction framework, it is assumed that the spouses have already calculated

how their current decisions will affect their future decisions.



                                                                                                      20
A. Joint Decisions with a Work/Retirement Choice.

        To begin this analysis, it will help to look first at a framework where each spouse is

deciding either to work full time or retire. This leaves the analysis of partial retirement until later

in the section. In such a framework, the joint decision result has four possibilities: both spouses

work; both spouses retire; the husband works and the wife retires; and the husband retires and the

wife works. These possibilities can be represented by the following grid:

                                               Husband’s Decision

                                               Work            Retire

                Wife’s         Work               A               B

                Decision       Retire             C               D

Thus, decision B is for the husband to retire and the wife to work, and similarly with the other

alternatives.

        Both the husband and the wife have utility values associated with each of these

alternatives. Let U hB be the husband’s utility if the wife works and the husband retires. This

utility will include the utility of decisions in future periods, given the income and consumption in

the current period and any restrictions that the current decision to work places on future

decisions. For instance, the decision to be retired in the current period may mean that in any

future periods the wage rate for full-time work will be lower than if the husband had continued in

his career job. Similarly, U Cw would denote the wife’s utility if she retires and the husband works

full time.

        If U hA < U hB , it means that the husband prefers to retire, given that the wife is working

full-time. If U Ch > U hD , it means that the husband prefers working full-time, give that the wife




                                                                                                     21
is retired. This situation can be represented by drawing horizontal arrows between the

corresponding decision points, as follows:

                                      A       →      B

                                      C       ←      D

where the arrows point to the preferred decision between the two choices. If U Aw > U Cw , it

means that the wife prefers working full time to retirement, given that the husband is also

working full-time. If U Bw < U Dw , it means that the wife prefers retirement to working, given

than the husband is retired. The situation for the wife can be represented by vertical arrows

between the corresponding decision points:

                                      A              B
                                      ↑              ↓
                                      C              D

where again the arrows point to the preferred decision between the two choices. We can

represent the combined preferences for both the husband and the wife by including both sets of

arrows, as follows:

                                      A       →      B
                                      ↑              ↓
                                      C       ←      D

       Since it takes four arrows to denote the relative preferences of both the husband and wife,

and since any of these arrows can point in two directions, there are sixteen combinations of

arrows that represent any combination of preferences of the two spouses. These sixteen

combinations may be represented as follows:




                                                                                                  22

We will analyze each of these combinations in turn. Since the combinations below the main

diagonal of this chart (combinations 5, 9, 10, 13, 14, and 15) are mirror reflections of

combinations above the main diagonal, we need only to analyze the combinations on or above

the main diagonal, and the results can be applied to the mirror images.

        1. This is a case where the husband wants to retire, given the wife’s decision, and the

wife wants to do likewise. But the arrows do not take account of the fact that each spouse’s

decision may influence the other spouse’s decision. The husband has two choices: to retire

regardless of the wife’s decision or to wait to see what the wife will do and then decide what he

wants to do as a result. If he retires, he knows that his wife will also retire, and the result will be

combination D. If he waits to make his decision, the decision shifts to the wife. She knows that

if she retires, he will too, and the result will be combination D. If neither one takes the decision

to retire, they will stay at combination A. Thus, the final choice for both spouses is between

combination A and combination D. If either spouse prefers combination D to combination

A, that spouse will retire, and the other spouse will follow, and the final result will be

combination D. But if both spouses prefer combination A to combination D, neither spouse


                                                                                                      23
will have the incentive to be the first to retire, and the final result will be combination A, which

both spouses prefer.

        2. In this case the husband prefers to retire if the wife works, but to work if the wife

retires. The wife wants to retire, given either decision of the husband. The key to understanding

this case is to compare the husband’s utility of combinations A and C. These are two

combinations where the husband is working, but the wife is either working or retired. Since the

husband is working and the utility value of leisure is zero, whether the wife works or not does

not affect the value of the leisure term in the husband’s utility function. However, if she works,

there will be additional income to the family, and this additional income will increase the

consumption component of the husband’s utility function. Hence, the husband’s utility will be

higher if the wife works, and he will prefer combination A to combination C. Since in this case

the husband prefers combination C to combination D and combination B to combination A, this

gives a strict ordering of the husband’s preferences among the four combinations: B > A > C >

D, where combination B is the most preferred and combination D is the least preferred.

        The husband might prefer combination B to combination A, but he knows that if he

retires his wife will certainly follow suit, leaving him with combination D, his least preferred

result. To avoid this, the husband will continue working. The wife knows that the husband will

continue working in any case, so her choice is between combination A and combination C.

According to her preferences, she chooses combination C. Thus, combination C is the final result

in this case.

        3. Here, the wife’s preference is to retire, given a retirement decision by the husband. For

the husband, his preference is to do the same thing as his wife does, given her decision. This case

is similar to case 1. The husband knows that if he retires first, his wife will follow, leading to



                                                                                                     24
combination D. The wife knows that if she retires first, her husband will follow, again leading to

combination D. If neither retires, they will remain at combination A. The final decision depends

on the relative preferences between combinations A and D by the two spouses. If either spouse

prefers combination D to combination A, that spouse will retire, and the other spouse will follow

suit. If both spouses prefer combination A to combination D, neither spouse will want to be the

first to retire, and combination A will be the result.

       4. This is a case where the husband wants to work, given either decision of his wife, and

the wife wants to retire, given either decision of her husband. The husband knows that if he

retires, his wife will too, and combination D will be the result. However, by the same reasoning

as in case 2, the husband will prefer combination A to combination C, and given the preferences

in this case he will prefer combination C to combination D. By transitivity, this means that both

combinations A and C are preferred to combination D, so the husband will not want to be the

first to retire. Given that the husband is continuing to work, his wife’s choice comes down to

combination A or combination C, and given her preferences, she will choose combination C.

Thus, the final result in this case is combination C.

       6. In this case, both partners want to do the opposite of their spouse’s choice, given their

spouse’s choice. By the same reasoning as was applied to case 2, the four outcomes can be

ranked by the husband as B > A > C > D, with combination B as the most preferred and

combination D as the least preferred. Symmetric reasoning applied to the wife’s preferences

yields a ranking by the wife of the four outcomes as C > A > B > D, with combination C as the

most preferred and combination D as the least preferred. The ideal situation for the husband

would be for him to retire first. In this case, the best choice for the wife would be for her to

continue working, leading to choice B. This is the best outcome from the husband’s perspective,



                                                                                                   25
but only the third choice outcome for the wife. For the wife, her ideal situation is for her to retire

first. If she does this, her husband will continue to work, and the outcome will be combination C.

This is her most preferred outcome, but not so good for the husband.

       The incentives for this case are for each spouse to be the first to retire. But if they both

retire, the result will be combination D, which is the worst result for both spouses. We assume in

this case that the spouses cooperate enough that they want to avoid the worst result, and that

neither one retires. This would lead to combination A, which although not the most preferred

outcome for either spouse, is the second choice outcome for both spouses. This avoids a

destructive race to see who can be the first to retire, which risks producing the least preferred

outcome for both spouses.

       7. This is a case where the husband wants to do the same thing as the wife, given the

wife’s decision, but she wants to do the opposite of the husband, given his decision. The key to

analyzing this case is to look as the wife’s ordering of the four outcomes. By the same reasoning

as used in case 6 (which is symmetric to the reasoning used in case 2), her ordering of the four

outcomes is C > A > B > D, where C is her most preferred outcome and D is her least preferred

outcome. She knows that if she retires, her husband will follow suit, and the result will be

combination D, which is her least preferred outcome. Thus, she will not want to retire. This

leaves the husband with the choice between combinations A and B, and by his preferences in this

case he will choose not to retire. This leaves the final result in this case as combination A, where

both spouses continue working.

       8. Here, the husband wants to continue working, given either choice by the wife, while

the wife prefers to work if the husband retires and retire if the husband works. For the wife, by

the same reasoning used in case 5, the ordering of her preferences is C > A > B > D. If the wife



                                                                                                      26
retires first, the husband will continue working, and the resulting combination C will give her the

most preferred outcome. If the husband were to retire first, the wife would continue to work, and

the resulting outcome would be combination B. The final result depends on the husband’s

evaluation of combination B vs. combination C, an ordering that is not a priori determined by the

preferences in this case. If the husband prefers combination C, he may simply let the wife retire

first. If the husband prefers combination B to combination C, the situation reverts to much the

same situation as occurred in case 6. Both spouses will have an incentive to retire first, but if

both succeed in retiring, the result will be combination D. This combination is the least preferred

result for the wife. For the husband, the ordering of the outcomes becomes A > B > C > D, so

that combination D is his least preferred outcome as well. Thus, both spouses would have an

incentive to avoid the consequences of both of them trying to retire first, and both retiring. We

assume that in this case, the spouses cooperate enough that neither of them tries to be the first to

retire, and the resulting outcome of combination A is more preferred by both spouses than is

combination D, which would be the result if both of them tried to retire first and both succeeded.

The final outcome in this case is combination C if the husband prefers combination C to

combination B, and combination A otherwise.

       11. In this case, both spouses prefer to do the same thing as the other spouse, given the

other spouse’s decision. The husband knows that if he retires his wife will as well, and the

resulting outcome will be combination D. Symmetrically, the wife knows that if she retires, her

husband will too, with combination D as the result. If neither retires, the result will be

combination A. The final outcome depends on the assessment of both spouses of combination A

relative to combination D. If either spouse finds that combination D is preferable to combination

A, that spouse will retire and the other spouse will follow, with combination D as the final result.



                                                                                                    27
If both spouses find that combination A is preferable to combination D, neither will want to be

the first to retire, and the final outcome will be combination A.

       12. The preferences in this case indicate that the husband wants to work, given either

decision by the wife, while the wife wants to do the same thing as the husband, given the

husband’s decision. This is perhaps the most complicated of the cases. The husband knows that

if he retires, the wife will also retire, and the resulting outcome will be combination D. If the

husband prefers combination A to combination D, he will want to continue working. Since the

wife will want to continue workings if the husband continues working, the resulting outcome

will be combination A. If, on the other hand, the husband prefers combination D to combination

A, he will have an incentive to retire. If the wife prefers combination D to combination C, she

will allow him to retire, and she will follow, resulting in combination D being the outcome. If,

however, she prefers combination C to combination D, she would want to be the first to retire,

since if she retires first, the husband will continue working. This outcome would also be

preferable to the husband over combination D, so he will refrain from retiring and allow the wife

to retire first. The final outcome will be combination A if the husband prefers it over

combination D. Otherwise, the outcome will be combination D if the wife prefers it over

combination C, and if not the outcome will be combination C.

       16. This case reflects a situation where both spouses want to continue working, given

either decision of the other spouse. The husband knows that if he retires first, the wife will

continue to work. This would result in combination B, which the husband finds less preferable

than combination A. Similarly, the wife knows that if she retires first, the husband will continue

to work. For her, the resulting combination C is less preferable than combination A. Thus, both




                                                                                                    28
spouses will have an incentive not to retire, and the final result is that both of them will work,

yielding combination A as the result.

        These results may be summed up in the following table:

                                           Husband’s Preferences

In the table, the columns represent the husband’s preferences. For instance, the second column

corresponds to the case where U hA < U hB (the husband prefers to retire, given that the wife is

working) and U Ch > U hD (the husband prefers to work, given that the wife is retired). The rows

refer to the wife’s preferences. In several cases, the preferences between working and retiring,

given the retirement state of the spouse, are not sufficient by themselves to determine the

decision, in which case other relationships between the utilities of one or both spouses are

required to ascertain which outcome will be chosen.


                                                                                                     29
B. Decisions with Partial Retirement.

         The addition of partial retirement introduces a third choice for both the husband and the

wife, but the general method of analysis remains the same. To analyze the choices with partial

retirement, we denote the nine possible outcomes as follows:

                                                          Husband’s Retirement State

                                             Working              Partially Retired         Fully Retired

Wife’s          Working                          A                        B                        C

Retirement      Partially Retired                D                        E                        F

State           Fully Retired                    G                        H                        I

Again, each of these states has a utility value associated with it for both the husband and the

wife. Each spouse knows that the other spouse may react to their decision, and they make their

own decisions with regard to the other spouse’s reactions.

         The general approach is similar to the case previously described with only the two

choices of working or retirement. At the beginning of each period each spouse calculates the

utility of retiring, given the other spouse’s reaction. Each spouse then ascertains whether it would

be better to go ahead and retire, given the other spouse’s reaction, or continue working and

allowing the other spouse to make the decision either to continue working or retire. If both

spouses conclude that they are better off working, or if only one spouse concludes that it is in his

or her interest to retire first, then those decisions determine the final outcome. If each spouse

concludes that it is in his or her interest to be the first to retire, then there is a possible conflict in

the decisions that is in need of resolution.

         To be more specific, consider the case of the husband deciding whether to be the first to

retire. If he initially retires fully, then the wife must decide, given the husband’s decision to retire



                                                                                                         30
fully, whether to continue working, to partially retire, or to retire fully herself. Call the utility

value of the resulting combination U hFR , which indicates the final utility if the husband makes

the initial decision to fully retire. An alternative is for the husband to initially retire partially. In

that case, the wife must again decide whether to continue working, to retire partially, or to retire

fully. If she decides to retire partially, that corresponds to combination E on the diagram above.

But the repercussions may not stop there. In response to her decision to retire partially, the

husband may decide to retire fully as a result, and it is possible that this may further induce the

wife to retire fully. The analysis from combination E may be done in the same fashion as the

two-by-two analysis done previously, considering only the combinations E, F, H, and I. From E,

any of these combinations are possible as each spouse decides whether it is in his or her best

interest to retire fully, given that both spouses are at least partially retired. An alternative for the

wife is that she may decide to retire fully, given that her husband has partially retired. In this

case, she takes into account that her husband may decide to retire fully if she does. Given the

possible reactions of the husband, then, the wife compares the utility of the final outcomes and

decides whether to partially retire or fully retire, given that her husband partially retires. For the

husband, the utility of the final outcome, given his initial decision to partially retire, may be

denoted as U hPR . For the husband, the decision as to whether he is better off by initially retiring

partially or fully is determined by comparing U hFR and U hPR . H would make the choice

associated with the greater utility. That utility may be denoted as U hR , which may be interpreted

as the utility that the husband would derive if he were the first to make the decision to retire in

some form. The wife makes a symmetric decision as to what her utility would be if she were the

first to make the decision to retire in some form. Call this utility U Rw .



                                                                                                        31
          Each spouse must then make the decision whether it would be advantageous to retire

first. If the husband retires first, his utility would be U hR . If he does not retire first, then the wife

would choose whether to retire or to keep working. That is, she would choose between her

retirement choice, with utility U Rw , or the outcome where both spouses were working full-time,

which for her has a utility value of U wW . Let the higher utility value be denoted as U wwC , where

the subscript wC stands for “wife’s choice.” Correspondingly, let the husband’s utility for this

outcome be U hwC . This is basically the utility for the husband if he initially just keeps on

working. The husband then compares U hR to U hwC to decide whether he wants to make the initial

move towards retirement. If U hR is the higher value, he wants to retire initially because if he

leaves the initial decision to his wife, the utility value will be lower. If U hwC is the higher value,

on the other hand, he is content to let the wife make the initial decision to retire if she so chooses

because that will yield a higher utility to the husband than if he retires first. Needless to say, the

wife is going through a similar process to decide whether it is to her advantage to be the first to

retire.

          There are four possible outcomes to this process. Each spouse may conclude that it is not

in his or her best interest to initiate retirement, in which case both will continue to work full-

time. A second possibility is that the husband may conclude that it in his best interest to partially

or fully retire, knowing that the wife may ultimately partially or fully retire as a result, and the

wife concludes that it is in her interest to let the husband do so. A third possibility is the

symmetric case where the wife concludes that it is in her best interest to initiate retirement, and

the husband concludes that it is in his interest to let her do so. In both the second and third cases,

there is no conflict between the spouses as to what to do, so the spouse that initially decides on


                                                                                                         32
retirement can do so, and the other spouse will respond accordingly. The fourth case is that both

spouses may decide that it is to their advantage to make the initial retirement decision before the

other. In this last case there is a conflict between the decisions of the two spouses which needs to

be resolved.

        If both spouses attempt to carry out their retirement desires simultaneously, the final

result depends on whether those desires were for partial retirement or full retirement. If both

spouses want to partially retire, then they would be a combination E in the diagram above. At

that point, one or both of them could decide that they would prefer to be fully retired, according

to the decision dynamics relating to the combinations E, F, H, and I. If the decision of one of the

spouses is full retirement, then the remaining spouse would have to choose whether, given the

full retirement decision of the first spouse, the second spouse wanted to be partially or fully

retired. If the decision of both spouses is to be fully retired, then that is the choice if both spouses

pursue their desired for retirement. Whatever the case, let the utility of the two spouses if they

both pursue retirement be given as U hbR and U bR
                                               w
                                                  , where bR signifies that both spouses are

pursuing their retirement goals.

        This is not the end of the story, however. It may well be that having both spouses

working dominates the scenario where both spouses try to retire. This would occur if U hW > U hbR

and U wW > U bR
             w
                . In this case, it is assumed that both spouses know that if they retire, the other

spouse will retire as well. For both spouses, it would be better to not retire as long as the other

spouse didn’t retire, and as a result both spouses would continue working. The economic

rationale for this case is that if one spouse retires, he or she loses not only his or her earnings, but

the earnings of the other spouse as well. Even if it turns out that having both spouses working

dominates having both retired, it may be true that allowing the husband to retire first (outcome

                                                                                                      33
hC) or the wife to retire first (outcome wC) dominates, for both spouses, having both spouses

working. If that occurs, then one spouse will allow the other spouse to make the retirement

decision which delivers a higher utility for both of them. Otherwise, if having both spouses

working dominates having both retired, the final outcome will be for both spouses to be working.

C. Unexpected Implications of the Decision Process.

       There are a couple of implications of this decision process that might not be expected, but

which have entirely logical explanations. The first is that retirement reversals can occur without

any changes in preferences (other than the increasing desire for retirement over time) or any

changes in effective compensation. Normally, without changes in preferences or compensation,

one would expect that once an individual retired, he or she would stay retired, since nothing has

changed to bring them out of retirement. But in the present model, that is not always the case.

       This effect can be illustrated with simple work/retirement decisions, without the need to

introduce additional complications via partial retirement. Suppose that in a given year, the

husband’s and the wife’s utility matrices look as follows:

                                                      Husband’s Decision
                                                      Work         Retire

                                                    Husband’s Payoff Matrix

               Wife’s         Work                  5.032577        5.026383
               Decision       Retire                5.023245        5.015767

                                                      Wife’s Payoff Matrix

               Wife’s         Work                  5.042582        4.997644
               Decision       Retire                5.072982        5.026156

Given these utility matrices, the husband prefers to work for any given retirement state of the

wife, and the wife prefers to be retired for any given retirement state of the husband. This




                                                                                                  34
corresponds to case 4 of the analysis in the previous part of this section, and in that analysis we

concluded that in this case, the husband will work and the wife will be retired.

        Suppose that a year later, the utility matrices look as follows:

                                                        Husband’s Decision
                                                        Work         Retire

                                                      Husband’s Payoff Matrix

                Wife’s          Work                  4.924987        4.931819
                Decision        Retire                4.915709        4.921649

                                                        Wife’s Payoff Matrix

                Wife’s          Work                  4.932621        4.889473
                Decision        Retire                4.967829        4.923471

The utility values are generally a little bit lower, largely reflecting the higher mortality rates as

individuals age. The wife still prefers retirement regardless of the retirement state of the husband,

but due to his being a year older, the husband now prefers to be retired regardless of the

retirement state of the wife. This corresponds to case 1 in the previous analysis. For that case, the

outcome depended on the comparisons of combination A, where both spouses worked, with

combination D, where both spouses are retired, for both spouses. For both spouses, combination

A is preferred, so the final result is that both spouses will be working. Since in the previous year,

the husband was working but the wife was retired, this means that the wife has switched back to

working from retirement even without any change in compensation or retirement preferences.

        The essence of this case can be summarized as follows. In the first year the wife is

retired, and the husband is working but is close to the border between working and being retired.

In the following year the husband crosses that border and would be retired if he were just giving

up his own earnings by doing so. Each spouse knows that if they retire rather than work, the

other spouse will also retire, because for each of them the extra consumption from their own


                                                                                                        35
earnings is insufficient to compensate for the lost leisure. However both spouses know that if

they retire and as a consequence the other spouse retires as well, they will lose both incomes.

Since in this example the loss of both incomes outweighs the loss of leisure for either spouse,

neither spouse sees an advantage in retiring as long as the other spouse does not retire. The wife

essentially returns to working as an inducement for the husband to continue working and provide

additional income which benefits them both.

       A second rather unexpected implication of the decision process is that higher wealth at

the beginning of the period, all other things being equal, may cause the work effort of one of the

spouses to increase, even if the work effort of the other spouse remains the same. This is contrary

to the usual implication that a pure wealth effect should cause a decline in labor supply.

       This effect can again be illustrated with a simple work/retirement decision, without the

need to introduce additional complications via partial retirement. Suppose that at a given level of

initial wealth, the husband’s and the wife’s utility matrices look as follows:

                                                       Husband’s Decision
                                                       Work         Retire

                                                     Husband’s Payoff Matrix

               Wife’s          Work                  4.288884        4.266913
               Decision        Retire                4.266930        4.261674

                                                       Wife’s Payoff Matrix

               Wife’s          Work                  4.312152        4.271539
               Decision        Retire                4.315635        4.271357

Using the previous analysis, this corresponds to case 8. The husband prefers to work regardless

of the retirement state of the wife. The wife prefers to be retired if the husband works, but if he is

retired she prefers to work. In the analysis of that case, the outcome depended on a comparison

of combinations B and C for the husband (B is the combination where the husband retires but the


                                                                                                   36
wife works, and C is the combination where the husband works and the wife retires). By a slight

margin, the husband prefers combination C to combination B, so the final result is that the

husband works and the wife retires.

          At a slightly higher level of initial wealth, the two utility matrices look as follows:

                                                         Husband’s Decision
                                                         Work         Retire

                                                       Husband’s Payoff Matrix

                 Wife’s          Work                  4.289692         4.267817
                 Decision        Retire                4.267776         4.262585

                                                         Wife’s Payoff Matrix

                 Wife’s          Work                  4.312960         4.272443
                 Decision        Retire                4.316480         4.272268

Note that all of the utility amounts, conditional on work status, have increased due to the

increased wealth. The pattern of utilities still fits the criteria for case 8, but in this case the

husband prefers combination B to combination C. In this case both spouses would like to be the

first to retire, since they know that if they retire first the other spouse will stay on the job.

However, if both retire, they will both arrive at combination D, the least preferred result, so they

both continue to work. Compared to the case with lower initial wealth, the husband’s work effort

has remained the same, but the wife’s work effort has increased in the case with higher initial

wealth.

          The essence of this situation may be explained as follows. At the lower level of wealth,

the husband finds it advantageous to work even if the wife retires. At a slightly higher level of

wealth, however, the husband finds retirement somewhat more appealing, he would prefer to be

retired and have the wife working rather than the other way around. In this case, both spouses

would like to retire and have the other work, but if they both retire they will be in the worst


                                                                                                      37
possible scenario for both of them. To forestall this, both agree to continue working. In essence,

the wife has changed her behavior to keep the husband working even though he would otherwise

retire at the higher wealth level.

D. Nash Equilibrium vs. Sequential Decisions.

        The difference between Nash equilibria and the results of the decision process described

above can be readily seen in the bivariate work/retirement scenario, so we will examine it in this

scenario rather than introduce the further complications of partial retirement. The simplest case is

illustrated in case 1 in part A of this section. In this case, both spouses would find it to their

advantage to retire, given either decision of the other spouse. The Nash equilibrium in this case is

straightforward: both spouses would retire. And yet, the possibility remains that both spouses

might be better off if both of them continued to work. The decision process described in this

paper recognizes that both spouses realize that if either of them retire, the other spouse will retire

as well, and hence they are both reluctant to retire for fear of inducing the other spouse to retire

as well. The essential difference is that the Nash equilibrium assumes that the actions of one

spouse have no impact on the decisions of the other spouse, which may be appropriate for a pair

of prisoners held incommunicado, but is probably less appropriate for spouses. In contrast, the

decision process of this paper assumes that both spouses realize that their own choices may

affect the choices of the other spouse.

        There may also be a case where there is no Nash equilibrium, yet the decision process

described in this paper will deliver an unambiguous and defensible solution. In terms of the

classification of cases in Part A of this section, cases 7 and 10 have no Nash equilibria. These are

cases where one spouse wants to do the same as the other spouse, but the second spouse wants to

do the opposite of the first spouse. In these cases, no Nash equilibrium can make both spouses



                                                                                                     38
completely happy with their decision, given the decision of the other spouse. Case 7 was the case

where the husband wanted to do the same thing as the wife, but the wife wanted to do the

opposite of the husband. Utilizing the sequential decision making process, the wife knows that if

she retires, the husband will as well, and that is her least preferred outcome. So she continues

working and the husband does too. The wife would really prefer that she retire and the husband

stays working, but she knows that this is an impossible outcome, because she knows what the

husband will do in response to her retirement. So she settles for her second best outcome, and the

decision process has a definite and defensible result in spite of the fact that there are no Nash

equilibria in this case.

        In any case, as we have shown, the backward induction method does not always yield the

exact same result as the Nash equilibrium, even in cases where a Nash equilibrium exists. More

generally, the Nash equilibrium, which assumes that each spouse takes the decision of the other

spouse as given, is not always equivalent to methods in which the choice of each spouse takes

into account the possible responses of the other spouse.



                                      V. Data and Estimation.

        Estimation in this study is based on data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a

survey of roughly 7600 households with individuals born from 1931 to 1941. 9 The study uses

observations from households of married couples for whom both spouses appear to have career

jobs from which retirement would be a meaningful concept. Details of the sample restrictions, as

well as the construction of the variables used in the estimation, are described in Appendix 1.



9
 The HRS is conducted by the University of Michigan under a grant from the National Institute
on Aging (grant number U01AG009740).

                                                                                                    39
       Both spouses in HRS households were interviewed separately. This is true even if one

spouse was in the eligible birth cohorts but the other was not. The survey started in 1992, at

which time these individuals were between 51 and 61 years old, and the same households were

re-interviewed every two years thereafter. This study uses the retirement data through the first

six waves of the survey, by which time the eligible birth cohorts would have been 61 to 71 years

of age. By age 61 half of the individuals would have retired, and virtually all by age 71, so this

period includes the overwhelming majority of retirements for the sample individuals.

       The HRS also has two important supplements, which are available on a restricted basis.

First, Social Security earnings records are attached for about 75 percent of the sample, allowing

fairly precise estimates of Social Security earnings and benefits for this part of the sample.

Secondly, for respondents who indicated that they had pensions, the survey obtained and coded

the summary pension documents from the employers of about two thirds of those in the sample

with a pension on their current job. This enables a much more precise determination of the

retirement incentives of pensions than is normally obtainable from the respondents themselves.

       The estimation method is the generalized method of simulated moments (GMM). In this

procedure, a group of moments is gathered into a column vector m. These moments are

generally the difference between some observed statistic, such as the percentage retired as of a

specific age, and the percentage that is simulated for the sample using specified values of the

parameter. In general, these moments come from an asymptotically normal distribution with a

mean value of zero. The estimation procedure seeks the parameter value which minimize q =

                         n
m'W-1m, where W =       ∑ m m′ . The
                        i =1
                               i   i    mi vectors are the moments of the individual


observations, and the W matrix is essentially the observed variance-covariance matrix of the

moments. Variances of the estimates are calculated from var(Θ) = [G'W-1G]-1, where Θ is the

                                                                                                     40
vector of parameters and G is the derivative of the moments with respect to the parameters. If

the model is correctly specified, m is distributed around zero, and q should have a χ2

distribution with λ – k degrees of freedom, where λ is the number of moments and k is the

number of parameters estimated.

       To construct the moments for a specific observation using a specific set of parameters,

we need first to estimate the value of the time preference parameter ρ for the couple associated

with that observation. To do this, we use the observed full-time retirement dates if the spouses

have already retired, or the expected retirement dates if one or both spouses have not retired. If

the retirement from full-time work was into partial retirement, a second retirement date from

partial retirement into full retirement is established in the same way. These retirement dates fix

the leisure parts of both utility functions as well as the complete earnings stream for the couple.

What remains is to compute the consumption stream conditional on a value of ρ. The

consumption model is computed using the usual backward induction method of dynamic

programming models. In this model, the rate of return on assets is taken to be stochastic, using

the observed distribution of asset returns. The model is then simulated to obtain an associated

path of wealth, and during this simulation the realized asset returns are used. The calculated

amount of wealth in a particular year, say 1992, can then be compared with the actual wealth

observed in that year. The calculated wealth depends on the assumed value of ρ, and this

parameter is adjusted up or down until the calculated wealth matches the actual wealth. In these

calculations, observed wealth is taken to be the sum of financial, real estate, business assets, and

non-pension retirement assets (e.g., IRA’s).

       The use of actual or expected retirement dates to calculate ρ avoids the necessity of

using the values of the random effects (εh, εw, VPh , and VPw ) in the calculations of ρ, since


                                                                                                     41
the random effects affect only the leisure terms in the utility functions. This approach requires a

couple of approximations. First, the actual or expected retirement dates refer to situations where

both spouses survive and do not tell us what would have happened if one of the spouses had

died. In general, the retirement ages would be expected to depend on the survival experience of

both spouses, since if one spouse dies the income stream of the surviving spouse will be altered.

However, since the pre-retirement mortality rates are relatively low, and since the bulk of

lifetime income will have been earned before the observations begin, we make the approximation

that the retirement dates of one spouse do not depend on whether the other spouse survives. The

second approximation is the approximation discussed in Appendix 2. The uncertainty in

retirement dates in the complete model probably induces couples to hold more assets than if the

retirement dates were certain, and even then the amount of wealth associated with observed

retirement dates and asset returns is not completely fixed. However, the discussion in Appendix

2 suggests that this is probably not a serious problem. The primary purpose of calculating time

preference rates is to distinguish households which place a substantial value on future utility

from those for whom present utility is paramount, and this approximation should be sufficient for

those purposes.

       Once the time preference rate ρ is calculated, we make a random draw from the joint

distribution of εh and εw, given the parameters σh, σw, and ρε of the distribution. We also

make random draws of VPh and VPw , given the parameters γ ho , γ 1h , γ ow , and γ 1w for those

distributions. With these preference parameters, the path of retirement states for both spouses can

be calculated using the methods discussed above, and the values associated with the various

moments are tabulated. Another draw is made from the distribution of εh and εw . Another set

of retirement states for both spouses is calculated, and the values associated with the various


                                                                                                  42
moments are updated. The process continues through a large number of simulations (10,000 per

observation). The moments used in the estimation are calculated by comparing the observed

tabulations to the simulated distributions. Once the model has been estimated, the calculation of

the 10,000 simulations does not add appreciably to the time required, so we use this number in

order to make the simulated moments close to the theoretical moments. However, in order to

make the calculations feasible, new draws of VPh and VPw are not made for each of the 10,000

simulations per observation, but new draws of these values are made for each individual.

       The moments used in the simulation are chosen to provide identifying information on the

parameters. The moments used are as follows:

                                                                                  Number

        The first 26 moments help to establish the overall pattern of retirements, as governed by

βho , β1h , β ow , β1w , σh, and σw. The next 10 moments reflect the amount of partial retirement by

age, and hence help to establish the values of γ ho , γ 1h , γ ow , and γ 1w , which determine the

distribution of the value of partial retirement. The next 20 moments help to establish the value of

α. The higher the value of α, the later will be the retirement of high earning individuals relative

to the retirement of lower earning individuals. The next 10 moments, which involve those

individuals in poor health, help to determine β h2 and β 2w . The following 10 moments, which

have to do with reversals, help to establish the values of ρh and ρw, which are the changes in

leisure preferences after retirement which could induce a return to work. The next six moments,

which relate to joint retirement, help to determine the values of β h3 and β 3w , which govern how

much the leisure of one spouse is augmented by the presence of the other spouse. The final six

moments, which measure how often one spouse retires early and the other spouse retires much

later, help to establish the value of ρε, the correlation between εh and εw. High values of ρε

should mean that cases where one spouse retires early and the other much later occur less often

than if the value of ρε is relatively low.

        The results of the parameter estimates are given in Table 1. Most if not all of the

parameter estimates are significant at conventional significance levels. 10 For 70 degrees of

the q value will be high and the prob value will be low, indicating that the model is not doing a

freedom, the 5% critical value of the χ2 distribution is 90.53 and the 1% critical value is 100.43.

The estimated value of 65.09 is well below these critical values, which indicates that there is

little evidence that the model does not fit the model well, at least in the dimensions measured by

the moments previously listed. Another way of looking at this is that the probability value of this

q value is 0.64, which suggests that by chance, the q value would be higher than the estimated

amount more than half of the time. 11

       Since this model is a combination of two of our previous models, we can see how

different these estimates are from those in the previous models. One of the models (Gustman and

Steinmeier, 2008) was a model of joint retirement decisions for both spouses within a family, but

that model did not include stochastic returns or any partial retirement. The other model was a

very good job of explaining the observed data. The degrees of freedom for the χ2 distribution is
equal to the number of moments minus the number of parameters estimations, which for the
current estimation gives a value of 70.
       11
           Other studies have also simplified the estimation of the backward induction
process. A notable approach that would approximate the solution to the model is
suggested by Keane and Wolpin (1997). (The description of the Keane-Wolpin method is
taken from the Appendix in their article in the June1997 JPE.) Unfortunately, their
approximations do not appear to be applicable to our model. They make use of the fact
that there is exactly one error term corresponding to each potential choice, which is to say
that the values of the choices are specified as Vm = fm(S) + εm, where m is a choice and S
is the set of state variables. Our error terms enter the model in a more structural (and we
would argue more realistic) way. While it may be possible to use the Monte-Carlo
methods for simulating expected values, it is not possible to use their method for
computing E[max(Vm)] from a transformation of more easily computed E[Vm]’s. The
reason that their E[Vm]’s are easier to compute is that the expectation has to be integrated
only over the single εm, (in fact, if E[εm] = 0, E(Vm] = fm(S), with no need for integration),
while E[max(Vm)] has to be multiply integrated over all the εm ‘s. Thus, once they
estimate the relationship between the E[max(Vm)]’s and the E[Vm]’s from a small
subsample of the possible state combinations, they can calculate the E[max(Vm)]’s for the
remaining state combinations without doing any integration at all! The cost is a relatively
more restricted error structure tying the errors to the choices in a one-to-one fashion. The
problem for our model is that since there is no strict correspondence between the potential
choices and the error terms, the computation of the m E[Vm]’s is as complicated as the
computation of E[max(Vm)].


                                                                                                  45
model which included stochastic returns and a mechanism for varying leisure preferences after

retirement, but took the wife’s labor supply and its associated income as exogenous to the

husband’s retirement decision.

       In comparing the current results with the previous family retirement model, the

coefficient of the age variable for the husband is considerably lower in the present model as

opposed to the previous model. Since this coefficient to some extent reflects the scope of

economic circumstances to affect retirement, one would expect that the husband’s retirement

decision would be more sensitive to economic circumstances in the current model. For the wife,

however, the coefficient of the age variable is very similar between the two models.

       The coefficient of the spouse retired variable is about the same for the husbands between

the two sets of estimates, but the coefficient of this variable is almost twice as high for the wife

in the current set of estimates as opposed to the previous results. Nevertheless, the husband’s

coefficient is almost two and a half times as great as that for the wife, which leaves unaltered the

conclusion from previous work that the husband’s utility of retirement is much more sensitive to

the presence of the wife than the other way around. Another dimension of joint retirement is the

correlation of retirement preferences, as measured by the parameter ρε. That parameter is

considerably higher in the current estimates than the previous estimates, suggesting that

correlated preferences may play a greater role. However, the previous estimate of this parameter

was not very precise, and the confidence interval for that estimate is very close to including the

current estimate. As a result, it is unclear that this difference in estimates is meaningful.

       The coefficients of the health variables are slightly higher in the current model than they

were in the previous family retirement estimates, both for the husband and for the wife. It is not

completely clear why this should be so, but again the confidence intervals for the previous



                                                                                                       46
estimates include the values estimated for the current model. The standard deviation of the

leisure preference term, which to a large extent governs the overall spread of the retirement

distribution, is very close between the two estimates for the husbands, but the value for the wife

is somewhat higher in the current model relative to the previous model.

       In comparing the current model with the previous stochastic model (Gustman and

Steinmeier, 2006), the most notable difference is that the leisure preferences change much less

after retirement in the current model than in the previous model. This is reflected in the

autocorrelation parameter ρh, which measures how autocorrelated the preferences after

retirement are to the preferences prior to retirement. To a large degree, this parameter reflects

how often individuals return to work after a period of retirement. As indicated earlier in this

report, the mechanism by which the retirement decisions are made for couples introduces some

degree of returns to work, even if there were no other mechanism for inducing returns to work.

This means that the autocorrelation parameter ρh does not have to account for all the returns to

work, but only a part of them. As a result, it is not terribly surprising that the autocorrelation

parameter is higher in the current model than it was in the previous model, which assumed that

the spouse’s retirement was exogenous.

                                            VI. Simulations.

       Having obtained estimates for the parameters of the model, we now turn to simulations

with the model. First we will present results from a simulation using the actual budget sets for

the individuals in the sample. We refer to this simulation as the “base” simulation. We will then

present simulations in which the wife is not in the labor force, to see what effect the wife’s work

has on the husband’s retirement, and simulations in which partial retirement is not permitted.




                                                                                                     47
       Table 2 shows the basic retirement outcomes from the base simulation. For both the

husbands and the wives, the last three rows indicate the percentages of the sample at each age

who were working full-time, partially retired, or fully retired. As expected, the percentage

working full-time falls with age and the percentage partially retired increases with age. For

husbands, by age 62 less than half of the sample is still working full time, while for the wives the

percentage working full time falls to less than half at age 60. Both husbands and wives have

substantial numbers partially retired. For the husbands, the percentage partially retired grows

steady throughout the age range illustrated until it reaches almost 20 percent at age 67. For

wives, partial retirement grows at earlier ages, reaches a peak of around 17 percent at age 62, and

declines thereafter.

       The first two columns of the table are what may be referred to as “pseudo” retirement.

These are merely the differences between the figures at adjacent ages in the last three rows. For

instance, 32.1 percent of husbands were fully retired at age 61 and 42.8 percent at age 62. The

difference of 10.7 percent is taken as the pseudo-retirements from work at age 62. It is really a

net result of individuals completely retiring at that age less the individuals who had been retired

at 61 but who returned to work at age 62. In any case, the prominent feature of these numbers is

the spike of retirements at age 62, both for the husbands and to a lesser extent for the wives. The

magnitude of the spike is approximately correct relative to the raw data for the husbands but is a

little short for the wives. The model is a little less successful in capturing the secondary spike at

age 65 for the husbands and not very successful at capturing the secondary spike for the wives.

In any case, the current model is much more successful in capturing the spikes than was our

previous family model, in which the spikes were substantially muted. As mentioned before, this

probably has to do with the much lower estimated coefficent for the age variable for the husband,



                                                                                                    48
which makes the husband’s retirement behavior more sensitive to economic incentives in the

current model.

       Table 3 decomposes both the full-time work figures and the partial retirement figures in

the last three columns of the previous table. The full-time work percentages are decomposed into

two parts, one for individuals who are still working in career jobs and who have never previously

either fully or partially retired and the other for individuals who previously fully or partially

retired and who have returned to full-time work. For both husbands and wives, the percentage of

the sample who have returned to full-time work rises gradually up until about age 60, peaks at

around 9 percentage points in the early 60’s, and tails off thereafter. At its peak at age 61, more

than 16 percent (9.4 / 57.2) of full-time husbands are individuals who have returned to full-time

work after a period of full or partial retirement. For wives, the figure is even higher at 21 percent

(8.8 / 42.5). Although the numbers of full-time workers decline both in the career jobs and in the

return jobs after age 61, the percentage of full-time workers who have been previously retired

continues to grow until it reaches 28 percent for husbands at age 67 and 30 percent for wives at

the same age.

       For partial retirement, the decomposition is between those who have partially retired

from full-time work without going through a period of full retirement and those who have been

fully retired at some previous point. From the table, it is clear that the majority of part-time work

is done by individuals who are on a traditional path of moving from full-time work to partial

retirement and then to full retirement, but part-time work by individuals who have previously

been fully retired is not insignificant. For the husbands, a little over a third of part-time workers

in their mid to late 50’s have been previously retired. This figure increases during the early 60’s

until by age 67 around half of the part-time husbands have previously been fully retired. The



                                                                                                    49
same trend occurs for the wives, though the percentages of previously retired part-time workers

is somewhat lower, particularly in the mid 50’s.

       Table 3 indicates the percentage of individuals who had returned to full-time work from

partial or full retirement and the percentage who had returned to part-time work after full

retirement, but it does not indicate the frequency with which husbands and wives go through at

least one period of transitioning from a state of greater retirement to a state of less retirement.

Table 4 provides this information. For both husbands and wives, around a third returned to full-

time work at some point in time after a period of partial or full retirement, with the percentage

being slightly higher among wives than among husbands. The percent returning to part-time

work after a period of full retirement was around a quarter for both husbands and wives. Since

these are not mutually exclusive categories, they cannot simply be added up since some

individuals will go through both transitions. Accordingly, the last row of the table suggests that a

little over two fifths of husbands go through a period of transition from greater retirement to less

retirement, and almost half of the wives do so.

       Table 5 addresses one of the issues particular to a model of the retirement behavior of

couples, namely, the frequency with which both spouses retire at the same time. The figures in

the top part of the table give the frequencies for which the husband retires before the wife, and

the figures in the bottom part of the table give the frequencies for which the wife retires before

the husband. Despite the fact that on average the husband is a couple of years older than the wife,

the husband retires first in only about half the cases, while the wife retires first in around 36

percent of the cases. The remaining 13.5 percent of the cases are instances where both spouses

retire in the same year. Note that this is around 10 to 11 percentage points higher than the

surrounding figures, which measure the instances where the husband retires a year or two before



                                                                                                      50
the wife, or the wife retires a year or two before the husband. This is almost surely a result of the

spouse retirement variables in the model, which increase the value of leisure of one spouse if the

other spouse is also retired. The correlation in leisure preferences would also lead to an increased

tendency for spouses to both retire early or both retire late, but a correlation in leisure

preferences should lead to more of a smooth hump in the joint retirement distribution as opposed

to a spike, as found in studies of joint retirement outcomes.

       Table 6 reports on another distribution of interest, namely, the distribution of time

preferences. Not quite half of the households have a time preference rate of less than 5%, while

around a third have time preference rates of 50% or higher. The latter group essentially has no

financial assets other than forced savings, meaning that they are effectively consuming all of

their available income. Only around a sixth of the households fall in the middle, with time

preference rates between 5% and 50%, and most of those are in the bracket from 5% to 10%. The

clear implication of this result is that models which assume that all households have a uniform

time preference rate will almost certainly yield very misleading results for a third of the

households, but models which allow two mass points for the time preference distribution, one at

a relatively low time preference rate and the other at a relatively high time preference rate, may

be a lot closer to the truth. Even here, though, as suggested by Figure 2 in the appendix, there is a

very substantial difference between the amount of wealth that would be accumulated by an

individual with a 1% time preference rate relative to an individual with a 3% time preference

rate, and a model with only two mass points of time preference is unlikely to reflect this

difference.

       We now turn to two simulations which address a couple of interesting questions. The first

has to do with the effect on husband’s retirement of having the wife in the labor force. To shed



                                                                                                   51
some light on this subject, we examine a simulation in which the wife is assumed to be out of the

labor force. The results of this simulation are reported in Table 7. The figures in the table are

differences between the simulation holding the wife out of the labor force and the base

simulation. As might be expected, excluding the wife from the labor force leads to a substantial

increase in full-time work by the husband. From the husband’s viewpoint, the income provided

by the wife is largely an increase in family resources not associated with his work. Taking away

this wealth leads to a wealth effect, which should have the impact of reducing both leisure and

consumption. The reduction in leisure is mainly reflected in increased full-time work effort,

amounting to over 13 percentage points in the early 60’s. Leisure itself, as reflected in the

percentage of the sample being fully retired, drops by a comparable amount, again reaching

around 13 percent in the early 60’s. During the 50’s and early 60’s, the percentage of the sample

who are partially retired is reduced, but after that age partial retirement is increased by the

exclusion of women from the labor force. To put it another way, in the early years full-time work

is increased substantially at the expense of both partial retirement and full retirement, but in later

years full retirement is increased substantially at the expense of both full-time work and partial

retirement. In any case, it seems clear that all else being equal, the flow of wives into the labor

force in the last few decades has probably reduced the amount of work that the husbands would

have done otherwise.

       A second simulation looks to see what would be the effect if work were a full time or

nothing decision. This is meant to address the issue of the effects of the possibility of part-time

work on overall work effort. One of the arguments in favor of expanding the opportunities for

part-time work is that increased part-time work would expand overall work effort by allowing

older Americans to work into years when health or other issues might make it impossible or



                                                                                                      52
difficult to work full-time. Table 8 presents results from a simulation where the option to work

part-time is effectively eliminated and the respondents would be forced to choose only between

full-time work and full retirement. The figures in this table are the differences between the

percentage of individuals in the stated work/retirement category in this simulation and the

comparable percentage of individuals in the base simulation. For instance, the first entry in the

table, 1.9 percent, means that at age 55, the number of husbands working full-time would be 1.9

percentage points higher if part-time work were eliminated as a possibility. Note that the sum of

the two columns for each gender is the percent of individuals partially retired in Table 2. That is,

of the 3.4 percent of husbands who were partially retired in the base simulation, if partial

retirement were eliminated 1.9 percent of them would switch to full-time work and 1.5 percent of

them would switch to being fully retired.

       In general, eliminating partial retirement would lead to increases both in the number

working full-time, which would increase overall work effort, and in the number fully retired,

which would reduce overall work effort. For husbands, the increase in full-time work outweighs

the increase in full retirement up until about age 62, which means that up until that age overall

work effort would increase if partial retirement were eliminated. After age 62, for the husbands

the elimination of partial retirement would cause the increase in full retirement to outweigh the

increase in full-time work, which would imply a reduction in overall work effort for this group.

For the entire 55 to 67 age range illustrated in the table, the increase in full retirement outweighs

the increase in full-time work, but only by a small amount.

       Making partial retirement more generally available or more attractive, of course, would

have the opposite effect. One might expect that the husbands would exhibit a slight increase in

overall work effort as individuals continued to work in partial retirement beyond the date that



                                                                                                    53
they would otherwise retire. This effect, however, is largely offset because with the increased

availability of partial retirement, individuals would be induced to leave full-time work for partial

retirement earlier than they would have left full-time work in the absence of partial retirement.

The simulation suggests that this offsetting effect is sufficient to largely negate any effort to

promote opportunities for partial retirement as a means to increase overall work. The goal of

increasing work effort, in turn, is often promoted as a means of stabilizing Social Security’s

finances or for other ends.

       The pattern for the wives is similar to that for the husbands, although there are some

important differences. Before age 62, partial retirement among the wives is more common than

among husbands, so the increases in full-time work and in full retirement are both greater than

for the husbands. It is still true, however, that before age 62 the increase in full-time work from

eliminating partial retirement outweighs the increase in full retirement. After age 62, the reverse

is true: the figures are less for the wives than for the husbands, and the increase in the percentage

fully retired is larger than the increase in the percentage working full-time. Again, over the entire

age range, the increase in the percentage fully retired outweighs the increase in the percentage

working full-time, but only by a small amount. Therefore, the implications about the goals of

increasing opportunities for partial retirement among the wives are essentially the same as the

implications for the husbands outlined in the previous paragraph.



                                          VII. Conclusions.

       This paper has integrated many features of retirement models into a single framework.

This has made it possible to utilize the full set of labor market information provided by the

Health and Retirement Study, including survey responses, pension plan descriptions and Social



                                                                                                    54
Security earnings data provided individually for husbands and wives. The integrated model is

much richer than previously specified models of family retirement, allowing each spouse to retire

and unretire, transitioning among the states of full-time work, partial retirement and full

retirement. It explains in much greater detail the effects of interdependence in the decisions made

by each spouse, including clustering of retirements by husbands and wives, while at the same

time allowing for forward looking behavior, explaining saving at the family level, incorporating

the nonlinear budget constraints from still dominant defined benefit pensions and Social

Security, and allowing for the effects of exogenous shocks to market opportunities, health and

asset returns.

        As we found in our past research, increasing the richness of the model allows us to

address phenomena that otherwise cannot be explained by conventional models of retirement. At

the family level we are able to isolate the key role of heterogeneity in time preference, allowing

the model to explain the wide differences in wealth accumulated by families with similar

earnings opportunities. The retirement hazard exhibits the important spike in retirement at age 62

in the face of an actuarially fair Social Security system, captures the extent of partial retirement

by each spouse, reproduces the flow from states of greater to lesser retirement, and relates each

of the flows for one spouse to the decisions made by the other. We also allow each spouse to

have heterogeneous preferences for both full-time and part-time work.

        The theoretical discussion increases understanding of the wide variety of situations that

families face when approaching the retirement decision. It illustrates how choices focused on one

spouse’s welfare will take account of the welfare and independent reactions of their mate,

incorporating the roles of different preferences and different market opportunities. Allowing for

the variety of circumstances facing different families, the theoretical framework incorporates the



                                                                                                    55
many different situations facing different couples into a unified framework, and directly into the

estimation. We also have shown why, when both spouses realize that their own choices may

affect the choices of the other spouse, a solution method based on backward induction is superior

to a method based on a Nash equilibrium, including a finding that a solution based on backward

induction may provide plausible behavioral predictions when the Nash equilibrium criteria fall

silent in attempting to predict the optimal solution.

       We have found some surprising implications of the model. For example, retirement

reversals can occur without any changes in preferences (other than the increasing desire for

retirement over time) or any changes in effective compensation. Also, contrary to the usual

implication that a pure wealth effect should cause a decline in labor supply, higher wealth at the

beginning of the period, all other things being equal, may cause the work effort of one of the

spouses to increase, even if the work effort of the other spouse remains the same.

       Simpler specifications cannot simultaneously explain heterogeneity in wealth; liquidity

preference and retirement spikes when benefits become available; the high rate of return from

states of lesser work to states of greater work despite the assumption of forward looking

behavior, and in the absence of changes either in preferences or in market opportunities; the

different sequence of retirements by husbands and wives; and why in some cases increased

wealth may reduce retirements.

       Comparisons of the integrated model of retirement behavior with models that either

simplify the retirement options and dynamic, stochastic nature of decision making, or simplify or

ignore the importance of interdependence of retirement decision making in a family setting, have

shown the value of the estimates obtained with the integrated model. While preserving key

findings, such as the conclusion from previous work that the husband’s utility of retirement is



                                                                                                  56
much more sensitive to the presence of the wife than the other way around, the integrated model

can explain the key features of retirement outcomes that a simple specification of the family

model failed to explain, including the ability to simulate with accuracy the spike in retirements at

age 62. There also are substantial differences in key coefficients between the integrated more

constrained specifications, such as in the coefficient on age, which governs the sensitivity of the

retirement response to incentives from policies, as well as changes in preferences after

retirement, which are smaller in the integrated model.

       We find interesting effects from counter factual experiments. The flow of wives into the

labor force in the last few decades has probably reduced the amount of work that the husbands

would have done otherwise. In the early years full-time work is increased substantially at the

expense of both partial retirement and full retirement, but in later years full retirement is

increased substantially at the expense of both full-time work and partial retirement. In another

experiment, we find that eliminating partial retirement would lead to increases both in the

number working full-time, which would increase overall work effort, and in the number fully

retired, which would reduce overall work effort. Altogether, the increase in full retirement

outweighs the increase in full-time work, but the difference is small. The simulation suggests that

this offsetting effect is sufficient to largely negate any effort to promote opportunities for partial

retirement as a means to increase overall work.

       Although there is a great deal of effort required to estimate and simulate with a structural

model that incorporates many dimensions of behavior, it appears to be worth the effort. One

reward is an increased understanding of behavior, providing insight into many dimensions of

retirement behavior, and behavior at the family level, that is not otherwise available from more

simplified approaches. Another reward is a clearer picture of the likely effects of events, where



                                                                                                     57
simplified approaches either fall silent or, worse, may provide misleading guidance for policies.

In previous studies we have examined the effects of various policies on retirement. In a longer

report to the National Institute on Aging, we also apply the present model to analyze the effects

of delaying the Social Security early entitlement age and the effects of substituting defined

contribution for defined benefit plans. The implications of these and related changes for saving

and retirement simply cannot be understood when behavior must be analyzed with a less

structural approach. Since the Health and Retirement Study has been designed to support these

complex analyses, there is additional effort required to design and estimate the basic behavioral

models incorporating all the relevant dimensions of behavior, but additional effort is not required

to collect the requisite data.
