        Do firms systematically over- or underinvest as a result of agency problems? We develop a
contracting model between shareholders and managers in which managers have private benefits or private
costs of investment. Managers overinvest when they have private benefits and underinvest when they have
private costs. Optimal incentive contracts mitigate the over- or underinvestment problem. We derive
comparative static predictions for the equilibrium relationships between incentives from compensation,
investment, and firm performance for both cases. The relationship between firm performance and
managerial incentives, in isolation, is insufficient to identify whether
managers have private benefits or private costs of investment. In order to identify whether managers have
private benefits or costs, we estimate the joint relationships between incentives and firm performance and
between incentives and investment. Our empirical results show that both firm performance and investment
are increasing in managerial incentives. These results are consistent with managers having private costs of
investment. We find no support for overinvestment based on private benefits.

 1. Introduction
 In large corporations, owners delegate decisions such as investment, effort provision, and resource
 allocation to professional managers. These decisions are often unobservable or very costly for
 the owners to monitor. Owners provide managers with incentives to induce them to take actions
 that maximize the value of the firm. This separation of ownership and control is the classic
 principal-agent problem.
    In this paper, we focus on the investment decisions of managers. Agency problems could lead
 managers either to overinvest or underinvest.       For example, Jensen (1986, 1993) argues that
 managers take wasteful, negative net present value investment projects because they derive some
 benefit from controlling more assets.    This is overinvestment or empire-building. Conversely,
managers may forego some positive net present value investment projects. Investing requires the
manager to oversee the investment. Because managers in general prefer to work less (i.e., they
are inclined to shirk), managers will underinvest. The two different agency problems provide
dramatically different characterizations of firm behavior.
    This paper makes three principal contributions.      First, we provide a flexible and tractable
principal-agent model for analyzing investment decisions. We model managers as having either
private benefits or private costs of investment. We show that the optimal provision of incentives
through compensation can mitigate over- and underinvestment problems. The model delivers
clear, testable implications that can be used to identify whether managers have private benefits
or private costs of investment.

   Second, we show that the existing evidence of overinvestment is not, in fact, sufficient to identify
the agency problem as one of overinvestmerjt. In an important paper, Morck, Shleifer, and Vishny
(1988) find that over a range of incentives, firm performance is declining in incentives. Theyargue
that this is because managers make investment decisions that serve to entrench them in theirjobs.
As a result, firms are overinvesting (see also Shleifer and Vishny (1989)). However, a finding that
firm performance is declining in incentives does not imply that firms are overinvesting. Such a
finding can also be consistent with firms that are underinvesting. In order to identify whether the
agency problem is one of over- or underinvestment, we need to examine the relationship between
investment and incentives in addition to the relationship between firm performance and incentives.

result in improved incentives. His results show that profitability increases and capital expendi-
tures decrease after the buyouts. Other evidence of overinvestment is anecdotal in nature. For
example, Burrough and Helyar (1990, p. 95) describe how managers at RJR Nabisco squandered
shareholders' cash on corporate jet rides for dogs and celebrity golftournaments.1
   A number of models predict that firms will underinvest. Reasonsfor underinvestment include
                                                         and Rock (1985)), and more general
high leverage (Myers (1977)), dividend signaling (Miller
asymmetric information between firms and capital markets (Myers and Majluf (1984)). Our un-
derinvestment model is based on principal-agent considerations—investing maybe personally costly
for managers because managers have to oversee the investments that their firms make.

  Existing empirical support for underinvestment comes from several sources. McConnell and
Muscarella (1985) show that firm stock prices react positively to announcements of increases
in capital expenditures. Poterba and Summers (1995) show that firms systematically evaluate
 investment projects using hurdle rates that exceed the firms' costs of capital. They argue that
 CEOs of firms in the U.S. have short capital budgeting time horizons. Poterba and Summers
 (1995) conclude that firms forego long-term, positive net presentvalue investment projects. Both
 of these studies imply that firms could invest more and increase dollar returns to shareholders.2
      We provide an alternative model of investment based on agency concerns. In our model,

 managers choose the level of investment and have either private benefits or private costs of invest-
 ment. The first case we consider is that managers derive private benefits from investment, so that
 their utility is increasing in the level of investment. Managers are empire-buildersand continue to
 choose investment projects even after all positive net present value investments have been taken.
 The second case is that investment is costly for managers. The disutility of investment comes
 from bearing oversight responsibilities for that investment. For example, when firms expand ex-

  isting facilities or start new product lines, managers are required to do more work. Managers will
  forego some positive net present value investments in order to lessen the amount of work that they
  have to do. Given these assumptions, managers will overinvest in the first case and underinvest

  i A different strand ol the empirical literature looks for evidence of overinvestment in corporate
  finds evidence of less diversification in firms with higher managerial equity ownership (see, for example, Deois,
  Denis, and Sarin (1997)).
  2 The sensitivity of investment to cash flow, first documented by Fazzari, Hubbard, and Petersen (1988), also
  suggests that investment systematically differs from its optimal level. Hadlock (1998) demonstrates empirically
  that this sensitivity rises with ownership, which he argues is inconsistent with overinvestment.

 in the second case. The two cases reflect very different perspectives on corporate investment and
 managerial behavior.

    We focus on incentives provided by tying managers' compensation to the performance of their
firms. The optimal contract for the manager ameliorates the overinvestment and underinvestment
problems. We show how the optimal contract depends on the manager's risk aversion, the variance
of firm performance, and the magnitude of the private benefits or costs associated with investment.
We then estimate how performance and investment vary with changes in incentives, given changes
in the underlying exogenous parameters.
    In our model, we assume that the firm has sufficient funds to undertake all investment projects
selected by the managers.      In this sense, the firm is potentially subject to a free cash flow
problem. Other studies have noted that debt, dividends, hostile takeovers, product and factor
market competition, and board intervention are mechanisms that could be used to overcome a free
cash flow problem. Compared to these other mechanisms, incentives can be adjusted frequently
and inexpensively, and, when adjusted, they can be targeted precisely for the managers. Incentives
from compensation should be the primary mechanism to influence managerial behavior.
    Our results highlight the importance of investment. In order to differentiate between over-
and underinvestment, we need to examine how both investment and firm performance respond to
changes in incentives in equilibrium. If investment and firm performance both increase or both
decrease in incentives, this supports the private costs model and rejects the private benefits model.
If investment and firm performance move in opposite directions with changes in incentives, this
supports the private benefits model and rejects the private costs model.
   To conduct our empirical work, we use data on managerial incentives from Standard and
Poor's ExecuComp dataset. Our sample consists of comprehensive data for the top five executives
(ranked annually by salary and bonus) from the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, and S&P SmaliCap
600 companies from 1993 to 1997. We use investment and firm performance data from Compustat.
   Empirically, we find that both investment and firm performance are increasing in incentives.
These findings are robust to the inclusion of firm-level fixed effects and other factors that could
affect the level of investment and firm performance. These results support a model in which firms
underinvest. Our results also suggest that the underlying sources of variation within and across

   point for our model is that we assume



                                                       6
   The agent has negative exponential utility with a coefficient of absolute risk aversion of r. The
agent receives a wage contract that is linear in firm performance:

                                             w—wo+air.                                                (3)

The agent receives a fixed wage component (salary) of w0 and a performance-based component
of air. In this setting, the agent's pay-performance sensitivity is a. We can also interpret the
previous equation as a statement about the agent's wealth. If we assume, as is true of most
executives, that a large fraction of their wealth is invested in their own firms, then w0 is the
component of wealth that is independent of the firm and air is the component of weahh that
depends on firm performance. In this case, a represents executive ownership in the firm.
   We allow for either nonpecuniary private costs or benefits of investing for managers. Following

Stulz (1990), we assume that the manager derives linearly increasing benefits or costs of the
form BI from investing more. If B > 0, then every dollar of investment generates a marginal B
dollars of utility for the manager. The manager enjoys private benefits from more investment or,
equivalently, managing a larger firm (empire-building). If B < 0, then the manager incurs costs
of investing. These take the form of oversight costs associated with greater investment. The more
the manager invests, the more work the manager must do to actually manage the investment.
Working is costly for the manager (B < 0), so the manager must be given incentives (a) in order
to invest more.
   The principal's problem is to maximize expected profits net of compensation for the agent,
given that the agent will choose the level of investment to maximize her utility. The principal's
program is:
                                          max EQr) — w
                                   s.t. E [i4w + BI)] ii        (IR)                                  (4)

                               I E argmaxj B [u(w + BI)] (IC).
The first constraint is the agent's individual rationality (Ia) constraint where ii is the agent's reser-
vation utility. The second constraint is the agent's incentive compatibility constraint (IC), which
requires that the agent choose the level of investment optimally (for her) given the compensation
contract. The agent's certainty equivalent from a contract vi is given by:

                                                                                                      (5)
                              u=wo+a(mI_I2)+BI_a2c2,
                                                   7
where a2c2 represents the cost of the agent's risk aversion.
   The manager chooses the investment level to maximize her certainty equivalent (5). This level
of investment is:
                                                   B
                                              1=m+—.
                                                   a                                            (6)

When compared to the optimal level of investment in the absence of agency problems (1° = in),
we notice two things. First, the level of investment chosen by the manager is distorted by B, her
private benefits or costs of investment. If the manager has private benefits (B > 0), the manager
will overinvest, P > I". If the manager has private costs (B <0), the manager will underinvest,
1 C 1°.     Second, the amount of over- or underinvestment is attenuated by incentives, a. The
greater is a, the closer the manager's choice of investment will be to the level that is optimal in
the absence of agency problems. This is true for both private benefits and private costs.
   The principal's problem is to maximize net profits given the agent's choice of investment.
Expected profits net of compensation for the agent are:


                               E[_w=mI_I2+BI_a2c2_1i                                            (7)

Here we assume that the managerial labor market is competitive, so that the agent is held to her
reservation utility through the choice of w0. Substituting the agent's choice of investment into
the above expected net profit equation and maximizing with respect to a yields the following first
order condition:
                                          (—ra2a — B2a + B2) = 0.                               (8)

The first order condition defines an optimal contract as (the second order condition is satisfied
as well). There exists a unique optimal contract, and this contract is on the interval (0, 1). To
see this, note that because the function —ra2a4 — B2a + B2 is polynomial, it is continuous in
a. As a —       0,   the function is positive. At a = 1, the function is negative. Therefore, there
exists a root on (0, 1). By Descartes' rule of signs, there is at most one real root to the equation
        —   B2a + B2 = 0, thus proving uniqueness.
   We obtain the following comparative statics by applying the implicit function theorem to
equation (8):

benefits or costs of investment. For B > 0, ff9 > 0. If there are private benefits, an increase in
incentives is associated with an increase in investment. This result may seem paradoxical. The
manager is overinvesting, and yet the increase in incentives seems to increase this overinvestment.
However, incentives are not an exogenous variable that determine investment. The increases in
incentives arid investment are both equilibrium responses to the manager's higher private benefits.
Although incentives increase in response to the increase in private benefits, incentives do not
increase sufficiently to prevent the manager from overinvesting more. This prediction is exactly in
line with the intuition from the entrenchment literature. In that literature, managers with higher
incentives (ownership) engage in more wasteful activities (overinvest) because their ownership
entrenches them. Here we give an optimal contracting and equilibrium interpretation to the
entrenchment intuition.
   For B <   0, 9    C   0. If there are private costs, an increase itt incentives is associated with
a decrease in investment. The intuition is similar to the private benefits case. As B becomes
more negative, the manager has more private costs and so the amount of incentives a that are
optimally provided to the manager increases. Although incentives increase to offset the greater
private costs, incentives do not increase sufficiently to prevent the manager from investing even
less, thereby increasing miderinvestment. These results are reported in the second and fourth
columns of the bottom row of Table 1.

2.3 Firm Performance and Incentives
Now we turn to the profit predictions. Recall from equation (1) that it = ml — I2 + e. It is
clear that profits depend on the exogenous parameters r, a2, and B only through their impact
on investment I. We take the derivative of it with respect to the exogenous parameters and
then show how it varies with a*, given a change in the exogenous parameter. For any exogenous
parameter, x, where it {r, a2, B}:

                                                                                                 (16)


Dividing both sides by j9 while holding the other parameters constant yields:
                                                             BOI
                                                   3cx       a Oa*                               (17)



                                                  12
   Equation (17) shows that the sign of j       depends    on the sign of B and the sign of . If
managers have private benefits, B is positive and          will have the opposite sign of -g-.   If the
firm is already overinvesting and investment increases, profits will decrease.      If managers have
private costs, B is negative and       will have the same sign as g.     If the firm is underinvesting
and investment increases, profits will increase.
   First, consider changes in r and o2.      Increases   in risk aversion or the variance of firm per-
formance reduce incentives. If there are private benefits, reduced incentives increase investment,
thereby reducing firm profits. Therefore, the reduction in incentives is associated with a reduction
in profits, or     > 0. If there are private costs, reduced incentives decrease investment, thereby
reducing firm profits.    Therefore, the reduction in incentives is associated with a reduction in
profits, or      > 0. Both the private benefits and private costs models yield the prediction that
firm performance is increasing in incentives if the underlying source of exogenous variation is risk
aversion or the variance of firm performance. These results are reported in the first and third
columns of the top row of Table 1.
   Next consider changes in the magnitude of private benefits or costs of investment. If there
are private benefits of investment, an increase in those private benefits leads, in equilibrium, to
an increase in incentives. However, the increase in incentives does not fully offset the higher
investment due to higher private benefits, so the level of investment increases.         Because the
manager is overinvesting, the increase in investment decreases firm performance.           Therefore,
higher incentives will be associated with lower firm performance. This is the most prominent
feature of stories of managerial entrenchment. Similarly, if there are private costs of investment,
an increase in the absolute value of private costs leads, in equilibrium, to an increase in incentives
and a reduction in investment. Because the manager is underinvesting, the decrease in investment
decreases firm performance.        Therefore, higher incentives will be associated with lower firm
performance. Both the private benefits and private costs models yield the prediction that firm
performance is decreasing in incentives if the underlying source of exogenous variation is the
magnitude of the private benefits or costs. These results are reported in the first and third
columns of the bottom row of Table 1.
    Studies in the entrenchment literature typically focus on the reduced form relationship between



                                                   13
firm performance and ownership. Morck, Shleifer, and Vishny (1988) find a negative relationship
over an intermediate range of the data and view this result as support for the entrenchment
hypothesis and overinvestment. Our comparative statics results show that this conclusion is not
warranted. A finding that firm performance decreases in incentives is not sufficient to conclude
that there are private benefits rather than private costs. Such a finding is also consistent with the
private costs model (where there is no entrenchment) when the underlying source of variation is
the magnitude of those private costs.

2.4 Summary
Table 1 summarizes the predictions between firm performance and investment and incentives,
which are observable in our data.       According to the theory, differences in firm performance,
investment, and incentives must be the result of differences in the three underlying parameters—
risk aversion, the variance of firm performance, or private benefits or costs.
   First, consider the predictions for firm performance (the first and third columns). Finding
that firm performance is increasing in incentives is consistent with both the private benefits and
private costs models if the underlying source of variation is risk aversion or the variance of firm
performance. Similarly, finding that firm performance is decreasing in incentives is consistent
with both models if the underlying source of variation is in the magnitude of the private benefits
or costs.   Analyzing the relationship between firm performance and incentives in isolation is
insufficient to determine whether managers face private benefits or private costs of investment.
   Second, consider the predictions for investment (the second and fourth columns). Finding
that investment increases with incentives would be consistent with the private costs model if the
underlying source of variation is risk aversion or the variance of firm performance. A finding that
investment increases with incentives would also be consistent with the private benefits model if
the underlying source of variation is the magnitude of the private benefits. Conversely, a finding
that investment decreases with incentives would be consistent with the private costs model if the
underlying source of variation is the magnitude of the private costs. It would also be consistent
with the private benefits model if the underlying source of variation is risk aversion or the variance

of firm performance.
    Using both the investment predictions and the firm performance predictions will allow us

                                                  14
to identify which model is generating the data. Table 1 shows that each of the four possible
combinations of the signs of the derivatives will identify a model and a source of exogenous
variation. If performance and investment move in the same direction given a change in incentives,

then the correct model is private costs. If performance and investment move in opposite directions
given a change in incentives, then the correct model is private benefits. When we empirically
examine these relationships, finding, for example, that investment increases with incentives and
firm performance increases with incentives would rule out the private benefits model and suggest
that either risk aversion or the variance of firm performance is the source of variation. These
comparative static predictions are what we test.

3.    Data

This section describes the data sources that we use to test the comparative static predictions of our
principal-agent modeL We use Standard and Poor's ExecuComp dataset to construct our measure
of managerial incentives. ExecuComp contains data on all aspects of compensation forthe top
five executives (ranked annually by salary and bonus) at each of the firms in the S&P 500, S&P

Midcap 400, and S&P SmallCap 600. Due to enhanced federal reporting requirements for fiscal
years ending after December 15, 1992, we can measure incentives from 1993 to 1997. Financial
and operating data for the ExecuComp sample companies are drawn from the Compustatdataset.
 Monthly measures of stock returns from the Center for Research on SecurityPrices (CRSP) are
 utilized in calculations of the variance of returns.
     Managers can receive pay-performance incentives from a variety of sources. The vast majority
 of these incentives are due to ownership of stock and stock options. Jensen and Murphy (1990)
 carefully aggregate pay-performance incentives into a single pay-performance sensitivity. They
 find that the typical CEO receives approximately $3.25 of compensation per thousand dollar
 increase in shareholder wealth. Of this amount, $2.50 is due to the median CEO's holdings of
 stock in the firm and $0.15 is due to ownership of stock options. Increases in the present value
 of current and future compensation and decreases in the probability of dismissal are responsible
 for $0.30 each. Hall and Liebman (1998) show that incentives from stock and particularly stock

are jointly equal to zero. If the null hypothesis is not rejected, thew Tobin's Q is unrelated to
managerial incentives. The second is that the four PPS coefficients are jointly equal to each other.

This is a test for linearity. If the null hypothesis is not rejected, then the relationship between
Tobin's Q and managerial incentives is linear. Both null hypotheses are rejected for both the
OLS and fixed effect specifications.
   Observed changes in managerial incentives and firm performance are equilibrium responses
to changes in exogenous parameters. Therefore, the coefficients on the PPS terms in Table 3
do not represent the marginal effect of an exogenous change in managerial incentives on firm

performance. For example, the slope coefficient on the first segment in the fixed effect regression
is 0.2387. Suppose that the top management team at a given firm is observed to have incentives
of 0.25 percent in the form of stock and options. Increasing this team's incentives to 0.75 percent
will not increase the value of Tobin's Q by (0.75—0.25)*0.2387 = 0.1193. Managerial incentives of
0.25 percent are set in equilibrium, based on the exogenous parameters r, cr2, and B. Increasing
managerial incentives from the optimal level of 0.25 percent will lower the returns to shareholders
at this firm.7    Instead, the coefficient of 0.2387 implies that at a firm in which it was optimal to

set managerial incentives to 0.25 percent, Tobin's Q is expected to be 0.1193 lower than at a firm
in which it was optimal to set managerial incentives to 0.75 percent. The values of exogenous
parameters vary across firms and within firms over time. The firm in which managerial incentives
of 0.75 percent are optimal either has lower variance of firm performance or has managers with
lower risk aversion. Differences in the underlying parameters generate the observed variation in
both incentives and firm performance.
   The fixed effects regression provides a more robust test of the comparative statics predictions
of the model. Including a dummy variable for each firm removes the effect of any firm-specific
characteristic that may affect both performance and incentives in a way not specified by our modeL
The fixed effects regression establishes a relationship between performance and incentives based
only on changes within firms over time. The OLS regression establishes a relationship between
performance and incentives based on comparisons both within and across firms. If firms are not
  When incentives are set optimally, shareholders have traded off the benefits of reduced agency problems against
the cost of compensating the manager. Higher-than-optimal incentives inefficiently expose managers to risk, deprive
them of private benefits of investment, or force them to incur private costs of greater investment. Shareholders
must then compensate managers for these added burdens, thereby lowering shareholders' returns relative to the
optimum.

otherwise identical, the OLS regression will be biased by unobserved, firm-specific factors whereas
the fixed effect regression will not. Comparing the 112 from the two regressions, the inclusion
of the fixed effects absorbs a substantial amount of the variation (increasing the proportion of
variance explained from 0.0474 to 0.8475), but the fixed effects do not change the basic shape of
the predicted relationship. The differences between the OLS and fixed effect regressions are shown
in Figure 1. The plot consists of the predicted values for each regression using the intercept for
the 1993 sample year. The values from the fixed effect regression have a higher intercept, a lower
initial slope, but a more modest decline in slopes thereafter. Overall, the two graphs are quite
similar. To the extent that there are unobserved, firm-specific factors that determine Tobin's Q,

they do not appear to be highly correlated with managerial incentives in our data.
   There are two important features of our findings on the relationship between Tobin's Q and
managerial incentives. The first is that in neither regression do we find an intermediate range
of incentives over which Tobin's Q decreases with higher levels of the PPS. This contrasts with
the earliest papers that investigated this relationship (Morck, Shleifer, and Vishny (1988) and
McConnell and Servaes (1990)). Recall that this negative relationship was the basis for the early
literature's conclusion that managerial entrenchment and overinvestment are important features
of large corporations. Our results, using more comprehensive data and including fixed effects, do
not support this conclusion.
   The second feature is that at all levels of incentives, greater incentives are associated with
higher firm performance as measured by Tobin's Q. To date, there has been no general finding
that performance is increasing in incentives. Our result contrasts with Himmelberg, Hubbard, and
Palia (1999), who found essentially no relationship between Tobin's Q and managerial ownership
in a fixed effects specification. Although they do not draw this conclusion, their results reject
standard principal-agent models such as Holmstrom (1979) and Holrnstrom and Milgrom (1987),
which predict that performance will be increasing in incentives in equilibrium. Our finding of
a positive relationship may therefore be viewed as support for standard principal-agent models,
quite apart from the implications of this result for our models of over- or underinvestment.
    We can also conclude from our estimate of a positive relationship that the underlying source
of variation, both within and across firms, is risk aversion or the variance of firm performance



                                                 21
 (see Table 1). If risk aversion or variance decreases, then shareholders will increase incentives
 provided to managers. Greater incentives reduce the agency problem due to private costs or
 benefits of investment and thereby increase firm performance.       In contrast, if the underlying
source of variation were the magnitude of private costs or benefits, then higher incentives would
reflect an attempt to offset the higher private benefits or costs. Higher private benefits or costs
lower firm performance. Based on the positive relationship between performance and incentives,
we conclude that any variations in the magnitude of B are small in comparison with the variation
in risk aversion or the variance of firm performance.

4.2 Investment and Incentives—Initial Results
Our results on the relationship between Tobin's Q and managerial incentives enable us to identify
the underlying source of variation but not the nature of the agency problem—private benefits or
private costs. As shown in Table 1, we must also consider the relationship between investment
and incentives in order to identify which model is generating the data. We estimate an analogous
spline regression for investment:

    (I/K) = $0 + $1PPS1 + fl2PPS2 + $3PPS3 + $4PPS4 + G + A + E.                                (19)
                                                                          t=94
In this equation, the dependent variable is firm investment divided by capital. Both investment
and capital are defined in terms of net property, plant, and equipment. As in the Q regression,
the PPS terms reflect the slopes of the segments in each of the four quartiles of the data, theyear
effects are denoted by O, and the firm level fixed effects are
   Table 4 presents the results of the OLS and fixed effect estimates of the coefficients in equation
(19). In the OLS regression, shown in the first column, the coefficients on the first three PPS
terms are positive and significantly different from zero at the one percent level.      The fourth
PPS term, corresponding to the slope of the top segment, is negative and significant. However,
as in the regressions for Tobin's Q in Table 3, the magnitude of the top segment's coefficient is
extremely small and reflects an essentially fiat relationship between investment and incentives.
The fixed effect results in the second column show a different pattern. In this regression, the
slopes of the first two segments are positive but insignificant. The slope of the third segment
is negative but extremely small and statistically insignificant. The slope of the top segment is


                                                22
positive and statistically significant at the one percent level. The test for the joint significance
of the four PPS terms rejects the null hypothesis that all coefficients are zero with a p-value of
0.0228. The PPS terms have significant explanatory power for investment. The p-value for the
test that the coefficients on all four PPS terms are equal to each other is 0.6416, indicating that a
linear specification would capture the relationship between investment and managerial incentives
as well as the spline does. The predicted values for both regressions are graphed in Figure 2 using
the intercepts for the 1993 sample year. Figure 2 shows that the relationship between investment
and incentives is positive.
   Combined with the positive slope of the relationship between Tobin's Q and incentives, the
finding that investment is increasing in incentives allows us to identify which model, private costs
or benefits of investment, is generating the data. Table 1 shows that if investment and firm
performance move in the same direction when incentives change, then the model must be one
of private costs of investment. The reason is intuitive: if risk aversion or the variance of firm
performance declines, so that it is less expensive to compensate the manager through incentives,
then shareholders will take advantage of the opportunity to increase incentives, thereby increasing
investment toward its optimal level (in the absence of an agency problem) and raising the value of
the firm. Our results do not support a model of overinvestment. If overinvestment were a feature
of the data, then increases in firm performance associated with increases in incentives would also
be associated with lower, not higher, levels of investment.
   To summarize our results, we can uniquely identify the model that generates the data from the
alternatives in the four cells of Table 1 based on two findings. Because the equilibrium values of
Tobin's Q and investment move together in response to changes in incentives, the model must be
one of private costs rather than private benefits of investment. Because this direction is positive,
the underlying source of variation across the equilibrium outcomes must be risk aversion or the
variance of firm performance rather than the magnitude of the private costs of investment.

4.3 Additional Specifications
Our initial regressions in Tables 3 and 4 focus on the relationships between managerial incentives
and both Tobin's Q and investment. In principle, there may be other determinants of investment
and firm performance that are not explicitly related to managerial incentives. The inclusion of


                                                23
fixed effects and year effects controls for a substantial amount of variation in these other factors.
Firm-specific factors that do not vary over time are absorbed by the fixed effects. Firm-specific
factors that change linearly over time are absorbed by the combination of the fixed effects and the
year effects. Economy-wide factors that affect all firms equally but vary over time are absorbed
by the year effects.
     To futher demonstrate the robustness of our initial estimates, we augment our fixed effects
specifications to include potential determinants of Tobin's Q and investment that vary both across
firms and within firms over time. We use the full set of covariates described in Table 2 to estimate
the following two regressions:

                         = /3 + /91PPS1ft + $2PPS2 + $3PPS3 + !34PPS4                          (20)

               (I/K) =       fib   + fi1PPSL + fi2PPS2 + /33PPS3 + fi4PPS41                    (21)

                             + 8kX +              Ut + A + Ej.
                                 k=1       t=94

In these regressions, the other covariates are denoted by 4. The results are presented in Table
5.

     The inclusion of the additional covarmates does not change the pattern of the coefficients on
the PPS terms in either regression. In the regression for Tobin's Q, all slopes are estimated to be
positive and are somewhat smaller than the estimates in Table 3. The p-values for the statistical
significance of the slope of each segment are 0.030, 0.058, 0.146, and 0.058. The p-value for their
joint significance is 0.0001. In the regression for investment with the additional covariates, the
estimated coefficient for the slope of the top segment is 0.0027 with a standard error of 0.0010.
These match the coefficient and significance of the top segment in Table 4, which did not control
for the additional covariates. The estimated coefficients for the bottom three slopes are slightly
lower and of comparable significance to those in Table 4. The p-value for the joint significance of
the FF8 terms is now 0.0323. The p-value for the equality of the FF8 coefficients is 0.6010, again
suggesting a linear specification would be sufficient to capture the relationship between incentives
and investment.


                                                  24
   For the additional covariates, we find that greater variance of returns is associated with lower
values of Tobin's Q and investment. All of the other variables in the investment regression are
insignificant, including cash flow and leverage, which are often cited as determinants of investment.
In the regressions for Tobin's Q, there are several significant results. Firm size, as measured by
the logarithm of sales, has a decreasing then increasing effect on Tobin's Q. The same is true for
the ratio of capital to sales. Higher leverage is associated with lower values of Tobin's Q. This
result contradicts hypotheses that greater leverage improves firm performance, as in other private
benefits models such as Jensen (1986), Stulz (1990), Hart and Moore (1995), and Zwiebel (1996).
Firms with more advertising expenditures tend to have lower values of Tobin's Q. Dividend yield
is not significantly related to either investment or Tobin's Q.
   These regressions show that the increasing relationships between incentives and both firm
performance and investment are robust features of the data. As an alternative specification, in
Table 6, we estimate the fixed effect regressions with a single linear term in managerial incentives,
denoted by ct.

In effect, we are imposing the constraints that fi =     = fi = fi in our original spline specifica-
tions.

   For both Tobin's Q and investment, the coefficient on managerial incentives is positive and
statistically significant. For Tobin's Q, the magnitude of the coefficient on incentives, 0.0121, is
intermediate between the slopes of the third and fourth segments of the spline regression estimates
in Table 5. For investment, the magnitude of the coefficient on incentives is very similar to that
of the top segment in Table 5. In the linear specifications, both firm performance and investment
are increasing in incentives, as predicted by the private costs of investment model.

4.4 Discussion
The results of our empirical estimates suggest a positive, concave relationship between Tobin's Q
and incentives and a positive, linear relationship between investment and incentives. Based on
the theoretical predictions detailed in Table 1, these results support a model in which managers

                                                 25
face private costs of investment (B < 0) and the underlying source of variation across equilibrium
outcomes is risk aversion or the variance of firm performance. The private costs model predicts
that we will observe underinvestment.
   Our results reject principal-agent models based on private benefits of investment (empire-

building, managerial entrenchment, perquisites consumption). Both investment and firm perfor-
mance move in the same direction in response to changes in incentives, not in opposite directions.
We also show that earlier empirical findings, based solely on the relationship between firm per-
formance and managerial ownership, are insufficient to identify whether the agency problem is
one of private costs or private benefits of investment. 'While there is surely anecdotal evidence
of overinvestment problems at individual firms, our results suggest that they are not, on average,
significant problems at a broad cross-section of U.S. corporations.
   Overinvestment problems have received extensive attention, starting with Jensen's (1986) dis-
cussion of overinvestment due to free cash flow. Jensen suggests that debt, dividends, takeovers,
and board monitoring could all serve as mechanisms to curtail overinvestment. Our private
benefits model shows that managerial incentives can serve the same purpose. Mechanisms such
as takeovers and board intervention require substantial, disruptive change. Given the relative
ease with which incentives from compensation can be adjusted, the compensation contract is the
natural mechanism to alleviate agency problems.
   Additionally, there is evidence to suggest that these alternative mechanisms are not effective.
Bertrand and Mullainathan (1998) show that takeover activity has decreased markedly in response
to antitakeover legislation. They also show that compensation incentives have partially offset the
reduction in incentives from takeovers. Jensen (1993) and Yermack (1996) suggest that boards,
and in particular larger boards, are ineffective at raising firm value. In our regressions from
Tables 5 and 6, we include both debt and dividends as explanatory variables. The coefficients on
dividends are insignificant in the regressions for both firm performance and investment. Although
the coefficient on debt is negative and significant in the investment regression, the coefficient is also
negative and significant in the Tobin's Q regression. This is inconsistent with debt constraining
overinvestment problems,
   In principle, our empirical results on underinvestment could be explained by factors other than



                                                   26
the principal-agent concerns discussed here. To take one example, suppose that managers have
private information about their own firms' quality. Then, in a dividend signaling model (Miller
and Rock (1985)), managers will cut investment to pay a dividend that signals their firms' quality.
In the Miller and Rock model, managers care about both the fundamental value of the firm and
the short-term stock price. The higher dividend increases the short-term stock price. If greater
management incentives cause managers to put greater weight on the fundamental value of the
firm, then managers will be less inclined to signal. Investment will increase (underinvestment
will decrease) and firm performance (fundamental value) wifi increase. As in our private costs
model, greater incentives are associated with higher investment and higher firm performance. It
is worth noting that, empirically, we find that both firm performance and investment are unrelated
to dividends. Further, controlling for dividends, greater incentives are associated with higher firm
performance and investment. These results cast doubt on the dividend signaling explanation.

   Aggarwal and Samwick (1999a, b) provide further support for the general principal-agent
framework by showing that incentives are declining in the variance of firm returns. While the
dividend signaling model and other alternative explanations may predict underinvestment, they do
not explain why incentives are declining in the variance of firm returns. Such a finding requires an
incentives-insurance tradeoff. Our private costs model can reconcile all three empirical findings:
investment is increasing in incentives; firm performance is increasing in incentives; and incentives
are decreasing in the variance of firm returns.
   Other models of the incentives-insurance tradeoff are also consistent with some of our findings.
In the Holrnstrom and Milgrom (1987) model, managers take actions such as exerting effort rather
than choosing the level of investment. In equilibrium, firm performance is increasing in the level
of incentives and incentives are decreasing in the variance of firm performance. Their model is not
designed to study the relationship between investment and incentives. However, the interpretation
of our underinvestment model is similar to that of their model if the private costs of investment
come from managers needing to exert effort to monitor investment. Our three findings provide
strong support for principal-agent models in which shareholders provide incentives for managers
to choose higher values of the action, whether investment or effort. Although the Holmstrom and
Milgrom (1987) model generates similar predictions to those of our underinvestment model, their



                                                  27
model is not sufficient to study overinvestment problems, which is the other main focus of our

study.

5. Conclusion
We examine how the separation of ownership and control affects investment and firm performance.
We consider two variants of the principal-agent problem. In the first variant, managers have
private benefits of investment and therefore overinvest. In the second variant, managers have
private costs of investment and therefore underinvest. We show how compensation contracts will
be designed to ameliorate over- or underinvestment problems. Given the optimal contracts we
derive, we then test several implications of the theory.
   For all specifications, we find that both investment and firm performance are increasing in
incentives. These results are consistent with the presence of private costs and underinvestment.
These results also suggest that the primary differences within and across firms are in risk aversion
or the variance of firm performance. In our framework, incentives are an endogenous variable
and our tests are based on the equilibrium predictions of the model. Increases in incentives come
from decreases in risk aversion or the variance of firm performance. The equilibrium increase
in incentives then yields higher investment and better performance. Without any change in the
underlying exogenous variables (risk aversion, variance), an increase in incentives would lower net
returns to shareholders and is therefore not optimal.
   Overall, we find little support for the idea that managers systematically overinvest. Our main
empirical contribution to the literature is to demonstrate that investment and performance increase
in response to increases in incentives. The implications of this result are straightforward. How
can there be an overinvestment problem due to agency concerns if greater incentives—the cure for
agency concerns—results in greater investment arid better firm performance? We find support
for the idea that managers underinvest. To the extent that they do, the positive relationship
between investment and incentives suggests that contracts are structured to address this problem.
Therefore, our results support the idea that contracts are set in equilibrium to optimally address
shirking problems in firms.

Notes:
1) Pay-perfonnance sensitivities (PPS) represent incentives provided by direct ownership of stock and stock options for each top
   management team or chief executive officer (CEO). They are expressed as percentages ofthe firm, from 0 to 100.
2) Pay-performance sensitivities are calculated from ExecuComp. The standard deviation of monthly returns is based on dollar
   returns calculated from CRSP, expressed in millions. All other variables are calculated from Compustat.
3) The PPS for the top management team includes the PPS for the CEO plus four times the average PPS for all other executives for
   whom data are available.
4) All dollar values are in millions ofconstant 1997 dollars.
5) The sample is comprised of 1494 finns observed annually from 1993 to 1997.
