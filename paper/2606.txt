                                   ABSTRACT


      A new empirical analysis of aggregate United States consumption and

 saving for the period 1947-80 ia presented. The model is based on the

 theory of exact aggregation. It recognizes explicitly that households with

 different characteristics may be heterogeneous in their behavior and that

 aggregate behavior may depend on the changing composition of households by

 characteriatics and therefore may not be adequately portrayed by a

 representative consumer, but otherwise it imposes minimal assumptions on

 household behavior. The model integrates longitudinal and cross-sectional

 microeconomic data on household characteristics with the traditional

 aggregate time-series data. Various hypotheses on consumption, such as age

 independence, proportionality to wealth, and price independence, sre tested

 and rejected. Strong evidence of relative price effects and a systematic

 variation of aggregate consumption with changing age distribution of wealth

 in the economy is found. Especially important is the substantial estimated

 difference in the shares of wealth consumed between households headed by

 persons born prior to and those born after 1939. One important lesson from

 this study is that modeling the aggregate U.S. economy as a rapresentstive

 consumer may give rise to misleading results.

    4.3 Estimation Results

    The results of the conditional maximum likelihood estimation are presented

in Tables 4.1 and 4.2. The statistical fit is good as is also graphically

apparent from Figures 4.5 and 4.6. The (conditional) asymptotic standard errors

of the estimators of rhe parameters ere not unduly large; and the Durhin-Watson

statistics appear acceptable. In Figure 4.7 we   present     the aggregate residuals

(the difference beteen actual and predicted aggregate consumption or leisure

expenditures) as a percentage of actual aggregate consumption or leisure

expenditures. On a percentage basis, the aggregate residual never exceeds 3

percent of the actual value.

     The firSt order of business is to test whether our specification of the age

profile effects (which imposes fixed differences among the consumption

expenditure-wealth and leisure expenditure-wealth ratios of different age-

cohorts in in 1972) is better than a flat age profile (that is, no age effects

other than the vintage 1939 effect) in explaining the data. Since there is no

change in the degrees of freedoe, we simply compare the logarithms of the

likelihood under each of the two specifications. These are reported in Table

4.3. and it is apparent that the imposed age profile is preferred to the.flat

age file.
      Continuing our analysis but now maintaining the imposed age profile, we

proceed to test the five' hypotheses outlined in Section 3.5 by the likelihood

ratio method. Asymptotically, minus 2 times the difference in the logarithm of

the likelihood ratio is distributed as the      distribution under the null

hypothesis. The test statistics are presented in Table 4.4. For the

convenience of the readers we provide the crjttcal values of the   test statistics
st   the 1 and 5 percent levels of significance in Table 4.5.

       It is apparent from Tables 4.4 and 4.5 that with the exception of

intertemporal separability, all the hypotheses can be rejected at the 1

percent level of significance. However, the hypothesis of separability of

the current period consumption and leisure from those of the future periods,

often a maintained hypothesis in tests of other hypotheses concerning

aggregate consumption (e.g ,   Boskin and Kotlikoff (1985) and their test of
intergenerational altruism, and Hall and Mishkin (1982) and Bernanke (1984)

and their tests for the importance of liquidity constraints),30 cannot be

rejected at the 5 percent level of significance.




30. We should add, however, that our concept of intertemporal separability is more
general then the usual one because we do not essujee the existence of a utility
function for the household as a whole, let alone its maximization. The
hypothesis that is tested is a necessary condition for the household utility
function to be intertemporally separable if it exists.

    4.4 Interpretations

     For the consumption expenditure function, the profile of estimated age-

cohort coefficients rises aootonically.31 The female labor force

participation rate does not have s statistically significant effect. The

coefficient for the unemployment rate has the expected negative sign   and   is

statistically significant. The share of wealth held by households headed by

persons born prior to 1939 has a statistically significant and negative

effect. For every one   percentage point   increase in the share of wealth held

by this group of households, the eggregata consumption-wealth ratio declines

by 1.65 percentage points. In other words, if wealth were to be held

entirely by this group, or if eli other groups behaved similarly to this

group, the consumption-wealth ratio would have been lower by 1.65 percentage

                                     32
points, a very significant amount!

     The real rate of interest elao has a statistically significant effect:

an increase in the real rate of interest, holding human and nonhuman wealth

and hence, total wealth, constant, increases the consumption expenditure.




31. Recall that the dependent variable is the ratio of aggregate consumption to
wealth, and that human wealth, and hence total wealth, declines rapidly for
the last two age cohorts.




                                            56
An increase in the real after-tax rate of interest lowers the forward prices

of future consumption, under our assumptions, relative to the spot price of

current consumption. The net effect ia, however, theoretically ambiguous.

Here we find that it is positive. Correspondingly, its effect on saving (as

defined in the National Income and Product Accounts) is negative. The net

effect of a change in the real after-tax rate of return depends upon the

relative sizes of these effects. The negative of the sum of the

coefficients 0cc end     measures the effect of a change in the size

distribution of wealth on aggregate consumption. It is found to be

negative, so that an increase in the degree of inequality of the size

distribution of wealth holding average real wealth constant decreases

aggregate consumption. We discuss the calculation of the net effect and its

implication for consumption and saving later in this section.

     For the leisure expenditure function, the profile of estimated age-

cohort coefficients takes a hump-shape: it rises monotonicsliy until the

cohort 45-54 and then declines.    The female labor force participation rate

has a statistically significant and negative effect on leisure expenditure,

as expected. The coefficient for the unemployrsent tate has the expected

positive sign and is statistically significant. The share of wealth held by




32. Nate that we do not interact the age cohort and vintage effects; instead, we
estimate a uniform average vintage effect. It is poesibte that the vintage
effect may be larger at some ages than at othere. Indeed, one of the key
questions in the future evolution of U.S. private saving is whether the
poet-Depreesion vintage will "break outs of their lower age-saving profile.




                                         57
households headed by persons born prior to 1939 has a statistically positive

and significant effect. The effect, however? is small. The price of

consumption and the wage rats both have statistically significant effects on

leisure: however, the precise direction of the effect depends on the values

of the psrameters as well as the variables as they work in the same

direction on the numerator and the denominator. The real rate of interest

also has a statistically significant effect similar to that on consumption

expenditure. The negative of the sum of the coefficients?      and

measures the effect of a change in the size distribution of wealth on

aggregate leisure. It is found to be slightly positive, so that an increase

in the degree of inequality of the size distribution of wealth holding

aversge real wealth constant increases aggregate leisure.

     En Table 4.6, we present first estimates of the elasticities of

consumption, leisure, total expenditure and saving of a representative

household headed by a person in the 45-54 age cohort in 1972 with respect to

total, human, and nonhuman wealth, the price of consumption, wage rate and

the real after-tax rate of interest, holding both human end nonhuman wealth

constant, calculated from the formulae derived in Section 3.7. These

estimates are labelled "witht human wealth revaluation". However, in




33. We note that the unimodality constraint on Gz25 is effective.

reality, when the real after-tax rate of interest changes, wealth can be

expected to remain constant only if it is held entirely in the form of

floating-rate assets (and liabilities). In general, if the stream of future

incomes remains the same, wealth is expected to dacreese with an increase in

the real after-tax rate of interest. In this study, we assume that nonhuman

wealth is held entirely in the form of floating-rate assets and thus is

insensitive to changes in the real rate of interest, but not human wealth.

We therefore also present ths same elasticities with respect to the real

rate of interest and the wage rate "with human wealth revaluation.

     We find that the elasticities of consumption, leisure and total

expenditure with respect to total wealth fall approximately between 0.75 and

0,80. The     elasticity   of aaving with respect to total wealth is, however,

large, negative, end statistically significant. The elasticities of

consumption, leisure and total expenditure with respect to human wealth are

all somewhat smaller than the corresponding elasticities with respect to

total wealth, in fact, by the same proportionality factor. The elasticity

of saving with respect to human wealth is also large and negative. The

elasticities of consumption, leisure and total expenditure with respect to

nonhuman wealth are statistically significant but leas than 0.1 in

magnitude. Trsnslatsd      to the more usual   marginal   propensities to consume
out of nonhuman   wealth, the estimatÃ a are about .025. similar to, but perhaps

slightly smaller than, the usual time series estimates, The elasticity of

saving with respect to nonhuman wealth is positive but not statistically

significant. The elasticity of consumption with respect to

the price of consumption is negative ea expected and statistically

significant   at about -0.6. The elasticity of leisure with respect to the price of
consumption is negligibla and statistically insignificant. The elasticity
of total expenditure with respect to its price of conswsption is relatively

                                               59
small (approximately 0.2) but statistically significant. The elasticity of

saving with respect to the price of consumption is large (approximately -

3.5)   and statistically significant.

       Holding both human and nonhuman, and hence total, wealth constant, the

elasticities of consumption, leisure and total expenditure with respect to

the real after-tax rate of interest lie between 0.20 and 0.25 and are

statistically significant. The elasticity of caving with respect to the

real rate of interest is approximately -2.5 and statistically significant.

This finding of a large negative elasticity of saving with respect to the

real rats of interest may seem surprising but is dependent on the

hypothesis that wealth is held constant, a hypothesis we relax below. The

elasticity of consumption with respect to wage rate is negative but not

statistically significant although it is suggestive of possible

compleisentarity between current consumption and current leisure. The

elasticity of leisure with respect to the wage rate is negative as expected

snd statistically significant. The elasticity of total expenditure with

respect to wage rate is negligible and statistically insignificant. The

elasticity of saving with respect to the wage rate is positive and large and

on the border line of being statistically significant.

       With full human wealth revaluation, however, the comparative static

effects of increases in the real after-tax rate of interest and the wage

rate change considerably. The elasticities of consumption, leisure, total

expenditure and saving with respect to the real after-tax rate of interest

all become negligible or statistically insignificant or both. The

elasticities of consumption, leisure end total expenditure with respect to

the wage rate are positive, between zero and one, and statistically

significant. The elasticity of saving with respect to the wage rate turns




                                           60
negative and large and is statistically significant. The finding that with

full human wealth revaluation, the elasticity of saving with respect to the

real after-tax rate of interest is statistically not different from zero may

also seem surprising in view of the results of some other aggregate time-

series consumption function studies, eg. ,       Boskin   (1978) and Summers (1982,

1984).

        We should note that the elasticities presented in Table 4.6 are for a

household headed by a person in the 45-54 cohort with the independent

variables set equal to their 1972 values and therefore are not directly

comparable to other studies. We present estimates of elasticities of

aggregate saving below.

        The estimated comparative static effects differ quite systematically

between the pre-1939 and post-1939 vintages of households and also differ

across different age cohorts and households with different ratios of

nonhuman to total wealth. In Figure 4.8, we show how the effects on saving,

with full human wealth revaluation, of a one percent change in the real

after-tax rate of interest in 1972, differ between pre and post-Depression

vintages and across age cohorts. In Figure 4.9, we show how the effects on

saving, with full human     wealth   revaluation, of a one percent change in the

real interest rate in 1972. differ across households headed by persons in

the 45-54 age cohort with different ratios of nonhuman to total wealth.

Note, in particular, that the effects turn from negative to positive as the

ratio    of nonhuman to total wealth exceeds approximately ten percent.
        It is of some   interest to calculate the interest elasticity of aggreate

saving, taking into account the joint distribution of households by wealth,

pre End   post-Depression vintage,    age cohort, and   the   ratio of nonhuman to

totalwealth. This parameter represents the percentage change in aggregate

     4.5 Coaparison to Previous Research

     The results reported here are not directly comparable to previous research

because of differences in the specification and measurement of the model and the

varisbles, especially the estimation of aggregate consumption and leisure in

terms   of   their shares of wealth. In this Section we provide the translation

necessary to compare our results to the usual      consumption   function estimates.

     First, the results strongly reject the notion that a "representative

consumer" model can adequately explain aggregate consumption behavior in the

postwar United States. In particular, demographic factors, especially the age

composition of the population and the age distribution of aggregate resources,

appear to be important determinants of aggregate consumption. While not a

formal test of either lifecycle theory or the intergenerational altruistic model

of aggregate consumption, the results do suggest that the age distribution of

resources is important, (end hence that the strong form of Ricsrdian equivalence

does not hold in the aggregate U.S. time series), and that at least some form of

consumption smoothing by age relative to income by age is occurring.

     The value of the interest elasticity of saving, once one defines the

relevant experiment as was done in Section 4.4, has been the subject of a

tremendous controversy (see, for example, Howrey and Hymana        (1980))   because

of its implicstion for the effects of fiscal policy, structural tax          policy,


                                            62
and the social rate of discount, to name but a few. The results reported

here are somewhat different from the results of Soskin (1978) and Summers

(1981, 1982. 1984) concerning the effects of the real after-tax rate of

return on aggregate saving. The estimated aggregate interest elasticities

range from - .5 to 0.5, depending on whether we uss 1972 or 1980 values of

the independent variables and whether we revalue human wealth. This

heterogeneity is also notsd in Summers (1982). As discussed in section 3,7,

revaluing human wealth always increases the interest elasticity of saving

for a household with positive saving and      decreases it    for a household with

negative saving. With some households saving and others dissaving, the

aggregate effect, being a weighted average, is in general indeterminate.

     The results reported here also lend support to the notion that taxation

of saving cart   affect   aggregate saving, although obviously the effects must

net the effect on savers against the effect on dissavers. The effect on

saving of its reduced taxation will be positive (and eventually large) only

for those households with nonhuman wealth exceeding 10 percent of their

total wealth. For those with little nonhtan wealth the effect will be

negative.

     The wealth elasticity and the implied marginal propensity to consume

out of wealth sre similar to those reported in the typical consumption

studies (see for example, Boskin (1981) and other studies discussed in

Zernheim (1981)), about 0.75 end 0.025 respectively for households headed by

the 45-54 year old cohort in 1972.

     It is not our purpose here to compare our      results   to each and every time

series   study of aggregate consumption in the United States component by
component. It is somewhat reassuring that the merging of aggregate with
disaggregated data and other potential     improvements we    have made lead to



                                             63
estimates which are comparable with previous research. Perhaps the most

important finding concerns the apparent tremendous difference in th.            propensity

to   save by households headed by persons born pre and post         1939,   at the sane age.
It appears that as the share of total national resources held by persons born
post 1939 rises, the national saving rate viii decrease unless some major

modifications occur     in   the consumption/wealth patterns at later ages for persons
born post     1939, or some of   the other variables affecting consumption change
suhstanticily.


5.     Accounting   for the Growth in Consumption in the United States, 1950-
       1980

       5.1 Decomposition     of Growth in Consumption

       We have constructed a modei of aggregate consumption which appears to

explain the U.S. postwar consumption data quite         well. We have also found
interesting     and significant demographic effects on aggregate consumption,

ranging from those of the age distribution of wealth, to differential saving

patterns for households headed by persons born pre- and post-1939. The

female labor force participation rate and other         variables   also affected

aggregate consumption. Importantly, relative prices, including the real

after-tax rate of interest, on average appear to have a substantial effect

on   aggregate consumption.
       Aggregate consumption grew substantially in the United States in the

three and a half decades following World War II and we attempt to account

for this growth on the basis of our modal. We       divide the thirty-year period
into   two sub-periods: 1950-62 and 1963-80. Recall from Figure 4.1 that

the growth of aggregate consumption expenditure accelerated around this

break point, in fact, as Table 5.1 reveale, the annual percentage change in

real aggregate consumption was 2.74% in the 1950-62 period but accelerated




                                              64
to 3.45* in the 1953-80, en increase of about

      We combine our estimated consumption expenditure there function with

information on the changes over the relevant sample subperiod in the variables

affecting aggregate consumption shares to "explain" the growth in annual

eggregete real consumption. i.e. â€¢    to   decompose the change in aggregate real

consumption   into componente corresponding to      its proximate determinants.

Specifically,   by observing that the systematic part of the right-hand side of
equation   (4.1) must be homogeneous ofdegree zero in p, w0 and        (under the

no money illusion essumption), we amy rewrite equation (4.1) as:

34.We confine our analysis to the period 1950-80, as Figures 4.2 end 4.3 reveal
unusual swings in consumption and saving rates the first few years after
World War II.

Thus, the rate of change of aggregate real consumption may first be

decoisposed into the sum of the rates of change of real consumption per

household and the rate of change of the number of households. The rate of

change   of real consumption per household may                 be further decompoied into the

sum of   the effects of the changes of real wealth per household, the real
wage rate, the real after-tax rate of interest, the distribution of real
wealth by size, age cohort and vintage, the female labor force participation

rate snd the unemployment rste. The effect of the change in the

distribution of wealth by age cohort may be further decomposed into the sum

of two effects: the effect of a change in the age composition of households

alone and the effect of a change in the relative wealth across age cohorts.

     We note that          the   size distribution of real wealth variable may be

rewritten as:

         The results of the decomposition exercise are presented in Table

The first thing to note about the data in Table 5.1 is that a large fraction

of the acceleration in the average annual rate of growth of aggregate real

consumption in the United States in the mid to late l960s and 1970a was due

to an increased rate of household formation. There waa still an increase in

the average real consumption per household: but the substantial increase in

the number of households, due pertly to population growth, changing living

patterns, and rising life expectancies, accounts for almost half of the

growth in aggregate real consumption in the period 1950-1962, and almost 65

percent in the period 1963-1980.

         Turning next to the factors affecting average real consumption per

household, we see that average real wealth per household declined vary

slightly in the first sub-period and resulted in a net decrease in

consumption of between one and two-tenths of a percentage point, wherees in

the letter sub-period, average real wealth increased substantially and

accounted for ebout seven-tenths of a percentage point annual increase in

real consumption.

         We turn now to examine the two moat important relative prices, real

wage rates end real interest rates. Real wage ratee rose repidly over the

whole period but about 40% more rapidly in the first sub-period than in the

second. These trend.. account for the negative three-tenths and two-tenths

of   a   percentage point effect of the growth in real conaumption in the two

sub-perioda1 respectively. Reel interest rates rose slightly in the first



36. Bear in aind that these results use the point estimates of the coefficients
presented in Table 4.1.

sub-period but fell slightly in the second sub-period; they account for the

positive one and then negative one-half percentage point of growth in real

consumption in the two sub-periods, respectively. Indeed, except for the

growth in the number of households in the first sub-period, the effect of

changes in real interest rates was larger than that of any other factor,

whereas in the second sub-period their effect was larger than any factor

other than.the growth in average real wealth and the Depression vintage

effect.

     We turn next to the variables reflecting the size and age distribution

of wealth. During the first sub-period, the change in the size distribution

of wealth, which had become more unequal, had a negative effect of four-

tenths of a percentage point on the growth of real consumption, whereas the

change in the age distribution of wealth accounted for about two-tenths of a

percentage point of the growth of aggregate annual consumption, or 16% of

the total. Further, the Depression vintage effect accounted for almost

three-tenths of a percentage point of the growth in average real annual

consumption as the share of wealth held by households headed by persons born

after 1939 grew slowly over this period. It accounted for about one-fifth

of the net percentage change in real consumption per household,

     During the second sub-period, the size and age distribution of wealth

and vintage effects ware also large. The size distribution of wealth effect

accounted for an almost two-tenths of a percentage point increase in the net

percentage change in average annual real consumption, about 13% of the

actual net increase. The age distribution of wealth effect subtracted

another seven-tenths of a percentage point from what would otherwise have

been the change in real consumption per household, more than 50% of the full

change in absolute value. The Depression vintage effect became very large




                                         72
in this period. The share o wealth held by persons born after 1939 roae

much more rapidly in the second sub-period than in the first, indeed, the.

Depression vintage effect alone, holding other variables constant accounted

for about a 1.3 percentage point increase in the annual rate of growth in

consumption, more than 100% of the total.

        The effects of changes in the age distribution of wealth can be further

decomposed      into two components;   e pure age composition of houaeholds effect.

which holds the average relative household wealth by age constant; and a

pure relative household wealth by age effect, which holds the age

composition of households constant. It turns out that the two components

tended to work in oppoeits      directions.    For both sub-periods, the effects of

changes in the age composition of households are        responsible for the    bulk of

the effect of changes in the age distribution of wealth.

        The above diacu.seion of the effects of changee in the real wage rates

and the real interest rates ignores the changes        they may' have   caused, in

total    reel   wealth through the revaluation of human wealth. If we inÃ lude in

their effects their indirect effects on real consumption through the

revaluation of real human wealth, we find that the net effect of the real wage rate

increases changes from -0.3% and -0.2% to 0,7% and 0,4% in the two sub-

periods respectively, and the net effect of the changes in real interest

rates correspondingly moves from 1.0% to virtually nil and from -0.5% to

-0.2%.

       These    reeults suggest that the drematic changes in the age distribution

of income   end wealth   in the United States in the poet-war period (documented
more    fully for the 1968-84 period by Boskin, Kotlikoff and Knetter (1985))
had   substantial   net impacts on the growth of aggregate consumption and
saving. Indeed, the rapid shift of wealth toward post-Depression birth
cohorts kept consumption growing rapidly despite increases in life


                                               73
expectancy and the growth of income and wealth in the hands of retired

persons (who by definition were born prior to 1939 in the period under

study), i.e., the post-Depression generation's greater propensities to

consume at young ages offset the movement of the pre-Depression generation

into ages with greater propensities to save. Had the post-Depression birth

cohorts shown similar consumption and saving patterns to the pre-1939 birth

cohort, aggregate consumption would have increased substantially less and

aggregate saving would have been quite a bit higher than in fact occurred.

      The female labor force participation rate increased modestly in the

first sub-period, and accounted for about three-tenths of a percentage point

of the annual increase in average real consumption, whereas its rate of

increase doubled in the second sub-period, and accounted for about a half of

a percentage point of the annual increase in average real consumption.

      Finally, we note that the business cycle effect, proxied by the

logarithm of the prime age white male unemployment rate, despite its secular

trend over the two sub-periods, had very little impact on average real

consumption.

      Taken as a whole, these results highlight how important various

demographic trends have been in affecting aggregate consumption and its

growth in the postwar United States. Aggregate consumption and saving are

affected heavily by demographic patterns, although in the 1950-80 period and

in the   two sample   subperioda, various demographic factors often offset one

another.   These demographic factors include the rate of household    formation,

the   age composition of the population, the age distribution of wealth, the
differences in the saving/consumption profiles over the lifecycle between

persons born prior and subsequent to 1939 â€¢ and the female labor force

participation   rate.




                                             14
       This decomposition, of course, is meant to examine the proximate

determinants of the growth rate of consumption. We have not attempted          to
expisin why there is an apparent difference in the consumption and saving

rates at the. same age of pre and post Depression birth cohorts or the

acceleration of feisale labor force participation. One can develop numerous

conjectures, not all of which are easily quantifiable. It is often

mentioned   anecdotally that persons who lived through the Depression    are

reluctant   to   borrow, whereas, again anecdotally, but buttressed by aggregate

credit statistics, the growth of credit and borrowing for a wide range of

purposea has become a part of life for persons born since the Depression.

In turn, one might conjecture that part of this is due to the tax laws

allowing deductibility of consumer interest payments with rising marginal

tax rates in     the period under study for   the bulk of the population. It is

not our purpose hers to attempt to explain the facts we have uncovered, but

we hope additional research will shed light on these issues. They appear to

be quite important in assessing not only the economic history of the first

few   decades after World War II, hut may well be important in determining the
future evolution of consumption and saving patterns in the United States.


      5;2 Iiortance of the Vintage Effect
      The difference in saving propensities between households headed by
persona of the pre- and post-1939 birth cohorts is not only large but has
importsnt implications for private, and hence, national saving, in Figure
5.1. we present the results of the hypothetical calculation of what total
private   saving would have been if the post-1939 generation had the same

saving propensities, conditional on age and the other variables in our

consumption   expenditure function, as the pre-1939 generation. We compare

 this hypothetical ratio of saving to GNP with our estimated ssving/GNF

 ratio, The difference is substantial, averaging approximately 10% for the

 period 1963-80,

        How important ste these differences? First, the shaded ares gives a

 very rough idea of the cumulative sdditional saving which would have

 occurred had the post-1939 generation saved "like their parents

 generation" .       This   amounts   to   about 115% of 1980 CNP,       or   about 1/3 of the

 actual private nonhuman wealth. Even            if   we use   sn   estimate of   the   cohort

 differential two     standard   errors smaller than our         point   estimate, the

cumulative effect would have been more than 70% of 1980 GNP. Increases of

cumulative savings of these magnitudes,            if   invested, would have increased

ONP by about 7%-lO% in the 1980s. Note that the share of wealth held by

households headed by parsons born           post-1939 has      been growing and therefore

if    the   estimated differential saving propensities persist, private saving
will    continue to decline, ceterie paribus. Thus, the vintage effect is one
explanation      for the decline in the private saving rate from the average of

7.1% in the 1960e to the averege of 5.8% in the 1980s.

       To gain further perspective on the importance of this factor for the

decline     in private saving, consider that          by 1980, the estimated annual

decrease was almost equal to the actual privet. saving rate itself. Holding
the government deficit and private domestic investment constant, reversing
such a difference by itself would be more then sufficient to redress the
imbalance in national saving and invastisent in the United States, eliminate


37. The estimate is approximate both because increased saving leading to increased
wealth would lead eubsequsntly to increased consumption; and the increased
saving may well have generated increased investment (not necessarily dollar for
dollar in an open economy) end subsequently higher incomes.

nation.


6.      Conclusion

        We have developed and presented a new empirical analysis of aggregate

United States consumption and saving for the period 1947-80. The research

incorporates several novel features. The model is based on the theory of

exact aggregation. It recognizes explicitly that households with different

characteristics may be heterogeneous in their behavior and that aggregate

behavior may depend on the changing distribution of households by

characteristics and therefore may not be adequately portrayed by a

representative consumer, but otherwise it imposes minimal assumptions on

household behavior. We merge linked Current Population Survey data on the

distribution of income and its components by the age of the head of the

household and aggregate time series data on consumption, interest rates,

etc. The econometric results are interesting and important. Using a

general functional form, and imposing the budget constraint and "no money

illusion", but not necessarily utility maximization, on the demand

functions, and conditional on our assumptions on expectations, we generate

estimates which track the actual consumption and saving in the economy quite

well.

        Restricting the functional form to impose various hypotheses on

consumption prevalent in the literature such as age independence,

proportionality, intertemporal separability, and price independence is

instructive. We reject each of these hypotheses, with the exception of

intertemporal separability. Nost important are the overwhelming rejection

of relative price independence and the rejection of age distribution of

resources independence of aggregate consumption. We find strong evidence of




                                            77
relative price effects, including interest rate effects, snd a systematic

variation of aggregate consumption with changes in the age distribution of

wealth in the economy. Especially significant is the substantial estimated

difference in the shares of wealth consumed between households headed by

persons born before and after 1939. This vintage effect is so large that if

the age-specific conditional saving rates of the post-Depression households

were as large as those of the pre-Depression households, the private saving

rate would have doubled its actual value in 1980. In essence, aggregate

saving may be considered a weighted average of two vintages of household,

pre- and post-Depression, each with its own specific age-saving profile,

with the later vintage's profile lying below that of the earlier vintage.

Since the share of aggregate income received and hence total wealth held by

those .in the later vintage is growing through time, a continuation of this

phenomenon would auggest further erosion of the aggregate private saving

rate.

        Our results thua suggest that fiacal policies which affect the real

after-tax rate of return (such as capital income taxes) and the age
distribution of resources (such as the size of the public debt) might       indeed

have    effected aggregate consumption in the period under     study.

        Our estimates of parameters auch as the   elasticity   of consumption with
respect to wealth and    "the"   interest elasticity of saving are also
interesting. The former is quite consistent with those found in typical
aggregate time series consumption functions which do not attempt to take

into account the age distribution of resources, whereas the latter estimates
shed some new light on the findings of Soskin (1978) and Stnaers (1981,
1982, 1984), who reported substantial elaaticitiea. We present separate
interest elasticities with and without the revaluation of human wealth and
also demonstrate how the elasticity varies with the ratio of nonhuman to


                                             78
total wealth. The results suggest that targeting tax incentives for saving

at younger workers or those with few assets, i.e., those with low ratios of

nonhuman to total wealth, is likely to lead to little effect on aggregate

saving; the targeting, if any, should be on thole with higher ratios of

nonhuman to total wealth.38 The recent IRA account limitations on

deductability may thus be mistargeted on a ssving bang for the tax dollar

loss buck" calculation.

     An important lesson from our research is that modelling the U.S.

economy as a representative consumer may be quite misleading. While this

device may be useful for some analytical purposes, it is likely to leave out

sufficiently important information so as to be potentially unrelLable in

analyzing aggregate data and/or policy experiments. This research tends

strong support to efforts to modal age-specific budget constraints and

aggregate behavior, as is done in Auerbach and Xotlikoff (1983).

     Our decomposition of the annual growth rate of aggregate consumption in

the two sub-periods 1950-62 and 1963-80 into its proximate determinants

revealed several important features. First, the acceleration in the rate of

growth of aggregate consumption between the two sub-periods was due

primarily to the increased rate of household formation. Second, by the

latter sub-period the Depression vintage effect is the most important

determinant of the rate of growth of consumption per household. Third, the

net effect of interest rate changes with human wealth revalued is small.

     Like all other research, our results have their advantages and




38. Indeed1 the survey information from the take-up rates for individual
retirement accounts indicates that middle income households and households
headed by persons in their SO's were the most likely to use IRAs.




                                         79
limitations. It would be desirable to extend the analysis to include

alternative specifications, for example, alternative specifications of

expectations   It would also be desirable, as a test of specification of the

model, to make conditional post-sample forecasts of the model. The major

advantages of our approach are the flexibility of the specification of

consumption expenditure functions, the minimal economic consistency

requirements of TMno money illusion0 without any other strong maintained

hypotheses such as utility maximization, let alone by a representative

consumer. Another advantage is the integration of individual household and

aggregate data end the tests of the hypotheses that the age distribution of

resources affects aggregate consumption. We believe this research

comptesients other approaches in analyzing consumption and saving behavior

with both aggregate data and individual household data. We hope that it

will stimulate further research on the issues we have   raised   and have

attempted to begin to answer.

                                  Appendix



    We present below a brief description of the generation of the data used

in our paper. (Further details are available upon request from the

authors.) First, real after-tax rates of interest are derived from data on

Moody's AAA-ten-year corporate bond yields, the automobile finance rete,

Moody's AAA-:wenty-year municipal tax-exempt bond yield and the implicit

price deflator for personal consumption expenditures in the National Income

and Product Accounts (NIPA). The expected inflation rate for the

immediately succeeding period is generated by a distributed lag over the

previous five periods with the weights assigned to different periods

estimated by a maximum likelihood search procedure. As is usual in such

studies, a heavy weight is obtained for the immediately past period. A risk

premium for personal finance of 3% is estimated from a regression of the

automobile finance rate against the corporate bond rate, The real aftcr-tiax

rate of interest is derived as the municipal hand rate minus the expected

inflation rate plus the 3% risk premium.

     Second, we use the panel study of income dy'nsmics (PSID) of 1972 to

build an age-wage profile. The wage' expected for a worker in sny given

year, at a future age, given his current age, as a ratio of his current

wage, is assumed to be tbe same as that given by the ratio of standard

hourly earnings predicted by the estimated earnings function which is

assumed to be quadratic in age. Average marginal tax rates from Barro and

Sahasakul (1983) are used to Strive, the after-tax wage rates.

     Third, to measure the value of human capital, the expected present

value of future earnings, for eech age cohort, we generate an adjusted

number of households of each age cohort from the baseline data in the

Current Population Survey Report, Series P-20, Bureau of the Census. We



                                       81
assume a full endowment of leisure of 4400 hours per year. The probability

of survival at each age is generated from 11.5. Vital Ststistics. This gives

us an estimated number of households by age cohort for each year from 1947

to 1980. These data combined with our estimates of expected future after-

tax wage rates, and real after-tax rates of interest, give us an estimate of

human wealth by age cohort for each year. When future earnings ars

discounted in our calculation of human wealth for each age cohort, we also

discount by one minus the probability of survival at each age. While human wealth

increases reflect the increase in adjusted male average hourly earnings from

$1.27 in. 1947 to $8.01 in 1980, the relative shifts among age cohorts are

substantial. For example, human wealth between 1965 and 1975 increases 349%

for the 25-34 age cohort, 219% for 35-44, and 220% for 45S4.

        Fourth, the measurement of nonhuman capital by each age cohort starts

with allocating aggregate NIPA property income by category for each age

cohort for each year. We assume that the ratio of each category of property

income to measured income by each age bracket is conmtant and is the same as

that observed in the Consumer Expenditure Survey of 1972-73. The components

of income (expenae) include market rental income, the property income part

of self employment income, personal interest income, dividend income,

imputed rental income on own dwelling before interest payments, and interest

expenses on own dwelling. By applying these ratios to the mean income for

each sge bracket in Series P-60 of the Current Population Survey, we obtain

a preliminary time series of property income by age bracket. It is well

known that   survey data usually underestimates property income. Thus, for
each category   of property income, we calculate the ratio of the sum across

age brackets to the aggregate PUPA figure and multiply the inverse of this

ratio   to our preliminary   property income estimate for each age bracket.




                                          82
Thus, the   sums of estimated property incomes across age brackets are made

consistent with the corresponding NIPA aggregates.

     Each category of property income is capitalized to obtain the

appropriate asset or debt value. The real after-tax rate of intereat plus

3% risk premium is applied to all property income except interest income and

expense. The personal interest yielding asset value is obtained by

capitalizing personal interest income by the nominal, corporate bond yield

with a 3% risk premium. The debt value of owned-home mortgage, is derived

by using the capitalization rate which would yield the aggregate mortgage

value reported by the Flow of Funds Data of the Federal Reserve Board.

Again, nonhuman wealth rises substantially from 1947-80, with pronounced

changes in the age composition. Perhaps most interesting and important is

the 473% rise in the nonhuman wealth of the 65+ cohort, compared to, for

example, 183% for the 45-54 cohort and 294% for the 55-64 cohort.

     Personal consumption expenditures from the National Income and Product

Accounts, l947-l98D form the basis for our basic consumption data. Leisure

expenditure data are derived as the difference between full-wage income and

NIPA wage income plus the labor income component of proprietors' income,

which is estimated as 80% of the total reported. We do not attempt a full

 adjustment of the consumption series to include the service flows from

 consumer durables, but conform to the NIPA convention     This includes an

 estimate of imputed rent to owner-occupied housing as part of consumption,

but not the aervices of consumer-owned durables.

      From the Consumer Expenditure Survey of 1972-73, we can calculate the

 average consumption and leisure expenditure to wealth ratios for each age

 cohort. In deriving such ratios we adjust the per family consumption, wage

 income, and property income by age cohort, directly derivable from the

 Consumer Expenditure Survey, to match each data series with the
corresponding aggregate NIPA data when per family data are added up using

the age distribution and the number of families from the 1972 Current

Population Survey. While we do not constrain the level of the ratios other

than that their weighted average conforms to the aggregate, we do impose a

less restrictive assumption that the difference between the estimated ratios

of each age cohort and the 45-year old age cohort in 1972 is equal. to the

actual difference in 1972.

     Three additional regressors are used in the base case of our study.

These are the female labor force participation rate, the logarithm of the

prime age white male unemployment rate (taken, respectively, from the Bureau

of Labor Statistics Bulletin and the Economic Report of the President) and

the share of wealth held by households headed by persons born prior to 1939.

Data on this last regressor is derived from the raw data. Because data on

households by individual ages are not readily available on a year to year

basis1 we estimate the fraction of households born post-1939 by allocating

the fractions within each cohort to specific ages. The data suggest

(Current Population Survey Reports 1981, 1982) that only 7% of the

households in the 14-24 cohort are beaded by persons less than 20 years old.

We thus allocate the cohort totals to individual ages to obtain that

fraction which is presumed to have been born pre- and post-1939. For the

older age cohorts, households are distributed more or less uniformly.

     We also experimented with some additional economic and demographic

regressors which sight affect consumption and leisure. These include the

proportion of single-headed households, life expectancy at birth, the

fraction of non-whites in the total population, and the fraction of the

labor force covered by Social Security, as well as various measures of

'Social Security Wealth". In all cases, the inclusion of these variables is




                                      84
not supported by standard statistical tests, Further, as Figure A1

reveals,   while many of these variables are trended, none of their paths are

closely correlated with that of the share of wealth held by households

headed by persons born pre-1939.
