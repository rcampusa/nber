Demographic Determinants of Testing Incidence and COVID-19 Infections in New York

                                          ABSTRACT

New York City is the hot spot of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. This paper
merges information on the number of tests and the number of infections at the New York City zip
code level with demographic and socioeconomic information from the decennial census and the
American Community Surveys. People residing in poor or immigrant neighborhoods were less
likely to be tested; but the likelihood that a test was positive was larger in those neighborhoods,
as well as in neighborhoods with larger households or predominantly black populations. The rate
of infection in the population depends on both the frequency of tests and on the fraction of
positive tests among those tested. The non-randomness in testing across New York City
neighborhoods indicates that the observed correlation between the rate of infection and the
socioeconomic characteristics of a community tells an incomplete story of how the pandemic
evolved in a congested urban setting.

1. Introduction

        The apparent difficulty in managing the COVID-19 pandemic raises a multitude of

research questions that need to be answered in order to minimize both the human suffering and

the economic costs. Why did hot spots arise in some cities or countries, but not in others? Is the

pandemic disproportionately affecting particular demographic or socioeconomic groups? Can the

destructive path of the pandemic be effectively controlled by a more careful targeting of the

scarce testing resources? What is the net cost of the restrictions on geographic mobility, work

arrangements, and social gatherings that are now common in countries affected by the pandemic?

Addressing all of these questions, however, requires the availability of detailed data that would

allow a researcher to search for systematic empirical patterns that might suggest an effective path

towards a reduction in future costs. 1

        The New York metropolitan area is currently a hot spot of the COVID-19 pandemic in

the United States. The first COVID-19 test in the city was conducted on January 29, 2020, with

the first positive result not confirmed until February 23, 2020. Nevertheless, by April 6, 2020,

New York City had already identified 68,776 persons infected with the virus, and 2,738 persons

had succumbed to the infection.

        1 Economists have already begun to analyze many of the questions raised by the pandemic; see, for
example, Baker et al (2020), Bergen, Herkenhoff, and Mongey (2020), Harris (2020, and Lang, Wang, and Yang
(2020).

        Beginning on March 30, 2020, the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene

began to release detailed information on the number of tests administered and the number of

positive results for persons residing in each of 177 zip codes, which I will roughly interpret as

urban “neighborhoods.” 2 Note, however, that the average population in a zip code in New York

City is around 46,000 persons (so that the typical New York neighborhood actually has the

population of a small city). This paper exploits the data to identify the demographic

characteristics that correlate with the very different patterns in COVID-19 testing and infections

across neighborhoods.

        Specifically, I merged the neighborhood-level counts of tests administered and positive

results with data from both the 2010 decennial census and the 2010-2014 American Community

Surveys (ACS). The merging allows me to paint a detailed picture of the neighborhoods where

COVID-19 testing was more prevalent and where the number of positive cases was relatively

high.

        The evidence suggests that a small number of neighborhood characteristics help explain a

relatively large fraction of the variance (over 70 percent) in positive test results (conditional on

being tested) across New York City neighborhoods. In particular, the conditional probability of a

positive test result is far greater for persons living in poor neighborhoods, in neighborhoods

where large numbers of people reside together, and in neighborhoods with a large black or

immigrant population. At the same time, however, persons residing in poor or immigrant

neighborhoods were less likely to be tested.

        Much of the discussion over the spread and impact of the COVID-19 epidemic focuses

on the evolution of a single statistic: the number of infections per 100,000 persons in the


        2 The data file, however, does not report the number of fatalities resulting from the pandemic.
                                                    4


population. The analysis of the New York City data starkly illustrates the problem with focusing

on this single number. The rate of infection in the population depends on two distinct factors: the

frequency of tests in a particular area and the fraction of positive tests among those tested.

        Because the incidence of COVID-19 testing was not random across New York City

neighborhoods, it is crucial to examine how socioeconomic characteristics correlate with each of

the two determinants of the rate of infection. It turns out that some characteristics—for instance,

household income—are correlated in opposite directions with the incidence of testing and with

the likelihood that a test leads to a positive result. In the end, we might find little correlation

between household income and infection rates, but this “zero correlation” masks the fact that

household income is related to both the rate of testing and the likelihood that a test yields a

positive result. Persons residing in poorer neighborhoods were less likely to be tested, but once

the test was administered, were more likely to be afflicted with the virus. In short, the finding

that the rate of infection in the population is uncorrelated with a particular socioeconomic

characteristic may not provide the information that is required to understand the evolution of the

pandemic.



2. Data

        The key data file analyzed in this paper reports the cumulative number of COVID-19

tests administered as well as the cumulative number of positive results for each zip code in the

City of New York. 3 These data were first released on March 30, 2020 by the NYC Department

of Health and Mental Hygiene (and have been updated since). Unless otherwise noted, the

analysis in this paper uses the cumulative counts as of April 5, 2020. The data consist of 177


        3 The New York City zip codes are numbered from 10001 to 11697.
                                                 5


identifiable zip codes, with some persons being allocated to a “non-identifiable” category that is

excluded from the empirical exercise that follows.

       It is important to emphasize that the zip code in the publicly available data refers to the

zip code of residence for the person who received the test. For expositional convenience, I will

use the terms “zip code” and “neighborhood” interchangeably.

       Figure 1, prepared by the New York City Department of Health, shows the geographic

spread in infection across neighborhoods. Even a superficial look at the map suggests that many

neighborhoods in Manhattan have had relatively few COVID-19 cases, while some

neighborhoods in the Bronx, Brooklyn, or Queens have seen a very high case load. Some of the

initial media reports of these data provide a detailed discussion of the pandemic in specific

neighborhoods (Honan, 2020; Buchanan et al, 2020; and Marsh 2020).

       The first two rows of Table 1 summarize key characteristics of the data. The cumulative

number of persons who had been tested for COVID-19 infection in the average zip code prior to

April 5, 2020 was 598.2, but there was a very large variation across neighborhoods in the

incidence of testing. Around 219 persons had been tested in the neighborhood at the 10th

percentile, and almost 5 times as many (1013) had been tested in the neighborhood at the 90th

percentile. The table also shows a similarly large geographic dispersion in the number of persons

who tested positive for the virus, from 101 persons in the neighborhood at the 10th percentile to

624 persons in the neighborhood at the 90th percentile.

        I merged the data released by the NYC Department of Health with information from

other sources, specifically the 2010 decennial census and the 2010-2014 American Community

Surveys (ACS). This merging allows me to obtain a relatively simple description of the

demographic and socioeconomic characteristics for each of the 177 neighborhoods.
                                                      6


       The demographic data from the 2010 decennial census at the zip code level is publicly

available in the data archives maintained by the Census Bureau. 4 The characteristics that I

downloaded from the decennial census are: the population of the neighborhood, the fraction of

the population that is male, the fraction of the population that is over age 60, the fraction of the

population that is minority (i.e. Hispanic, non-Hispanic black, or non-Hispanic Asian), and the

number of persons in the average household. Table 1 shows that all of these demographic

characteristics vary substantially across NYC neighborhoods. For instance, the mean household

size is 2.6 persons, but the range between the 10th and 90th percentile neighborhood goes from

1.7 to 3.2 persons. Similarly, the range for the fraction of the neighborhood’s population that is

black goes from 1.3 to 52.1 percent, with a mean of 16.1 percent.

       I use the neighborhood’s population to normalize the data on COVID-19 testing and

infections. Specifically, Table 1 also reports both the number of tests and the number of

infections per 100,000 persons. In the 10th percentile neighborhood, the incidence of testing was

902.9 persons, while the incidence was twice as large, or 1840.6, in the 90th percentile

neighborhood. These large geographic differences in the incidence of testing will play a role in

the analysis that follows.

       The table also reports the rate of infection per 100,000 persons, calculated simply as the

number of persons infected with COVID-19 divided by population (times 100,000). This number

also differs substantially across neighborhoods, from 442.2 in the 10th percentile neighborhood to

1107.4 in the 90th percentile neighborhood.




       4 The data are available at census.data.gov.
                                                     7


       Finally, the table reports the percent of tests that confirmed an infection. The fraction of

tests that had positive results was 54.0 percent in the average neighborhood, but it ranged from

39.4 in the 10th percentile neighborhood to 64.3 percent in the 90th percentile neighborhood.

       Unfortunately, the zip code-level data available from the decennial census does not

contain information on the income level of the neighborhood or on other socioeconomic

variables that might be relevant in understanding the spread of the pandemic. I used data from

the merged 2010-2014 ACS to obtain this type of additional information. In particular, I used the

ACS to calculate the mean household income of the neighborhood and the fraction of the

neighborhood’s population that is foreign-born. 5

       Table 1 also reports the summary statistics for these two additional variables. As with the

data drawn from the decennial census, there is a great deal of dispersion across neighborhoods in

these characteristics. For example, the range for mean household income goes from $46,800 in

the 10th percentile to $164,000 in the 90th percentile, and the range for the fraction of the

neighborhood’s population that is foreign-born goes from 19.3 to 52.5 percent.

       Let Vi be the number of persons in neighborhood i who tested positive for COVID-19,

and let Pi be the population of the neighborhood. The fraction of persons in a neighborhood who

tested positive (which can be easily translated into the number of persons infected with the virus

per 100,000 people) can be written as:



                                           𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖    𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖  𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖
                                                = � � × � �,                                     (1)
                                           𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖    𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖  𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖




       5 These data are downloadable from the usa.com website; http://www.usa.com/rank/.

where Ti gives the number of residents in the neighborhood who have been tested.

        Equation (1) shows that the infection rate in the population (Vi/Pi) depends on two

distinct ratios: (1) the rate at which persons were tested; and (2) the rate at which those who were

tested, in fact, tested positive for the virus. Testing in the United States was very sporadic in the

early stages of the pandemic. Even in a city as large as New York City, fewer than 1,000 persons

had been tested by March 10, 2020, and only 110,606 persons (out of a population of 8.6

million) had been tested by April 5, 2020. 6

        Equation (1) also shows that the infection rate in the population depends on the fraction

of tests that turn out to be positive. This variable, too, is likely to be correlated with specific

socioeconomic characteristics (for example, there may be more infections among people living

in neighborhoods where large families cluster together).

        It is unclear at the outset whether a given socioeconomic variable x should be similarly

correlated (even in sign) with each of the two ratios in the right-hand-side of equation (1). As a

result, the correlation between the population infection rate (Vi/Pi) and x may confound the two

very different roles that x might be playing in the pandemic.

        Let me conclude with an important caveat. The demographic and socioeconomic

characteristics chosen to describe the neighborhood were selected not only because they tend to

be the usual suspects used in many studies in the social science literature, but also because it is

unlikely that they affected the evolution of test frequency and testing results during the month of

March 2020.




        6 The cumulative number of tests for March 10 was reported in the testing.csv file prepared by the NYC
Department of Health and available at https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data. The file was downloaded on
April 2, 2020, but had disappeared from the website by April 5.

         It is not difficult to find neighborhood characteristics that likely affected the allocation of

testing resources as the pandemic took hold in the city. By the middle of March 2020, for

instance, it became well known that the large Hassidic community in Brooklyn was particularly

hard hit by the virus (Stack and Schweber, 2020; Sales, 2020). The Hassidic population in New

York City is concentrated in a small number of neighborhoods (Gallagher, 2009). 7 After learning

of this specific problem, NYC health officials might have responded to the outbreak by

reallocating resources to increase the incidence of testing in the affected neighborhoods. Such a

behavioral response would lead to an increased number of tests in Hassidic neighborhoods, with

a likelihood that many of those tests were positive.

         A positive correlation between, say, the fraction of a neighborhood’s population that is

Hassidic and the fraction of positive COVID-19 tests would then measure a response to an actual

outbreak rather than a pre-existing “predisposition.” The socioeconomic variables chosen for the

analysis and summarized in Table 1 were, in part, chosen because they tend to avoid this

endogeneity problem. 8



3. Descriptive evidence

         Before proceeding to the regression analysis, it is instructive to illustrate graphically the

simple correlation between some of the neighborhood characteristics and both the incidence of

testing and the likelihood of a positive test result. Figure 2, for example, presents scatter

diagrams that show how differences in the mean household income of the neighborhood’s


         7 The main zip codes are 11211, 11218, 11219, 11204, and 11230, which include the Williamsburg and
Borough Park sections of Brooklyn.
         8 One potential exception is the variable that gives the fraction of the population that is over age 60. As the
pandemic progressed, it became apparent that the elderly were severely affected by the illness and testing resources
may have been reallocated to neighborhoods that had a disproportionately large number of older persons.
                                                          10


population relate to: (a) the incidence of testing per 100,000 persons (Vi/Pi × 100,000); (b) the

percent of tests that confirm an infection (Vi/Ti × 100); and (c) the number of infections per

100,000 persons (Vi/Pi × 100,000).

         Panel A of the figure shows the relationship between the incidence of testing and mean

household income (in logs). It is obvious that there is one outlying zip code where residents were

far more likely to be tested. The neighborhood with the largest (normalized) number of tests,

with about 4,400 tests per 100,000 persons, has zip code 10018. This zip code roughly

encompasses the west side of midtown Manhattan between 34th and 42nd streets, from 5th Avenue

to the Hudson River. 9

         The graph suggests a positive relation between the incidence of testing and household

income in the neighborhood. In other words, persons residing in wealthier neighborhoods were

more likely to be tested than persons residing in poorer neighborhoods.

         The middle panel of Figure 2 shows the relation between the probability that a test yields

a positive result and mean household income. It is obvious that this probability is far higher in

poorer neighborhoods. The figure suggests that the fraction of tests that reveal an existing

infection is around 60 percent in neighborhoods at the 10th percentile of the income distribution

(where the log of household income is 10.8), but the statistic falls to about 45 percent in

neighborhoods that are in the 90th percentile (where the log of household income is 12.0).




         9 It is difficult to understand why the incidence of testing was so high in the west midtown area. There are
no media reports suggesting the existence of a notable COVID-19 outbreak in this neighborhood. The second
highest incidence of testing, with 2,537 tests per 100,000 persons, has zip code 11370, and it encompasses the
Elmhurst area of Queens. That area, however, became notorious in mid-March because of the large number of virus-
related admissions and fatalities at the Elmhurst Hospital Center (Rothfeld et al, 2020; Russell, 2020). It seems
plausible that health officials might have responded to the crisis by increasing testing in that neighborhood in the last
half of March, “artificially” inflating the testing incidence.
                                                   11


        The bottom panel of the figure shows the net impact of these two conflicting correlations

by linking the incidence of COVID-19 infection in the population and household income.

Although the resulting correlation is negative, it is visually evident that it is relatively weak

simply because persons residing in poorer neighborhoods were less likely to be tested and hence

have a smaller chance of showing up in the infection counts.

        Figure 3 provides an analogous summary of the correlation between the average

household size in the neighborhood and the various outcomes. Panel A reveals that the incidence

of testing was essentially independent of average family size. This allocation of testing resources

might seem questionable given the very strong positive correlation between household size and

the likelihood that a test yields a positive result illustrated in Panel B of the figure. In

neighborhoods where small households are prevalent, fewer than 50 percent of the tests came

back positive. In neighborhoods with larger households, over 60 percent of the tests came back

positive.

        The combination of these two effects attenuates the relationship illustrated in Panel C of

the figure. There is a weaker positive correlation between the incidence of infection in the

population and household size simply because testing was not particularly common in the

neighborhoods where large families cluster.

        Panel A of Figure 4 shows the relationship between the incidence of testing and the

minority composition of the neighborhood, defined as the fraction of the neighborhood’s

population that is either Hispanic, non-Hispanic black, or non-Hispanic Asian. The graph

suggests a negative relation between the incidence of testing and the percent of the

neighborhood’s population that is minority. In other words, persons residing in predominantly
                                                         12


minority neighborhoods were less likely to be tested than persons residing in mainly white

neighborhoods. 10

         The middle panel of Figure 4 shows the relation between the probability that a test yields

a positive result and the minority composition of the neighborhood. It is obvious that this

probability is far higher in minority neighborhoods. The figure suggests that the fraction of tests

that reveal an existing infection is around 45 percent in neighborhoods where 20 percent of the

population is minority and increases to nearly 60 percent in neighborhoods that are over 60

percent minority.

         The bottom panel of the figure shows the net impact of these two conflicting correlations

by linking the incidence of COVID-19 infection in the population (per 100,000 persons) and the

percent minority variable. Although the resulting correlation is positive, it is relatively weak

simply because persons residing in minority neighborhoods were less likely to be tested and

hence have a smaller chance of showing up in the infection counts.

         Finally, Figure 5 illustrates the relationship between the outcome variables and the

percent of the neighborhood’s population that is foreign-born. The top panel of the figure reveals

that persons residing in immigrant neighborhoods were less likely to be tested. The middle panel,

however, shows a strong positive relation between the probability that a test is positive and

percent immigrant. The combination of these two correlations summarized in Panel C leads to a

weaker positive relation between the “immigrant-ness” of a neighborhood and the incidence of

COVID-19.




         10 One important caveat: The regression analysis presented below conducts a more detailed examination of
this correlation and shows that the negative correlation between the incidence of testing and the racial composition
of the neighborhood is driven by Asian neighborhoods.
                                                        13


        As this graphical description of the data suggest, it is crucial to examine the distinct

channels through which any socioeconomic or demographic variable can affect the incidence of

testing and the likelihood that any given test yields a positive result. At least in the early stage of

the pandemic in New York City, testing resources were not randomly allocated across

neighborhoods, contaminating the correlation between any socioeconomic characteristic and the

(observed) population incidence of COVID-19 infection. The next section will estimate

regression models that confirm many of the implications of these scatter diagrams even after

controlling for the role played by other neighborhood characteristics.



4. Regression Results

        Table 2 reports the main regressions that relate each of the three key outcome variables to

the set of socioeconomic characteristics introduced earlier. The regressions are estimated using a

grouped logit estimator. For expositional convenience, Table 2 reports the marginal effect of

each of the regressors, where the marginal effect is defined as the percentage change in the

number of “successes” in the dependent variable. 11

        The regressions confirm the insight emphasized in the previous section—that focusing

solely on the incidence of COVID-19 in the population masks a lot of what is actually going on

in New York City. Consider, for example, the impact of mean household income (introduced in

logs in the regressions). The last column of the table shows that although the relative number of

infections in the population is positively related to household income, after holding constant

other neighborhood characteristics, the coefficient is not very significant. This finding would




          11 Specifically, the regressions are estimated using the glogit command in STATA, and the marginal
effects are estimated using the eydx option.
                                                          14


lead to the inference that COVID-19 infections affected poor and wealthy NYC neighborhoods

in roughly the same way.

         However, the regression reported in the first column of the table documents that persons

residing in wealthy neighborhoods were tested at much higher rates than persons residing in poor

neighborhoods. The 90-10 gap in log household income is about 1.2 log points. This implies that

the number of tests administered to persons residing in the wealthier neighborhoods was about

21.6 percent greater than the number of tests administered to persons residing in the poorer

neighborhoods (for a given population size).

         At the same time, however, the persons who were tested and who resided in the wealthy

neighborhoods were less likely to test positive for the virus. 12 The number of positive test results

declines by about 5.5 percent when comparing the 90th percentile neighborhood with the 10th

percentile neighborhood (for a given number of tests administered). In short, the analysis of the

distinct effects of household wealth on the incidence of testing and on the conditional probability

of testing positive (holding constant other neighborhood characteristics) provides a different

picture than the one implied by the weaker positive correlation between household income and

the incidence of COVID-19 infections in the population.

         It is important to note that the correlation between household income and the various

outcome variables reported in Table 2 can be interpreted in different ways, and that the currently

available data do not allow us to distinguish among alternative explanations. For instance, the

regressions indicate that residents from wealthier NYC neighborhoods were tested relatively

more often than their counterparts from poorer neighborhoods. But why did this difference arise?



         12 It is worth noting that the R-squared of the grouped logit regression on the conditional probability of a
positive test result is quite high, exceeding 0.7. A small number of neighborhood characteristics do a remarkably
good job of explaining the geographic dispersion in this probability.

         It is possible that the scarce testing resources were disproportionately allocated to

wealthier neighborhoods. But it is also possible that persons residing in the wealthier

neighborhoods might have had better information networks or could more easily afford to obtain

tests elsewhere in the city. It would be important to resolve this puzzle, but the publicly available

data released by the NYC Department of Health reports only the zip code of residence for the

persons tested and does not report the zip code where the test was administered.

         The regression in Table 2 shows that household size is an important determinant of the

various outcome variables, and in this case the effects on the two components of the infection

rate work in the same direction, so that the correlation between the incidence of infection in the

population and household size is very strong. In particular, persons residing in neighborhoods

where large families were cluster were far more likely to be tested. Similarly, given that a test

was administered, infections were much more likely to be detected in those neighborhoods. This

is not surprising, of course, as the grouping together of a larger number of people raises the risk

of exposure to COVID-19. The fact that the two effects work in the same direction leads to a

very strong correlation between household size and the incidence of infections in the population:

One additional person in the household increases the number of infections by about 46.4

percent. 13

         Table 2 also shows that predominantly male neighborhoods were more likely to be

affected by COVID-19 infections. This finding, however, is solely by the fact that those

neighborhoods were tested more intensively. The relative number of positive cases among

persons who were tested is independent of the gender composition of the neighborhood’s



         13 Although this may seem implausibly large, it is consistent with the raw data illustrated in Panel C of
Figure 3. The figure suggests that an increase in household size from 1.5 to 2.5 increases the number of infections
per 100,000 persons from about 500 to about 750, a 50 percent increase.
                                                  16


population. There is a similar pattern in the correlation between infections and the percent of the

neighborhood’s population that is over age 60. Persons residing in these neighborhoods were

also far more likely to be tested, but the outcome of the test was independent of the age

composition of the neighborhood.

       The regressions examine the link between minority neighborhoods and COVID-19

infections in more detail than the graphical analysis presented in the previous section. In

particular, the regression introduces a vector of variables measuring the percent of the

neighborhood’s population that belongs to each of the three main ethnic/racial groups. The

analysis reveals striking differences across the groups.

       Persons residing in neighborhoods with a predominantly black or, to a lesser extent,

Hispanic population were more likely to be tested. In the case of black neighborhoods, these tests

were also more likely to result in the detection of an infection. As a result, there is a strong

positive correlation between the incidence of COVID-19 infections and the percent black (and, to

a lesser extent, percent Hispanic) variables.

       The regression also shows, however, that the sign of these correlations is reversed for

Asian neighborhoods. Persons residing in those neighborhoods were less likely to be tested.

Once tested, the tests were less likely to come back positive. As a result, the incidence of

COVID-19 infections among persons residing in predominantly Asian neighborhoods was far

lower than for persons residing in other types of neighborhoods.

       Given the geographic origin of the COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan, China, the results

regarding the incidence of testing and frequency of positive test results in Asian neighborhoods

are unexpected. Note, however, that 60 percent of Asian immigrants in the city were not born in

China. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to uncover why the spread of the virus in
                                                 17


neighborhoods with a large Asian population behaved in different ways than the spread in black

or Hispanic (or white) neighborhoods.

         Finally, New York City has long been an urban area that attracts very large numbers of

immigrants. The regression reported in the last column of Table 2 indicates that the “immigrant-

ness” of the neighborhood’s population is uncorrelated with the incidence of an infection in the

population (holding the other neighborhood characteristics constant). In other words, the number

of infections per 100,000 persons was essentially the same for persons living in immigrant or in

“native” neighborhoods. However, this result arises because persons in immigrant neighborhoods

were less likely to be tested, and far more likely to test positive once the test was administered.

The evidence regarding the correlation between immigrant neighborhoods and CUVID-19

infections in New York City, therefore, again reveals how the nonrandom allocation of testing

resources in the city affects the perception of which groups are disproportionately affected by the

virus.

         I should note that the regression analysis summarized in Table 2 only examines the role

of a small number of variables that hope to capture key aspects of how the COVID-19 pandemic

affected the various neighborhoods of New York City. By focusing on a small number of

regressors, the analysis avoids the problem of multicollinearity that a kitchen-sink approach

would introduce, particularly given the limited nature of the sample (a single cross-section of

outcomes summarizing the cumulative impact of the pandemic on NYC as of April 5, 2020) and

the relatively small number of observations.

         Nevertheless, the regressions ignored the obvious fact that the various neighborhoods are

located in one of the five distinct boroughs that make up the City of New York (Manhattan, the

Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island). Figure 1 suggests that there may be noticeable
                                                         18


differences across the five boroughs in the incidence of COVID-19 infections per 100,000

persons (which, of course, partly reflect the different kinds of neighborhoods that compose the

various boroughs).

         Table 3 re-estimated the regressions after adding a set of borough fixed effects. The

results tend to resemble those reported in Table 2, although many of the coefficients are not

statistically significant. For example, the correlation between household income and the various

outcome variables is weaker once the regression controls for borough of residence. This is not

surprising, as it is well known that Manhattan has a far higher level of household income than the

other boroughs, so that the Manhattan fixed effect attenuates the impact of household income on

the incidence of testing and on the likelihood of positive test results. 14 Nevertheless, the

regressions in Table 3 suggest that—even within boroughs—the population in the neighborhoods

that were predominantly black or Hispanic, or had larger households, or had a large immigrant

population, are more likely to test positive once tested. Similarly, the population in the

neighborhoods where large households cluster or are predominantly male—even within a

borough—are still more likely to be tested. 15



6. Summary

         This paper documents the characteristics of New York City neighborhoods that were

most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. It uses data compiled by the New York City



         14 Manhattan’s average household income is $125,900, as compared to between $48,700 and $90,300 for
the other four boroughs.
         15 The coefficients of the borough fixed effects in Table 3 suggest the presence of borough-wide impacts
that would be interesting to pursue in further research, as they may provide insight into the evolution of the
pandemic. For example, persons residing in Brooklyn had a relatively lower incidence of testing than persons from
other boroughs, while persons residing in the Bronx had a relatively higher incidence. In addition, the likelihood a
test yielded a positive result was far higher in Brooklyn and Queens than in the other boroughs.

Department of Health and Mental Hygiene that reports the number of COVID-19 tests

administered and the number of persons infected at the level of a zip code. I merged these

administrative counts with data from the 2010 decennial census and the 2010-2014 American

Community Surveys to describe the neighborhoods where COVID-19 testing was relatively

more common and where the number of positive test results was relatively high.

       The probability of a positive test result (conditional on testing) is larger in poorer

neighborhoods, in neighborhoods where large numbers of people reside together, and in

neighborhoods with a large black or immigrant population. At the same time, however, persons

residing in poorer or immigrant neighborhoods were less likely to be tested.

       The rate of infection in a given population (i.e., the number of infected persons divided

by the size of the population) depends on two separate factors: the frequency of tests and the

fraction of positive tests among those tested. The New York City experience suggests that the net

correlation between socioeconomic characteristics and the rate of infection sometimes captures

the net impact of perhaps two conflicting forces. As a result, an understanding of which types of

neighborhoods are disproportionately affected by the pandemic requires an examination of how

socioeconomic characteristics correlate with each of the two determinants of the rate of infection

in the population.

Notes: Standard errors in parentheses. All regressions have 177 observations and are estimated using the command
glogit in STATA. This procedure estimates grouped logit regression models using weighted least squares. The
coefficients report the marginal effect of the independent variable in percentage terms, specifically giving the
percent change in the number of “successful” cases (i.e., the numerator of the dependent variable) resulting from a
one-unit change in the independent variable.
