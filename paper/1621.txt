      This paper formulates a model of the youth labor market and applies

that model to analyze the effects of policies which are aimed at improving

the labor market status of youths., and in particular their employment rate

and the quality of jobs that they hold.1 At the heart of the model is a

minimum wage restriction which has the effect both of causing some youths

to become unemployed and of preventing other youths from entering jobs in

which they could acquire training which would be useful in their adult

years.2 There are! in turn, repercus ons in the adult labor market, since

the mix of youth employment among skilled and unskilled Jobs affects the

demand for adult skilled and unskilled workers through the usual factor

substitutability channels. In order to evaluate fully any policy aimed at

conditions in the youth labor market, it is necessary to trace through the

effects that the policy will eventually have on the steady state conditions

in both the youth and the adult labor markets. This paper considers three

representative policies: a youth subminimurn wage, subsidies paid to firms

that hire youths, and training subsidies that offset the costs of on—the—

job training. The purpose is to improve our understanding of how

employment and training are determined and how they are influenced by

policy.

    The model developed here incorporates a number of features which are

important for any analysis of the youth labor market, yet which have not

previously been combined in a single model. First, labor is assumed to be

heterogeneous in that different workers are not equally productive in a

given skilled job.4 Second, in contrast to some wage models where "good

Jobs' offer the minimum wage and "bad jobs" offer less than the minimum, in

this model "good jobs" provide training opportunities and frequently pay
more than the minimum wage to youths, while 'bad jobs pay only the minimum

and provide few training opportunities. Finally, individuals are presumed

to be less productive as youths than they will ultimately be as adults

simply because of their age (immaturity).5   A model incorporating these

features can be used to analyze how particular employment and training

outcomes are affected by labor market policies.

     The organization of the paper is as follows. Section II develops a

model in which the on—the—job training can be either specific or general,

and which includes the features described above. Section III examines the

models properties and derives the effects o+ alternative policies.

Section IV considers some of the welfare implications of the results in

terms of ascertaining which groups are better off and which groups are

worse off as a result of alternative policy changes.   A final section

briefly addresses some remaining issues pertaining to the model.


                  II.   A Model of the Youth Labor Market

     This section develops a model of youth labor market experience. The

model incorporates two broad economic sectors, which may be called the

primary" and "secondary' sectors, and it considers workers at two stages

in their working lives, namely youth and adulthood (for a related analysis,

see Dickens and Lang, 1983). The two sectors contain what we have called

'good jobs1 and "bad jobs," respectively. The secondary sector is a sector

where skill and training do not have a very great effect on productivity.

It may be convenient to visualize this sector as being comprised of fast—

food outlets, grocery stores, car washes, and similar establishments.      In

the primary sector, on the other hand, an individual's productivity does

depend on his ability and training. Training must be acquired on the job

by going through an initial period of lower productivity, while ability is
 considered to be an inherent characteristic of the individual. This

 implies that some people will be more productive than others in this

 sector, even if they have the same amount of training,

      Youths may work in either sector, but their productivity will be lower

than the productivity of comparable adult workers. The lower productivity

exposes them to the possibility that ct   all   of them have sufficient

productivity to earn the minimum wage, with the result that there may be

substantial unemployment among youth. Following Feldstein (1973), in the

primary sector this problem of insufficient productivity to Justify the

minimum wage is aggravated by the fact that any training required for work

in this sector reduces productivity even further, and that this training,

to the extent it is general training, must be fully financed by the

individual at the time of the training. The lower productivity among

youths, combined with training requirements for the primary sector, leads

to a sorting equilibrium in which individuals follow one of three paths

during their working lives, depending on their individual—specific level of

innate ability. The most able individuals will find employment in the

primary sector even as youths because the productivity resulting from their

natural ability justifies a wage above the minimum, despite their relative

immaturity and the fact that they must be trained.    4 second group with

intermediate natural ability levels will not be able to find employment in

the primary sector as youths, but will be able to find such work as adults.

During their youth, these workers as a group will have spotty employment

records in the secondary sector, since they have no real advantage over

anyone else seeking work in that sector. The third group, with the lowest

levels of natural ability, will also find spotty work in the secondary

sector as youths, and as adult workers they will find steadier employment
in this   sector as they become more mature and their productivity increases.

     To begin a more formal description of the model, let T1 be the number

of years that each individual spends as a youth at the beginning of his

labor force participation and T2 be the number of years he spends as an

adult in his prime—age working years. The age distribution of individuals

in the labor force is presumed to be uniform, so that the number of youths

and adults in the labor force can be written as pT1 and pT2,

respectively, for some constant of proportionality p.       Labor is assumed

to be supplied inelastically, which means that the school—work decisions of

youths are not examined in this model.6

     The technology of the model is described in Table 1.     The technology

represented in this table is assumed to be linear, meaning constant returns

to labor of a given productivity. The underlying physical productivity of

adult labor in the two sectors is denoted as Y      +    and Y

respectively, where       and       are exogenous to the analy:is.7          is a

time—invariant individual effect associated with each individual's

abilities, and it affects productivity in the primary but not the secondary

sector (this is to say that all individuals can make hamburgers equally

well but that some individuals are better than others at doing electrical

work, even after training)      The productivity of youth labor is given by

the fractions       and      of the adult productivity, with the fractions

reflecting what may be called the immaturity factor.     In general,

would be expected to be less than          reflecting the fact that in the

primary sector mistakes can be costlier than in the secondary sector.

Finally, anyone working in the primary sector must undergo training for

years, during which period productivity is reduced by C.         The assumption

of fixed training costs enables the model to focus more sharply on the

effects of potential policy changes on the employment and welfare of youths


                                       4
 and adults in the two sectors; for a model focusing more on the

 determination of the amount of training, see Hashimoto (1982).

        The output of the primary sector is taken as the numeraire, and the

 relative price of the output of the secondary sector is given by P.                          The

value of the minimum wage is measured in terms of the numeriare, that is,

the minimum wage is taken as given in terms of primary sector output. The

model presumes that workers in each sector are paid the value of their

productivity. For youths in the secondary sector, who are assumed to be

constrained by the minimum wage, the following relationship must hold:



                                      ss +3 w
(1)                                                   =   W
                                                              m


where W        is the minimum wage.    S           (which is also measured in terms of
           m                               w

primary sector output)      is the value of any wage subsidy that the

government pays to firms which employ youths; in the case of any subsidies

provided by the government in the model, the government is presumed to be

able to raise sufficient revenues by means of lump sum taxation, This

equation says that the value of the youth's production in the secondary

sector plus the amount of the wage subsidy must be equal to the minimum

wage.

        For youths in the primary sector, it is necessary first to identify

the productivity of the marginal youth in this sector. Suppose that the

fraction n1 of youths work in the primary sector. Let F(s) be the

cumulative distribution function of the random variable ,                     and denote its

inverse by 6(n).       Then since the top            n1 of the distribution of

will be employed in the primary sector, the value of                      associated   with

the last youth hired in this sector will be 6(1 —                         The total

rate, and St is the value of any subsidy provided by the government for

training in the primary sector, again measured in terms of primary sector

output. The four terms in this expression are the productivity of the

individual as a youth, the productivity as an adult, the training costs net

of any subsidies, and the wage subsidy.

     Marginal youths jn this sector will need as much of this lifetime

productivity as possible to be paid in the early years in order to satisfy

the minimum wage requirements. Firms will be willing to do so, even if it

means paying youths more than their marginal productivity, as long as the

firms can be reasonably assured that the youth will remain with the firm as

an adult, and as long as the total lifetime payments to the individual do

not exceed the individual 's lifetime productivity as calculated above.                                                 In

particular, the wages the firm pays the individual during his adult

years must at least match what the individual could get at another firm.

If the individual were to go to another firm at the beginning of his adult

years, he would have to undergo some fraction, say u, of his training

again. This fraction of the training may be regarded as specific, with the

remainder being regarded as general. Thus, the value of his productivity

at the second firm, discounted back to the beginning of his working life,

is given by'°


                      d{CY + 5(1         — n          )]K        — c*(C      —       S       ) }

If the first firm is to pay at least this much to the individual as an

adult, and if the individuals total discounted lifetime productivity is


                                                      6
given by the previous expression, then the maximum that the firm will be

willing to pay the individual as a youth is given by the difference between

the two expressions:

The per period wage rate which the firm can pay to a youth is then found by

dividing the above expression by K1                                         and it is this amount which must be

Just equal to the minimum wage for the marginal individual hired into the

primary sector as a youth:


(2)          v CY               +       6(1    — n        )] —       (1 —   d)(C   — S ) +         G       =
              pp                                     p1                               t                w

                                                                                                                    m


It can be seen in this expression that the firm is not willing to finance

general training, but it will finance up to the fraction d of the costs

of specific training, net of whatever subsidy is available to offset the

training costs.11 The fraction of specific training costs that the firm

will be willing to bear will evidently be higher the lower the real

discount rate.'2

      Specific training thus allows firms to offer an implicit contract

which permits some individuals to be hired as youths in the primary sector

even though their productivity net of training costs plus wage subsidies

falls below the minimum wage. Moreover, this implicit contract arises even

in the absence of cyclical fluctuations in demand, which provide the usual

explanation for the firm bearing the cost of specific training. Note that

the fact that the firm is willing to advance some of the costs of specific

but not general training to some individuals in their youth is of

importance in this model only because of the existence of the minimum wage,

and it is of greatest importance to those whose ability in the primary



                                                                        7
sector is marginal and whose wage net of training costs would otherwise

fall below the minimum. As would be expected, any turnover for reasons

that have not been incorporated in the model, such as differential tastes

for job characteristics or specialized talents that require trial and error

Job search and present a positive probability of quit, will reduce the

willingness of the firm to finance such training and will lead to solutions

that are closer to those obtained when training is general (Mincer, 1981).

      Note also that if inframarginal individuals receive the value of the

higher productivity attributed to their greater ability levels, most youths

who are employed in the primary sector will be receiving a wage above the

legal minimum. Thus if one were to observe only those youth who hold

minimum wage Jobs, only a small proportion would be found receiving
            1,
training.        This does not mean, however, that a training or wage subsidy

or youth subminimum wage program would have no effect on the number of

youths receiving on—the—job training. The effect of such programs would

depend on the increase in the hiring of youths For work in the primary

sector, a marginal effect the size of which should not be judged to be

equal to the fraction of minimum wage workers who receive training.14

      Among adult workers, the necessary requirement is that the marginal

worker hired in the primary sector as an adult must be indifferent between

working in the primary and secondary sectors.'5 To specify this

requirement, let n2 be the fraction of adults whD are working in the

primary sector. The indifference relationship for this marginal adult

hired in the primary sector can be stated as:'6

the value of s associated with this individual.

      In this model, all adult workers will be employed in any solution

which is characterized by youths working in the secondary sector. This is

because a youth working in the secondary sector is producing enough output

to earn the minimum wage, and all adult workers can produce at least this

much output in that sector. Hence, if there are youths employed in the

secondary sector, then it is possible for all adults to earn at least the

minimum wage, and all of them should be employed. The appropriate relation

to express this requirement is:


(4)                                    n2 +    n,,       1




where n2 is the fraction of adults working in the secondary sector.

Since a solution with no youths working in the secondary sector is not very

interesting, we will confine our attention in this paper to the case where

they do and where therefore equation (4) holds.

      The amounts produced of the two types of output, expressed as

functions of the labor inputs are found by multiplying the productivities

of youths and adults in the two sectors by the numbers of youths and adults

in the sectors, and adding the results. For the primary sector, this

yields the following equation for output:


            =                                   +              +           —

production of youths and the second term the production of   adults,   both

gross of training costs, and the final term subtracts out current training

costs. With regard to the last term, note that the fraction n2 of

           individuals spend the fraction T1/(T1+T2)] of their working

years in training, so that in a steady state the number of individuals in

training at any particular time is simply the product of these three

numbers.   In the secondary sector, the total output is calculated simply

as:



()                      q_ =       II

Here, the first term is the production attributable to youths and the
second term the production attributable to adults.

      In order to find out how much of the two goods are actually produced,

it is necessary to establish the demand for the two goods as a function of

their prices. The model uses a relatively simple demand function which

specifies the relative demand for the two goods as being dependent on their

relative price:


(7)                                          h(P)


with the first derivative of h being positive. This demand function

specifies that as the relative price of the output of the secondary sector

becomes less expensive, relatively more of it will be demanded. For any

given level of income and the price ratio, this function specifies the

ratio that is demanded, but not the absolute amounts of the two goods.

Since the model is a closed system, the aggregate budget constraint

guarantees that there will be just enough income generated in the

production of the two goods to buy the output, if the price ratio is

correct.


                                        10
       The seven equations numbered above constitute a complete model in

seven endogenous quantities: the relative price of output of the secondary

sector       (P) ,          the two output levels (q and q5)                         ,
                                                                                         and the four ratios

describing the fraction of the youth and adult cohorts working in the two

sectors       (n        ,
                             n        ,
                                          n        ,
                                                       and   n        ).   The essence of the model can be

described briefly as follows. All adults in the model are presumed to be

employed. Adults with high productivity in the primary sector are employed

in that sector, with most earning wages substantially in excess of the

minimum, while adults whose productivity would be low in the primary sector

are   instead        employed in the secondary sector at a wage only modestly in

excess of the minimum. Youths are employed in the primary sector only if

their potential productivity in that sector, net of whatever training costs

the firms are unwilling to finance, is above the minimum wage. The

remaining youths would all like to work in the secondary sector, but were

they to do so, their production would depress the price of output in that

sector so much that they would be unable to earn the minimum wage there.

Therefore, only enough of them can find jobs in that sector so that the

price of secondary sector output remains high enough to justify paying the

minimum wage to youths who are employed in that sector. The remainder of

the youths are unemployed.


                                  III. Policy Analysis with the Model.

      This    section will                be concerned with analyzing how employment in the

two sectors, particularly youth employment, behaves under alternative

policy changes. The model contains three parameters which are of interest

for potential policies to mitigate the effects of the minimum wage on the

youth labor market. The first such parameter is 9w' the potential wage

subsidy to firms that hire youths, and the second is S, the training


                                                                  11
subsidy for firms in the primary sector to defray the training expenses of

newly hired workers.18 The third parameter is We, the minimum wage

variable. Since in this model the minimum wage is not binding on adults., a

reduction in          W           may be interpreted either as the introduction of a youth

sub—minimum or as a reduction of the minimum for all workers. Further,

given the way S( and Wm enter into equations (1) and (2), which are the

only equations in which they appear, either an increase in the wage subsidy

or an equal reduction in the minimum wage would have the same employment

effects, since either would permit fires to hire youths. whose productivity

has less value. Hence, in this section we will not consider changes in

We, with the understanding that the employment and output changes arising

from changes in               S      can be interpreted as being the result of changes

either in the youth wage subsidy or in the minimum wage.

     The first three equations of the model determine youth and adult

employment in the primary sector and the relative price of secondary sector

output. The impact of either a training or a wage subsidy on these

quantities can be calculated as follows:


     dn IdS               =       1/(w   G) >            0            dn /dS t        (1—du)/(w 8')
                                                                                                 p1
                                                                                                        >   0
       p1         w                      p1                             p1



     dn2/dS
                          =

                                                                                      K1/(K2G)
                                                                                                  > 0
                                                                      dn2/dS

     dP/dS                =       — 1/(                      0        dP/dS       =   0
             p4                           55
                                           t )       >
                                                                              t

Both types of subsidy are seen to increase not only youth employment in the

primary sector, but also adult employment in that sector. With regard to

youth employment, both subsidies permit youths with lower ability levels to

earn wages above the minimum during their period of training. For adults,

the two subsidies encourage employment in the primary sector, but in



                                                                 12
 different ways. The training subsidy increases the wages that can be

offered to adults entering that sector, and for some adults whose ability

 levels put them at the margin between working in the primary or secondary

sector, the increased wages in the primary sector will shift them there.

The youth wage subsidy, on the other hand, causes the price of secondary

output to fall, and by making it less attractive for the marginal

adults to work in the secondary sector, the subsidy encourages a shift of

such individuals to the primary sector. Interestingly, since an increase

in the minimum wage would have the opposite effect of an increase in the

youth wage subsidy, these results indicate that in increase in the minimum

wage would cause adult employment in the primary sector to decline. The

reason is that an increase in the minimum wage would increase the price of

secondary sector output and make it more attractive for the adults on the

margin to work in that sector.

     The effects on the other variables in the model can also be readily

inferred from the remaining equations. Since both types of subsidy cause

both youth and adult employment in the primary sector to increase, they

also cause primary sector output to increase. The increase in primary

sector output, in combination with the fact that the relative price of

secondary output is not increased with either type of subsidy, implies

through the relative demand equation (7) that secondary sector output also

increases. Adult employment in this sector falls, reflecting the fact that

there is full employment among adults and that adult employment in the

primary sector has increased. Finally, the combination of increased output

in the secondary sector with the fact that adult employment in the sector

is lower implies that youth employment in that sector must rise as a result

of either type of subsidy.

     Although the general employment and output effects are the same for


                                    13
the two types of subsidies, the relative sizes of the effects among youths

and adults in the two sectors is not. A convenient way to examine this

issue is to consider a change in either type of subsidy of sufficient

magnitude to increase youth employment in the primary sector by one

individual, and to calculate the magnitude of the accompanying changes in

adult employment in that sector and in youth and adult employment in the

secondary sector. Since the answers will turn in part on whether the

training necessary for the primary sector work is general or specific, let

us first look at the case where training is general, that is, where u = 0.

       The number of additional adult workers in the primary sector which

would accompany each additional youth worker can be calculated as:


           dnp2/dSw   ——   'p6i                    dn2/dSt    —
                                                              —    Kip6i
           dn /dS w          6                     dn /dS t       K 6 (i—d)
             p1             s2                       p1           22

for the youth wage subsidy and the training subsidy. We assume that T1 <

12t which says that the length of time spent as a youth or in training is

shorter than the length of time spent as an adult. This in turn implies

   <        Then, since    i   <   1 and, in the case of general training, c = 0,

the above ratio for the wage subsidy will be larger.          That is, for each Job

that a youth wage subsidy or a training subsidy creates for youths in the

primary sector, the wage subsidy will create more jobs for adults in that

sector.

       With regard to employment in the secondary sector, the wage subsidy

will cause a greater decline in adult employment, per additional youth

employed in the primary sector, than will the training subsidy. This is

because the wage subsidy would cause a larger increase in adult employment

in the primary sector, and with full employment among adults, there must be

a correspondingly larger reduction in adult employment in the secondary


                                          14
sector. With regard to youths in the secondary sector, there are several

considerations in establishing the relative size of the effects of the two

types of subsidy. First, note that per additional youth job in the primary

sector, a wage subsidy will increase adult employment more in that sector,

and hence it will increase the output of the primary sector more. Second,

the relative price of secondary output will fall with a wage subsidy but

not with a training subsidy. Through the demand equation, both the higher

primary sector output and the lower relative price of secondary sector

output will favor an even greater increase in secondary sector output with

the wage subsidy. Finally, this greater increase in secondary sector

output with a wage subsidy is accompanied by a larger decline in adult

employment in this sector, and this tends to make the wage subsidy even

more potent, relative to the training subsidy, in creating youth employment

in the secondary sector. Thus, if training is general, a wage subsidy will

tend to favor employment increases most among youths in the secondary

sector and, to a lesser degree, among adults in the primary sector, while a

training subsidy will be more successful in concentrating employment

increases among youths in the primary sector.

     If training in the primary sector is highly specific, so that u                                   1,


the results may be much different. In this case, the magnitude of the

ratio (dn /dS )/(dn /dB )                   relative to       (dn /dB )/(dn /dS )          depends
          p2      w             p1      w                       p2    t          p1   t

on the value of       1/v            relative to   c /[ic (1—dc)). Substituting for

and 2' this last expression reduces to 1/(1 — e
                                                                     —pT2
                                                                            ).   If       >1—e
                                                                                                  —pT2


then it is possible that for every youth job created in the primary sector,

the youth wage subsidy may create fewer adult jobs in that sector than

would a training subsidy. Further, if the relative demand function                            h        is

fairly inelastic with respect to the relative price of output in the



                                                   15
secondary sector, it is in turn possible that for every youth job created

in the primary sector, the wage subsidy will create fewer youth jobs in the

secondary sector than will a training subsidy.      In other words, if training

is specific, it is possible that a youth wage subsidy (or, equivalently in

this model, a reduction in the minimum wage) will be more successful at

focusing increases in employment on youths in the primary sector than will

a training subsidy for jobs in the primary sector.

     Another way of looking at this result is that if training is specific

rather than general, firms may already be willing to finance a substantial

portion of the casts, net of any subsidy, of training a youth for work in

the primary sector. Under these circumstances, a subsidy to offset the

costs of training does not relax the constraints imposed by the minimum

wage very much, since the firms are willing to finance most of these costs

anyway. Hence, a training subsidy will be relatively less effective in

creating additional youth employment in the primary sector. On the other

hand, if the training is general, firms will be unwilling to finance it,

and it must be financed by the youths themselves.         In this case, a training

subsidy will provide mare relief from the constraints imposed by the

minimum wage, and such a subsidy will be relatively more successful in

creating jabs for youths in the primary sector. Thus, the relative merits

of youth wage subsidies (or reductions in the minimum wage) as against

training subsidies for encouraging higher employment of youths in the

primary sector may depend on whether training in that sector is

predominantly general or specific.


                        IV.   Welfare    Considerations

     In the previous section, the analysis considered the effects of

changes in the minimum wage and of youth wage subsidies and training



                                        16
subsidies on employment of youths and adults in the primary and secondary

sectors.   In general, one would expect that a policy which causes an

expansion of employment and/or a shift in employment from the secondary

sector to the primary sector will have positive welfare effects on the

individuals who because of the policy are able to find jobs in the primary

sector or who are no longer unemployed. However, in addition to welfare

effects generated by employment changes, there are welfare effects

associated with any change in relative prices which may occur as a result

of the policies. These additional welfare considerations have two

consequences. First, it is possible in some instances that an individual

who manages to find a Job in the primary sector because of a policy will

nonetheless find himself worse off as a result. Secondly, the large

majority of individuals whose employment status does not change because of

a policy may nevertheless find that their level of welfare is affected by

the policy.

     Table 2 summarizes the general welfare implications of changes in the

minimum wage and of youth wage subsidies and training subsidies for various

groups according •to their employment status in the presence of and in the

absence of the particular policy. The first two columns indicate the

sectors in which the individuals in the group would be employed as youths

and as adults without the policy, and the next two columns indicate the

sectors in which they would be employed with the policy. The final three

columns indicate whether the welfare of the group would improve,

deteriorate, stay the same, or would be indeterminate with the policy.

     In the table, the groups denoted by A, C, E, H, and 3 include all the

individuals whose employment patterns are not affected by the policies.

For these groups, any welfare change must be mediated either by a change in

relative prices or by a change in wages directly induced by a subsidy.


                                    17
Since the training subsidy does not entail any change in the relative price

of secondary sector output, such a subsidy affects the welfare of these

groups only to the extent that it pays for some of the training of primary

workers. Hence, groups 4, C, and H, whose members are trained at one time

or another for employment in the primary sector, gain, while groups E and

J, whose only employment is in the secondary sector, neither gain nor lose

under a training subsidy.   4 reduction in the minimum wage, on the other

hand, will lower the relative price of secondary sector output. This will

improve the welfare status of individuals in groups 4 and H, who work only

in the primary sector during their lifetimes. For group C, whose members

work in the secondary sector as youths and in the primary sector as adults,

the welfare effect of a reduction in the minimum wage will be ambiguous.

On balance, though, if their employment in the secondary sector is

relatively short as compared with the length of time they spend in the

primary sector, one would presume that these individuals would probably

show welfare gains. For individualsin groups E and J, whose only

employment is in the secondary sector, the decline in the relative price of

the output of that sector will mean that these groups are worse off with a

reduction in the minimum wage.   4 youth wage subsidy creates much the same

pattern of gainers and losers among these five groups as does a reduction

in the minimum wage, except for groups C and E.   For the individuals in

group C, the extra value of the subsidy is enough to make them definite

welfare gainers with a wage subsidy. The individuals in group E will also

gain as youths because of the subsidy, but since youth is short relative to

adulthood, one would presume is that on balance they lose because the value

of the secondary output they produce as adults declines. With regard to

either a reduction in the minimum wage or a youth wage subsidy, note in



                                     18
particular that individuals in groups E and 3, who are definite or probable

losers under either policy, are at the bottom of the ability scale and also

at the bottom of the wage scale as adults, so that the relative disparity

between high wage groups and low wage groups is likely to be accentuated

under either policy.

     The remaining groups include individuals whose employment patterns are

changed by the policies, so that either they would find a job in the

primary sector where otherwise they would not, or they would not be

unemployed whereas otherwise they would. With a training subsidy, all such

groups would be better off, since the gains due to the employment change

would never be offset by a deterioration in the relative price of secondary

sector output. A reduction in the minimum wage or a youth wage subsidy

will also make many of these groups better off, but again in these cases

the deterioration of the relative price of secondary sector output will

cause ambiguities in the welfare effect of the subsidy among groups which

spend part of their time in the secondary sector. For instance, consider

the individuals in group L, who are unemployed as youths at a high minimum

wage but who would be employed with a reduced minimum wage. These

individuals may find that the decline in the value of the wages that they

earn in the secondary sector as adults more than offsets the gains that

they realize as youths by being employed. All of the remaining ambiguous

cases among these groups arise in a similar fashion, with individuals who

are initially employed in the secondary sector as adults suffering losses

because the value of the goods they produce falls.


                        V.   Summary and Conclusions

     This paper has explored the effects of changes in the minimum wage, in

the level of youth wage subsidies, and in the level of training subsidies



                                     19
n a model characterized by a sorting equilibrium based on the ability

levels of individuals in the labor force. Three results in particular are

worth noting in a summary. First, an increase in the minimum wage may reduce

adult employment in the primary sector, even though such an increase would

reduce youth employment in this sector and even though the model assumes

perfect substitutability between youths and adults within industries (although

not at a one—to—one rate> and full employment of adults. Secondly, whether or

not a youth wage subsidy or a reduction in the minimum wage is more successful

than a training subsidy at creating primary sector jobs for youths depends

on whether or not training in the primary sector is specific or general.

If the training is specific, it is possible that a wage subsidy or a

reduction in the minimum wage can create a relatively larger fraction of

new youth jobs in this sector. This result may occur because firms are

already willing to finance a large fraction of the costs of specific

training, so that a training subsidy does little additional to relieve the

constraint imposed by a minimum wage. Finally, it should be kept in mind

that these subsidies may have large welfare effects on groups other than

the groups immediately affected by the subsidy. Most importantly, it

appears that a youth wage subsidy or a reduction in the minimum wage will

in general have an unfavorable impact on most adult secondary workers and a

positive impact on most adult primary sector workers.

     It should be kept in mind that in the interests of making relatively

clear the mechanisms generating the results, the model has been kept fairly

simple. There are a number of directions in which the model could be

extended, many of which are suggested by the existing literature. These

include: (a> the elimination of the sharp dichotomy between youth and

adulthood by introducing additional periods representing the transition

between these two phases in the life cycle, (b) the introduction of a skill


                                    20
factor, varying from individual to individual, in the secondary sector, (c)

the introduction of heterogeneity in the productivity losses due to the

immaturity of youths, (d) a role for general labor market experience, which

would require the specification of some mechanism for allocating

unemployment among youth, (e) a corresponding role for specific job

experience and its relation to internal labor markets via job ladders (See

Hall, 1981, and Carmichael, 1983b) , (4) a consideration of imperfect

information about the individual s productivity, his propensity to quit,

the characteristics or requirements of the job, and/or the course of future

demand, which may vary for cyclical or other reasons, all of which provide

alternative reasons for unemployment and turnover and which hence affect

the firms willingness to finance specific training (See Oi, 1983 and

Carmichael, 1983a) ,   (g) a consideration of potential variation in the

quantity of on—the—job training, and (h) the introduction of an elastic

supply of untrained vs. generally trained labor perhaps resulting from the

availability of vocational training in the schools. Although many of these

extensions should be addressed before any empirical implementation of the

model, it does not appear that they should change substantially the

principal conclusions mentioned above.

1.   For a thorough analysis of the course of employment and wages in the
     youth labor market in recent years, see Freeman and Wise (1983) and
     Freeman and Medoff (1983).

2.   A number of reasons other than the minimum wage have been given for
     the unsatisfactory performance of the youth labor market. These
     include the following (a) the casual labor market attachment of
     full—time students (Feldstein and Eliwoad, 1983), (b) imperfect or
     asymmetric information about individual abilities, efforts expended,
     preferences, and the characteristics and requirements of jobs (e.g.,
     see Leighton and Mincer, 1983), and (c) high relative reservation
     wages due to income maintenance programs (Venti, 1993).

3.   The policies we examine are general forms of the three major 'policies
     to reduce youth unemployment' cited in the 1983 Economic Report of the
     President, pp. 44—45. The policies described there are the Job
     Training and Partnership Act of 1982, the Minimum Wage Reform, and the
     Targeted Jobs Tax Credit. There is, however, a major difference
     between the policies we examine and those cited in the Economic
     Report. The policies examined in this paper are, for the most part,
     not narrowly targeted on special groups within the youth or adult
     populations.   (For a discussion of the implications of narrow targeting,
     see Johnson, 1982).

4.   For a discussion of the importance of assuming a heterogeneous
     population when analyzing labor market policy, see Nichols (1982).
     For studies of the impact of minimum wages which assume the population
     is heterogeneous in their abilities, see keckman and Sadlacek (1981)
     and Meyer and Wise (1983).

5.   For a sample of employer testimony to the effect that youths are less
     reliable and less productive than older workers for reasons other than
     inexperience, see Barton (1976).

6.   The relationship between minimum wages and the decision to continue in
     school is discussed by Mincer and Leighton (1981). For an empirical
     analysis of the impact of wage offers and youth unemployment on the
     jointly determined school choice and labor supply decisions, see
     Sustman and Steinmeier (1981). The effects of minimum wages on the
     employment, compensation, and schooling of youth depend on whether, in
     addition to basic schooling, there is general vocational training
     available in the schools. For a discussion, see Gustmart and
     Steinmeier (1982).

7.   Note that this assumes that adult productivity is unaffected by the
     uunemployment experience f the individual as a youth. Meyer and Wise
     (1982) find that holding individual specific characteristics constant,
     there is no lasting effect of nonemployment after leaving school on
     employment in subsequent years. They do find, however, that early
     nonemployment is associated with lower wage rates later in one's
     youth. Ellwood (1983) also finds that there are persistent negative
     effects of lost wages. Findings that wages are lower for those


                                    22
      unemployed as youths all the way into adulthood would have greatest
      impact on our results if these findings do not in fact represent the
      effects of unmeasured characteristics. To incorporate any effects of
      early unemployment on subsequent wages into our analysis, equations
      representing a mechanism for determining who among the young
      population experiences unemployemnt and how the duration of
      unemployment is distributed among youth would have to be added to the
      model. There is no general agreement on how to distribute
      unemployment in a minimum wage model. See, for example, Mincer (1976)
      and Grasnlich (1976). Were the other reasons for unemployment and high
      job turnover experienced by youth in footnote 2 incorporated into the
      model, it might be more important than it is in the current framework
      to assume that general labor market experience affects later
      productivity (Hall, 1982, also emphasizes turnover). We further
      simplify our task by assuming that minimum wage coverage is universal.

8.    Allowing these individual effects to be positively correlated over
      time rather than constant would probably not greatly affect the
      results, but it would complicate the model considerably because
      allowance would have to be made for some individuals who undertook
      training as youth to revert to the secondary sector as adults.

9.    The model is not much affected, though the algebra becomes more
      tedious, if the period of training is taken to be shorter than T or
      if the cost of training is presumed to be different for youth ana
      adult workers.

10. This expression presumes that the individual will be eligible again
     for the training subsidy at the second firm.  If an individual is
     eligible to receive this subsidy only once during his working life,
     then St must be deleted from this expression.

11.   Note that S    in equations (1) and (2) is a subsidy on the wage rate
      and not on ernings, and it is available to all youths no matter what
      their wage. An alternative formulation would target the subsidy on
      low wage workers, e.g., as a proportion of the difference between a
      target wage and a market wage (Barth, 1974). For an early analysis of
      the role of wage subsidies in a somewhat different context, see Rosen
      (1972).

12.   Another consideration which may influence the sharing of the costs and
      benefits of specific training is the business cycle (See Hashimoto,
      1979). Our model does not consider the impact of cyclical variation
      on the cost sharing.

13.   To generate behavior where no training takes place in Jobs offering
      the legal minimum wage, there must be wage interdependence or some
      other institutional arrangement such a union which raises all offered
      salaries in the primary sector above the minimum wage.

14.   Some of the funds earmarked for a training or wage subsidy will have
      the effect of bidding up the wage of inframarginal workers.  The
      marginal impact of employment and training programs for youth may be
      increased by targeting these programs on those who would not otherwise
      be hired as youths in the primary sector. The importance of targeting


                                    23
      has been appreciated by Congress and is reflected in legislation,
      e.g., the targeted jobs tax credit program. Nowever, there are also
      dangers in targeting since if the targeting is too narrow, the
      targeted group may simply replace others who are equally deserving but
      who are ineligible for the subsidy. See Johnson (1982). For an
      earlier analysis in the context of government training programs, see
      Hamermesh (1971).

15.   If the distribution of E   is such that all adults find it
      advantageous to work in the primary sector, then equation (2) below
      should be replaced by the equation n 2    1.  Such a change would not
      greatly affect the general conclusion drawn from the model, however,
      with the obvious exception that none of the policies considered would
      affect adult employment in either sector.

16.   According to this equation, a training subsidy is available to adults
      as well as youths, If the training subsidy were available only to
      youths, 5t would not appear in the equation.

17. This relationship assumes n     < n 2' meaning that all the
                                  1
     individuals hired into the pPimarysector as youths remain as adults,
     and in addition some individuals are newly hired into the primary
      sector as adults.  It can be shown that a necessary and sufficient
      condition for this result is:

                               (1 — du)(C —                               PY +     (C — S
            ( /' )PY
              s   p    s
                           +                      S
                                                      t
                                                          )/w
                                                                p
                                                                    >
                                                                               $            t )( 12
                                                                                                 1K

      The condition is satisfied, for instance, if v > '                                    (i.e.,
      immaturity has a greater detrimental effect in he pPimary sector) and
      PY5K2 >> (C —
                    St)K, (i.e., training costs are fairly small compared
      to total adult proàuctivity). In the analysis of this paper, it will
      always be assumed that the condition is satisfied. On the other hand,
      for sufficiently small values of v5, all individuals in the primary
      sector will be hired as youths and will continue working there as
      adults, in which case the equation n 1 = n     should replace equation
                                                  2
      (3) in the model. For still smaller aluesof v, it is even
      possible that some individuals hired and trained in the primary sector
      as youths will switch to the secondary sector as adults. This would
      require that equation (3) in the model be replaced by

                                              '           + 5(1     — n
                                     s            p                       p2
      and that equation (2) be modified to reflect the fact that the
      marginal youth in the primary sector will switch sectors as an adult.

18. One might expect that the firms in the secondary sector would try to
     claim that some of their activity is training in order to claim the
     subsidy. Similar incentives would exist for firms in the primary
     sector to claim that they do more training than they in fact do. The
     model abstracts from the potential difficulties in monitoring the
     claims of training.
