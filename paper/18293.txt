                                            ABSTRACT

This paper exploits the seasonal and annual changes in marginal prices for water to estimate the price
elasticity of demand by residential households for water. It uses the changes in distributions of water
using the census block group levels in response to changes in marginal prices of water for matched
months across years. This strategy reduces the interaction effects of outdoor use and demographic
fact in determining responsiveness to price. By comparing years that vary in overall water availability
the framework can recover measures of how responses to price vary with season and draught conditions.
The application is the urban Phoenix metropolitan area.

    Measuring Price Elasticities for Residential Water Demand with Limited Information


I. Introduction

         There is a growing recognition in both the professional and popular literatures that

water scarcity is a key policy issue which is essential to address in evaluating the effects

of climate change and long term sustainability of economic growth.1 Glennon’s [2009]

observations in his book, Unquenchable: America’s Water Crisis and What to Do About

It, describe the problem well:



         “Water presents a surprising riddle. We can neither make nor destroy it, so our

         supply is fixed yet it’s exhaustible because, as a shared resource used repeatedly,

         some uses preclude future reuse. Water policy suffers from a profound

         discontinuity between science and law…the result epitomizes the tragedy of the

         commons: limitless access to a finite resource” (p. 324)



         Those evaluating the water problem usually conclude prices must be reformed so

that incentives facing water users reflect this scarcity. Demand functions provide the

basic economic relationships required to predict how water use will respond to such

changes. This is where the problems arise. Access to detailed information on household

water use including household attributes (i.e. lot size, landscaping composition, and

presence of swimming pools), the composition of use (i.e. indoor versus outdoor usage),

and pricing is limited. The combination of concerns over confidentiality and in some

challenges.

cases legislation precluding access to micro-level data for individual customers served by

water providers creates a limited information setting for understanding water demand.

Nonetheless, following Chetty’s [2009] arguments, it is possible under some conditions

to recover key structural water demand parameters without either a structural model or

the ability to use data on specific customers.

       In our application, the demand parameter we estimate is the price slope of a water

demand function for residential consumers at different water consumption levels. We use

this parameter to construct estimates for the price elasticity of demand, a key policy

variable of interest to local water providers. Our analysis uses order statistics derived

from micro level information on residential metered water use and prices which protects

the confidentiality of individual water customers. We control for unobservables by

exploiting our ability to link consumption and price data to spatial units. An important

element in our strategy stems from the ability to observe price and water consumption

changes over time.

       In most water demand applications increasing block rate structures confound a

reduced form approach for recovering information about a structural parameter such as

the quantity response to a price change. Our application has only two blocks. Nearly all

residential consumers are in the second block and do not switch blocks when water prices

change. In many areas of the country where there is metering and pricing of water more

complex increasing block pricing structures are often found. Pricing policies with

multiple blocks transform the methods required to use records on households’ water

consumption patterns for estimating how the quantity of water used responds to price
                                                                                            4

changes.2 They also make the requirements for detailed information on household

attributes even more important. As a result of the increased modeling requirements

associated with more complex pricing structures it has been difficult to offer a detailed

characterization of the differences in water demand responses across small versus large

residential users. This shortcoming has direct policy relevance because there is broad

consensus in the U.S. that affordable access to water for “ordinary” household use must

be maintained for lower income groups.

       This paper proposes a simple method for estimating the price elasticity of demand

that meets policy needs and can accommodate current data limitations. It can also be

implemented in the presence of simple increasing block pricing structures, such as the

two block structure used in Phoenix, AZ. In short, our method can estimate how water

usage responds to price changes under the typical conditions confronting applied

researchers with limited access to detailed household level micro data. Our data sample

was constructed as the thresholds for percentiles of water consumption at the census

block group level for a single municipal provider in Phoenix, AZ. Using the changes in

water consumption for selected percentiles over time our approach controls for housing

attributes, landscape attributes that don’t change, and socio-economic characteristics of

consumers while maintaining confidentiality of individual households’ records.

       The seasonal and temporal changes in the Phoenix municipal water system’s

residential water rates are used to reconstruct a record of price changes that are

exogenously imposed on customers. The Phoenix water provider is a regulated utility

which is allowed to adjust prices annually to cover cost increases. By matching months

unconditional price elasticities.
                                                                                               5

that experienced changes in the marginal price for the same pricing block it is possible to

isolate the quantity adjustment associated with these specific price changes and be

assured there is no shifting of households between price blocks.3 The findings derived

using this simple strategy are striking. Despite limited price variation we estimate

statistically significant demand elasticities. Our results also allow the price

responsiveness to be distinguished by percentiles of consumption. Distinguishing the

price responsiveness of demand by the amount of water consumption we are able to

establish that there are relatively large differences in elasticities with the largest water

users appearing to be more price inelastic.

        Estimation involves matching years where we compare two normal precipitation

years as well as a normal precipitation year to an exceptionally dry year. Separate models

are estimated for winter and summer demand. A comparison of the estimates for

approximately comparable price changes when there are different patterns of natural

precipitation conditions provides a simple plausibility check for the logic of the model.

That is, we should expect that natural increases in the need for water (due to dry

conditions) would make households with significant outside uses of water less responsive

to price increases. This is exactly what we find. The estimates of price elasticities for

residential customers in the summer months across all consumption percentiles reveal

they are much less responsive to price changes when the price comparison involves

responses in water use during dry conditions.


3 This strategy is consistent with Chetty’s [2009] call for a middle ground between
structural and reduced form (or treatment effect) approaches to policy evaluation. He
describes how research in public economics has focused on what he labels a “sufficient
statistic” or estimation strategies that focus on measuring parameters in transparent ways
with credible identifying information and yet focus on the key economic parameter for
policy evaluation and often welfare statements.

       The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section two outlines our

model and discusses its relationship to the conditional demand approach widely

advocated for estimating price elasticities with increasing block prices as well as to a

recent contribution by Nataraj and Hanemann [2011] exploiting a drought related water

pricing change in Santa Cruz.4 The third section describes our data and empirical

estimates. We conclude with comments on the applicability of our new approach in other

situations where response of water usage to price changes must be evaluated with limited

information.



II. Modeling Water Demand



A. Background

       Most of the recent literature measuring the price elasticity of demand has been

based on the discrete / continuous choice (DCC) model developed by Hausman [1979]

for applications to labor supply.5 For demand models derived from choices with convex

budget sets (increasing block price structures), one need only specify a conditional

demand function to estimate the model. This relationship describes how the quantity

demanded responds to the marginal price within each budget segment (corresponding to

the segment associated with each step in the increasing block pricing structure).

Conventional practice assumes this demand function includes two errors. One is usually

  An alternative structure based on using the first order conditions from the constrained
utility maximization problem is developed and illustrated in Strong and Smith [2010].
5
  See Burtless and Hausman [1978] for discussion of the model with non-convex budget
constraint, Heckman [1983] for a critique and Reiss and White [2006] for discussion of
how welfare analysis can be undertaken with non-linear budget constraints.
                                                                                               7

hypothesized to be associated with household preference heterogeneity not captured in

observable variables. This feature is known to the household but not to the analyst. The

second is an error hypothesized to be unknown to both the household and the analyst. It

could arise from leaks in the water system, measurement errors, or a composite of both

effects. The two error terms allow the model to describe choice outcomes. This structure

is especially important for being able to include some households’ consumption choices

that would appear to have them falling at the kinks of the budget constraint.

       As a rule, the consumption decision process is explained as if there were two

distinct steps: (1) a description of the probability that consumption will be in one of the

budget segments (or at a kink)6 and (2) conditional on each budget segment there is a

conditional demand function describing how the quantity of water demanded relates to

the marginal price.7 At a kink, there is no such relationship because the model implies

demand is higher than the highest value of the lower block but lower than the lowest

value of the next highest block. The parameters of the conditional demand are assumed

constant across segments to identify the model.8 This assumed constant parameter

structure for all budget segments does not simplify the relationship between conditional

and unconditional price elasticities.

       As Olmstead et al. [2007] demonstrate, the unconditional price elasticity is a

function of both the conditional price elasticity and the income elasticity. As a result, the

steps in the increasing block structure.

  In practice we simply observe households consumption that implies their consumption
affects the marginal price they face. The steps are used to separate the way the statistical
model uses available information so that the inherent simultaneity is represented
consistently in the econometric analysis.

  See Strong and Smith [2010] for a discussion of the limitations of this assumption.
                                                                                                 8

relationship of the unconditional price elasticity to the conditional elasticity is not clear.

Both the ranking of the two measures and the magnitude of the absolute difference

between them cannot be signed a priori. For their application Olmstead et al. found the

unconditional price elasticity of demand was smaller in absolute magnitude than the

conditional elasticity. Because the rate subsidies associated with increasing block price

structures are small, the price differences between blocks are small, and the expenditure

share for water in a household’s overall budget is small; the authors suggest their results

may provide a reasonable guide for the relationship with most communities’ residential

water demands.

         Nonetheless, despite this relatively optimistic conclusion of the Olmstead et al.

study, the experience with the DCC model for water applications has been mixed. Hewitt

and Hanemann [1995] reported the first such application. They found large (in absolute

value) conditional price elasticities and report an unconditional elasticity for a price

structure change that is also large compared to the literature. Both the Espey et al. [1997]

and the Dalhausen et al. [2003] meta analyses of water demand studies found the

majority of the price elasticity estimates were less than unity in absolute magnitude.

Olmstead et al.’s results are consistent with these findings in that their conditional

elasticity estimate was approximately -0.34 and simulated unconditional estimates was -

0.59.

         The Olmstead et al. sample is also quite unique in that it pools household level

data across 11 urban areas in the U.S.9 One concern the authors raise is that the very

advantage of their data in displaying how households responded to a variety of price

    The data are relatively old as are the data underlying Hewitt and Hanemann [1995].
                                                                                            9

structures may create a cause for concern. That is, the community’s tastes for water

conservation may be reflected in the provider’s rate structure. Communities with several

blocks and high marginal prices for the top blocks may also have strong mandates for

conservation. This logic seems especially relevant for public water providers where

revenues cannot exceed costs. Under these conditions revenues in excess of the costs of

service for the highest blocks must be offset by revenues below the costs of service for

lower blocks in order to meet the zero “profit” constraint.

       In these situations the estimation of demand functions that are structured to be

conditional to a rate structure may also reflect the unobserved taste for conservation.

After a series of tests for this potential explanation of their findings Olmstead et al.

conclude that they cannot dismiss the hypothesis that the underlying city level taste for

conservation, through the design selected for each community’s price structure, may

contribute to the observed higher (in absolute value) elasticities. It would not be possible

to reproduce their study using a single water provider because the structure of a single

system’s price schedule is usually stable. Year to year changes in prices may well involve

small changes in marginal prices for selected blocks that are unlikely to have sufficient

variability in prices to distinguish the effect of a change in price from changes in

conservation motives over time.10

       Recently Nataraj and Hanemann [2011] have exploited a natural demand shock

for water pricing in Santa Cruz, California using a regression discontinuity design to

10
  One exception to this is Pint [1999] who estimates the DCC model for the Alameda
County Water District but argues that it would be difficult to take the results from the
estimation to other parts of California since the results are sensitive to climatic
conditions, a key point of our analysis. Additionally, the information available for her
analysis includes detailed information on household characteristics including house size
and lot size.
                                                                                            10

estimate how households responded to a new block in the block pricing schedule. In

response to a prolonged period of drought and after using price increases and various

non-price controls from 1987 to 1992, in February 1995 the Santa Cruz local government

introduced new rates to begin in June 1995. Prior to this time there was a two block

system. The 1994 rates priced the first eight hundred cubic feet (CCF) on the bi-monthly

metering schedule at $0.65/CCF and the next units of water were priced at $1.55/CCF.11

The new third rate applied to consumption over 40 CCF and was initially priced at

$3.14/CCF for use in excess of 40 CCF in a two month period.

       This pricing scheme implied households consuming 40 or more CCF would

experience a change in the marginal price of consumption over this threshold. To exploit

this change they use prior water consumption as the threshold distinguishing treatment

and control households and investigate the effects of excluding households close to the

40 CCF cut off. Their findings indicate households did respond to the price change. This

result was confirmed in both robustness checks for the threshold and falsification tests for

the basic logic underlying the design. Unfortunately, the discrete nature of the price

change and the fact that it was limited to the largest consumers made it difficult to

develop general conclusions on the extent of price responsiveness to compare to the

literature. The authors did note that the water consumption response estimated for the 100

percent price increase implied a short run price elasticity of approximately -0.12. This

estimate falls at the low end of past estimates.

       Our method builds on the Nataraj and Hanemann [2011] logic and exploits a set

of changes in the rate structure for residential customers in Phoenix, AZ that take place

11
  Increases in rates of 6% in June 1995 and 5% in June 1996 and 1997 were part of the
plan to increase rates. The 5% rate increases in 1996 were to apply to the new block.
                                                                                            11

with every change of season. These rate changes are common across many water

providers in the Southwestern U.S. and are intended to reflect seasonal changes in

demand and supply of water. We adapt a proposal made by Borenstein [2009] for

considering residential elasticity demand and are able to consider how these changes

affect consumers with different total amounts of water usage at different times of the

year. Our approach does not estimate a structural demand. Instead, we hypothesize a

price response that can be locally approximated for small price changes with a linear

form. Changes in the distributions of water use in local neighborhoods, defined by census

block groups, associated with price increases over time are used to estimate elasticities

for different consumption percentiles. More specifically, we use the order statistics for

these consumption distributions to characterize the responses for different sized water

consumers to price changes.



B. A Quasi-Experimental Approach for Measuring Price Elasticities for Residential

Water Demand

       Our analysis considers a single municipal water provider with a two block pricing

structure.12 Rates change in different months throughout the year corresponding to low,

medium, and high usage periods. Water and waste water are priced on the same metered

records. Thus, changes in either price affect incentives for water usage. The consumption

threshold for the increase in marginal price between blocks changes from 600 cubic feet

in low water use periods (winter) to 1000 cubic feet in high water use periods (summer).

Our estimation strategy exploits increases in rates over time that vary by different


12 The use of a block pricing structure is common for water providers; while the number
of blocks and cutoff points between blocks varies widely across different providers.
                                                                                                12

amounts for each usage period along with the ability to link individual meters to census

block groups, with each block group containing approximately 600 residential water

meters. To consider the first component of our analysis, the changes in marginal prices,

we use a linear specification for water demand as in equation (1).



w ijt   0  1 p jtb  f z i   g(T jt )  uijt                                             (1)



w ijt is the water consumed by household i in the month j of year t. Based on the metered

records for w ijt , we know p jtb , which is the bth block’s marginal price in month j of year

t. This is the block that corresponds to the water consumption w ijt . f(zi) is a function for

the effects of observable household attributes (zi) and g(Tjt) is the effect of weather

related variables – temperatures and precipitation in month j and year t. uijt is an error

that can be a composite of unobserved individual heterogeneity and measurement error.

         To form a difference equation, we match the monthly records for each household

(meter) in each year of our data.13 For customers who remain in a constant price block

across years and months, we can difference equation (1) between two years in which a

marginal price change occurs to derive equation (2).



wijt  a  wijt   1  k  ( g (T jt  a )  g (T jt ))  (uijt  a  uijt )             (2)




13
  The Phoenix water provider changes rates every year to cover increased water delivery
costs and maintenance.
                                                                                          13

k is the constant increment to the marginal price experienced between years (i.e.

and ). Using this specification the intercept in this difference equation estimates the

effect of price on water demand assuming the price change between the two months is

identical for each consumer. These differences can be pooled over months if the price

increment is the same. The differencing causes the demographic features, zi’s,

characterizing individual households to drop from the estimating model. This outcome

assumes these attributes don’t change at the scale of the census block group. One might

argue the lowest block’s price should also be included in the vector of zi’s due to an

adjustment in virtual income associated with the change in expenditures on the first block

of water. If the lower block’s price changes with linearity assumed for the effect of

income on water demand and all households remain in the top consumption block we

would expect the changes in this price to appear thru the income term. However, the

quantity limits distinguishing the blocks do not change for a given season so this

adjustment to income would be the same for all households. They would imply an

adjustment to the intercept for our difference model. In our case over the years

considered the first block’s price does not change.

       Differencing eliminates the effects of the first block’s price if the sample’s

consumption remains in the second block and the first block price doesn’t change.

Fortunately, as we explain below, there are no households with changes between the two

blocks in response to the price changes for our sample. We did observe over the full year

that there are some households who change consumption blocks at the lowest levels of

water consumption in May. Considering the consumption levels realized by the top 80 to

85% of the households in Phoenix and removing May from our sample we avoid the
                                                                                               14

problems that would arise with households changing consumption blocks as prices

change.

          Equation (2) is best considered an approximation. It relies on the effect of price

on water demand being locally constant. We would expect that price response would

depend on the features of each residential consumer’s living situation such as outdoor

landscape, number of bathrooms, the composition of water using appliances, and so forth.

We attempt to take account of these effects to estimate the changes in water demand at

different levels of consumption. More specifically, we alter equation (2) and construct

differences in the thresholds defining the 10, 25, 50, 75, and 95 percentiles for water

consumption in each block group to arrive at our estimating equation given in (3).



wnjt  a  wnjt   1  k  ( g (T jt  a )  g (T jt ))  ( njt  a   njt )         (3)



Consumption percentiles are represented by the subscript , and the precise thresholds

could be different households in different years. As noted earlier, we assume the

differences in the demographic attributes of households at each threshold defining the

percentiles are small and can be neglected. This is a limitation that arises with our data.

We do not have distributions for the economic and demographic attributes of households

in the census block groups over time. This formulation follows Borenstein’s [2009]

proposal for the case of modeling electricity demand. When the assumption that the

household defining each threshold has approximately the same attributes differencing the

same percentile across time for each block group removes these effects. It also removes

cross sectional features of neighborhoods that are constant across time, such as xeric or
                                                                                             15

mesic landscape, that might interact with the consumption responses to marginal price

changes.

       As noted earlier only households at the lowest level of consumption display

sufficient reactions in their water use to the price changes over time to observe a shift

from one price block to another. Moreover, for this percentile, the changes that lead to

shifts across pricing blocks are limited to one month, May. This month precedes the high

use and highest price season. All of the remaining points on the distribution fall in the

highest block. By focusing on the highest and lowest water usage periods of the year

corresponding to winter and summer months, which do not include May, we avoid the

issue of block switching. Our estimates discussed in the next section report all

percentiles. Nonetheless for the lowest consumption groups demand responses may well,

over the full year, reflect the influence of the price threshold between blocks. For this

reason we argue the estimated water consumption response to prices is appropriate for

residential consumers that account for all but the lowest 10 to 15 percent of water

consumption.

       Our strategy does allow us to estimate different conditional price elasticities for

different sized residential users. To our knowledge, this issue has not been considered in

the past literature. Nataraj and Hanemann [2011] measure the local price responsiveness

for one class of demanders. We can extend that logic to consider nearly the full

distribution of residential consumers. Moreover, it appears these types of distinctions can

be important for pricing policy when there are concerns with assuring affordable access

to low income users who tend to be in the lowest use percentiles.

III. Data and Price Elasticity Estimates

       Our analysis is based on records for residential meters served by the municipal

Phoenix water system. We know the year, month, amount of water used, and the price

schedule for each meter which we treat as a user. These data do not include other

information about these households.14 After matching each meter to its block group and

information on weather conditions experienced in each block group for each month and

year we are left with between 993 and 996 records for each month in the three years

comprising our sample.15

       Our analysis relies on isolating changes in the marginal prices for water over time.

These changes are not associated with any household moving between pricing blocks.

Table 1 displays the marginal prices for the highest water usage blocks by month for the

three years in our sample. This table depicts the changes in marginal prices that occur for

the highest block in different seasons. There are some months that display differences

from the low (December, January, February, March), medium (April, May, October,

November), and high (June, July, August, September) periods due to the timing of

allowed adjustments in the rate structure.

       We use these monthly differences in prices for the low and the high usage period

as exogenous price differences to construct the quasi-experiment. As noted this difference

in the quantity thresholds for each consumption percentile at the block group level



14
   This same limitation faced Nataraj and Hanemann. They used the average values for
demographic variables for each block group. The structure of the price changes applied to
every residential customer. As a result it is possible to difference out the effects of
demographics and focus on the price and weather related differences in demand for the
full distribution of consumers.
15
   Block groups are constant across years. The slight difference in numbers of block
groups is a result of missing data.
                                                                                            17

differences out the effects of the housing distribution and neighborhood attributes. During

this period, the bulk of the new housing construction in the Phoenix area occurred outside

the Phoenix water provider’s district, making the assumption of constant housing and

neighborhood attributes reasonable given the short time periods we consider.

       As Table 1 suggests, we selected three years for analysis and treat the year 2000

as our base year. This strategy provides two different sets of price changes to evaluate

using differences between the years 2000 versus 2002 and 2000 versus 2003. The years

2000 and 2003 were considered a pair of “normal” years in terms of precipitation while

year 2002 was unusually dry. We use the effects of these weather differences on our

elasticity estimates to judge the plausibility of our strategy for estimating price

responsiveness. Table 2 compares the weather variables and percentiles of consumption

use for each of the three years.

       Our models also include controls for monthly differences in the minimum

temperature, the precipitation, and the days of precipitation interpolated for each block

group. These data came from approximately 15 NOAA monitoring stations located

around the Phoenix area that collected information during the months used for our

analysis. Each monitoring station reports daily data on temperatures and precipitation.

We averaged temperatures in each month at each monitor to form a series of monthly

specific temperature variables. For precipitation, we used monthly counts of the total

number of days in which rainfall was detected as well as the total amount of rainfall

(measured in inches). Each block group in our sample is assigned the weather data from

the closest monitor.
                                                                                             18

       Different months experience different price changes. Comparing the price

changes over all months between the years 2000 and 2003 we observe price changes

varying from $0.14 to $0.31 (per 100 cubic feet). Eight months fall between the ranges of

$0.14 to $0.17. Comparing years 2000 and 2002 the range is $0.08 to $0.19. The model is

estimated separately for each of two sub-samples and each percentile – restricting the

data to include only winter (low-December, January, and February) and only summer

(high-June, July, August, and September) seasons.

       Before discussing our estimates for price responsiveness we should discuss the

implications of using a difference in an order statistic as the dependent variable in each

model. We examine the quantity response to price changes at the k percentile of

consumption. There is a well-established literature on the properties of order statistics

used in multivariate statistical models. Linear functions of order statistics are often

known as L statistics and as L estimators when they are used to estimate parameters of an

underlying distribution. When the L statistic is a function of a finite number of central

order statistics or a finite number of extreme order statistics, we can use established

properties of their asymptotic joint distribution to obtain the limiting distribution for the

L statistics. For example, in the case of a fixed number of central order statistics the

limiting distribution is normal under mild conditions on the parent distribution. Indeed,

asymptotic normality has been established by putting relatively mild conditions on the

weighting function or the parent distribution.16 Both are consistent with what would be

conventional practice with analyses of micro data. Thus, it seems reasonable to interpret




16
  A good overview of these conditions with citations to the primary results is found in
Chapter 8 of Arnold, Balakrishnan and Nagaraja [2008].
                                                                                          19

the test statistics for our parameter estimates as asymptotically normal and follow

conventional practices in interpreting the test statistics.

        Table 3 reports our estimates for the first difference model for these two seasons

and for each paired price change (2000-2003 and 2000-2002). The intercept in each set

of models is the key focus of the analysis for evaluating the effects of price on

consumption. This parameter is precisely estimated in comparing summer consumption

for normal weather years. For winter use, large users are not responsive to price but

otherwise respond during summer months. What is especially striking is the contrast

when we consider a price change comparing a normal and a dry year. Here all users are

price responsive but the pattern of adjustment is informative. In the summer months all

users, but especially large users, are less responsive to price changes during dry

conditions.

        In comparing a dry and normal year changes in precipitation are the same sign in

both winter and summer months. The amount of precipitation, as Table 2 shows, has

declined so the change is negative between 2002 and 2000. This precipitation effect

increases demand in both winter and summer. By contrast, in comparing the two normal

years the effect depends upon season. To assess the overall impact we need to consider

changes in the amount of precipitation and its distribution over days. Changes in each of

these variables have opposite signs for the summer and winter models.

        For the comparison of the normal and dry year the two effects are consistent

between the winter and summer models. Reductions in precipitation lead to increases in

water use and reductions in the number of days of precipitation reduce water usage for
                                                                                              20

both seasons. Precipitation declines in the winter increase water use, while in the

summer the effect depends on both the change in amount and days of precipitation.17

        Table 4 presents the primary results of our analysis – estimates of the demand

elasticity using comparisons between two normal years and a normal and a dry year to

identify the price effect. Our estimates using percentiles can be distinguished by the size

of residential customers. This distinction, as expected based on Nataraj and Hanemann

[2011], plays an important role in parsing out the heterogeneity in household level

estimates for the price elasticities.

        Comparing the first panel of Table 4 for normal / normal versus the second panel

for normal / dry we see directly that price responsiveness is reduced quite substantially

for the summer months when the overall situation is abnormally dry. In winter months,

we see responsiveness to price changes across all consumption percentiles. We also find

that larger users are uniformly less responsive to price across all seasons regardless of

weather conditions. To our knowledge this is the first time a water demand study has

been able to extract these distinctions and control for the effects of the block structure.



IV. Implications

        When the DCC approach was first proposed to model labor supply and evaluate

the effect of policies to change income taxes Heckman [1983] raised a number of

questions about the ability of analysts to assume the actual points specifying the kinks in

the budget constraint, due to tax structure, were exogenous. In addition, he noted that




17
   All the significance tests for the effects of individual variables use Huber robust
standard errors.
                                                                                          21

with exogenous kink points there should be “bunching at the kinks.”18 These kink points

are exogenous in the case of increasing block price structures for water; however in

preliminary analysis of the Phoenix residential water data we did not observe this

bunching. This may reflect the simplified rate structure residents in the Phoenix area

faced where most residential customers are in the highest block throughout the year due

to the relatively low consumption threshold defining pricing blocks. As a result, there

would be no meaningful variation in the marginal price for these customers. The seasonal

changes in rates would be experienced by all water consumers at the same time and

responses to the price changes would be difficult to separate from changes in water needs

due to the temperature changes throughout the year. The Phoenix system’s price structure

is not unique. As a result, it may be reasonable to assume the opportunities for

adjustments among blocks for many water systems are limited and the distinction

between conditional and unconditional price responses small. The “action” in estimating

price responses may well be in considering price changes over time and allowing

flexibility in the nature of the price response by the quantity of water consumed.

         A further limitation to what has become the conventional approach to demand

modeling, as Olmstead et al. suggest, is the concern about whether the price structure is

truly exogenous. Under these conditions pooling data across communities to provide

variation in price schedules may also include differences inherent in the conservation

motives of the households in these communities. These types of applications also would

not have sufficient information to distinguish taste parameters for conservation from the

parameters reflecting price responses. Limiting the analysis to a single community would



18
     See Heckman [1983] p. 71.
                                                                                            22

not provide a sufficient basis for identifying the price response either. This concern

would lead to preferences for models that do not start with the conditional demand

function defined for a given price structure and instead a framework that begins from a

preference specification such as Strong and Smith [2010]. Of course, this approach adds

considerable structure in the assumed specification for preferences.

       We have proposed a different strategy for estimating demand responses more

consistent with the compromise advocated by Chetty [2009]. It combines two elements.

The first is Borenstein’s proposal to consider how order statistics summarizing the

distribution of use, constructed at the census block group level, change with exogenous

price changes. The second element involves exploiting changes in marginal prices over

time (to reflect provider cost increases) that can be matched by month so the position of

water consumption in the price structure is unchanged. This matching process assures the

increment to the marginal price can be used as an exogenous change from the

household’s perspective. As a result, the price change can be treated as a type of

treatment for evaluating the change in water usage.

       Our application to the Phoenix residential market indicates this approach is

remarkably effective. It does not require the structural assumptions of the DCC approach,

allows estimates of price responsiveness by size (in terms of water use) of customer, and

was also effective in discriminating how lower than normal precipitation in an arid desert

environment can reduce price responsiveness, especially for large users. We interpret this

ability to detect a role for differences in seasonal rainfall as confirming evidence that

supports our direct approach. It also indicates that matching a simple theoretical model of

demand response with an exogenous source of price variation can allow measurement of
                                                                                          23

demand elasticities. Our use of the order statistic to characterize demand provides a

strategy that recognizes the importance of a price change to any individual household will

depend on the amount of water used. More complex increasing block price schedules can

be accommodated in this logic with enough ability to observe within block changes in

marginal prices over time.

       For empirical demand estimation, our findings of substantial heterogeneity and

variation over time should be informative for the specification of future structural

models. In addition to informing future structural models, there are also several

limitations of the method provided in this paper that could be confronted in future

research. Perhaps most glaring is that we rely on the relatively short time frame of study

and relatively non-binding pricing block structure of Phoenix. Confronting endogeneity

from changes in price blocks, how to handle differences across larger geographic areas

such as metropolitan areas, and incorporation of longer-run changes in response through

changes in appliances or landscape remain open questions deserving of future research.

By demonstrating the ability to overcome the typical setting of limited access to micro

data on water consumption information we hope that this approach offers a practical basis

for meeting many of the needs of policy makers managing local water resources. Reliable

estimates of price elasticities distinguished by seasonal and weather conditions can help

to assess how water use (and provider revenues) will change with price changes.
