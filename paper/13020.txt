Collateral Damage: Exchange Controls and International Trade

                                              ABSTRACT

While new conventional wisdom warns that developing countries should be aware of the risks of
premature capital account liberalization, the costs of not removing exchange controls have received
much less attention. This paper investigates the negative effects of exchange controls on trade. To
minimize evasion of controls, countries often intensify inspections at the border and increase documentation
requirements. Thus, the cost of conducting trade rises. The paper finds that a one standard-deviation
increase in the controls on trade payment has the same negative effect on trade as an increase in tariff
by about 14 percentage points. A one standard-deviation increase in the controls on FX transactions
reduces trade by the same amount as a rise in tariff by 11 percentage points. Therefore, the collateral
damage in terms of foregone trade is sizable.

I. Introduction

Since the emerging market crisis of the 1990s, a new conventional wisdom has emerged that
developing countries should be alert to the adverse effects of premature capital account
liberalizations (see Rodrik, 1998; Stiglitz, 2002; and other papers reviewed by Prasad,
Rogoff, Wei, and Kose, 2003). In comparison, the costs of not removing exchange controls
have received much less attention in empirical research. A notable exception is a study by
Forbes (2002) which estimated the effect of Chile’s capital controls (“encaje”) in the early
1990s on the cost of borrowing faced by its medium-sized publicly-listed firms.


In this paper, we estimate another possible collateral damage of exchange controls, namely
their effects on international trade, and compare them to those of tariff and other non-tariff
barriers (NTBs). The study was motivated in part by a conversation we had some years ago
with the chief of the national foreign exchange control administration of a country which
shall remain anonymous. As the country was on a fixed exchange rate regime (and any
change in the regime was to be decided by the government cabinet rather than by the foreign
exchange control administration) and by then had permitted current account convertibility of
its currency, we asked the chief why his bureau needed to have a large staff nationally. The
response was that it was common for firms and individuals to try to circumvent capital
account restrictions by mis-invoicing imports, exports or both, and his staff had to implement
various inspections to minimize such leakages. It dawned on us that attempts to enforce
exchange controls have most likely raised the cost for firms to engage in exports and imports.
How much extra cost these controls effectively impose on international trade is the subject of
the current research reported here.


The paper combines three unique panel data sets: (a) a detailed description (192 indicators)
of the exchange controls for up to 184 countries since 1996 in the IMF’s Annual Report on
Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER) database; (b) importer-
partner country- specific tariff rates from the UNCTAD’s Trade Analysis and Information
System (TRAIN), retrieved via the World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS) at the IMF; and
(c) a rating of the extent of non-tariff barriers from the IMF’s Trade Restrictiveness Index
                                               3


database. These data are then combined with bilateral trade data from the IMF’s Direction of
Trade database as well as additional control variables from other sources. The econometric
specification is grounded in the theory of trade volume, including recent development in
Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) and Helpman, Melitz and Rubinstein (2005).


To our knowledge, Tamirisa (1999) was the first and the only other paper that studied the
effect of exchange restrictions on trade. Due to data limitation, her sample covers only one
year (1996) and 40 countries. Perhaps more importantly, the estimation was based on a mis-
specified model as it did not incorporate separate importer and exporter fixed effects which
are required of by economic theory. For example, Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) show
that the omission of these fixed effects has artificially generated the so-called “border effect”
in trade volume. Subramanian and Wei (forthcoming) show that the inclusion of the fixed
effects can reverse Rose’s (2004) conclusion on the ineffectiveness of the WTO in promoting
trade. It is therefore important to specify the trade volume equation in a way that is consistent
with economic theories.


Due to the comprehensive descriptions of the exchange controls in the AREAER database
since 1996, we are able to construct separate indicators for (a) controls on proceeds from
exports and payments for imports, (b) controls on capital transactions, and (c) controls on
foreign exchange (FX) transactions and other items not specific to goods trade or capital
transactions. Note that the phrases “capital controls” and “exchange controls” are used
interchangeably in this paper as they refer to all three categories of controls, not just those on
capital transactions. A narrower definition of “capital controls” may include only controls on
capital transactions plus controls on most FX transactions. According to Johnson, Kochhar,
Mitton and Tamirisa (2006), several capital control measures adopted in Malaysia during the
Asian financial crisis were not targeted at specific capital transactions, but at all FX
transactions.


To preview the main findings, we will report economically and statistically significant
evidence of negative effects of exchange controls on trade. In particular, a one standard
deviation increase in the controls on export receipts and import payments is found to have the
                                              4


same negative effect on trade as an increase in tariff by 8.7 to 13.9 percentage points,
depending on the model specifications. A one standard deviation increase in the controls on
FX transactions reduces trade by the same amount as a rise in tariff by 10.8 to 11.3
percentage points. When a case study of the emerging markets during 1996-99 is examined,
we find that those countries with greater increases in the controls on capital transactions also
experienced greater falls in their trade (after taking into account their output contractions). To
summarize, exchange controls effectively work as a form of non-tariff barriers to trade even
though they have not been typically characterized as NTBs in the literature. We conclude that
the collateral damage of imposing exchange controls in terms of foregone trade is sizable.


The paper is arranged as follows. Section II describes some basic patterns regarding the
exchange controls across countries and over time. Section III presents the statistical analysis.
Section IV Concludes.


II. Exchange Controls: Some Basic Patterns


The IMF’s AREAER database uses up to 192 indicators – listed in an appendix - to track the
exchange controls for individual member countries from 1996. We divide these controls into
three broad categories and construct an index for each category. Each index ranges from 0 to
1, reflecting the proportion of the indicators in each category that have controls in place. The
three categories are:


   •   Controls on payments for imports and proceeds from exports. They cover 35 controls
       that explicitly target transactions related to international trade, including requirements
       for a foreign exchange budget for imports, and documentation and financing
       requirements for import payments and export proceeds.


   •   Controls on capital transactions. They cover 86 controls on transactions of capital
       and money market instruments, derivatives, FDI, credit operations, real estates, and
       personal finance. They also include controls on the operation of institutional investors
       and commercial banks.
                                                    5



   •   Controls on FX transactions and other items that are not exclusively on trade or
       capital transactions. They include exchange taxes and subsidies, ban on currency
       derivative trading, controls on bank accounts, currency requirements for pricing and
       settlements, current transfers and invisible transactions, and trade in gold and
       banknotes.

On average, as Table 1a and Figure 1 indicate, countries tend to have more controls on
capital transactions and foreign exchange transactions than on trade payments. Furthermore,
all three indices show a moderate decline during the period from 1996 to 2005. The average
index value for controls on capital transactions dropped from 0.49 in 1996 to 0.45 in 2005.
The index for controls on trade payments, and that for FX transactions, also declined from
0.30 to 0.24, and from 0.35 to 0.31, respectively, during the same period. Countries with
more controls in one category are also likely to have more controls in the other categories, as
indicated by the pair wise correlations of about 0.67-0.76 (Table 1b).
                                                                                          6


The average values of the indices mask substantial cross-country heterogeneity and time-
series variations for many countries. To illustrate this point, Figure 2 presents the patterns for
three developing countries on two continents (Brazil, Chile, and Malaysia) and one OECD
member country (Greece). Each has experienced substantial changes in the controls during
the sample period.


Brazil first tightened controls on capital transactions and foreign exchange transactions in the
1990s, but then liberalized dramatically in 2002. Its controls on trade payments fluctuate a
bit, with a generally downward trend. Chile’s story is equally dramatic. While it started off
with a fairly restrictive regime on capital transactions, with a value of 0.75 for the relevant
index in 1996, major reforms in 2001/2002 removed more than half of the controls, including
those on transactions of equity, bonds, real estate, and direct investment. This results in a
decline in the index value to 0.19 by 2005. During the same period, Chile also removed some
controls on trade payments, though there were relatively few of them to begin with.

Greece exhibits two major episodes of liberalization of the controls on FX transactions in
1997 and 2001 with modest reforms in other years. Virtually all controls on FX transactions
had been removed by 2005. Controls on capital transactions loosened more gradually over
time. While Malaysia reduced its controls on trade payments in the mid-1990s, it tightened
its controls on capital transactions during the Asian financial crisis, through introducing new
controls on the transactions of bonds, derivatives, real estate, and other debt instruments by
nonresidents. The index for controls on capital transactions jumped from 0.61 in 1997 to 0.69
in 1998, climbing further to 0.75 by 2004. Some of these controls have been removed or
loosened since 2001, but these changes apparently are not fully reflected in the database.


The variations across countries and over time will prove helpful in identifying the effects of
exchange controls on international trade in empirical specifications with country and year
fixed effects. It is important to point out, however, that as measures of exchange controls,
these indices are not perfect either. First, the AREAER database only reflects the presence or
absence of specific exchange restrictions on the book, but not the degree of enforcement on
the ground. Second, in spite of up to 192 indicators to describe the controls, for any given
indicator, the intensity of the controls is not well captured by the database. In light of these
shortcomings, the statistical findings should be interpreted with caution. Nonetheless, the
AREAER database may be the only source that covers the near universe of the countries and
codes the controls in a consistent way across countries.


III. Statistical Analysis


We now turn to the regression analysis. Starting with an explanation of the benchmark
specification and the data on tariffs and non-tariff barriers, we move to reporting some basic
results and computing the tariff equivalents of the exchange controls. We then discuss a
number of extensions including a case study of the emerging markets’ experience during the
financial crisis episode of the late 1990s.

Specification
An augmented gravity model is utilized to study the effect of exchange controls on trade. The
gravity model is one of the most successful empirical models in economics, as it is capable of
explaining a large fraction of the variations in observed volumes of international trade, with
adjusted R-squares of 70% or higher. It has also been applied to analyze the effects of a
variety of policies on trade.1 The specification used in this paper incorporates recent
theoretical insights from Anderson and van Wincoop (2003), and Helpman, Melitz, and
Rubinstein (HMR, 2005). It allows us to compute a tariff-equivalent measure of the exchange
controls in terms of their effects on trade. To be precise, the benchmark model is specified in
the following form:


Yi,j,t = α1 IMPi + α2 EXPj + α3 Yeart + Xi,j,t β

        + Restriction-Indicesi,t γ + δ Tariffi,j,t + η NTBi,t + εi,j,t                                (1)



The dependent variable Yi , j ,t is country i’s log imports from country j in year t. The key

variables of interests are the three restriction indices, the tariff rates, and the NTB index. In
addition, IMPi , j , EXPi , j , and YEARt are the importer, exporter, and year fixed effects,

respectively. X i , j ,t is a list of variables that previous studies have found significant in

explaining the volume of trade, including log GDP, great circle distance between i and j,
dummies for common language, colonial links, and shared borders. Following Helpman,
Melitz, and Rubinstein (2005), we also include a Mills ratio and another HMR variable to
correct for the non-random presence of zero trade and intra-sector firm heterogeneity.


The importer and exporter fixed effects are meant to capture the “remoteness” terms in Wei
(1996) or the “multilateral resistance” terms in Anderson and van Wincoop (2003). Note,
however, that we are not able to include time-varying country fixed effects as that will render
it impossible to identify the effects of exchange controls (which are part of the time-varying

country-specific factors). As an extension, we will use a specification that includes time-
varying import-price index for exporters and importers separately. In addition, we will
examine a specification that includes (non-time-varying) country-pair fixed effects which are
also more general than the importer/exporter fixed effects.


Data
The sample includes 142 countries for which information about trade flows, tariff rates, the
nontariff barrier index, and exchange controls are available. A list of these countries is
provided in Appendix 2. As will be clear, this paper concludes that many of the exchange
controls are effectively non-tariff barriers in terms of their effects on trade. However,
conventionally measured NTBs in the literature do not usually include exchange controls.
For comparison, we adopt a separate measure of the NTBs in the traditional sense of the
phrase based on the IMF’s Trade Restrictiveness Index database. The index takes a value of
1, 2 or 3, depending on the coverage ratio or other dimensions of non-tariff barriers to trade.
According to the IMF (2005), the index takes the value of one if NTBs are absent or minor in
a country (i.e., less than one percent of production or trade are subject to NTBs). A rating of
2 implies that NTBs are significant, applied to at least one important sector, and affecting up
to 25 percent of production or trade. A rating of 3 means that NTBs are relevant for many
sectors or an entire stages of production, affecting more than 25 percent of production or
trade. In the IMF database, the NTB index takes the value of 2 for a large number of country-
years. So a rise in the index’s value from one to two, or from two to three, represents a fairly
significant increase in the extent of non-tariff barriers.


The tariff rate for a given country pair in a given year is a simple average of the applicable
tariff rates across all tariff lines for that importer and that specific trading partner (so that
members of a free trade area would face different tariffs from non-members).


Benchmark results
We now turn to the regression results which are reported in Table 2. The first three
regressions include the three exchange control indices one by one. The controls on trade
payments have a strong adverse effect on trade. The point estimate for γ is -0.57, and is
                                                     10


highly significant. The coefficient for controls on capital transactions is negative but
insignificant. The estimate for controls on FX transactions is -0.31 and significant at the 10
percent level. Note that all standard errors are clustered by importer-exporter country pairs2.


Most other regressors are significant and with intuitive signs. In particular, the estimate for
tariff rates is -0.71 and highly significant, which implies that increasing tariff by 10
percentage points is associated with a 7.1 percent reduction in trade. The estimate for NTB
index is -0.22 and also highly significant. This implies that a one-step increase in the NTB
index would have equivalent effect on trade as a 30 percentage points increase in tariff rates.
GDP, distance, dummies for border, colonial ties, and common language are all significant
and consistent with the previous literature. Trade between two WTO members is about 38
percent higher, while the trade between a WTO member and a non-member is about 17
percent lower.


Column 4 in Table 2 provides estimates when all three restriction indices are included in one
regression. The point estimate for the controls on trade payments remains significant at -0.54.
Controls on capital transactions is still insignificant. The coefficient for FX transactions
became insignificant, although it still shows a negative sign. Estimates for all other variables
are virtually unchanged.


The model allows us to conduct a tariff equivalent calculation for the exchange controls.
Take Column 4 in Table 2 as an example. As the standard deviation of the controls on trade
payments is 0.19, an increase in this type of controls by one standard deviation would have
the same negative effect on trade as raising tariff rate by 100*0.19*0.54/0.72=14.3
percentage points.


2
  When the standard errors are clustered by importers rather than importer-exporter pairs, some standard gravity
variables such as log of importer’s GDP as well as the three exchange controls lose statistical significance. This
suggests that clustering by importers may be an overkill if one’s prior is that the standard gravity variables
should be significant. For this reason, we choose to cluster by importer-exporter pairs. Note that the importer
fixed effects already take into account an important source of common variations across variables for any given
importer.
                                             11


We also implement a set of regressions with country pair fixed effects, which are more
general than importer/exporter fixed effects. The results are shown in columns 5 to 8 of Table
2. When the restriction indices are included one by one, the results are similar qualitatively as
before: the coefficients on both controls on trade payments and FX transactions are negative
and significant, while that on controls on capital transactions remains insignificant. When all
three indices are included together, the estimate for controls on trade payments becomes -
0.37 and significant, while controls on FX transactions increases to -0.35. The coefficient for
tariff rates is now -0.78 and significant. These estimates imply that an increase in the
exchange controls by one standard deviation (0.19 and 0.24, respectively) are equal to
100*0.19*0.37/0.78=9.0 percentage points increase in tariff rate for controls on trade
payments, and 100*0.24*0.35/0.78=10.8 percentage points increase in tariff rate for controls
on FX transactions.


Alternative specification with time-varying price indices
As we are not able to include time-varying importer fixed effects, we use time-varying
import price indices for both importers and exporters from the World Economic Outlook
database to proxy for the time-varying country-specific price factors. Import price indices are
better than CPI indices because the theory (Anderson and van Wincoop, 2003) suggests an
index of tradable goods prices, but CPI would be dominated by nontradable components.


The results from this alternative specification, reported in Table 3, are mostly consistent with
the benchmark case. When the restriction indices are included individually, all three types of
controls have negative and significant coefficients. When they are included collectively, both
controls on trade payments and those on FX transactions remain significant, while controls
on capital transactions become insignificant. The point estimate for controls on trade
payments is -0.49, implying slightly larger effect than those in the benchmark regressions.
The coefficients for tariff rates are estimated to be about -0.72, close to those in the
benchmark regressions. These estimates imply a tariff equivalent of 13 percentage points for
a one-standard-deviation increase in the controls on trade payments, and 14 percentage points
for a similar increase in the controls on FX transactions. In the last column of Table 3, (non-
time-varying) contry-pair fixed effects as well as time-varying imported goods price indices
                                             12


for exporters and importers are included in the same regression. With this specification, the
controls on trade payments still have a negative and significant coefficient, though the
coefficient on controls on foreign exchange transactions becomes negative and insignificant.
For some reasons, the coefficient on controls on capital transactions becomes positive and
significant. It is worth noting that the last column represents a fairly demanding specification
with many more parameters to be estimated relative to the regressions in Columns 1-4 of
Table 3.


Developing countries
There are reasons to think that the same exchange controls may have a smaller negative
effect on trade for developing countries than for developed countries. For example, bribery
and corruption at the customs may be more prevalent in developing countries so that a given
conrol is easier to be evaded. On the other hand, trading firms in developing countries may
have a harder time than their counterparts in developed countries in obtaining trade credit to
overcome the exchange controls. In this case, the same exchange controls may have a larger
negative effect. This discussion suggests that it may be useful to check if the results for
developing countries are different for the whole sample.


Table 4 focuses on a sub-sample in which both importers and exporters are developing
countries. The results are consisitant with (though somewhat weaker than) the benchmark
regressions. Columns 1 to 4 are regressions with importer, exporter, and year fixed effects.
When three control measures are included separately in regressions, all of them have the
expected negative signs with the coefficients on controls on trade payments and FX
transactions being significant. When included jointly, all three controls have negative
coefficients but only controls on trade payments remain significant. The point estimate for
controls on trade payments is -0.476, slightly less than the corresponding one in the
benchmark regression. Columns 5 – 8 are regressions with country pair fixed effects.
Controls on trade payments have a negative coefficient which is significant only when
included by itself. With all three controls in the same regression, controls on FX transactions
remain negative and significant.
                                                     13


Additional control variables
We have considered additional control variables. The most important ones are corruption and
trade openness. The results are reported in Table 5. All regressions include country-pair fixed
effects and year fixed effects. Since the level of corruption is a slow-moving variable, its
direct effect is likely captured by the country fixed effects. In Columns 1-4 of Table, we look
at the interaction between corruption and the exchange controls. Specifically, we create a
dummy for “more corrupt countries” if their corruption rating – based on the World Bank
Institute’s “Control of Corruption” index – exceeds the median in the sample. In addition to
the three exchange controls, we then add the interaction terms between each of the exchange
control measure and the corruption dummy. The results in Columns 1-4 provide some weak
evidence that exchange controls have a reduced negative effect on trade in relatively more
corrupt economies. This suggests that corruption may make evasion of exchange control a bit
easier on average.


Trade openness itself may alter the effect of a given level of exchange controls on trade. A
very high volume of trade opens up many channels to evade exchange controls through mis-
invoicing of trade. If customs inspection per unit of trade declines with the volume of trade,
then the negative effect of exchange controls on trade may also decline3. To examine this, we
create a dummy for “more open economies” for countries whose trade-to-GDP ratio exceeds
the median value. The dummy is interacted with the three exchange controls. The results are
reported in Columns 5-8 of Table 5. The interaction terms have generally positive signs (with
one exception). This is consistent with the notion that exchange controls have a smaller
negative effect on trade in more open economies.

  Aizenman (2003) proposes a model in which domestic financial repression leads to incentive for capital flight.
Trade openness facilitates capital flight precisely because of the difficulty in enforcing exchange controls when
trade volume is big.

Finer classification of exchange controls
As the restriction indices are based on many indicators for different dimensions of the
controls, a question of interest is which sub-categories of controls have greater adverse
effects. To answer it, we break down the three indices further into finer sub-categories. The
controls on trade payments are divided into controls over imports and those over exports.
Note controls on exports can have a negative effect on imports and vice versa due to the
Lerner symmetry theorem. The controls on capital transactions are broken down to eight sub-
categories that cover controls on capital and money market instruments, derivatives, FDI,
credit operations (loans), real estates, commercial banks, institutional investors, and personal
capital transactions. The controls on FX transactions are sub-divided into exchange taxes,
exchange subsidies, controls on forward markets, administrative controls, controls on setting
up bank accounts, controls on current transfers, controls on trade in gold and bank coins, and
existence of arrears due to lack of FX.


The regression results are reported in Table 6. As in the benchmark case, we place the
controls indices one by one first, and then pool them together. For each model, we implement
two variations, one with separate importer and exporter fixed effects, and the other with
country pair fixed effects. Many sub-indices show a negative sign, suggesting a trade-
reducing effect. Some sub-categories are significant for all specifications, such as controls on
export proceeds, controls on setting up bank accounts, existence of arrears due to lack of FX,
and currency requirements for pricing/settlements. It is particularly noteworthy that controls
over transactions of capital and money market instruments (including equity and bond
investments) have negative and significant signs in the models with importer and exporter
fixed effect. One caveat for the regressions with a large number of restriction sub-categories
is that some of them are highly correlated with each others, making statistical inference
difficult. For example, the average pair-wise correlation among the 8 indices for capital
transactions is 0.6. Therefore, the estimates need to be interpreted with caution.


A case study of the emerging market experiences in the 1990s
To supplement the full-sample analysis, we now turn to a case study of the experiences of
some emerging market economies that tightened exchange controls during the Asian-Latin
                                                15


American financial crisis of the late 1990s. As the increases in the controls were primarily
motivated by a desire to stop capital outflows or otherwise reduce the chance of a speculative
attack on their currencies, the changes in the controls were arguably exogenous with respect
to the countries’ trade flows.


We would like to work with a group of countries for which international capital flows are
significant relative to their GDPs (at least prior to the crisis). Therefore, we start with a set of
countries that are included in the MSCI emerging market index, and narrow down the list to
those developing economies that raised controls on either capital transactions or FX
transactions during 1996-1999. We are left with 11 countries (marked by # in Appendix 2).
As it turns out, very few of them significantly altered their tariffs, NTB ratings, or even
controls on trade payments during the period. Therefore, on an ex ante basis, we do not have
much hope in identifying a significant effect of these three variables. Nonetheless, we hope
to identify some effects coming from changes in the controls on capital and FX transactions.


We implement a time-differenced version of Equation (1), with the change in log bilateral
imports from 1996 to 1999 as the dependent variable. Naturally, all variables that are time-
invariant are eliminated, including the various fixed effects. Our specification is:


∆Log( importi,j,t ) = α1 ∆log(GDPi )+ α2 ∆log(GDPj ) + ∆Restriction-Indicesi,t γ

                       + δ ∆Tariffi,j,t + η ∆NTBi,t+ εi,j,t                                    (2)



where ∆ denotes a change in the relevant variable from 1996 to 1999. The regression result
without the NTB variable is reported in the first column of Table 7. The coefficient for the
controls on capital transactions is -1.46 and significant at the five percent level, and that for
the controls on FX transactions is -1.28 and significant. As expected, the coefficients on tariff
rate and controls on trade payments are not statistically different from zero. Note that a fall in
imports due to a contraction of domestic demand is explicitly controlled for since the change
in an importer’s GDP is a regressor. In the second column, we add change in the NTB ratings
as an extra regressor and obtain broadly similar results. To account for the effects of
                                              16


exchange rate fluctuations on trade flows, multilateral and bilateral real exchange rates are
included in the regression. The results are reported in column 3. The estimates for the
exchange controls remain similar to the other regressions. These results suggest that using
exchange controls to regulate capital flows can have the (unintended) consequence of
harming trade.


IV. Concluding Remarks


This paper sets out to investigate a possible collateral damage of exchange controls, namely
their negative effects on international trade. It indeed uncovers economically and statistically
significant evidence of the adverse effects. An increase in the controls on foreign exchange
transactions by one standard deviation reduces trade by the same amount as an increase in
tariff rate by 11 percentage points. An increase in the controls on trade payments has the
same negative effect on trade as an increase in tariff rate by 14 percentage points. The
experience of the emerging market economies during the late 1990s suggests that controls on
capital transactions intended to regulate capital flows also tend to harm trade substantially.
The evidence reported in the paper suggests that the collateral damage of exchange controls
should be a part of any assessment of the desirability of capital account liberalization (see
Kose, Prasad, Rogoff, and Wei, 2006, for a re-assessment of the effects of financial
globalization).


This paper represents a first step in understanding the effects of exchange controls on trade. It
is possible that the effects are non-linear: the same measure in an already restrictive exchange
control regime may do more harm than in a less restrictive one. The effects may vary by
sectors: exchange controls may raise the cost of trading in heterogeneous products more than
the cost of trading in homogeneous products. As heterogeneous products have a greater
variance in their unit values over different varieties, it may be more difficult for traders to
convince bureaucrats that a particular transaction is not mis-invoiced to evade exchange
controls. In this case, exchange controls imply one more distortion by affecting a country’s
pattern of specialization. The effects may also interact with other features of an economy: the
same exchange controls may do either more or less damage in a governance-challenged
                                             17


economy depending on whether corruption primarily weakens the exchange controls or
exacerbates the burden of complying with the controls. These are all fruitful topics for further
research.

Appendix 1: Exchange Controls: Source, Measurement, and Indices

         The exchange control indices are computed by the authors based on the exchange-
restriction indicators in the IMF’s Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange
Restrictions (AREAER) database, which in turn is compiled from the annual reporting by the
authorities of IMF member countries. The current classification system was first used in 1996
for a subset of countries but soon expanded to cover all member countries. This appendix
lists these indicators and explain how the restriction indices are constructed. Formal
definitions of these indicators are available in any issue of the AREAER.

        Three indices are constructed to gauge the coverage of exchange controls in three
groups: trade payments, capital transactions, and FX transactions and other items. Each index
is constructed as

                                                            n
                                Restriction Index i ,t = ∑ D j ,i ,t × W j
                                                           j =1



where Di , j ,t is an dummy variable that takes the value of 1 if country i has restriction
measured by indicator j in year t, and W j is the weight assigned to the indicator j. The
weights are chosen so that the major components within each group receive same weights.
For example, the documentation requirements for imports receive the same weight as
financing requirements for imports, although there are 5 sub-indicators for the former and 3
for the later. By construction, this index takes the value between 0 and 1, with a higher value
indicating a more restrictive regime.
