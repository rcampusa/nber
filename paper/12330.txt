We use micro data on young married households from the Japanese Panel Survey of Consumers in
order to analyze the importance of borrowing constraints in Japan. We find (1) that 8 to 15 percent
of young married Japanese households are borrowing-constrained, (2) that household assets and the
husband‚Äôs educational attainment are the most important determinants of whether or not a household
is borrowing-constrained, and (3) that the Euler equation implication is rejected for both the full
sample and for the subsample of unconstrained households. These results suggest that the life
cycle/permanent income hypothesis does not apply in Japan and that the presence of borrowing
constraints is not the main reason why it does not apply.

1     Introduction

If the life cycle/permanent income hypothesis (hereafter LCPIH) holds, changes

in consumption should not be sensitive to changes in expected income. On the

other hand, if this hypothesis does not hold (for example, because households are

borrowing-constrained), changes in consumption will be sensitive to changes in ex-

pected income. Thus, a commonly used test of the validity of the LCPIH is to

estimate an Euler equation to see whether changes in consumption are sensitive to

changes in expected income.

    If the LCPIH does not hold and the reason is the existence of borrowing con-

straints, we would expect changes in consumption to be sensitive to changes in

expected income in the case of borrowing-constrained households but not in the

case of unconstrained households. In this paper, we use micro data on young mar-

ried households from the Japanese Panel Survey of Consumers, conducted by the

Institute for Research on Household Economics, to shed light on (1) the prevalence

of borrowing constraints in Japan, (2) what households are borrowing-constrained

in Japan, (3) whether the LCPIH holds in Japan, and (4) whether the presence of

borrowing constraints is the reason why the LCPIH does not hold in Japan.

    To summarize our main Ô¨Åndings, we Ô¨Ånd (1) that 8-15 percent of young married

Japanese households are borrowing-constrained, (2) that household assets and the

husband‚Äôs educational attainment are the most important determinants of whether

or not a household is borrowing-constrained, and (3) that the Euler equation impli-

cation is rejected for both the full sample and for the subsample of unconstrained



                                        1
households. These results suggest that the LCPIH does not apply in Japan and that

the presence of borrowing constraints is not the main reason why it does not apply.

    The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we present the theoretical model;

in Section 3, we describe the data and analyze what households are borrowing-

constrained in Japan; in Section 4, we present the results of our Euler equation

tests; and Section 5 concludes.




2     The Model

2.1    Consumption Smoothing

Consumption smoothing behavior is characterized by the Euler equation. We sum-

marize this, making the usual assumptions. An individual holds At of total assets at

the beginning of period t and purchases a total of Nt of assets at (the end of) t. The

individual earns a real wage of w, and spends it on the consumption of goods, c, and

the purchase of assets, N. We do not consider the individual‚Äôs leisure choice, and

assume w is exogenous. The saving constraint faced by the consumer is described as

Nt  At = wt  ct . The asset accumulation constraint is At+1 = Nt (1 + rt+1 ) where

rt+1 is the interest rate at the beginning of period t+1. All individuals face the same

interest rate, live for a Ô¨Ånite lifetime T , and leave no bequests at T +1. Suppose that

the individual‚Äôs utility is stationary and additively separable over time and written
      nP                     o
          T      1
as Et     k=t (1+4)k3t u(ck )  ,where Et is an expectation operator conditional on in-

formation available at t, u is a function that is increasing and concave in ct and 4

is the rate of time preference, which is assumed to be homogeneous over individuals

                                           2
and time. The representative consumer‚Äôs maximization problem can be written as

                                                            1
a dynamic programming problem. Maximizing Vt = u(ct ) + 1+4    Et Vt+1 (At+1 , wt+1 ),
                                                      n                      o
                                                                1+rt+1 Yut+1
we obtain the Ô¨Årst order condition for consumption: Et Yu t
                                                        Yct
                                                                 1+4 Yct+1
                                                                                = 0.

This is the Euler equation, implying consumption at t should be chosen so that the

expected discounted gain of saving now for the future is equal to marginal utility in

this period. Further assume that utility is isoelastic, u(cit ) = c13
                                                                   it /1  , where  is


the risk aversion parameter. Marginal utility is convex and allows for precautionary

saving as a special case. If it is assumed that lnci,t+1 and rt+1 have a joint normal

distribution, the Euler equation becomes


                                                           1
                      Et { ln ci,t+1 =  31 (Et rt+1  4) + / 2i,t .               (1)
                                                           2


In the last term, /2i,t is the conditional variance, which equals the variance of

({ ln ci,t+1  rt+1 /) and partly reÔ¨Çects uncertainty and the precautionary motive

for saving.

   There are at least two ways to test the validity of equation (1). The Ô¨Årst way is

to test a structural form, estimating utility function parameters using Generalized

Method of Moments (nonlinear instrumental variable) estimation. This is a direct

test using the Euler equation, whose error term should be orthogonal to information

before t (see, for example, Runkle (1991)). GMM estimation is beneÔ¨Åcial in the sense

that we can avoid the approximation of linear marginal utility in consumption, the

assumption of distribution, and the assumption of income exogeneity.

   However, many researchers have for a long time used another way to test the


                                            3
Euler equation implication. This is a test of the reduced form Euler equation with

additional variables in past information sets. It tests the validity of this additional

information (for example, income changes) predicted by previous information. Addi-

tional variables should not explain consumption changes if the Euler equation holds.

For example, consumption changes should not react to predicted income changes.

That is, we test whether q = 0 in the equation


                                               1
          { ln ci,t+1 = k1 Ft + k2 {Xi,t+1 + k3 / 2i,t + q{ ln yi,t+1
                                                                 e
                                                                       + 0i,t+1 ,       (2)
                                               2


            e
where { ln yi,t+1 is income predicted by individuals using the information available

to them. This is calculated as predicted values from the Ô¨Årst stage estimation of

{ ln yi,t+1 . Ft is a time-varying variable including  31 (Et rt+1  4). Preference shifts,

described as {Xi,t , could aect the consumption plan at any point in time. The

third term is the conditional variance of the uncertain components. One of our

main focuses is to review past studies using proper data on consumption smoothing.

Thus, we conduct this reduced form exclusion test. Since our data are panel data on

households, we conduct IV estimation controlling for household-speciÔ¨Åc dierences

by applying Ô¨Åxed eects estimation and random eects estimation. The null hy-

pothesis is that the Euler equation holds and that individuals smooth consumption

changes against predicted income changes. That is, q = 0: consumption does not

react to predicted income changes.

   Most past studies drop the conditional variance term, 12 /2i,t , simply assuming

that it is the same across individuals. It is often necessary to make this assumption


                                             4
because information is seldom available on precautionary motives, but Jappelli and

Pistaerri (2000) emphasize the importance of including this term; if we ignore this

                  e
term and if { ln yi,t+1 is related to uncertainty or precautionary saving motives, q

measures not the sensitivity of consumption to income but the eect of uncertainty

on consumption. Jappelli and Pistaferri (2000) regard nominal (observable) income

variance as a proxy for the uncertainty term / 2i,t and include it as one of the

explanatory variables.

   This method could, however, be problematic for the following reasons: First,

income uncertainty is only one of many uncertainties individuals face and is not a

su!cient indicator of general uncertainty. Second, even if uncertainty consists only

of income uncertainty, using actual income uncertainty as a proxy for / 2i,t as well

         e
as { ln yi,t+1 may raise a problem due to the correlation between the two. Thus, we

calculate consumption variances for each household, and conduct an additional test

of the Euler equation implication controlling for this term.



2.2    Violation of Consumption Smoothing

If markets are complete and there exist appropriate securities against any future

state, each household‚Äôs consumption is fully insured against any idiosyncratic shock.

Households can smooth consumption changes completely over expected and unex-

pected income Ô¨Çuctuations, sharing risks with each other. Previous studies have

tested this implication of consumption full insurance and most have rejected it. Al-

though it is important to Ô¨Ånd a situation (if any) where full insurance holds, the

rejection of the implication is not surprising. A more interesting issue is what can

                                         5
and what cannot explain the violation of the implication.

   For example, the existence of borrowing constraints may cause the Euler equa-

tion implication to be rejected. Many studies have, for a long time, inquired into

the existence of borrowing constraints and the dierences in consumption behavior

between borrowing-constrained and unconstrained households. Households should

fail to smooth consumption if they encountered an unexpected shock and could not

borrow to carry out their original plans. Thus, unconstrained households should not

react to income shocks, while constrained households should react strongly. Based

on this analogy, many researchers have tested the Euler equation (e.g., Eq. (2)) and

have interpreted q as the proportion of borrowing-constrained households.

   Once we have rejected the Euler equation implication, we should seek the reason

for it, checking each possible explanation one by one. The following parts focus on

the existence of borrowing constraints, which is the most frequently used explanation

for the violation of the Euler equation implication. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we identify uncon-

strained households using unique information on households‚Äô borrowing constraints

and test the Euler equation implication using this subsample. If the existence of

borrowing constraints is the primary explanation for the violation of the Euler equa-

tion implication, we should Ô¨Ånd evidence of the Euler equation implication for this

sample but not for the full sample. However, if other explanations for the viola-

tion of the Euler equation implication matter, we should not Ô¨Ånd support for this

implication even for the unconstrained sample. We will discuss other possible ex-

planations for the violation of the Euler equation implication later after we have

examined the empirical results for borrowing constraints.

3     The Data

3.1    JPSC Data

This paper uses micro data from the Japanese Panel Survey of Consumers, (here-

after the JPSC) (in Japanese, Shouhi Seikatsu ni kansuru Paneru Chousa), a panel

survey conducted by the Institute for Research on Household Economics (in Japanese,

Kakei Keizai Kenkyuusho). This survey has surveyed young married and unmarried

women (those between the ages of 24 and 34 in 1993) once a year since 1993, and

this paper uses the 1993-2004 waves from this survey. Because JPSC is a panel

survey, we can calculate changes in consumption from year to year, which is pre-

cisely the variable we need to test our theoretical model. We conÔ¨Åne our analysis to

the subsample of married women because most young single Japanese women live

with their parents and rely on their parents‚Äô income but precise information is not

available on their parents‚Äô income and consumption. Note that married women are

asked not only about themselves but also about other household members.

    Borrowing constraints. The Ô¨Årst and most important variable used in our analy-

sis is the one pertaining to borrowing constraints. The JPSC asks three unique

questions about borrowing constraints: (1) Have you (or your spouse) ever had a

loan application turned down? (2) Have you (or your spouse) ever had the loan

amount reduced when you applied for a loan? (3) Have you (or your spouse) ever

decided against applying for a loan because you expected your loan application to be

turned down? Following Jappelli (1990), we refer to households answering "yes" to

these questions as "rejected," "reduced," and "discouraged" borrowers, respectively.


                                         7
Households that replied "yes" to one or more of these questions were regarded as be-

ing borrowing-constrained. Unfortunately, this information is available only in the

1993 wave and the 1998 and later waves1 . Thus, we had no choice but to assume

that borrowing constraints remained unchanged during years for which information

is not available. This is exactly what Jappelli (1990) and Jappelli, Pischke, and

Souleles (1998) assume, even though it may be too strong an assumption. We will

return to this point in the last part of this section.

    Consumption. The JPSC collects data on consumption (living expenses) by all

household members during the month of September. In the regression analysis, we

use the growth rate of monthly consumption. The data on monthly consumption

have at least two advantages: Ô¨Årst, they include all consumption goods and services,

unlike in the case of PSID, which collects data only on food consumption. Thus,

we need not make any assumptions about the separability of consumption. Second,

using the change in consumption between two non-sequential months has the advan-

tage of avoiding, to some extent, potentially serious problems raised by consumption

durability and habit formation2 .

    Income. The JPSC collects data on several measures of income, including annual

    1
      More speciÔ¨Åcally, the wording of the question about borrowing constraints was changed slightly
starting in 2003, and it now asks only about the respondent‚Äôs experience during the previous year.
For 2003 and later, we have created a new variable that indicates whether the respondent was
borrowing constrained at any point in the past.
    2
      The change in monthly consumption could be biased if the household engages in purchases
of big-ticket items such as homes and cars. The JPSC asks about spending on ‚Äòliving expenses‚Äô
during the previous month excluding spending on most big-ticket items. The survey asks separately
about purchases Ô¨Ånanced by loans. Thus, we can exclude the possibility that consumption growth
is overestimated as a result of purchases of big-ticket items. Unfortunately, the JPSC does not ask
for a breakdown of living expenses into durables, non-durables, and services so we cannot be sure
that it excludes durables completely, but for the reason given above, we can be reasonably sure
that it consists mostly of non-durables and services, which is what we want.



                                                 8
(total) income, annual labor income, and monthly labor income. Annual (total)

income and annual labor income are inclusive of taxes so we need to estimate taxes

in order to calculate after-tax income. We use after-tax monthly labor income in

the main Euler equation for at least three reasons: Ô¨Årst, we wanted the period and

timing of consumption and income to match. If we use annual income, there is

a danger of underestimating the degree of consumption smoothing simply because

annual income is more stable than monthly income or consumption. Another reason

for using monthly income is that using annual income would require us to waste the

last year of data since the survey asks about annual income in the previous year.

Finally, the use of monthly labor income helps to reduce the amount of household

heterogeneity because data on monthly labor income are not available for the self-

employed. We sum the monthly labor incomes of all household members and use

the growth rate of total monthly labor income in the regressions.

       Household characteristics. Following the past literature on testing the LCPIH

and the existence of borrowing constraints by estimating an Euler equation, we

include the husband‚Äôs age, the household‚Äôs consumption needs, as proxied by the

number of family members, and year dummies. Although we tried including many

other time-variant and time-invariant variables that might possibly inÔ¨Çuence con-

sumption, particularly that of young Japanese households such as those included in

our sample, all of the variables we tried including had little eect and their inclusion

was not supported statistically3 . Time-invariant variables such as regional dummies

   3
    For example, neither a dummy variable for those who had their Ô¨Årst baby during the current
year, which could make a big dierence in consumption patterns, nor a dummy variable for those
who starting living with their parents during the current year, which is often observed in Japan as


                                                9
are automatically dropped in the case of Ô¨Åxed eects estimation. We estimate ex-

pected income change using income change in the previous year and the husband‚Äôs

educational attainment as instruments and include it in the explanatory variables

for consumption.

   The total number of married women (households) was about 1000 in most years.

In order to estimate the Euler equation, we kept an observation if it contained

enough information for at least a one-year panel. Thus, the sample we used is an

unbalanced panel. We calculated consumption variances using consumption values

for the past four years, and information on borrowing constraints is available for

1993 and for 1998 and later. Thus, data for 1998 to 2004 are used to test the Euler

equation implication. After eliminating observations with missing values for one or

more of the variables included in the regressions, we were left with 1006 households

(4582 household-years) in the full sample and 956 households (4133 household-years)

in the unconstrained sample4 .



3.2     Who Is Constrained?

Before estimating the Euler equation, we summarize the characteristics of borrowing-

constrained households. Table 1 summarizes the borrowing motives of households

that are currently in debt. Although housing and car purchases are the main reasons

for borrowing, a few households do in fact borrow to Ô¨Ånance living expenses. More

the parents get older, changed the results below.
   4
     We did not drop outliers from our sample in the regression results shown in this paper. We
did try re-estimating the regressions after dropping observations whose monthly consumption and
disposable income lie outside of the "mean plus or minus three standard deviations" range, but
the results did not change qualitatively.


                                              10
than half of the sample is currently in debt, which suggests that borrowing plays an

important role in household planning.

   Turning to data on the share of households that are borrowing-constrained, this

Ô¨Ågure was 7.61 percent in 1993, 9.29 percent in 1998, and 15.40 percent in 2003.

Thus, the share of borrowing constrained households was very low in 1993, and

although it increased sharply during the 1990‚Äôs and early 2000‚Äôs, it was still less

than one-sixth in 2003.

   Many past studies have tried to distinguish borrowing-constrained households

from unconstrained households. Since direct data on borrowing constraints are

usually not available, most previous studies have tried to predict who is borrowing-

constrained using a variety of indicators. In our case as well as in the case of Jappelli

(1990), however, direct information is available on whether or not a given household

is borrowing-constrained. Thus, following Jappelli (1990), we analyze what deter-

mines whether a given household is borrowing-constrained by regressing a dummy

variable that equals one if the household is borrowing-constrained and zero other-

wise on various household characteristics using probit estimation. The household

characteristics we use include assets, income, the husband‚Äôs age and educational

attainment, household size, homeownership, debt, city size, and region. We use two

measures of assets: Asset1, which is deÔ¨Åned as holdings of bank and postal deposits,

bonds, and equities, and Asset2, which is deÔ¨Åned as Asset1 plus life and non-life

insurance, land, and housing. Only the results for Asset1 are shown in Table 3, but

the results for Asset2 were qualitatively similar. Debt is deÔ¨Åned as the amount of

outstanding debt. The other variables are described in the previous section.

                                           11
       Table 2 shows the characteristics of borrowing-constrained and unconstrained

households separately. All borrowing-constrained households have lower assets and

husband‚Äôs educational attainment than unconstrained households and all borrowing-

constrained households with the exception of "reduced" households have lower in-

comes and husband‚Äôs employment rate than unconstrained households. "Discour-

aged" borrowers have similar characteristics to "denied" and "reduced" households.

This Ô¨Ånding underscores the importance of dierentiating "discouraged" households

from those completely free from borrowing constraints and grouping them together

with borrowing-constrained households.

       Who is borrowing-constrained? Table 3 shows the estimation results of our pro-

bit analysis of who is borrowing-constrained for 1993, 1998, and 2003. Household

assets and income are two variables of interest since many past studies have used

the ratio of assets to income as an indicator of whether or not a given household

is borrowing-constrained, and as Table 3 shows, the marginal eects of the income-

related variables are statistically signiÔ¨Åcant in only one of the 3 years (1998), but

the marginal eects of Asset and/or Asset-squared are statistically signiÔ¨Åcant in all

3 years, with the overall impact of assets being consistently negative, as can be seen

from the partial eects on the last line of Table 35 . However, we found that the

husband‚Äôs educational attainment also has a statistically signiÔ¨Åcant impact on the

probability of being borrowing-constrained in the case of Japan, with college grad-

come, and the cross-product of Asset and HusAge, respectively. *(¬∑) is the standard normal density
function, and X is the linear prediction evaluated at the means.

uates being signiÔ¨Åcantly less likely to be borrowing constrained than less educated

households. The results are unchanged even if we utilize the panel structure of the

data and do, say, a random eects logit estimation using 1993 and 1998-2004 data.

Jappelli (1990) found using U. S. data that income and assets have a signiÔ¨Åcant

impact on the probability of being borrowing constrained but that the husband‚Äôs

educational attainment does not, so our results for income and husband‚Äôs educational

attainment are dierent from those for the United States. Educational attainment

could be an indicator of current as well as future income, and a household in which

the educational attainment of the husband (usually the household head and main

income earner) is relatively low might be regarded as having insu!cient ability to

repay loans.

       Finally, we also tried including a number of other explanatory variables, but

their coe!cients were never signiÔ¨Åcant6 .

       We turn now to a check of the accuracy of indicators used by previous studies

to identify borrowing-contrained and unconstrained households. Following previous

studies, we group the sample into ‚Äôhypothetically‚Äô borrowing-constrained and un-

constrained households using various indicators and then compare these households

to ‚Äôactually‚Äô borrowing-constrained and unconstrained households. The results are

shown in Table 4.

       The Ô¨Årst three indicators, which were originally proposed by Zeldes (1989), are

   6
     The self-employed may need to borrow and may face borrowing constraints more frequently
than others. Also, employment conditions such as tenure and Ô¨Årm size often aect household
decisions in Japan. Thus, we conducted the estimation including variables relating to the husband‚Äôs
self-employement, tenure, and Ô¨Årm size, but none of their coe!cients were signiÔ¨Åcant.




                                                13
the most frequently used indicators in many countries and are constructed by taking

the ratio of asset holdings to income. Since households who have adequate amounts

of assets relative to income can dissave their assets when necessary and protect

their consumption against unexpected income shocks, households with a high asset-

income ratio are regarded as being unconstrained. The Ô¨Årst indicator is whether or

not the household‚Äôs holdings of Ô¨Ånancial assets are more than twice as much as their

monthly income, and the second one is whether or not the household‚Äôs holdings of

total assets (Ô¨Ånancial assets plus housing equity) are more than twice their monthly

income. The third indicator classiÔ¨Åes households with no Ô¨Ånancial assets as being

borrowing-constrained and households whose holdings of Ô¨Ånancial assets are more

than twice their monthly income as being unconstrained.

   The fourth indicator is whether or not the household owns one or more credit

cards. If it owns one ore more credit cards, it can Ô¨Ånance its consumption even

when it experiences an unexpected income decline. This indicator is close to the

one suggested by Shintani (1994), who classiÔ¨Åes households as being unconstrained

if they own one or more credit cards or one or more cards with a free-loan feature

because they need to pass a credit check in order to receive one or both kinds

of cards. The Ô¨Åfth indicator, proposed by Hayashi (1985b), classiÔ¨Åes households

as unconstrained if they consume less than 85 percent of their annual disposable

income (minus all debt outstanding plus 20 percent of their Ô¨Ånancial assets).

   Finally, since we found from Table 3 that educational attainment is a signiÔ¨Åcant

indicator of being unconstrained, we propose a new indicator that identiÔ¨Åes college

graduates as being unconstrained. In addition, we construct another new indicator

                                        14
that is the same as the Ô¨Årst indicator suggested by Zeldes (1989) except that Ô¨Ånancial

assets are replaced by a broader concept of assets‚Äînamely, bank and postal deposits,

bonds, equities, life and non-life insurance, land, and housing.

    Table 4 shows the results. The predicted-unconstrained/actually-unconstrained

and predicted-constrained/actually-constrained cells indicate the proportion of house-

holds identiÔ¨Åed properly. The results are summarized in Table 5. As expected, the

husband‚Äôs educational attainment identiÔ¨Åes unconstrained households well, as does

Hayashi‚Äôs indicator (his consumption-income ratio). By contrast, Zeldes‚Äôs asset-

income ratio is better at identifying borrowing-constrained households, but even so,

about 50% are misclassiÔ¨Åed. This Ô¨Ånding is similar to Jappelli‚Äôs (1990) Ô¨Ånding for

U.S. households that using the asset-income ratio leads to serious misclassiÔ¨Åcation of

constrained and unconstrained households, and moreover, misclassiÔ¨Åcation is even

more serious in the case of Japanese households.

    Thus, we should identify unconstrained households using information on educa-

tional attainment or the consumption-income ratio, but we should identify borrowing

constrained households using Zeldes‚Äôs asset-income ratio despite its limitations.




4     The Results

4.1    Euler Equation Test

In this section, we present the results of our Euler equation tests, but we Ô¨Årst present

the descriptive statistics for the sample used in the estimation in Table 6.

    Parts (a) and (b) of Table 7 are the results of IV estimations controlling for in-

                                          15
dividual eects using a Ô¨Åxed eects model and a random eects model, respectively

(see Appendix (1) for the Ô¨Årst stage regression results). Although the Wu-Hausman

test shows that individual eects in the error terms are not correlated with the ex-

planatory variables so that the random eects model is good enough to be estimated,

the Ô¨Åxed eects model estimator is still consistent (but ine!cient) and may still be

preferred if unobserved time-invariant individual eects relating to the household‚Äôs

consumption and income changes are omitted from the equation. The coe!cient of

expected income is about 0.094 and 0.093 in the Ô¨Åxed eects and random eects

models, respectively. Both coe!cients are signiÔ¨Åcant at the 1 percent signiÔ¨Åcance

level. Thus, we strongly reject the applicability of the Euler equation implication.

   When we control for conditional variances additionally, the coe!cients of ex-

pected income changes are still 0.097 and 0.092, respectively, in the Ô¨Åxed eects

model and the random eects model, and both are signiÔ¨Åcant at at least the 5%

signiÔ¨Åcance level. Thus, we again reject the Euler equation implication.

   The coe!cient of expected income changes in (a) might be upward biased because

the process of taking the dierence from the mean (within-estimator) to remove Ô¨Åxed

eects makes income changes "transitory or surprising" rather than "expected or

permanent" whereas we want to see the reaction of consumption to the latter. A

larger coe!cient in the Ô¨Åxed eects model relative to the random eects model may

reÔ¨Çect this possibility.

   A coe!cient of 0.09 or higher is roughly consistent with the values suggested

by previous studies for many countries. According to the previous literature, about

9% of all households are rule-of-thumb consumers. However, we will show soon that

                                         16
comparing coe!cients in this way is not meaningful. Although there is variation

in the magnitude of the coe!cients, the test implications are the same: the Euler

equation implication is rejected. Households do not smooth consumption changes

over even expected income changes.



4.2       Do Borrowing Constraints Matter?

Most of the past literature attributes the violation of the Euler equation implication

to the existence of borrowing constraints. Using this analogy, the coe!cient of

expected income changes, such as the 0.09 value shown in Table 7, is sometimes

interpreted as the share of constrained households. The 0.09 value is consistent

with our earlier Ô¨Ånding that 8 to 15 percent of our sample is actually constrained.

      If the existence of borrowing constraints is the reason for the violation of the Euler

equation implication, we would expect to Ô¨Ånd that the Euler equation implication is

applicable or close to applicable in the sample of unconstrained households. Table

8 shows the results for the sample of unconstrained households, and as this table

shows, the coe!cient of expected income changes stays at about the same magnitude

and signiÔ¨Åcance level. The dierence in the coe!cients of expected income changes

between the full and unconstrained samples is quite small and not signiÔ¨Åcant at a 1

percent signiÔ¨Åcance level (see the bottom row of Table 8). Thus, the Euler equation

does not hold even for unconstrained households, which suggests that the existence

of borrowing constraints is not the reason for the violation of the Euler equation

implication7 .

  7
      Ideally, we would have liked to estimate the Euler equation for the sample of borrowing con-

                                                17
    Many past studies that identify unconstrained households using the level of the

asset-income ratio make the conclusions even more ambiguous. In the previous sec-

tion, we found that splitting the sample by the asset-income ratio itself is question-

able, especially when we are interested in the behavior of unconstrained households.

In addition to this problem, the sensitivity of consumption to expected income

changes as measured by the above type of Euler equation does not show what pro-

portion of households are borrowing-constrained. Nonetheless, the results obtained

in this paper suggest that the existence of borrowing constraints is not the primary

cause of the violation of Euler equation implication.



4.3     Other Possible Explanations

If borrowing constraints are not the explanation, what is the explanation for the

violation of the Euler equation implication? First of all, the existence of future

constraints may aect the results. Our deÔ¨Ånition of constrained households does

not include the possibility of future constraints. As Hayashi (1997) emphasizes,

the current consumption of households that predict that they will face borrowing

constraints in the future will be sensitive to income changes. Unfortunately, we

cannot identify households who expect to be constrained in the future from among

currently unconstrained households.

    Other data problems are also possible explanations of the rejection of the Euler

strained households also in order to see if the implication of the Euler equation was violated more
strongly for this sample, as expected, but unfortunately, we were not able to do so because the sam-
ple of borrowing constrained households was too small. Wakabayashi and Horioka (2005) test the
implication of the Euler equation for the full sample and for the sample of borrowing-constrained
households and Ô¨Ånd that it holds for the full sample but not for the sample of borrowing-constrained
households.

                                                18
equation implication. If we did not have data on total consumption but only on con-

sumption of a certain good, we would need to assume separability between goods. If

we could not obtain the appropriate micro data to test the Euler equation implica-

tion, we would have to assume that aggregation were possible. If we could not Ô¨Ånd

valid instruments in the limited information set, the stochastic structure of income

would be misspeciÔ¨Åed. The last problem is related to informational constraints on

households. However, these problems are not so serious in the present analysis.

Our consumption data is total consumption expenditure, and moreover, our data

set contains data on a large number and variety of household attributes, making it

easier to Ô¨Ånd appropriate instruments.

      The existence of consumption durability is another possible explanation of the re-

jection of the Euler equation implication. If a commodity is durable and expenditure

on that commodity is increased in the current period, expenditure will be depressed

in the next period even though the household is still enjoying the consumption ser-

vices from that commodity. Households can derive beneÔ¨Åts from consuming now

rather than later, thereby showing excess sensitivity of consumption8 . In this case,

the error term in Eq. (2) will contain the eects of past consumption and will be

correlated with the explanatory variables (Mankiw (1982), Hayashi (1985b, 1999)).

However, this problem is less serious in our case partly because our consumption

measure consists primarily of non-durables and services and partly because the sur-

vey we use measures consumption in two 1-month time periods 1 year apart).

  8
    Habit formation is another example of nonseparable consumption over time. In this case,
consumption must increase over time and households try to save now for future consumption,
showing excess smoothness of consumption.


                                            19
    The existence of precautionary saving or dierences in households‚Äô level of uncer-

tainty is another possible explanation of the violation of the Euler equation impli-

cation. Our basic estimation model excludes this possibility by assuming that time

and individual Ô¨Åxed eects can control for it, which may be too strong an assump-

tion. The JPSC does not have information on overall uncertainty, and although we

estimate the implication including consumption variances, this may not be enough

to control for household‚Äôs risk-related behavior.

    Finally, the misspeciÔ¨Åcation of the theoretical assumption that consumption and

leisure are separable is another possible explanation for the violation of the Euler

equation implication. Unless this assumption is imposed, we cannot derive our Euler

equation test, which presupposes that the consumption decision is made indepen-

dently of the leisure decision. The JPSC contains information on individual‚Äôs time

allocation, but it is inappropriate to examine the Euler equation implication us-

ing leisure time in the above type of income-added-test since changes in leisure are

probably correlated with changes in income.

    Thus, the possibility of precautionary behavior in the face of uncertainty and

that of inseparability between consumption and leisure remain as topics for future

research.




5     Conclusion

In this paper, we used micro data on young married households from the Japanese

Panel Survey of Consumers, conducted by the Institute of Research on Household


                                          20
Economics, to shed light on (1) the prevalence of borrowing constraints in Japan,

(2) what households are borrowing-constrained in Japan, (3) whether the life cy-

cle/permanent income hypothesis (LCPIH) holds in Japan, and (4) whether the

presence of borrowing constraints is the reason why the LCPIH does not hold in

Japan. To summarize our main Ô¨Åndings, we found (1) that 8-15 percent of young

married Japanese households are borrowing-constrained, (2) that household assets

and the husband‚Äôs educational attainment are the most important determinants

of whether or not a household is borrowing-constrained, and (3) that the Euler

equation implication is rejected for both the full sample and for the subsample of

unconstrained households. These results suggest that the LCPIH does not apply in

Japan and that the presence of borrowing constraints is not the main reason why it

does not apply.

   We turn Ô¨Ånally to the implications of our Ô¨Åndings for the causes of the prolonged

slowdown of the Japanese economy in the 1990s (the so-called "lost decade"). Many

studies have found that the prolonged slowdown exacerbated the borrowing con-

straints of Ô¨Årms, which in turn caused them to cut back on their investment, hiring,

and R&D (see, for example, Ogawa (2003), but the impact of the slowdown on house-

holds via borrowing constraints does not appear to have been as pronounced. We

did Ô¨Ånd that there was a sharp increase in the proportion of borrowing-constrained

households during the 1990s, but even after the increase, the proportion of borrow-

ing constrained households was less than one-sixth, and moreover, our estimation

results imply that the consumption behavior of borrowing constrained household

is not fundamentally any dierent from the consumption behavior of unconstrained

                                        21
households. Thus, it does not appear that the exacerbation of borrowing constraints

on households was an important determinant of the stagnation of household con-

sumption during the prolonged slowdown (see Horioka (2006) for a discussion of

what were the main causes of the stagnation of household consumption during this

period), and moreover, Horioka (2006) Ô¨Ånds that the stagnation of household con-

sumption contributed far less to the prolonged slowdown than the stagnation of

private Ô¨Åxed investment.

     2. "Constrained" households include 'rejected, 'reduced' and 'discouraged' households. Since some households experienced
        two or more of the three events, the totals sum to more than 100%.
     3. HusAge, HusCollege and HusEmployed denote the husband's age, college graduation, and employment status, respectively.
     4. NumFamily denotes the number of family (household) members.
     5. Asset denotes the household's total holdings of bank and postal deposits, bonds, and equities (in units of millions of yen). Debt is the
        household's total liabilities outstanding including housing and other loans (in units of millions of yen).
     6. Income is the annual disposable income of all household members (in units of millions of yen).
     7. Consumption is monthly expenditure (in units of 1,000 yen).

Notes
1. The marginal effects evaluated at the means are shown.
2. For the definitions of the variables, see the text and the notes to Table 2.
3. AreaScale_med and AreaScale_small are dummy variables indicating that the household
  lives in medium-sized and small-sized cities, respectively, rather than in a metropolitan
  area. Metropolitan areas denote the thirteen ordinance-designated cities.
4. The equation also includes seven regional dummies.
5. We obtain similar results when we replace Asset with broader definitions of assets such as the sum of the
   paid-in value of life and non-life insurance and the value of land and housing in addition to total holdings of
   bank and postal deposits, bonds, and equities.
6. * indicates significant at the 10% level, ** indicates significant at the 5% level, and *** indicates significant at the 1%
level.

     Notes
     1. For the first stage estimations to calculate expected income change, see Appendix Table 1.
     2. The squares of ƒ±u and ƒ±v are variances of ui and vit, where the error terms are written as eit=ui+vit.
     3. Wu-Hausman test statistics suggest that individual effects are not correlated with the explanatory variables
        and that the random effect model is good enough to be estimated. However, the results of the fixed effects model are
        reported as well since they are consistent (but not efficient) even in this case.
     4. The fixed effect model here takes a difference from the mean of time for each individual and adds the mean
        of the total number of observations (both over individuals and time). Since the last term is backed into a
        "usual" mean difference, a constant remains in the estimation.
     5. Time and area dummies are included in all equations.
