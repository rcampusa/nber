                                                               ABSTRACT



            Using    two unifying        models      and an empirical          exercise,     this paper presents and extends           the

main theories        linking      income       distribution     and growth,      as well as the relevant       empirical       evidence.

The first model           integrates    the political      economy       and imperfect       capital markets theories.          It allows

for explicit    departures from perfect democracy                      and embodies     the tradeoff    between       the growth costs

and benefits         of    redistribution        through      taxes,     land reform        or public    schooling:     such     policies

simultaneously            depress    savings      incentives     and ameliorate         the wealth      constraints     which    impede

investment      by the poor.           The second       model      is a growth     version     of the prisoner’s      dilemma      which

captures the essence           of theories where sociopolitical             conflict    reduces the security of property          rights,

thereby     discouraging          accumulation.         The economy’s            growth      rate is shown     to fall with interest

groups’      rent-seeking         abilities,    as well as with the gap between                rich and poor.         It is not income

inequality     per se that matters, however,                  but inequality     in the relative      distribution    of earnings     and

political    power.        For each of the three channels                of political      economy,     capital markets     and social

conflict,    the empirical          evidence       is surveyed         and discussed        in conjunction     with the theoretical

analysis.      Finally,      the possibility       of multiple         steady-states    leads me to raise and take up a new

empirical      issue:      are cross-country         differences        in inequality      permanent,     or gradually     narrowing?

Equivalently,        is there convergence           not only in first moments              (GDP per capita),    but convergence            in

distribution?

1.1        Korea      and the Philippines,                         circa 1960:                  Not So Similar After                     All

To introduw          the theme           of this paper            I shall revisit the puzzle                   raised by Lucas             (1993)     at the

beginning       of his article.         In the early 1960’s,                 South Korea and the Philippines                         were similar with
respect     to all major           -nomic          aggregates:           GDP           per capita,        population,        urbanization,          primary
and secondary             school     enrollment.            The       Philippines           had a somewhat               higher      share of GDP           in
manufacturing,            but in exports           both muntries              had the same proportions                    of primary        commodities
and manufactures,                  Given       nearly     identical      starting           points,      how can it be that                over the next

quarter     antury         Korea      experienced           “miraculous”                growth        averaging      about   6% per annum,             while
the Philippines           stagnated        at about        2%?

      If one looks beyond             first moments,             however,          initial conditions          were in fact quite different.               As
shown by Table 1, the distribution                        of income was considerably                       more unequal             in the Philippines:

      The Philippines’          Lorentz curve lay everywhere                            below that of Korea. ] The Gini coefficient                      was
seventeen       percentage          points      higher,       about      1.8 standard              deviations        in the world distribution              of

Ginis, or 2.5 among                East-Asian           countries.       Most strikingly,               the ratio of the income              share of the
top 2070 to the bottom               20Y0, or even to the bottom                       40% was about tloice m la~e in the Philippines,
Similar disparities          characterized              land ownership:                 the Gini coefficient           for farmland          was 38.7 for
Korea and 53.4 for the Philippines                        in 1961 and 1960 respectively. 2 This greater concentration                                       of

income      and wealth, which persists to this day, cannot                                      be blamed     on the “kleptocratic”                nature of
the Marms         regime.       Ferdinand           Marcos        was first elected               president       in 1965, and declared              a state


    1The year     1965 is the earliest         one for which data         for      both countries are available. Moreover, these figures were
based on the same survey method                (gross    household     income),         making     them comparable.       The 1988 Philippine         number
is for gross personal      income,     but very close to the 1985 figure which still [lsed household                         income.
    ‘The sourm for land Ginis is Taylor and Hudson (1972). The twelvepoint gap corrwponds to about one
standard deviation. While it is common knowledge that Korea implemented a land reform following World War
II, it may be worth mentioning that the Philippin- al= had ib own around the end of World War I, during
the American      occupation        period.     Following      the di=tablishernent               of the Catholic     Church,    a large part      of its land
holdings   were purch~ed           and redistributed.         The relatively           high land Gini for 1960 suggests          that either     land reform
was not as egalitarian         as in Korea,       where     individual       holdings       were limited     to 3 hectarm,       or that    land ownership
became     r~ncentrated         during        the following      forty years



                                                                                   1
of emergency         ordy in 1972. Preceding                  him in power at the end of the US–assisted                       ranstruction

period      were two presidents                 whose      main policies        are described       in the US State            Department’s
background         notis as seeking to “expand                  Philippine     ties to its Asian neighbors,             implement       domestic
reform programs,            and develop          and diversify        the economy”.
      Of couw         Table     1 does not mnstitute                 proof     that greater      initial       equality     was the reason –
cert airily not the sole reason–                  why the “miracle”              omurred       in one country             and not the other.
But the facts which it documents                        do suggest that the answer to the puzzle may lie outside                               the
represent ative agent framework.


1.2        Empirical           %gularit          ies

South Korea and the other Eas-Asian                            “dragons”       are usually contrasted            not to the nearby Philip-
pines, but to Latin American                     countries.       It has long been part of development                      economists’       con-
ventional       wisdom       that the very equal distribution                   of income       and land in the first group played
a significant       role in their take-off,                whereas    the high levels of wealth concentration                      in the later
were a serious impediment                  to growth.           In recent years the literature             has moved          from anecdotal
to formal empirical            evidence,        impulsed       by the findings of Alesina and Rodrik                      (1994) ancl Persson
and Tabellini        (1994) of a negative               effect of inequality       in cross-country            growth     regressions      and by

Perotti’s       (1992),    (1994),      (1996) methodical            testing of the main theories.
      Table 2 summarizes                the main results from twent y–three                    recent studies of the links from in-
equality to growth or investment.                    I shall refer to it throughout             the paper.        Column      (1) mrresponds
to the basic, reduced form regression,                       where the average growth rate of per capita GDP over some

long period         (twenty     years or so) is regressed                on initial inequality           and several controls.              These
typically       include:     (a) initial inmme,              whose coefficient      is always negative            and significant;         (b) the
initial stock of human capital,                  or proxies in the form of initial school enrollment                         ratios; as shown
by mlumn          (8) this effect is systematically                  positive;3     (c) regional       dummies.           These    regressions,
run over a variety of data sets and periods                          with many different           measures of income             distribution,
deliver a mnsistent            message:         initial inequality      is detrimental         to long–run        growth,     The magnitude
of this effect is mnsistent               across most studies:               a one standard        deviation        decrease      in inequality

raises the annual growth                 rate of GDP           per capita by .5 to .8 percentage                  points.    Whether       this is

large or small may be in the eye of the beholder.                               On one hand it amounts               to between         30% and
45% of the standard             deviation         of growth rates found in most samples.                        It also implies an income
gap of about         25% after 30 years,                   which is far from inconsequential,                   On the other        hand,     this

do=    not mme            close to accounting              for the growth       differential     observed        between      the Philippines
and Korea,        or East Asia and Latin America.                       However,      several models           in the literature      predict        a
non–linear        effect, possibly        leading to a multiplicity             of equilibria.      In that case small differences                in


   awith    the ~xcePtion      of the puzz]ing      result    that when male and female stock         are distinguished,      the latter   aPPears
to eontribute     negatively    (e.g.   Barro    (1996),     who also rliseusses   possible   explanations).




                                                                           2
 initial inequality       can have marginal               effects well in excess of the average slope estimated                        by linear
 regressions,      and significantly          influen~       long–inn        outcomes.
       The inclusion       of mntrols         (b) and especially            (c) typically     redums      the coefficient        on inequality,
 Sometimes         it becomes       insignificant,        as in Benhabib          and Spiegel (1993) when the stock of human

 capital    is included,        or in Deininger           and Squire          (1995b)     when dummies          for Latin America             and
 sub-Saharan          Africa    are added.          In most other studies inequality                  remains       si~ificant      even in the

 presenm      of these controls,          In any case, enrollments                in and stocks of secondary               education     have a
 substantial       negative     correlation        with inequality,           and in some of the theories              discussed     below       the
link between          income distribution            and growth arises precisely               through      human capital           investment.
Note finally that a large part of the cross-country                          variation in inequality         comes from the high levels
observed       in Africa       and, particularly,           Latin America.             These persistent       inter–regional         differences

need to be explained,               and in fact point             in the direction         of the models        with multiple         long–run
distributions       mentioned        above,


 1.3       Overview

This paper presents             and extends           the main theories            linking    income      distribution       and growth,          as
well the evidence          on their relevance.                  This is done       through      two unifying          models,      a survey       of
the empirical         literature,     and an econometric                   exercise.     The first model        integrates        the political

mnomy         and imperfect          capital       markets       theories.      The second      one deals with social conflict                and
the security of property            rights. The empirical                 section asks whether countries             are converging       to the
same level of inequality.            The paper focuses primarily                   on how the distribution             of income      (whether
exogenous         or endogenous)        can affect output            growth,      rather than on reverse effects from the level
of development          to inequality,        It thus barely touches on the Kuznets                       (1955) hypothesis.4
       I start in Section         2 with theories         where asset markets are complete                    and distributional         effects

arise solely through            the balance          of power       in the political         system      (Bertola     (1993),      Alesina   and
Rodrik      (1994),     Persson      and Tabellini          (1994)).         The idea is that by lowering                 the income     of the

median voter or pivotal middle class relative to the national                                 average, greater inequality             increases
the pressure        for rdstribution.               This,       in turn,     discourages      investment.           The    model     developed

here, which combines              features of Persson and Tabellini                    (1994) and B6nabou           (1995a),      displays this
mechanism         but also formalizes             departures       from the one person,           one vote, ideal.          Whether      or not
there is a role for productive                public      investment,         ~owth      in this class of models           always increases

with the degree of pr~wealth                     bias in the political           system.      I also provide        new results,      together
wit h a general aveat,            on the issue of whether inequality                    affects democracies         and non–democracies

differentially,       Compared        to a perfect          democracy,         income      disparities     are shown to have a lesser

impact     on redistribution          and growth only in right–wing                     or wealth–biased        regimes,         and a greater
impact     in left–wing        or populist        ones.


   4 See Fields    and Jakuhson      (1994)      for a recent    review    of this issue w well as some new evicleuce,           which do=    not
support    the Kuzneb     curve    hypothesis.
    In S~tion         3 I turn to another            set of theories,        where the distribution              of wealth has macroeco-
nomic      implications       due to imperfections              in asset markets,           I use the very same model                   as before
but simply        “turn off”      the loan market.          Indeed, the main idea in this literature                       which starts with
Loury (1981) is that credit constraints                    prevent the poor from undertaking                       the efficient amount of
investment.       With decreasing            returns their marginal product                     is higher, so that redistributions              can

increase total output            or growth.         My model embodies             the tradeoff         between         these growth benefits
of land reform,         public     schooling        or other progressive              transfers,     and their traditional             costs due

to depressed         incentives    for savings or labor supply.                   The other central              issue in the literature          is
intergenerational          mobility,      for which uninsurable             shocks are of the essence.                 Some papers focus on
the decentralized           equilibrium       (Galor      and Z.ira         (1993),     Banerjee      and Newman            (1993),     B6nabou
(1996a),     Aghion       and Bolton        (1996),     Piketty     (1996)),     while others combine              market incompleteness
with the politics          of redistribution           (Perott i (1993),        Saint-Paul         and Verdier          (1993),    Verdier     and
Ades    (1993),      Saint-Paul         (1994),     B6nabou       (1995a)).       In a related        class of models            the macroeco-
nomic effects of distribution              arise from, or are magnified                 by, the enciogenous            sorting of agents into
homogeneous          immunities           or other “clubs”          (B6nabou          (1993),    (1996b),      Durlauf      (1996a),      (1996b),
Fernandez       and Rogerson            (1996),    (1994), Maskin and Kremer                    (1994)).     The results obtained           in this

paper     are representative            of this entire set, and include                a number        of new propositions             as well.       I
explain for instance why maximizing                      growth requi i-es some (interior)                  degTee of democracy             in con-
trast to the complete            markets case. I also demonstrate                     how the mmbination                of credit constraints
and a less than perfectly                democratic       political     system        can lead to multiple              long–run       equilibria,
differing     both    in growth         rates and levels of inequality.                  I then use this example                 to explain     the
common        principle     by which multiple            steady–st at e distributions              arise, through         a variety of general
equilibrium       feedbacks,      in several of the models              mentioned         above,

    Section      4 turns to theories              based on the idea that sociopolitical                     conflict    reduces the security
of property       rights, thereby         discouraging          accumulation.          In particular,        when the gap between              rich
and poor       widens      the latter presumably                have a greater temptation                   to engage      in rent-seeking        or
predatory      activities      at the expense           of the former.          The security          of property         rights is the main

focus of the models            of Grossman            (1991),     (1994),     Acemoglu          (1995),     Tornell     and Velaco          (1992),

Tornell (1994), Grossman                 and Kim (1996) and Benhabib                    and Rustichini          (1996).     Only the lmt two
papers,     however,       explicitly      link inequality         and growth.          I propose          here a simple      gTowth version
of the prisoner’s          dilemma        which captures           the essence         of this class of models.               The economy’s
maximum         sustainable       growth          rate is shown       to be negatively             related     to interest        groups’     rent–
seeking abilities,        as well as to in~me            disparities        between      them.      It may then be profitable               for the
rich to collectively         transfer wealth to the poor through                      land reform, eclucat ion subsidies,                 or trade
protection.       More generally,          the analysis reveals that what really matters is not income                                 inequality
per se, but inequality            in the relative          distribution        of earning         and political         power.     I also point
out that actual           instability     or uncertainty          is not part of the story                 told by most          models     in this

CIWS, mntrary         to common           interpretation,         As in the case of taxation,                 growth is reduced           through



                                                                        4
a decline in the expected                return on investment,                 due to a higher threat of expropriation.
        Finally,   the possibility         of multiple             long–run     distributions        and history~ependenm                      discussed
earlier leads me to raise in Section 5 an empirical                            question      which has not been taken up previously:
are count riea converging                 to the same level of inequality,                         or are there        permanent           differences?
Equivalently,           is there convergence              not only in the first moments                   of their income           distributions              -
GDP per capita– but also in the second one (and higher),                                     as would be predicted               by most versions
of the neoclassical            model      once      it is enriched            with uninsurable            idiosyncratic          shocks?         Using         a

new data set put together                     by Deininger            and Squire (1995a)            I make a fist            pass at this issue of
convergence            in distribution.        Although            it is insufficient    to resolve the issue this exercise                     uncovers

some interesting            puzzles,     including         some evidence           of mean–reversion            in Ginis.5
        The general strategy           adopted          in this paper is one of simplification                 and unification.            The models
are thus stripped           of many elements               which contribute           to the richness and realism of the literature,
but are not essential to conveying                        the main ideas.           These are briefly discussd                   in the concluding
section,     before turning to directions                   for further research.           All proofs are gathered               in the appendix.



2        Political           Economy                    with Complete                      Markets

The model          to be developed             here and in the next section                   will bring together              the political          econ-
omy and imperfect              capital     markets theories.                 There is a mntinuurn             of non–altruistic            overlapping

generations        families, indexed            by z E [0, 1]. The utility of a member                        i in generation          t is


                                                                                                                                                             (1)


where ~ and d; denote consumption                           when young and old respectively.                   This person is born endowed
with resources            W;, distributed         independently              across agents with mean wt = E[wj].                            Agents       can

invest in human or physical                   capital according              to the technolo~


                                                                                                                                                             (2)


where r is mnstant                 and O < ~ S 1; k; is the amount                        invested      and y: is second-period                  pretax

income.       Note that individuals              face decreasing             returns but the aggregate             technolo~           is linear.       One
can interpret           w: as agent i’s basic level of skill or human                              capital,    which can be supplemented
through        investment.          The higher the general level of basic                           skills, the easier it is to develop                      or
acquire new knowledge.                 I shall focus for a while on what happens                              within a given generation,                      in
which case time subscripts                 can be omitted.


    5The paucity and sometim= poor quality of international                        data on income       distribution    remain    binding constraints
here,    as in all empirical       work on the          isues;     see Deininger   and Scluire (1995a)         and Perotti     (1 W)       for discussions
of data     quality.     Another    general    problem           is the lack of almost    any data      on the distribution        of wealth         (land     is
sometimes       used as an imperfect          proxy),      even     though   in mmt     theories    it is this distribution       rather      than   that     of
income     which   is determinant.




                                                                               5
2.1          Savings and Intragenerational                                 Growth

There is a frictionless             credit market where agents in each generation                                borrow from and lend to each
other,       at some endogenoua              inter~t         rate ?. The amount borrowed                       by i is denoted           bi ~ O. Finally,
there is a government                who redistributes               smnd-period              income.        I depart     here from the standard

everyone         has the same second-period                        income,      so no actual transfers                take place         in equilibrium.
The critical feature of redistribution                        under complete            markets is the tltmat of expropriation                           of part

2.2        Intergenerational                 Linkages

To extend this result to long–inn                    growth rates it remains to specify the dynamic                            linkages between
generations.         The simplest           kind is an aggregate                  spillover     (as in Persson        and Tabellini        (1994))
through      which the productivity                 achieved by generation              t becomes      embodied        into the basic human
capital endowment              of generation         t+ 1:


                                                                                                                                                  (8)


where ~~ is an i.i.d.            shock with mean normalized                        to 1, representing           for instance     innate    ability.

Equivalently,        let altruistic         parents     devote       some of their second-period                    resources       to children’s
education       (say, primary           schooling),     which is provided               as a public      good.      Specifically,     let parents
care about        old age consumption,                now denoted           d:, and about           the human         capital    endowment         of
their child:
                                           U; = ln~          + ~lnc~        + P(1 – 7) Et[ln w~+l].                                              (1’)

The latter is a combination                 of ability and public expenditures                     on schooling,


                                                                Wj+l = K.Ej+l et ,                                                               (8’)


with the latter financed                through      a proportional          tax on second-period                income.     With logarithmic
preferenms        the unanimously                preferred     tax rate is 1 – T, so that ~                 = Tdi and et = (1 – ~) [it =
(1 – ~) y,. Nothing             else in parents’             behavior     or maximized            utility      is affected.a      Thus    w~+l =

K.(1 – T) c~+l yt , and normalizing                   the mnstant           to one yielck the same result as (8), namely                         that
the intra– and intergenerational                    g-rowth rates are equal:


                             gt = ln(yt/yt-1)         = ln(wt+]/wt)             = ln(yt/wt)      = lnr + olns(~t)                                 (9)


where ~t is the tax rate chosen                      in generation         t. Moreover,          the distribution          of relative    incomes

w~/wt       = e; is stationary,           which       will result in a timeinvariant                   equilibrium         tax rate.      In what
follows I shall therefore             omit time subscripts              once again.

a similar    speci6cation.      The     former    uses overlapping       generations     with    a “waru-glow’’bequ=t,           as I do here;    the

2.3           Inequality          and Redistribution

I now examine               the determination              of taxes within each generation.                          Agent i ‘s optimal         investment
entails a net borrowing                  of
                                                                  b; = A(W                - w’)                                                            (lo)


at the interest rate
                                                       F = Tp(l –T)p(l              +pp(l       –T))l-~.

Redistribution              through     what is es=ntially               a tax on capital income lowers this equilibrium                              return,
thereby         favoring      borrowers          and hurting lenders.                  It leaves unaffected              the “representative”            agent
wit h resources             equal to the per capita                average w, as he does not make use of the loan market.

Given         optimal       borrowing         and investment             decisions,         the intertemporal                utility    of individual          z is
equal to:

                            Ui(T) = V(T) +(1+                  p)ln [1 + (w’/w             - 1)(1 + p~(l             – T))/(1     + p)]                    (11)

where
                              V(T) ~ (1 +p)lnw                 +ln(l      –5(T))        +pln(r5(T)D)             = lnc+plnd,                               (12)

with c and d representing                      aggregate        consumption             in the first and second                 periods,      For an agent
with the average endowment                         w the second              term in (11) vanishes.                  His preferences          thus coincide
with those of a social planner mncerned                                only with intertempoml                    eficiency,       in the sense of being

indifferent           to the distribution              of mnsumption            across individuals,              Since


                                                                                                                                                           (13)



the preferred tax rate of this representative                            individual         or social planner is zero. g Individuals                   poorer
than average would like (progressive)                            taxes on capital:              it is easily seen that for all Wi < w, ~;(~)

                                                                         T(l + p)
                                                                                                                                                           (14)

This implies that agent Z’S preferred tax rate rt is positive                                     and declines as his relative income falls,
as in Meltzer             and Richards           (1981).       The problem             is more complicated                   for agents who are richer

than average, as p is not monotonic                            over all negative            values of r, One can nonetheless                       show that
Ui(~)         remains strictly          concave         on its domain           [z, I], where z < – 1 W= defined earlier.                           Thus for

w;/w      < 1 – P( Z) agent i‘s preferred                        tax rate is still given by the first-order                            condition     (14); for

       These results on the personal                    distribution        of wealth in a onefactor                 model can be extended                   to
the functional           distribution           of income,      say between         capital   and labor.           Bertola        (1993)     and Alesina
and Rodrik            (1994)       show more generally               that a lower median-to-mean                        ratio in agents’              relative
endowments            of accumulable             and non-accumulable             factors reduces the growth rate. The mechanism

is the same, namely increased                       taxation     of capital,     and so are the efficiency               implications.               The fact
that these are models with infinitely-lived                            agents also makes clear that the results are independent
of the assumption               of myopic          preferences. 11 Note finally that what is key in Proposition                                      1 is how

inequality         aff-ts      the desire for redistribution                 of whoever          is the decisive          agent in the political
system.          Because      the latter is likely to depart                 from the one person,                  one vote abstraction,                I will
later on consider             variations         in political    institutions.


2.4        Empirid                Evidence

I now turn to the evidence                         on the general         idea that inequality             increases       redistribution,             which

in turn redums               growth.        Column          (4) of Table      2 reports       the results of empirical                 studies         which

have examined               the links between               income     inequality     and a variety of measures                    of redistribution:
share of transfers              in GDP           (either     as a whole       or decomposed              into different           categories         such as

welfare, unemployment,                   health and social securi ty), average and marginal                              tax rates, or education
expenditures,           Column          (5) then reports the effects which these policies                           were found to have on the
economy’s          growth or investment                rate, Some studies examine                  only one of these two relationships;
others, most notably                  Perotti      (1992),    (1996) estimate         a simultaneous           system.
       In column        (4) the measure of inequality                   is generally taken to be the share of the third quintile,
or the share of the third plus fourth quint iles. This reflects the emphasis                                              placed      by the models
on the median voter and middle class. The results are rather disappointing:                                                  the effect of income


  10The ~aiu         difference       betw&n     the pr=nt      model    and that    of Per=on     and Tabellini        (1994),     apart from the ‘act
that I allow B < 1 and make explicit                 the functioning     of the loan market      (~’s    and i),    k the use of a geometric            rather
than    linear    redistribution       scheme.      While    this modification      will prove   most      convenient    when considering              mising
credit markets, it is here in~ntial.     All formul~   clerived above also obtain in the traditional, linear, case.
   11The quantitative   ma=itu[le    of the effect, on the other hand, C1O= depend on how far into the future                                           agents
look when making            savings    decisions    and c=ting       their ballo~s; see Krusell,        Quadrini    and Rfos-Rtill         (1996),



                                                                             9
distribution      on transfers and taxes is rarely significant,                     and its sign varies from one study or even
one specification        to the other.        The same is true for education                  expenditures,          Both Alesina         and
Rodrik     (1994) and Persson and Tabellini                  (1994) raise an objection            to interpreting         such regressions
as a test of the theory.               They       point    out that redistribution           can take many           forms     other     than

straight transfers:       progressive       income taxation,            minimum      wage laws, trade and capital restrictions,
the imposition          of government         expenditure,         patent legislation,        regulation,        and the protection         of
property      rights,   This is certainly          true but not entirely persuasive.                First, the studies reported             in

Table 2 already include some of these variables such as tax rates, public employment                                          or education
expenditures.       Second, it is hard to see why the increased pressure for redistribution                                would manifest

itself only through         indirect     channels         and not through          direct ones.    Presumably           the pivotal      voter
or class is equalizing           the marginal        costs and benefits           or pressure along the different              dimensions
of redistribution.          Finally,     one would         want to see at least some evidence                    that minimum            wage
laws, trade and capital             restrictions      or regulation          are higher in more unequal             countries.         Such is
not the me         within     the OECD:            these indirect        forms of redistribution           are lowest in the United
States, which has the greatest pre-tax                     inequality,       and much more extensive            in continental     Europe
(welfare state and labor legislation)                 or Japan (regulation            and tracle protection).

      ~lumn      (5) provides       even more surprising              news. The coefficient         in growth regressions          of most
of the transfers        described       above is positive,        and frequently          statistically     significant.      This is t rue

not only for education           expenditures,        but also for social insurance            and even pensions.            These results
stand in sharp mntrast              to those found           for pure government            consumption,           Most studies         which
include    this variable find it to be negatively                  related to growth,          as in Barro        (1990),     Government
consumption,        however,       is conceptually          different    from redistribution,         at least on the expenditure
side; I shall come back to this point later on.                         On the revenue sicie both              are eventually     financed

through     taxes, but even tax rates fail to have the predicted                          growth     effect,     Easterly     and Rebello
use twelve different         average and marginal              tax rates; the coefficients          are always negative,          but only

one is significantly        different     from zero.        Perotti      (1996)    finds that both average and marginal                    tax
rates have a significantly             positive     effect on growth.          One might be tempted              to dismiss the whole
set of results in mlumn           (5) as due to reverse causality, based on the plausible                         idea that the welfare

state is a luxury        good –a form of “Wagner’s                 law”.      The fact that Perotti            estimates     simultaneous
equation      systems     which allow for the level and growth                       rate of GDP       to affect transfers         and tax

rates precludes         such as an easy way out.                Together,         the results of columns          (4) and (5) indicate
that the median voter, complete                   markets model is missing some important                       factors     which bear on
both the causes and mnsequences                     of redistribution.


2.5       Democracies             and Other Regimes

Another     dmension        of the political        economy     model which has generated                 substantial      empirical    effort
concerns      its differential     implications       across political         regimes.    Perhaps because          some of these have
not been formally         modelled        but simply argued on the basis of intuition,                       the literature      manifests



                                                                        10
some disagreement               as to what exactly                  these implications           are and how they can be tested.                            I shall
therefore     explicitly        formalize          departures         from the “one person, one vote” ideal, in a manner which
is quite specific           but allows me to demonstrate                        some more general points.
      Instead of the voter at the 50th perwntile                              of the wealth distribution                being decisive,            let it be the
agent or pressure group located                          at the pth percentile.            The case p > 1/2 mrresponds                             to a system
biased      against         the poor        due to a wealth–restricted                   voting        franchise,         unequal          lobbying         power,
vot~buying            or simply the fact that poor                      and less educated             individuals             have lower participation

rates in elections,            even in industrialized                  countries      (e. g., Edsall (1984)              or Conway              (1991)      for the
United States).              Conversely,          p < 1/2 corresponds                to a populist          bias reflecting           either the ideology

of a non–democratic                  leftist       regime     (“dictatorship          of the proletariat”)                    or the bargaining              power
of powerful          unions.        To get simple expressions,                    assume moreover               that the distribution                     of initial
endowments            in emh generation                 is log–normal:


                                                                    lnwi N N(m,         A2) .                                                                   (15)


The pivotal          voter or pressure group then corresponds                              to the wealth level w“ defined by @((w*                                  –

rn)/A)       = p, where @ is the c.d.f.                       of a standard           normal.        Equivalently,              w* = m +            AA, where
A -       @-1(p).          Regimes        with positive          values of J muld               be called        “elitist”,         those       with negative
values      “popuhst”.              But since even Western                    democracies         exhibit       departures            from       A = O, I will

use a milder terminology                     and simply speak of positive                   or negative           “wealth          bias”       in the political

institutions.        12 Substituting              In(w”/w)      = AA – A2/2             into (14) yields the following                         results:


Proposition             2
      (1) Growth h higher,                   the more bimed against the poor is the political system:                                          13g/~A >0.
      (2) Inter-temporal              eficiency          is maximized          when the indiuidud                setting        the tax rate is the one
with the avemge              endowment             w.
      (3) Achieting           intertemporal             eficiency      requires more pro-wealth                 bias in, a more uneqtLal count~:

W“    =   W fO~      ~ =     A/2.


      The     very stark nature                   of these results may lead one to think                           that they            reflect special           as-
sumptions           rather than general insights,                     They do not.         These are in fact robust                        features of most
political     economy          capital       taxation        models       with mmplete            ~set       markets.           This includes             not only

models      where there is no useful role for the government                                     (Persson       and Tabellini                 (1994))     but also
those where taxes or subsidies                          are required          to correct        an externality            (Bertola         (1993))        or to fi-
nanm some productive                     public investment              (Alesina      and Rodrik            (1994)).      The underlying                intuitions
are indeed straightforward.                       With complete           markets wealth heterogeneity                         has no efficiency             conse-
quences;      if preferences             are homothetic             it does not even affect aggregates.                          To equalize            the social


  12See Verdier         and Ades         (1993)    for a (lynamic       model    of political     elites,    and Bdnabou           (199,5a)      for a discusion
of alternative       representations        of the political        system.    I show there      in particular         that    if political     influence    reflects
absolute    rather    than    relative     wealth,      with an elasticity      A, the pivotal     ageut     has rauk AA and log–wealth                   n~ + AA*.



                                                                                11
marginal      costs and benefits               of taxation         one need therefore                 only look at averages,                 which means
adopting      the point         of view of the individual                  with the ‘Representative”                     endowment.          13 Complete
markets      also imply          that aggregate           consumption                 growth       rises with the interest               rate; in steady–
state, the same applies to output                       growth.       Maximizing             growth thus means maximizing                         the rate of
return on capital,          thereby adopting              the perspective                of the individual         with highest wealth relative
to other souras           of income.           This includes           his valuation              of any complementarities,                  public       inputs
or regulations         which might affect the private return.
    The empirical              literature      seems to have somewhat                          shied away from the most direct                        testable
implication,         namely       (1), focusing         instead on a more indirect,                     second-order           effect:     the differential

effects of inequality            on redistribution             and growth across political                     regimes.        The claim, first made
by Persson          and Tabellini           (1994)     and taken up by Perotti                      (1992),      (1996)      ancl others,         is that the

negative      impact      of inequality            discussed        in Proposition                1 should       be stronger           in “democracies”
rather     than      “non+emocracies”.                   While       it does          relate      to some      valid intuitions,            there     are two
problems      with this ar~ment.
     (a) I know of no formal proof                      or model.          Upon reflection,             this is probably              no accident.           Such
claims     concern       the cmss–patiid                second       derivative          of the growth           rate,      with respect          to inmme

distribution        and regime.           Not only is it rare when cross–partials                           can be signed unambiguously,                       but
in this instance         the gTowth rate (or equivalently,                             the tax rate) is determined                    by the first-rder
mndtion        of the decisive agent –whether                      a dictator,          lanclowning         elite or powerful            union.     Its cross-
partial     thus inevitably           involves        the third derivative                of that agent or gToup’s objective                         function,
and therefore         cannot       be signed without               restrictive         functional       assumptions.          14

     (b) Whatever          its sign, any differential                 impact           of income       distribution          across political         regimes
must surely depend                on the direction             in which one moves away from pure democracy.                                         A similar
criticism     was formulated                by Alesina           and Rodrik             (1994)      who pointed           out that         even diet ators
are subject         to political          pressure,     whether        through           riots or bribes.          What        should      matter         is how

inequality         affects the desire for realist ribution                   of their constituency.
     Elaborating         on these remarks,               I shall now formally                     examine      the cross~ffects            of political          in-
stitution      and inequality,              A and A, on redistribution                      and growth.           When        voters or constituents

located     at the pti wealth permntile                    are decisive,              the equilibrium          tax rate is given by their first–
order rendition:          ln(l — p(r))          = AA — A2/2,               where p was defined in (14).                       This implies


                                                                                                                                                               (16)

growth     (&~/~~~A       and     ~2g/8~~A in my model),               which is the issue of contention              here.

The first term in the smnd                    bracket       is negative,     but the semnd              one depends         on the curvature                of
ln(l – p).15 This is a complicated                    expression,      even for A close to zero. One could of course evaluate

it numerically.         Alternatively,         observe that when A is small, the second term is dominated                                          by the
first. Together         with similar derivations                 for the growth rate, this allows me to prove an amended
version of the “democracy                 and inequalit y“ conjecture:


Proposition 3
     As long as inequality               is not too la~e,           its positive       effect    on redistribution               and negative           effect
on growth am weaker,                 the less favomble             to the poor is the political             system:         ~2r/8A8A              <0      and
82g/8A8A          >0.

in left–wing,       populist       regimes and less impact ordy in right-wing                          or wealth–biased            systems, 16 Note
also from (16) that in this latter case taxes first decline,                              then rise with inequality:                 8T/~A         ~ O as
A ~ ~. Distributional               ~nflict     initially     shifts po]icy       to   inefficiently       low   levels     of taxation,          but     the

growing      skeness        of the income             distribution      eventually        tilts the balance           of power back towards
the poor.        The regressive          nature of taxes or capital                 subsidies      in this range (~ <0                    for A < 2A)

need not be taken literally,                  because       one could       incorporate         some insurance             value or public              good
which ensured            that ~ remained              positive.      What        is important,          given the lack of any empirical
link between         inequality       and redistribution            evident in Table 2, is the non-monotonicity                               of r with

respect      to A. The possibility              of redistribution           decreasing       with inequality              will play a still larger
role onm combined               with imperf~t            capital     markets        in Section         3, and will therefore              be discussed

in more detail at that point.
     Propositions         2 and 3 make clear that what matters for growth                                 (both directly           and through            the
impact of income distribution)                  is not the just the degree to which the political                           system departs from
perfect democracy,              whi& corresponds             to IAI, but also whose political                rights or influence are being
curtailed.       The empirical         literature has nonetheless                followed       Persson and Tabellini              (1994) in testing

for differential        effects of absolute democracy.                 Typically,       countries       are classifieci into “democracies”
and “non-democrwies”                   on the basis of some index of political                         rights, freedom            of expression          and

association,        etc., such as those of Gastil (1982).                    The growth regression                is then run separately                   for
each subsample,           or for the whole sample with a “democracy”                               dummy         variable included            –both        by

itself and interacted              with income distribution.                   The results of these tests, summarized                            in columns

(2) and (3) of Table 2, have generally                             been negative.              First,     there is no consistent              direct        effect
of democracy            on growth          (rail       that this class of models                 predicts       ~g/8A        > O). The latest study,
Barro (1996), finds a non-linear                       effect which I shall revisit in the next section.                          Turning to column

(3), most other              studies have not reproduced                      Persson        and Tabellini’s         (1992),      (1994)      finding         of a
stat istically        significant       differential     impact       of inequality            ~ross      democracies          and non-democracies.

Moreover,          the sign of the estimates                 varies from one study to another.                              But since what is really
me~ured           in such regressions              is the effect of IAl and IAlA rather than J and AA, I see these results
w less damaging               for the theory than those of the direct tests discussed                                   in Section         2.4. It should
be feasible          in future      work to provide               more discriminating                  tests by clistinguishing             between          left-
and right–wing               regimes,      at least for some subset of countries. 17


2.6         Consumption                 Taxes        and      Labor           Supply

Ohe potential           explanation          for the fact that redistribution                     does not appear to depress investment

or growth          is the presenm            of crdt       constraints,          as I will show later on.                   But even with complete

markets this need not happen:                        nothing       in principle        prevents progressive                 taxation,     transfers,         min-
imum wages and the like from being mmbined                                      with a consumption                 tax or investment              subsidy        to
maintain          =umulat         ion at the appropriate               level. Indeed, value-added                    and sales taxes account                    for
a much higher share of government                            revenue in “welfare                 state”     European          countries      than, say, in
the US or Japan,
      Going back to the model,                     suppose        that a proportional                 consumption       tax is introduced                  and its
revenue used to subsidize                   investment,           First period consumption                    is now Ci = (1 – t) (wi + bi – ki),
investment           (1 +a)ki     and second period pretax                     income yi = [r((l+a)k;               )p(w)l–~]l–T(~)T.                Balanced
budgets        require t(w – k) = ak, where letters without                                    superscripts        still denote         aggregates.           It is

easily verified that, for any rate of redistribution                                 7 :


      1. Agents        still save the same frsction                    5(T)      of their income,               so that the investment                     rate is

            5(T)(1 + a).

      2. The mnsumption                 tax rate unanimowly                   preferred        by agents is t“ (~) = p~~/(1                 + p~r).         Thus
            the more progressive              the income tax, the greater the recourse to consumption                                        taxes.


      3. The resulting            investment         rate never departs from its first best level: s(~)(l                                + a) = p~/(1            +
            pp) = 5(0).

based or wealth–b-d               voting    franchise.     This    corresponds       closely    to A ikelf,     and is therefore        a more     appropriate
regr~sor      than    any post–war         democracy     index.     The   resulting        estimate     of ~g/~A   is nonetheless        negative,     although
not significant.       The cr=-ffect          is not -timatecl in this set of regressions.




                                                                                14
      4. Introducing         elastic labor supply, by replacing                first-period         income       w’ with Wali and prefer-
          en~     (1) with U = In c — 61 + pin d, leaves these results unchanged.                                     As to the growth rate,

          it bmmes       g(~) = lnr +~lns(0)             +lnl(~),      where l(~) = (1 +p~(l                   —~))/8     is agents’ common
          labor supply.18


      This simple extension           of the model          makes clear that it is only when redistributive                               policy    is
restricted      to capital taxation      that increases in redistribution                   automatically         translate into intertem-
poral distortions,        thereby generating            results like Proposition            1. A related conclusion               emerges from
Bertola’s       (1993) two factor model, where labor supply is fixed.                          He shows that when redistribution
takes the form of investment              subsidies       rather than f=tor              taxation,       wealthy agents want less of it
than poor on-,           as it depresses        the value of the existing                capital    stock.      Therefore       the poorer         the
median      voter relative        to the mean, the higher the growth                       rate.     Of course         when labor supply            is
elastic,    redistribution        depresses     effort and this decline in 1(~) still lowers the growth                             rate.    Note,
however,        that the magnitude        of this effect is smaller than that of                     5(7-)    -even     with linear disutility
of labor, which puts an upper bound                     on distortions         to labor supply.


2.7        What      of Land        Reform         and      Public        Education?

Formalizing        the broad       idea of a link between             distributive          conflict         and growth      is an important
cQntribut ion of the pure political               economy        models discussed            above       (e.g., Bertola         (1993),    Alesina
and Rodrik         (1994),     Persson and Tabellini           (1994)).       The specific          mechanism          on which they focus,
however, appears somewhat               at odds with some of the motivating                         issues and evidence.           For instance
when interpreting             their empirical     results, Alesina and Rodrik                      (1994)     refer to the idea that land

reform      w=     an important        factor    in the growth           performance           of Japan,         Korea      ancl other       Asian
countria,        especially     when compared           to Latin America.            Similar claims are often made concerning

the role of public investment            in primary         and secondary           education,         which mostly benefits              the poor

and lower middle           class. This means that if Latin American                         or African         countries     did not grow as

f~t    as Asian ones it is -among              other things-        because       they failecl to redistribute,              at least initially
(land) and perhaps also along the way (education).                           19 Yet~ the o?lly transfers allowed in this class of

models are those detrimental              to growth.         Public schooling            and any kind of redistribution                   affecting
people’s        ability to invest are just not feasible under complete                             asset markets.          Land reform         and
other reallocations           of property       rights which could            reduce future distributional                  conflict      are only
envisioned        as off-th~equilibrium            path events,         in the form of on~time,                       unanticipated         capital
levies,    But if onetime          rdstributions          are so beneficial          they should occur                systematically        at high
levels of inequality          (Brasil and South Africa come to mind).                       To avoid this tim+inconsistency                        one

needs to explain what is impeding                 such transfers, and perhaps why this constraint                               may be relaxed

following      a war or major           crisis.    More generally,                countries       face a tradeoff          between       the benefits         of
redistribution        and its inwntive            or reputation          costs; both aspects should be explicitly                          incorporated
into the politioanomic                     game.     This is the task to which I now turn.
      For redistribution         to potentially        have any growth benefit, in addition                             to costs, it must of course

take place before         investment           is completed,            But altering            the timing          of transfers       is not sufficient:
the reader will e~ily            verify that none of the earlier results change if the government                                             redistributes

investment       expenditures           (or capital itself but prior to production)                             according       to the scheme:

for instance       to a land reform               (redistributing             plots of size ki), but one which is anticipated                               by
agents,      Equivalently,         one can think of redistributing                          education          budgets       across      rich and poor
school districts,       as done implicitly            in muntries             which have a national system of education                             finance,
and explicitly        in an increasing         number of U. S. States in response to constitutional                                    court mandates.

Finally, if one thinks of physical                  capital,      redistributing            investment              expenditures        is equivalent         to
taxing      large investments            and subsidizing              small ones:           agents         investing      ki fue       a price p(ki)          =

such redistributions          –or the threat thereof–                   can only distort             first-best        investment       decisions.

3.1       Direct       Effects of Inequality                     and Redistribution

Let me now consider              the very same model as above, but with missing credit markets:                                                agents have
no possibility y of borrowing              from one another,               for instance           due to a severe moral hazard problem
(there is no way to enforce                 repayment).          Later on I shall relate the model                           to others which make
credit frictions       explicit.     I naturally       focus on the case where redistribution                              cjccurs in time to affect
the resources       available      for investment,            namely          (3’)–(4’),        With       no access to a loan market,                 agent


    ZOIt might ~tim    ~om    natural      to ~im~l~ tm first-perio[l             wealth U)i. But since it is here exogenouslY                deterlniu~    for

each generation       this would be equivalent         to an unanticipated              capital    levy.    Formalizing      redistribution      as affecting
inv=tment      expenditures      enables     me to capture        its disincentive         effetts   while simultaneously             allowing    it to occur
in time    to affect potential     liquidity   constraints.      Straightforwarcl          income        taxation     with dynfitic     or infinitely-lived
agents    leads to very similar     expressions      (BSnabou         (1995a)).




                                                                              16
i’s optimization     problem        is the same as (5) before,                except     that 6Z is now constrained             to zero:


                                    m~~x{ln(wi – k;) + pln(r                [(ka)l-T(L)’]Pwl        -P)}m                                    (5’)


The optimal      investment         is therefore:


                                                                                                                                             (18)


where~       everyone     previously       invested a fract ions            of aggregate income,             they now invest that same
fraction   of their own inmme.             The government’s             balanced        budget      condition     (4’) then defines ~ to
be ~ = sti, with
                                                   (ti/w)’      = wl-’/E[(wi)]-’]            .                                               (19)


This yields semnd-period              income for agent i :


                                                yi = ~~~(w’)d(l-’)             d’wl-~
                                                                               -             .                                               (20)


Summing       over all agents, the growth rate of aggregate                       income         is given by:


                   g(~) - ln(y/w)          = ln~ + ~ln5(T)             – in (E[(wi)l-”])P/E[(            wi)p(l-7)]        ,                 (21)
                                                                                                                       )

where ~ is the tax rate chosen by the current generation,                              With dynamic           linkages still specified         as

in Section     2.2, this is also the intergenerational                  growth rate:         g(~~) = ln(wt+l /wt ) = ln(yt/yt_                1).
The first two terms represent              the growth          rate with frictionless            loan markets,     derived       in (9). The
l~t   term     is negative    for ~ <        1 due to Jensen’s                inequality,        and vanishes      for @ =        1. A more
unequal distribution         of resources,      in the usual sense of a mean–preserving                          spread in U)i, tends to
increase this loss and thereby              slow down growth.               A particularly         simple expression           obtains   when
endowments       are log-normally          distributed,         in Wi w Af(m, A2),           which I will assume from now on:


                                    9(7) = ln~ +Blns(T)                –P(l     –P)(1       –~)2A2/2.                                        (22)


The intuition      is straightforward.          With         ~ < 1 individuals           face decreasing        returns to investment.
Reallocating      funds    from rich to poor                 relaxes   the latter’s       credit    constraints,      allowing       them      to

earn a higher return.          Because       the government             is in no better           position     than potential       financial

intermediaries     to monitor         borrowers        and ensure that they repay, this more efficient                          allocation     of
investment      can only be achieved           together         with a net transfer to the poor.                This in turn depresses
savings incentives,       as in the case of perfect capital markets.                     The same two effects are present when
evaluating     intertemporal         efficiency:       the objective          function      of a planner        with no distributional

mncem      now equals


                             W(T)      =   lnc + plnd          = V(T) – p~(l           – P)(1 – T)2A2/2,                                     (23)



                                                                       17
where V(7)            arresponds            to the complete              markets case.


Proposition 4
      (1) Under any given policy                    T,    inequality reduces growth and intertemporal                                eficiency.          This loss
decrees          with the extent            of pm–investment               mdisttibution.
      (2)     Growth h hill-shaped                  with respect          to ~distribution,             and the growtlt-rnaximizing                        tu    rate
incmasa         with in~uaiity.


      These results differ somewhat                         from those of G alor and Zeira (1993),                              Banerjee         and Newman

(1993),      Perotti       (1993) or Aghion               and Bolton            (1996).      In these models the effects of inequality                           and
redistribution           on grotih          depend         critically      on the initial distribution                   of wealth.          This is because
investment            involves      a minimum            project        size, generating         a threshold           level of wealth below which

agents do not invest,                  or do not leave enough                     to their offspring              for them         to invest.          Increasing
growth        means maximizing                 the number               of people. above            this threshold,            and in the early stages
of development              this may require                conm.ntrating           resources         on a lucky           few or on some emerging
middle       class,       This non–convexity                 was also originally               seen as a key ingredient                      in models          with
explicit      credit      rationing,        especially        in generating            multiple       long–inn        equilibria           (poverty      traps) .21
To demonstrate              that multiplicity             can arise solely through                  the feeclback from distribution                      to factor
prices       (see Section          3.6),     Piketty       (1996)        does     away with indivisibility                   by simply          augmenting              a
standard        Solow model with moral hazard,                            His neoclassical,           concave        technology         again implies that
inequality       is always harmful and redistribution                            towards the poor beneficial                    —abstracting             of course

from incentive            effects, which he does.                Thus Piketty’s              model,     incorporating             the micro-foundations
underlying         the credit rationing,                 validates       the similar result obtained                   by simply closing down the

loans market,            as I have done here following                      Loury (1981),            Tamura         (1991)       and B6nabou             (1996a).


3.2         Empirid                Evidence

Because        asset market            in~mpleteness               is difficult        to measure,           there has been little work testing
its growth implications                    directly. 22 Columns             (7) and (8) in Table 2 show the results from Perotti

(1994),       who uses the loan-t~value                       ratio for mortgages                as an indicator             of credit       availability        and

finds it to affect the investment                        rate positively           and significantly,             Moreover         this effect is stronger
where the share of the bottom                            two quintiles           is lower (that coefficient                  is significant        only at the
10% level).           Similarly,      the negative           effect of inequalit y on investment                      rises with credit frictions,                 as

predicted        by the model.

   21 Another     potential        ~PPeal   is its ability     to generate        Kuznek-type         dynamics,       W the range          of increasing      returns
initially    causes    some measures         of inequality       to increase.      Eventually,      ineqllality     decrewses     as aggregate         growth    pulls
everyone      out of the poverty        trap through         a decline in the warcity          of ca]]ital     (Aghion      and Bolton       (1996))    or through
some positive         spillovers    from the better        educated      xgments       of society     (Galor      aucl Tsicldon     (1993)).
   ‘zThere      is of aurae        an empirical     literature      linking      financial    develol]ment        and growth,       but it does not directly
connect      to the personal        or functional        dktributiou      of income       and the consequences             of reclistributive     policiti,     which
represent     our main concerns.            More closely       related    is the literature      devotecl      to credit     constraints       on the investment
of small firms, e.g.,        Bernanke       and Gertler       (1989).



                                                                                  18
       Evidence        of a more indirect nature can also be considered,                                            For instance,      if liquidity      mnstraints
are impeding             investment           by the poor or lower middle-class,                               any form of progressive                  transfer will

mntribute           to relaxing            them.         By contr=t,                government             consumption             will not,     except       perhaps

for civil servants.               If anything,            the taxes needed to finance it will aggravate                                       wealth constraints.
This differential             effect is remarkably                    consistent       with the empirical                 evidence      discussed        earlier:       the
cent ribution of transfers to growth is general] y positive,                                           that of government              consumption          generally

negative.        The effects of public education                           expenditures            also deserve attention.                Column        (5) of Table
2 shows that these generally                           promote          growth.        In the absence                of credit       constraints,       increases         in
public      spending          on education               would be offset by decreases                          in private          spending      (unless the two
are mmplements),                  and therefore             would not mntribute                     to growth.          To the extent that they require
higher levels of distortionary                         taxation          they would even have a negative                             effect,    as in Becker and
Tomes        (1979) .23
       The development                   literature       also provides             some valuable evidencfi,                      even if it does not directly

relate to aggregate                 growth.            First,        it appears       to be a robust                 finding       that credit      rationing          and

the lack of adequate                    insurance        significantly            constrain        the investments                of poor farmers away from
profit-maximizing                 levels and impositions.                          See for instance                 Rosenzweig         and Wolpin         (1993),        or

the mmprehensive                  surveys by Binswanger                         and Deininger              (1995) and Binswanger                 and Rosenzweig
(1995),       Informal         risk-sharing             and mnsumption-srnoothing                             arrangements             play an important               role
but are only limited                    substitutea         for well-functioning                  markets           (Townsend        (1995)).      This literature
also provides            evidence          of the decreasing                  returns         which are central             to the resulting            inefficiency:
whether         in developing              or developed               countries,      the family farm is usually                       the most efficient unit
of production.               Inadequate          access by peasants                    to credit           for buying        land,      agricultural       inputs or

equipment           is one of the main causes of conuntration                                      in land ownership;                others are the favorable

tax treatment             of agricultural              income          and various subsidies                   which benefit           wealthy      farmers most,
Diminishing           returns also occur in education,                             according           to most empirical             estimates      of the private
and social returns to primary,                          secondary           and tertiary schooling                    (e.g., Psacharopoulos               (1993)),


3.3         Politid             Economy                with          Missing         Asset          Markets

ht       us now examine how inequality                               affects the efficient and equilibrium                         amounts       of redistribution

and the corresponding                      growth rates, by studying                        the interactions            of political      economy        and imper-
fect asset markets.                 I mntinue           to focus on the case where first period                                endowments          are log-normal


     23An inter=ting         i~ue       is the degr&       to which government                transfers    are actual]y     Progre~ive.        Al=ina    (1995)      shows

that     a significant       fraction      of health     and especially           education       expenditures         is often    captured     by the middle          40~o,
with even the top 20% appropriating                        a large share          in some Latin        American        countri=.     The size of transfers           is thus
not as good         an indicator         of social     equity        as might     appear.       With      respect     to growth,     however,     th=     observations
are not inconsistent           with the idea that               redistribution      tends      to relax wealth         constraints     on investment.       First,     even
Alesina’s     data suggests         that    a significant        amount       of r-urces        generally      reach=     the bottom      40%.    Moreover,       the key
i=ue     is what segment         of the population              has the highest       marginal       return    on investment;         in a poor country       this could
easily    include     parb     of the middle           class,    =    o~rvd         earlier     when discussing          the effects    of fixed costs.      Naturally,
institutional       reforms     which could minimize                  transfers    to the truly wellaff             would always be beneficial.




                                                                                       19
and to omit time subscripts.                   Using (20), individual         i’s welfare is equal to:


                      Ui(7)      = V(7)      – (1 + p~(l        – 7)2)A2/2      + (1 + P8(1 – ~))(lnwi         – m).                  (24)


It can be shown that U’ is strictly                    concave      over all ~ 2 Z, where z = – (1 + l/p~)               112<      – 1 was

taken to be the most re~essive                      tax feasible.     Except     for the richest individuals           who prefer this
corner     solution       (Ti = Z for in wi — m > (pP)–l V’(Z)                     + (1 – Z)A2       > 2A2),     each agent’s        ideal
tax rate ri is then given by the first-order                        condition     U’i (~) = O; it decreases       with own income
in w; and increases              with inequality        A. Agents      richer than in w; = nl + A2 = in w + A2/2                     favor

regressive tax=           while all others, including             the individual     with the average endowment                w, are for
progressivity.        To compare          these private optima          to the social one, let us next rewrite:


                           Ui(~)    = W(7)        – p~2(l   – T)2A2/2        + (1 + PB(l – T))(ln wi – n~).                           (25)


This leads to the following               results.


Proposition           5

     (1) A social planner              wncerned        only with i?tterternporal         eficiency   W would set a positive            tax
mte rP(A),       inc-ing             in A.
     (2) The prefemd               tax mte of t}te agent with median wdth                    is above this eflcient       level.
     (3) The prejemd               tax rate of the agent with avemge               wealth is below the eficient          level if
    (1 - @)A2/4~            > (2D -       1)/(2     + p), and above in the reverse case.


    The fist     result is intuitive,             given that redistribution        now has not only efficiency          costs through

5(7) but also efficiency             benefits,     proportional      to A 2. The second one has a familiar ring, although

it should be noted that the median voter’s                        preferred     policy    now maximizes        ez–a~~te or aggregate
welfare,     EWi [Ui (~)]. Most striking               is the third result.       In the previous      class of models,        the agent
with average wealth                always chose the efficient policy.             Now there are two opposite              forces which
make him “un–repre=ntative”.                       The first is the progmssivii?y of the tax scheme,              whereby       for ~ >0

all those below            ti > w gain at the expense                 of those     above.     Previously,      redistribution       was a

threat which discouraged                savings but did not materialize              in equilibrium,     as everyone       invested the
same amount.              With     liquidity      constraints    investments      reflect wealth levels, allowing          the average

individual     to join        in “soaking”          the very rich (differential           product ivi ties would       yield    a similar
result).    The opposite           effect, which tends to make him choose too little redistribution,                       is his failure
to internalize        the social losses from liquidity                constraints,       which are proportional         to (1 – ~)A2.
As seen in (10), the missing credit market does not affect him at all because                                     he does not want

to borrow      or lend.          In this sense he is the leastmpmsentative                    of all agents,     as both       richer and
especially    poorer        ones are affected.         When      (1 – ~) A2 is large enough or simply when ~ < 1/2 this

effect dominates           the progressivity         bias and the average agent chooses an inefficiently                 low tax rate,




                                                                       20
~sibly         even less efficient than that of the median voter. 24 Democracy                                         has its virtues,           after all.

     To explore in more detail the effects of political                            institutions     and inequality               on redistribution,         let
the pivotal agent or group correspond                     once again to the pt~ percentile,                        with p = O(A). Substituting
in Wi = m + AA into (11) and setting U’i(7)                            = O leads to the following                    results:


Proposition 6

     (3) If the pivotal             agent is of higher mnk than the median (A > O), taxes are U-shaped                                                     with
Rspect        to inequality.         Tax cuts induced             by rising inquality              am always inefficient                     and can abo

duce       growth if ~ is not too close to 1. Tax incwes                              induced by tising inequality have the opposite

eflmts     up to some         point,    beyond which their contribution                         to intertemporal                 eficiency      and growth
beomes         negative.


     The first result provides               a potential          explanation           for Barre’s          (1996)         finding      that    growth      is
maximized           at some interrnediate             level of democracy,               and more generally                   for the absence           of any
monotonic          relationship       between     the two.         See Table 2, column                  (2), with the usual caveat about

me~uring           IAI rather than A. Note that asset market incompleteness                                        and tax distortions            are both
critical      for this non–linear         effect of the political                  system     on the growth            rate.          In models     such as
Alesina and Rodrik             (1994) or Bertola            (1994) the presence                 of public investment                   or spillovers    does
not change the fact that rest rict ing the political                          rights of the poor al~oays increases growth,                             as ex-
plained following           Proposition      2. A polar opposite                   is Saint–Paul        and Verdier’s              (1993) model where
non–distortionary            taxes are used to finanu                 public education,                supplementing               wealth<onstrained

private expenditures.               As a result, growth increases monotonically y with redistribution,                                          and there-

fore with –A,            The model        presented       here can be seen as combining                            both      forms,      resulting      in an

interior solution          for the growth-maximizing                  political        system.

     As far as equilibrium              taxes and we~am                are concerned,             results (2) and (3) also apply in the
complete          markets    ~se. 25 The difference                is only one of degree:                   because          the optimal         level of r

now increases with A, inequality-induwd                            tax increases are now less inefficient                             and t ax decreases
more inefficient.           With respect to growth, however,                       the losses from credit constraints                        lead to a new
and potentially           import ant explanation             for its negative               correlation      with inequality:                Proposition      6

shows that more inequality                can lead to less redistribution,                      which in turn leads to less growth                         (see
also B6nabou           (1995a)).

3.4      Direct     and Indirect              Effects of Inequality

We saw earlier that for a given policy                     r, inequality     redu~.s       growth    and intertemporal          efficiency.
Does     this remain      true when policy             responds       endogenously?           A straightforward            application      of
the envelope       theorem        to (23)     shows        that such is the case when                redistribution        is determined
by an efficient        planner,    i.e.     r = 7P(A)         -    arg max{W}.         The    more interesting            case is when it

arises through      the political         process.    kt    r“ (A, A) denote this solution             to the first-order        rendition
U’i(~)   = O of the pivotal         group:


                                             (p~)-lV’(r)          + (1 –~)A2       – AA = O.                                              (26)


We ean write

                                              :=%+(~).=..x                           (~)

and similarly for W. The first term, which holds policy fixed, is always negative,                                  while the l~t two
were analyzed      in Proposition           6. In a pure democracy             or a populist        system    (~ S O) taxes increases
with inequality;        moreover,      the equilibrium            rate is always above 7P, hence in the range where W
and a fortiori g decline with redistribution.                     With positive wealth bias, on the other hand, taxes are
U–shaped       with respect to inequality.              Lower taxes have a positive             effect on savings incentives              but
a detrimental      one on credit constraints,               Whether        growth rises or falls thus depends               on the extent
to which agents f-          decreasing        returns and have unequal resources.                    The effects on W are similar,
except     that since it puts positive           weight on first-period            mnsumption          it does not “overvalue”            low
taxes w g does.         In particular,       Proposition          6 established     that where rising inequality             letis      to tax
cuts, these are never efficient.


Proposition        7
      (1) If the pivotal     agent is at or below the median (~ s O), inequality                             mduc~s both growth and
interternpod       eficiency.

      (2) If the pivotal agent is of higher rank than the median (A > O), inequality                                  still lowers W m
long os ~ is not too large,               For B close to 1 inequality             may increase        intertempord         eficiency,      but

thti can ody      occur through an incm~~e in mdisttibution.
      (3) For A >0        inequality       reduces growth if A is not too small and ~ not to close to 1. In the
opposite     co.se, inequality      incmes           growth through a decmse               in tax rates.


      While the direct effect of inequality                 on growth       (through    wealth constraints)           often dominates,
its interaction    with the indirect           one (policy         response)      can generate       a fairly mmplex         relationship
between these variables.           Sorting out the two channels through                     a structural      model should nonethe-
less be possible,       and even appears              desirable.      Particularly     interesting       is the third result,           which

calls attention     to the fact that if political             power is sufficiently         correlated       with financial     or human

wealth     and if capital       market       imperfections         are not too severe,         greater       inequality     may actually



                                                                      22
increase growth through                a decline in redistribution.                A similar insight will arise from the model of
social conflict         dscussed      in Section        4 : what matters              for sociopolitical         stability    (which promotes
growth)      is not income           inequality      per se, but the inequality                 of income        relative     to the inequality
of political     power.         Where     institutions       or the political           technology        are such that increases              in the
former translate          into increases in the latter, instability                    (or here, taxation)          need not rise, and may

actually     fall.


3.5        Endogenous              Income          Distributions             and       Social        Mobility

Up to this point I have maintained                    a feature inherited from the complete                      markets models discussed
in Section      2: even though            it plays a critical role, the pretax                   distribution       of endowments            is mm-
pletely exogenous,              In Persson and Tabellini             (1994) as here it simply reflects, period                      after period,
the fixed distribution              of agents’      abilities.     In Bertola         (1993)     and Alesina        and Rodrik           (1994)    the

distribution         of wealth is indeterminate:              the constancy            of factor prices combines              with the absence
of idiosyncratic          uncertainty       to ensure that any initial distribution                       will reproduce         itself from one
period     to the next.           By contrast,        the endogenous             evolution      of the wealth distribution                  is at the

core of incomplete              markets     models.        This includes          those which focus on the decentralized                          mar-
ket outmme            (Banerjee      and Newman            (1993),    Galor and Zeira (1993),                   Aghion   and Bolton           (1996),

Piketty     (1996)),      those which analyze potential                    redistributive        policies    (Loury      (1981),     Glomm         and
Ravikumar            (1992),    B6nabou      (1996a),       Fernandez           and Rogerson          (1994))     and those which encioge-

nize redistribution             as a political     outmme         (Perotti      (1993),     Saint–Paul       and Verdier         (1993),     Verdier
and Ades        (1993),        Saint–Paul        (1994),   B6nabou          (1995a)).       Making        these distributional             dynamics
explicit    is also necessary          to address the issue of social mobility.                      The intergenerational               persistence
of income      and wealth disparities                is at least as relevant a social concern                     as the level of inequality
per se. The question              of how policy         affects persistence,           both in theory and in practice,                   is therefore

of mnsiderable           interest.
      The model          developed        in this paper          is easily amended             to deal with these issues.                 lJntil now

it was assumed            that intergenerational             linkages operated              onl y at the aggregate              level.     Whether
through      an economy-wide                spillover      or through           universal      public    education,          they resulted        in a
transmission          mechanism        of the form:        w~+l = c~+l y~. ht             me now recognize            that the transmission

of human       capital         operates    largely    within the family or at the level of small communities                                   which
are fairly homogeneous               in socioeconomic            status:     school     districts,      neighborhoods,         social networks,
etc. Consider          first the pure human capital spillover interpretation,                             under which wj+l = c:+ 1 yt is
simply replaced           by:
                                                                 W;+l = E;+l y:.                                                                  (8”)

Under perfect          capital markets this changes nothing,                       because y~ = r (5L)P wt for all agents.                    Family
in~me       remains i.i.d., with variance A2 = Var[ln c] = s2. With imperfect                                       capital    markets,       on the
other hand, equation               (20) now implies that family income follows the law of motion:




                                                                           23
where ~t is the tax rate chosen in period                              t and tit is given by (19).                Income    remains log-normally

distributed,      and its intergenerational                      persistence         is given by ~(1 – ~t). As a result,                     inequality
follows the autoregressive                 prouss:


                                                                                                                                                    (28)


The alternative           mechanism          of intergenerational               t ranstission          is educational       investment,       now pri-
vately or locally              funded.     With       the preferences           ( 1‘ ), agents all want to invest the same fraction

1 – ~ of smnd             period         rwources       in their child’s          human capital.           Therefore        w~+l = ~~+1~,         where

the constant          has again been normalized                       to one. In the absence of credit markets,                     d: = y: so (27)
and (28) remain unchanged.                        ~mplete         markets lead to somewhat                    different     individual       dynamics,
but these retain the property                       that redistribution              reduces    the persistence            of w;. From here on I
shall focus on the first case, since it has implications                               for aggregate        gTowth whereas the second one
does not. R,ecall in particular                    that




Together     with (28) this makes clear that once the dynamics                                  of income distribution            are endogenized,
an additional,          long–run          benefit of redistribution                 appears.    A marginal           rise in ~t causes the same
distortion     s’(~t)     as before,        but now the growth 1OSS- due to the combination                                  of wealth inequality

and borrowing           constraints         are reduced not only in the current period                             ((1 – ~t)2A~/2      is lower), but
also in dl future perioh:                  A~f~ is lower, for all k. This homogenizing                              effect means that long-run
growth is maximized                at a higher level of redistribution                      than previously. ‘G This, in turn, requires
a lower deg-ree of wealth bias A in the political                                 system,      which must therefore              be closer to pure

democracy.
     This brings me to the question                          of the long-run         behavior    of the economy             and its income       distri-
bution,    which I will discuss both theoretically                            and empirically.          As before,      let taxes be determined

in each generation               by the preferred             policy    of the pivotal         group:     ~t = ~“ (At, A), defined             by (26).
Together,      ~t and At then determine                       next period’s         distribution,      according      to (28).    Recall now from

Proposition       7 that when A s O, ~“ (At, A) is increasing                               in At, so that endogenous                 redistribution
acts as a stabilizing             feedback        on inequality,

Proposition 8
       If the median voter            or some         agent located at a lower pementile                   chooses        the tax rate in eue~
per-iod (A < O), the ewnomy                   wnve~es        to a unique steudy-state                growth path (Tm, Am, gm) when

‘r   ~——r*(A,      Am),      2 —
                            Am —s 2/( 1 – ~2(1 – ~a)2)                    and tile gmwtl~ rate is

       As one would expect,              a stronger        populist      bias shifts this steady-state                towards        greater redis-
tnbution        and less inequality,


3.6        Multiple         bng        Run       Distributions

With      any positive        influena        of wealth on the political                process,    on the other hand, taxes initially
decrease with At, before increasing                    again. By (28) this tends to increase At+l,                        hence also ~~+1, and

so on. The feet-bzk                 from policy        to intergenerational             dynamics        is now potentially           destabilizing,


Proposition           9
       If the pivotal       agent i.s of higher rank than the median (~ > O) there can be multiple                                          steady-
states.     In that cue,        interternporal         eficiency       W incre~~es m one moves from a less redistnbutive,
more inegditarian             steady-state           to one where       Tm     is   higher and Am          lower.     This is a fortiori          true
for m-ante         welfare Ewi [U=], and may &o                       be true for the growth rate gm.


       Proposition        9 and equation             (27) on whi&         it is based illustrate            more generally            the common
ptinciple       through       which multiple           long–run        distributions        arise in models          with imperfect          capital

markets:        a negative        general equilibrium            feedback           of inequality       on mobility,       via a worsening            of
credit     constraints .27 In Banerjee                 and Newman            (1993)       this feedback        operates      through        the real

wage,      A more unequal            distribution        of wealth means more people                     who do not have the mllateral

required to bwme              either self–employed             entrepreneurs           or employers       of labor,       Instead they bemme
workers,        mllectively       depressing         the wage and therefore                the bequest         which       they leave to their

children.        Conversely,        wealthy      dynast ies benefit            from paying          lower wages.          This   makes for low
social mobility           and persistently           high inequality.        Builcling on Aghion             and Bolton          (1996),    Piketty
(1996)      generates       a related      form of “mobility             trap”       through       the interest      rate.    When         wealth is
distributed       very unequally           there are few lenders and a lot of would-be                             borrowers.         This implies
high interest rates, especially                if the economy’s           total wealth is relatively               low.    High interest rates,

in turn, aggravate poor agents’ borrowing                          constraints        and make mobility            more difficult;       thus both

low total wealth and high dispersion                      persist into the next period.                 Across stewly–states,            aggregate
income      and wealth vary negatively                  with the interest rate. In the present model,                         as in Saint–Paul


     “Multiple equilibria can also arise from a non-convexity at tile level of iu(lividual families,                              as in Galor     and
Zeira (1993).     With     enough    idiosyncratic     uncertainty,     however,      a poor families    escapes   the poverty       (no inv~tment)
thrmhold     with positive     probability;    the wealth     pro-       is then ergo[lic      and the long-run       distribution     uni~lue.



                                                                          25
(1994) and Wnabou                    (1995a),       the feedback             is through     policy;   taxes and transfers or public funding
of education            serve M imperfect              substitutes           for the missing credit market.             When greater inequality
leads to lower redistribution                       this again reduces              mobility      and makes disparities                more persistent,
by worsening              the credit           constraints         of poor      agents,        This is why transfers            and growth           can be

positively        mrrelated          across steady–states               in spite of savings distortions,              as stated above,             A related

form of mtitiplicity                omurs through               segregation       in models of endogenous               community           imposition,
In Durlauf             (1996b)      for instance,          sufficient        disparities     in wealth and/or           education         cause well-off
families to form small homogeneous                               communities           rather than share the fixed rests with a larger,
more heterogeneous                   population,            ~t      off from the tax base and positive                        local    spillovers         which
richer, more educated                   neighbors          would have provided,                poor families again experience                    no or little
upward mobility, 2s
      Are countries           all headed towards                 the same long-run              distribution        of income,        as in Proposition
8, or are there permanently                          different       trajectories         in terms of both           level and inequality,                as in

Proposition            9? I shall argue in Section                    5 that this issue of convergence                 in distribution            is of even
broader        interest      and merits to be investigated                        empirically,        then take the first few steps in that
direction.         But first I turn to the last of the three main theories linking distribution                                             and growth.



4         Social Conflict                        and Property                       Rights

In the median voter model (at least when taken literally),                                       expropriation        occurs through             an orderly
process:        votes are aunted,                  then everyone              submits      to the majority          rule.   At the other extreme
are models             where agents or interest groups can simply grab part c)f someone                                          else’s wealth.            It is
generally        praumed            that this becomes                more likely when the gap between                       rich and poor           widens,
and that the resulting                  decline in the security                  of property      rights discourages            investment,         thereby

impeding          growth,

      A number            of related         ideas have been formalized                    in the literature.         Grossman           (1991),     (1994),
Acemoglu           (1995),        and Grossman              and Kim           (1996)      focus on the allocation             of resources          between
productive,            predatory       and defensive             activities      in the context       of one–shot       interactions          between        in-
dividuals        or -nomic             classes.       Using “dynamic              commons        problem”      games with either Markovian
or trigger–type            strategies,         Tornell and Velasco (1992), Tornell (1994) and Benhabib                                   and Rustichini
(1996) study how growth is affected by distributional                                      wnflict    between       long-lasting         interest groups
or coalitions.           The first two papers emphasize                          the role and sources of interest                     groups’     ability to

opportunistically             extract          rents from others;             the y do not directly         deal with inequality.                 Benhabib
and Rustichini             (1996) show how the extent to which social conflict                               constrains         growth may depend

on the economy’s              level of development,                  as well as on a form of inequality                 which relates to equilib-

sorting     effects,   as well as Maskin         and Kremer         (1994)    on segregation     by skills in tile labor market.         In tile latter    case,
when segregation          occurs     it is always     efficient.     But     if one combined     this ]]roduction     model    with credit-constrained

      I shall seek here to convey                        the essence of this literature                     and make some new points by means
of a very simple model,                     which relates the underlying                          structure     of the problem              to a familiar object:

the prisoner’s               dilemma.        The model has close links to that of Benhabib                                       and Rustichini               (1996) but

Consider           an mnomy               constituted           by two homogeneous                  groups of agents, labelled                     1 and 2; allowing
for n groups would be straightforward.                                       In period        t each can choose to either moderate                              its claims
to the economic                pie (“cooperate”)                     or try and extract             a disproportionate                 amount,        at the expense
of the other group                (“deviate”).               Formally, let kt be the economy’s                       capital stock at the start of the
period.         The consumption                     of groups          1 and 2 are given by the following                         shares of kt :

When both sides moperate,                            a total of ct = (1 –~ ) k~ is consumed,                         while       5k~    is reinvested          according
to the linear technolog:

~ O is at the direct expense                          of the other group’s                    consumption.         Following            most of the literature,

it is resumed                that transfers             or rents unilaterally                   extracted       from      the rest of society                   can only
be mnsumed.29                   The underlying                  motivation           is that otherwise            they could            be seized back by the

opposite          side.       That        consumption             is less vulnerable              to expropriation               than investment                 does not

(1992).     One could also introduce                 into the model direct or opportunity                 costs of engaging            in expropriation,         by making
non-cooperative              payoffs sum to 1-           than        (1 — s)k~ +      6i5kt. Thus deviator        i’s private          gain (net of resources           spent
on expropriation)             fli5k~ could        be strictly        less than      the sum of the other        side’s   (net)     consumption          loss, say piskt,
and the reduction             in investment,          6i~kl.    I shall not do m for simplicity,               thus imposing           ~i = pi + 6i. All costs           and
payoffs in the stage            game      are of course         specified     exogenous]y;        to endogenize      them WOUIC1re[luire              morlelling      agents’

levies or outright        theft implies that not all of the deviator’s                      gain need come from investment,                        as
is often assumed         in the literature;       pi and 6i are conceptually                  distinct,     and will be seen below to
have different       implications.
      On net, a unilateral         deviation      by some group z reduces the capital                         stock by a factor              1 – 8;.
In a situation       of open mnflict         where both           groups      try to appropriate           resources         from each other
they will be lead to overconsume                even more: for simplicity                I assume that under (D, D) all capital

is consumed,        ~1 + 72 = 1, but this is not essential                      for the nature of the results.                  The shares 7;
represent     each side’s strength          in the political          struggle,      that is, its power.        They could be related
to the ~i’s and pi ‘s, as dscussed             later on, but in general need not be.30 Let me assume from here
on that ~i(l        – S) — (@_i — 6_i)5         < ~i for all i, which implies that the unique equilibrium                                     of the
one-shot      game is (D, D), Consider,                however,     agents who are infini tely–lived,                  with preferences

where I/a      > 1 is the intertemporal            elasticity       of substitution         and p rl ‘a < 1. In each period                    they
play the game described              by the above payoffs.                The capital       stock kt constitutes              a state variable
which makes this a dynamic                  game, rather than simply                   a repeated      one.    I begin         by focusing        on

the “first–best”        case where there is only one group,                         or equivalently       a central          planner        who can
carry out lump–sum             transfers.     Starting       with k. = k, playing                 (C~,(~) in every period              yields the

intertemporal        utility   U = u(5) kl–a/(l           – a), where

                                                                         (1-~)1-a
                                                         U(5) =                                                                                 (31)
                                                                    1 – p(7”5)l-a”

The growth mte is constant                and equal to r5.                This strategy       is preferable      to (D, D),            where the

entire capital      stock is consumed          immediately,           if u(s) > u(O) = 1. As depicted                  on Figure 1 for the
case r = 3, p = .4, a = .25, the function                 u(.) is strictly concave            and maximized            at s’ ~ pll” rl/”-l.

This is the value which the planner would choose if he could select the savings rate continuously,

One could let s = 5*, but more generally                     I will simply require that s belong                      to the interval (Z, 1)
over which u(s) > 1, so that T5 is indeed the best of the two growth rates achievable                                            in our simple
mnomy.         The main question            is whether           it can be sustained              as a subgame        perfect       equilibrium
when groups have the ability to behave opportunistically                               and extract        more than their cooperative
share from the mmmon               pool of resources. 31

4.2       Income     Inequality,            Power Inequality                   and Growth

Playing     (D, D) in every period           is always an equilibrium.              This high-mnflict,             low–growth       outcome

will naturally     serve as the punishment                to which players                  revert whenever       someone      has deviated

from cooperative         behavior.       These      trigger strategies         will sustain the first best if, for all i,

The first term on the right hand side is group i’s current consumption                                    when it deviates         and grabs

extra rmour-        equal to a fr~tion              ~i~ of the capital stock.                 The second term measures             its payoff

in the following        period      where both       groups play D, liquidating                   the capital     stock,      Rewriting    this

condition     leads to:

      Several interesting         results can now be obtained                  by examining           condition     (32),     which is illus-

trated on Figure 1.




                                                                    29
       (1)    Incentive        compatibility                typically         holds       when s is low enough,                      and is violated                   at high
enough values, This implies that there is a maitnu?n                                             stainable             growth rate which is constrained

by confict          over the distribution                  of income,          as in Benhabib              and Rustichini              (1996).            This maximum
growth rate rs~=                falls as maxi {~i/a;                    } or maxa{~i/ai}              rise. 32

       (2)    Growth        becomes        harder to sustain when some (or both)                                     group’s      ability to expropriate                    the
other through              unilateral,      opportunistic                deviations         is dispmpotiio?~ate                to its “normal”                 share of the
economic           pie: for any given 5, (32) ceases to hold as ~i/ai                                        becomes         large enough.                 Gnsequently,

s~~      declines.

       (3)    Inwrne         inquality        also limits the emnomy’s                           growth       rate, for a given allocation                           of power
and expropriating                ability.          For instanm               if @l = ~z and ~ =                       1/2,     the incentive                compatibility
mnstraint           is binding      for the group with the smaller income share, al < a2. Deviations                                                               come from
the poor,          and are more likely the poorer                           they are. In this case it may be in the interest of the rich

to voluntarily             transfer     wealth to the poor through                              land reform,          education             subsidies,         a minimum
wage, or trade protection:                       group        2 is better          off if its own share a2 can be permanently                                          reduced

to increase          al.    This scenario,                formalized         by Grossman              (1994),         (1995) in a static context,                        arises
here from the desirability                   of growth.

       (4)    However,         it could          be the poor                who are relatively               more vulnerable                     to expropriation                or
exploitation;          one can think of small peasants                                   versus large. landowners.                     If PI/al             = ~2/a2         but
~1 /al       < T2/a2,        for instance,               it is the rich’s threat to deviate                         which reduces                accumulation,             The
model        thus makes clear that what                                matters       is not inequality              in the (equilibrium)                      distribution

of income per se, as often claimed                                in the literature,             but inequality              in the relative               distribution          of

earning and political power:                       sin~       al + a2 = ~1 + 72 = 1, the minimal value of maxi {~i/ai},                                                  which

maximizes            growth,     is 1. 33 Note             also        that the important                 role played by off-the                     equilibrium–path

payoffs is a potential                problem            for the empirical               implementation              of such gametheoretic                         models.        I
shall return to it below.

       (5) The more of the expropriation                                comes from capital,                as opposed          to other people’s                   consump-
tion, the easier it is to sustain cooperation:                                   vi is decreasing             in d;.


  32For instance           as s tends     to zero,        u(5)     =    1 + p(r5)1 ‘“       >   1 + p(rs(l     – 6~)(~i/~~))’          ‘a    x    vi(s)     as long as (1 –
6i)(~i/~)      <     1. Conversely,       u(1)       =    O < vi(l)         always     and u@)        =    1 < ~i(i)       whenever         fli/~i     >     1. In the game
described     here there are only two sustainable growth rates, rs and zero.                                        But    suppose     now that            there    is in fact    a
continuum          of such games,       indexed          by s, which        can be played;        all other     parameters        are invariant.              Among      values
of 6 for which cooperation can be sustained, both groups will prefer the one with the constrained-optimal growth
rate, 5“’ S min{s” ,5ma. }. They will also be unanimous in preferring the s’” game to any other with a single,
uncooperative         equilibrium      if u(s’”)      > m~i{(~;/~i)            1‘“}.     If this condition      is not satisfied       the Pareto           frontier   includes
both     the s’*    and the zero-growth             outcomes.
  33 Deviations       by the rich also occur              in Barbosa,        Jovanovic      and Spiegel (1996),             but the context           is different.      Agents
with stochastic        endowments         enter      into an ex–ante           efficient    income        sharing    agreement.         Ex–post,           they may renege
and fight over the appropriation                   of total      r-urces.        Their    decisions       are based       on current        payoffs only.

4.3       Empirical          Evidence

The findings        from most studies which have examined                           the links between            inequality,     mnflict     over
property       rights,     and growth         are summarized             in columns        (9) and (10) of Table            2.    Two      broad
m-ures         of “instability”         or “insecurity”         have been considered.               The first consists           of indices    of
sociopolitiml       instability      constructed           from various mmbinations                of protests,      strikes, government
turnover,      political     violence,       mups,        revolutions,        and the like (e.g.,        Venieris     and Gupta         (1986),
Londregan        and Poole         (1990),     Alesina       and Perotti         (1996),     Alesina,     Olzer     and Roubini         (1996),
Perotti      (1996)).     Because       of the potential] y serious simultaneity                  problem      most studies estimate              a
joint model of growth and instability.                     The other form of “instability”               is more directly linked to the
issue of property          rights. It is measured            by various indicators            of “country      risk” sold by specialized
fires   to international          investors,      such as sovereign             default    risk, expropriation         or nationalization
risk, rule of law, enforceability              of contracts,      quality of the bureaucracy,                corruption,       and so on; see

Keefer and Knack             (1995),     Svensson         (1993) or Barro          (1996).      Column      (9) shows that both             types
of security      deteriorate       as a result of increased               income      inequality.        In turn,     column      (10) shows
that both       greater     political     turmoil     and lower protection                of property       rights decrease       investment

and growth,         The general idea that inequality                      exacerbates        social conflict,       which in turn makes
property       rights less secure            and reduces        growth        thus appears        well supported        by the evidenm;
indeed it is eminently           plausible.      The specific channels through which this occurs,                          however,     remain
to be clearly      identified,       Svensson        (1993) finds that when both political                    instability      and property

rights variables are included                in investment       regressions,       only the latter are significant;             on the other
hand, greater political           stability     implies more secure property                  rights, as does a more equal income
distribution.           Keefer   and Knack          (1995)     report     that     when one controls             for initial     GDP       in the

investment       equation,       political     instability     becomes         insignificant.
      I also wrote support          for “the general idea” rather than “the models”                           because the link between

the latter and intuitive           or empirical       notions      of social or political          instability     is still somewhat         ten-
uous. This can be seen from the representative                           model presented           above.     First, note that contrary
to mmmon          interpretation,         unurt aint y or unpredictability                   is really not pati        of the story.         The
mechanism        formalized       here and in most of the literature                  is not one where greater inequality                  leads,
through      more acute political             conflict,     to a mean–preserving                spread in the return to investment
(and even this is known to have an ambiguous                         effect).      It has no up-side        and thus leads, ve~            muclt
m in the voting modeZs, to a lower mean return due increased expropriation,                                         or the threat thereof.
Second,      with perfect        information       about      actions     ancl payoffs,       equilibrium      is achieved       without      any

“friction”     or resource        dissipation,       Just as there is no reason for delay to occllr                         in a bargaining

model     with symmetric           information,           there is no role in these models               for strikes, riots, coups,           as-
sassinations,      etc.     Incorporating         incomplete       information,           as for instance        in Alesina      and Drazen
(1991), will generate delays and resource-dissipating                            struggles along the equilibrium               path; but the
extent to which these occur                  will reflect not so much the distribution                      of income       (and power)        as
the extent of agents’            uncertainty       over what this distribution                  is. Why the two should be related


                                                                         31
is not obvious,              Given imperfect                information,         resources        would be dissipated                    as well in standard
politiml        economy            models:        the voter who turns out to be pivotal                              (say, median)               will eventually

have his way, but only after costly political                                 campaigns,        lobbying           and legislative             maneuvers.           This
will make the two types of model a little more similar yet, as would the incorporation                                                                of strategic,

dynamic         mncerns            into the voting model:                reputation        of the pivotal class for fiscal restraint,                         trigger
strategies        on the part of the private sector,                          and so on.



5        Convergence:                           On to Second Moments                                         (and Higher)

Are muntries             mnverging             to the same level of inequality?                        This question             may seem unusual,                   and
indeed it has not been taken up by the empirical                                     literature.       Yet it is important,                on several counts,
First, ascertaining                the facts is in itself of interest.                    It is common             knowledge           that Latin American
muntries         tend to be more unequal                       than European               ones, themselves               less equal than East–Asian
on-.        Similarly,       the specter of U, S.–style inequality                         is often used in Europe                     to justify        high levels

of redistribution              and minimum                  wages.      But are all these gaps really permanent,                                   or inexorably
narrowing?34

       %nd,         it can shed light on the relevance of models                                  with multiple            steady–states             and history–
dependence           of the inmme                distribution,            In particular,          it provicles           an indirect           test of the joint
mechanisms           of credit market inmmpleteness                            and negative            feedback          from inequality            to social mo-
bility which underlie these theories,                            as explained          in Section        3.6.
       Third,      there is now a vast empirical                          literature       examining            international            convergence              in per
capita incomes.              This variable is after all only the first mo?nent of each collntry’s                                               income distribu-
tion.    Once augmented                  with idiosyncratic               shocks, most versions of the neoclassical                                growth model

imply        conve~ence             i~l distn”bution:           countries       with the same fundamentals                             should       tend towards
the same invariant distribution                           of wealth and pretax                 income. 35 Barring unexplained                            differences

in “tmtes”          for equity          or in the distribution                 of innate abilities,              persistent          differences         in the de-

gree of inequality                 would       mnversely         indicate       the presence           of some form of increasing                         return or
mmplementarity                 in the mnornic                or politioeconomic                structure.


    34~k~g         at OECD           ~oun~ri=      in the     l~gO’S, Gottscllalk         and Smeeding          (1995)     find no relation         between        initial
levels of inequality         and chang=          in inequality      during    the 80’s.    If anything,       there is some evidence              of polarization       at
the extremm,        of the type suggested             by Proposition         9. The largest       incre~s       occurred      in the UI{        and the [JS, which
had the highest          initial    levels, su~-ting          that these countri=          may be converging             to a high inequality          steadyatate.
The small~t        incre=           occurred     in Italy,    France,     Portugal     and Denmark;           thus Denmark             could    be converging        to a
low inequality       steady=tate.             While    this exercise      provides     valuable     information,          it suffers     from    being    based     on a
small number of eountri~,   several of which are observed over a very short interval of time.
  qssee for instanm  Banerjee    and Newman (1991),     Ayagari (1994), Bertola  (1995)  or the c=                                                 without        credit–

constraints      in Piketty        (1996)     for examples       of this ergodicity        property.        Some    of these     models         even include       credit
rationing      (agents     can     borrow      less than     what    they     muld    repay    with    probability        one)   but     the feedback        from     the
wealth      distribution      to credit       constraints     discussed      in Section     3.6 is either       absent     because       the latter      are specified
exogenously,       or as the economy             grows      it becomes       too weak to generate           multiplicity      (Aghion          and Bolton     (19M)).
Departing       from homothetic             preferences     by introducing       a minimum        consumption         level w in Cbatterjee              (1994)    could
probably      lead to history dependence,                 but the stochastic         version   of that      model   still remains        to be studied.

    Having raised the question                         of mnvergence             in higher moments,                    I shall make here a first pass
at trying to answer it. Ideally, one would apply to an international                                                    panel of inequality             measures
the same tests which are now standard                                   in the literature                on the mnvergence                  of first moments:
regressing      rates of change                on initial       values, examining                   whether          cross–sectional           dispersion       falls

over time (Barro               (1991),     Barro         and Sala–i-Martin                (1992)),         or the more complex                  tests of Quah
(1993) and Durlauf and Johnson                            (1995).    The binding              constraint,            however,       is data:    no such panel
exists over a long enough                  period.         The closest substitute                  is a new data base recently                      put together

by Deininger          and Squire (1995a).                 It significantly            expands        the coverage           of previous        data sets, both
over time and over countries,                         to the extent that one can think of it as a panel with (still many)

missing wlls.         I shall also use data for a sample of OECD                                    countries         from the Luxembourg                  Income
Study (LIS). It mntains                  far fewer observations                 but considerable               effort has been devoted                 to making
the numbers           comparable          across countries.
    I start with a bird’s                eye view of the issue, by comparing                                the seven main regions of the world
for which Deininger               and Squire (1995a) provide                      summary               statistics    on inequality:           Latin America,
Sub-Saharan           Africa,          Middle        East and North Africa,                   East Asia/Pacific,                  South Asia, OECD              and
High Income,           and Eastern Europe.                   For each region they constructed                               decaclal averages of various

inequality      measures,          by averaging             all available observations                     from the 1960’s to the 1990’s.                     From
these numbers            I computed             both      the world average and the cross-regional                                   standard       deviation      of

each inequality          measure,          These are report ed in Table 3.

    While      these are somewhat                      crude statistics,              they point          to some interesting                facts.36      For the
mean     level of inequality               in the world             the picture           is one of relative                 stability;      some      small and


  36 One would want             to weigh regions         by population         or income,         for instance.       The       “adjusted   Gini”     in the second
column   of Table 3 refers to an adjustment                  made by Deiuinger            and Squire (1995a)            to observations        bawd     on expendi-
ture rather    than income         surveys.     The former      typically       bias the Gini coefficient             downward.       The adjustment        consists



                                                                                  33
gradual        improvement                is visible until the 1980’s,                    after which the situation                   starts to deteriorate.
Cross-regional              variations         in inequality,          on the other hand, show a clear decline.                                      The coefficient

of variation          falls by 1970 for the Gini mefficients,                             30% for the shares of the bottom                            quintile,    22%
for the shares of the third and fourth quintiles and 37% for the share the top quintile.                                                                   Note also
that almost all of this “convergent”                              occurred           between       the 1970’s and 1980’s.37
      I next went to the full sample and ran simple convergence                                              tests for the Gini coefficients                      across
individual          countries,        to the extent permitted                  by the data. I chose the Gini rather than particular
shar=      or share ratios because                      it was available for more observations,                             and because              it relates more
directly       to the transition               equation        (28) in the formal                model, 3s In the first test I computed                              for

ewh     muntry           the average yearly rate of change in the Gini coefficient                                           between          the first and last
available observations.                    I then ran a regression                   of this variable on a constant                    and the initial value
of the Gini. The results are reported                             in Table 4, for four samples.

      The first sample                consists          of the 69 countries                for which I was able to compute                               the rate of

change, 39 The second                     one is perhaps           the most reliable:               it restricts         attention       to the 25 countries

for which           the data are most comparable,                            having        been         obtained       from similar            types      of surveys
(gross household                 income),           The third one consists                 of the 19 OECD                  countries     in the full sample.
It is complemented                  by the LIS data set, where I was able to perform                                         the same regression                  on 16

muntries;           the typical time interval is much shorter, however.                                     The results are consistent                    across the
four columns:              the negative             and generally         significant         signs indicate            mean–reversion                in inequality.

To redua            the chanm             that these results were due to measurement                                    error on the first observation


of adding      to the Gini the average               size of the bias, which Deininger                  and Squire     compute       to be about        6.6 Yo in their
data set.
  3TGiven that           there    are onlY ~ven         observations      in eac]l c=,        tbe differences         in standard     deviations        ‘r coefficients

of variation        documented        in Table       3 are, unsurprisingly,          not statistically      significant.     In my view this does not make
them any less intriguing, especially in the light of tbe other eviclence discussed below.
  38For a log_normal,    the Gini is a monotonic    function of the variance of the 10gs A?. I also ran manY of ‘lle

regressions with the logarithms of the Ginis instead of the levels. This led to similar results.
   39~tncting   the sample to th-    countri~  where at le~t ten years sel]arate the first and last oblsemations                                                   leads

to throwing         out nine data         points,    with essentially     unchanged          rcsu]ts.



                                                                                     34
(which bias-        the wefficient         towards      negative    values),        I ran the regression     with the exact same
right–hand–side        variables but replacing            the left–hand         side by the average rate of change between

the s~ond       and last available observations.             For the first three subsamples               the inefficient        remained
virtually    unchanged         and st artistically significant         (t–stat ist ics ranged from 1,9 to 3, O). For the LIS

data set, it bmme              positive     and insignificant;        however,       that regression      contained       only    12 data
points   (with the trend often mmputed                    over dates separated              by just a few years) as opposed             to
betw~n       18 and 62 for the Deininger                and Squire data set.
    One problem        with this test is that inequality              and i ts rate of change are computed                over different
periods for different countries.             The incompleteness             of the data set does not permit one to run the

standard       cross–sectional      regression      over a fixed, ten or twenty year period.                 To generate          a usable
panel it is nassary             to interpolate        some missing          data,     This is what I did, using neighboring

observations       when required to obtain Gini coefficients                    for 1970, 1980 and 1990. I was then able to
run inequality       mnvergence           regressions    for the periods         1970–1 980 (Table        5a, 33 countries),        198&
1990 (Table 5b, 38 muntries)                 and 1970-1990         (Table 5c, 25 countries).            The first mlurnn presents
the basic regression       of the change in the Gini on the initial value and a constant.                             The coefficient
is negative      and significant          at the 5% level for 197&l 980, similar in size but significant                          only at
the 107o level for 1980-1990,               and small and insignificant               for 1970–1 990.      One sourw         of concern
is that the data from different               muntries      may not be directly             comparable.      Some numbers            come
from expenditure        surveys, others from income surveys; some pert ain to household                               income,       others
to personal      income;   finally, most concern            gross inmme,            but some are for net (after tax) figures.40

I deal with this issue in three different                 ways, all of which lead to similar results.                 First, I include
in the regression       dummy         variables      for observations           generated     from expenditure        data,      personal
inmme       data and net inmme             data (expdum,       perdum         and netdum);       the results are reported           in the
smnd        mlumn    of Table 5. Alternatively,             I first regTess both the initial and final Gini coefficients
on these dummies           (evaluated         at the relevant         years),     then run the regression           on the residuals
(“dginires”,      third column        of each table).       Finally, I run the regression               on the subset of countries
which used gross family             income        for both dates.          These results, given in the “Sample               3“ column
of each table,      are very similar to the previous                  ones.     Once again there. is significant            evidence    of

inequality      mnvergence        from 1970 to 1980, much less so from 1980 to 1990 and none at all for the
whole period        1970 to 1990.

    One problem         which might explain the puzzling                     discrepancy      between     the first two results and
the last one is that the data for ewh subperiod                        are for different       subsets of countries,        I therefore

reran    the regressions,        with and without          dummies,         on yet another      subsample      consisting        of the 24
muntries       for which 1970, 1980 and 1990 observations                       were available (either from the original data
or by interpolation).           The results are presented              under the heading          “Sample     2“.     Once again the
estimates      are all negative,      with a drop in significant                but not in magnitude         from the first decade
to the semnd,         and a drop          in both     when moving            to the full twenty–years         period.       A possible

explanation            would for some countries                   to go from above to below the mean (say) during the first

decade,       then move back above during the second one, In the fourth,                                            much smaller subsample               of

OECD          countries,          by wntrast,          the evidence         of mean-reversion            seems stronger            in terms of both
magnitude          and stability              across    periods.       Overall,        the regressions            reported      in Tables         5a to 5C

insistently            point to some mean–reversion                       between      1970 and 1980, but the picture                   for the other
periods       is much less clear.               It is interesting         to recall that in Table 3, the dispersion                      of inequality

across major             regions      of the world experienced                   most of its decline              between       the 1970’s and the
1980’s.       koking         across individual             countries,       however,       one sees no evidenw                 of any narrowing          in
the range of Ginis. The standard                         deviation        (sdev),     reported     in the last two lines of Table 5, shows

no virtually           no change during any of the two decades under considerate ion.
     The general picture                  which emerges            at the end of this empirical                   exercise    is thus a mixed one:
general stability            in the world distribution                of Ginis, within which countries                      and regions seem to be
experiencing            some non–negligible               amount       of relative       mobility.       The question           of whether         there is

actual convergence                 or whether countries             oscillate       around dist inet long–run               levels of inequalit y still
awaits a definite               answer.         This is perhaps        not surprising            given the rather preliminary                  nature of
the analysis and, above all, the limitations                              of the data.41 My main purpose,                      however,       was to put

forward the issue of convergence                        in distribution         as an important           and essentially          unexplored         topic
for empirical           research.       Hopefully,        future studies with more sophisticated                        econometrics          and better
data (looking            across states or regions as in Barro and Sala-i-Martin                                    (1992))     will help resolve the
issue.
     Two related             empirical          questions        also deserve        serious investigation.             One, motivated             in par-
ticular      by Proposition             9, is whether            there is so to speak            “convergence          in redistribution”.             Are
countries,       or even industrialized                countries,     converging        to the same relative size of the welfare state,

or are there permanent                   differences       in the social contr~t?                Evidence         on OECD         countries       provided
by Lindert             (1996)      suggests       the latter,       but more          formal     tests on larger samples               are needed.42
Another         broad       issue is whether            educational,         fiscal, or other forms of progressive                     redistribution
xtually        increase           mobility,      a   formalized       in equation          (27) and suggested                by most      models      with

imperfect        capital          markets.       Recent     work by Cooper              (1996)     studying        the effect of state financing
of education            on the intergenerational                 mobility    of families in poor communities                      suggests     a positive
answer.        Mulligan           (1995), on the other hand, finds only mixed evidence                               that borrowing          constraints

affect the transmission                  of inequality.




   41In particular,        I have only looked at unconditional              convergence.       The l]otential     effects of develo]]ment      on inequal-
ity (e.g.,    the Kuznets         hypothesis)     and the reverse     links from inequality        to growth      studied    in this pal)er sugg=t     that
the dynamics           of mean income         and income     inequality     should    be examined      jointly.

6        Conclusion

Non representativ~agent                 growth      theory    has developed              so rapiclly in recent years that this tour
is necessarily         incomplete.      First, I focused         only on the effects of income                       or wealth inequality             on
growth,      rather than the reverse.              The first model’s              income        distribution        evolved       endogenously        in

response      to credit mnstraints            and policy        outmmes,          but due to the homotheticity                        of preferences,
technology        and policy        it WM not affected          by the economy’s                 level of development.                I thus entirely
abstracted       from the Kuznets             (1955)    hypothesis,           except      when discussing                the role of fixed rests.
This choim            reflects both    sp=        constraints        and a waning interest                 in the Kuznets             curve,    arising
from its lack of empirical              support     in most remnt studies,                     Similar homogeneity               properties      in the

s-rid       model       precluded      me from examining               whether         sociopolitical          conflict      and extensive        rent-
seeking are diseases more likely to afflict poor countries                              or rich ones (see Benhabib                   and Rustichini

(1996)).      Another       level-dependent          effect of income             distribution          arises in the ‘(big push”               theory
formalized       by Murphy,         Shleifer and Vishny (1989).                 If industrialization             requires a sufficiently          large

domestic       market       to make increasing           returns       technologies            profitable,       excessive       concentration            of
wealth may represent              an obstacle        to growth.          The relevant constraint,                   however,         is the absolute
mnomic         weight of the middle class, which in a large country                                like Inclia is considerable              even with
very high inequality.             Keefer     and Knack          (1995)        test the “big push”               mechanism            by including         in
growth regressions           measures of market size such as population,                             total GDP, and openness                 to trade,
both by themselves            and interacted         with income distribution.                     They find no support               for the theory
in their data.           An empirically        more successful           direction         of research          concerns       the links between
income      distribution,       fertility,    and development.             Perotti       (1996)      finds that a greater income                  share
of the middle           CISSShas a strong           negative      effect       on fertility,        and this in turn has a significant
positive     impact on growth.           I did not discuss this mechanism                       due to space constraints                and because

there is yet no well worked                  out theory      of distribution,            fertility     and grcjwth which can robustly
generate      these mrrelations,              Among     the models             which have begin                 to formalize          some of these

links, moreover,          the kind of wealth constraints                 on educational             investment           which were extensively
mnsidered        in Section      3 often play a critical             role (e.g., Galor and Zang (1993)).
      Even for the three main theories which were examined                                     in some depth, the analysis necessarily
involved      a number        of simplifications.         For ancision            I abstracted          from i nheritecl ability, dynastic
altruism, occupational            choice and effort decisions of workers, ent reprenellrs or rent–seekers,                                      as well
as from spillovers          and non~onvexi           ties of any kind. All these elements                        have been incorporated                   in
the literature,         and their role mentioned             at various points in the paper.
      Where      do we go from here?              The political        economy          and imperfect            capital       market models         are

now well understood               and have reached            the quantitative                 stage. 43       While       further     developments


    43 See for instance     Krusell,   Quadrini     and Rfos–Rfill       (l W),       (1995)    in the first     case,     Fern andez    ancl Rogerson
(1994)    and B6nabou        (1995b)    in the WOnd.         There     also    many     quantitative       models      where    liquidity   constraints
impede     consumption=rno          othing but not invmtment         (e. g., Ayagari     (1994),     Bertola    (1995)),     hut their ]]roperties    are
rather   different.



                                                                         37
(perhaps          in relation             to fertility            or technolog)                    will surely prove valuable,                            the gap between                       the
swpe          of the theoretical                    literature          and the scarcity                    of direct            evidence         makes further                    empirical

work a high priority:                       signs of the adverse effects of redistribution                                               on growth              remain elusive                   (to

put it mildly),                 and inferences                about          the role of credit constraints                             far too indirect.                  With         respect
to sociopolitiml                  conflict,         there remains               room for theoretical                           and empirical                 work to move closer
to one another.                 Existing            models provide               many valuable insights but few robust results about the
effects of income inequality                            on mfiict,             whether mnflict                    will be open or latent (off the equilibrium
path),         fully predictable                 or uncertain.               On the empirical                  side, the vatiances                      of policy             and property
rights variables should be included                                    in the regressions,                    so as to determine                       whether           it is instability
or just the average level of extra–legal                                        redistribution                 that matters.                   Examining                 the interaction
between          mnomic               inequality            and inequality                of political               power in determining                         the occurrence                   of
open ~tict                 also seems desirable.
        Coming          full circle, it is tempting                          to conclude               by asking:              which of the theories                      linking distri-

bution         and growth              considered              in this paper best shed light on the experiences                                                       of South              Korea

and the Philippines?                         While          this is not a substitute                          for detailed              csse studies                 (see for example
Rodrik          (1995) on Korea and Taiwan),                                  one would expect                     the most relevant mechanisms                                    to clearly
show up in basic indicators                               such as those compiled                           by Barro and Wolf                      (1989).             Once again, the
pure political              economy              hypothesis            of excessive               redistributive               pressure emanating                        from the poor,
whether          through           the ballot box or the street, does not fare well. Public                                                            transfers in Korea were
low but still two-and-a                           half times higher than in the Philippines:                                             3.71%           versus          1.46%         of    GDP

on     average         between            1970      and       1980.      ~ucation                 expenditures                show      the     same         pattern,           with        shares

of     5,13%      and       1.97%         respectively.           44     While         the        Philippines’               government              redistributed               much          less,

it    mnsumed              a little        more:          1.66%        of     GDP,       versus            1.58%         in     South         Korea.           These          numbers           are

broadly         wnsistent             with        the     creditwnstrained                         human        capital          accumulation                  hypothesis,              and      in-

deed      Korea’s          educational              investment              skyrocketed             past      that       of the      Philippines:              the     enrollment              rate

in secondary              education              went      from       42%      in 1960            to 95%       in 1985,          as opposed             to     50%       to    65%       for    the

Philippines.              Similarly,          for    tertiary          education             Korea’s          1965       enrollment             rate     of 6%           was     far    behind

the     Philippines’              19Yo;     by      1992      roles      were     reversed,             with         rates      of 42%         and      28%       respectively.                An-

other      likely       piece      of the        puzzle        is the        Philippines’              much        higher        fertility       rate        (5.55%           versus        3.6070

between          1965       and     1985),          although           the    extent         to    which       it reflects           economic           as opposed               to cultural

factors        is unclear.          Turning             now     to theories          of social          conflict         and      property           rights,       political           instabil-

ity    does      not     appear        very        relevant        in this inst ante, as the two countries                                      experienced               similarly            high

levels of turmoil.                 The Philippines                    had more revolutions                         and political               assassinations,                 Korea more
riots, coups,             government                crises and constitutional                           changes.              Their indices of political                         rights and

protection          discussed earlier (rule of law, enforceability                         of contracts,      expropriation           risk, mrruption,
etc. ), on the other hand, put Korea distinctly                             ahead. 46 This general security of property                          rights was

probably        instrumental           not only in creating             a favorable           climate     for business         investment,         but also
in inducing          Korean households             to entrust much of their considerable                         savings to a stat~controlled
banking       system,       which in turn channeled                   credit towards the industries                    deemed          strategic        by the

government,           without    excessive         dissipation        along the way.

Proof of Proposition            1
    Let us first study the properties              of the function          V(7)    defined        by (12).     ~early,      (13) implies
that it has a unique, global maximum                 at ~ = O. Moreover,

                                            v“(T)                 1 +pp(l      – 72)
                                                                                                                                     (Al)
                                         ‘—= PP          (1 -T)2(1        +pp(l         -T))2


is positive   if and only if 72 < 1 + l/p~.              Thus V is strictly             concave         on the policy     domain     (z, 1),
where z -     –~~.                  By (11), individual       i’s utility function              U;(7)    is of the form V(~)        + (1 +

p) ln(A + Bi~)       and therefore     also strictly concave           on (z, 1). The envelope               theorem    then yields the
claims which follow equation            (11 ), as well as Proposition              1.

Proof of Proposition 3
    The result for taxation           was proved in the text.           Next, note from (9) that




For A small enough,         ~2r/~A~A        was seen to be negative,               and the fact that           dT/dA      is proportional
to A makes the second           term again dominated              by the first; hence the result,                 Similar derivations

apply to intertemporal         efficiency    V.

Proof of Proposition 4
    The first claim follows           directly    from    (22).    Differentiating          this equation         and using        (6) also
impli-   that                                                                           .
                                                                                                                                     (A.2)


Since the left side is increasing         in ~, g increases with r up to some 79(A)                          E [z, 1), then decresses.

This maximum          is interior    (and increasing      in A) if and only if


                                             (1- P)A2> (1           -Z)2;1         +PP)’                                             (A,3)



As z < –1,      it suffices for instance          that (1 – @)A2         > 1/(4 + 8p~).             The growth-maximizing               tax
rate is positive     if
                                                                                   1
                                          79(A)     >0~(1–~)A2                 > ~+pP.                                               (A.4)


Proof of Proposition 5
    Because W(7)          is the sum of V(T)       and a concave,         quadratic         function       of 7, it is strictly concave
on (z, 1). The same statements              hold for individual           preferences           ZJi(T), now given by (24).             The

social and (interior)       private optima        are thus respective] y defined by W’(~)                     = O and ZJ’i(7) = O. In
the planner’s      case, (23) implies that V’(~p)           = –p@(l         – D)(1 – 7P)A2.               The fact that V is strictly


                                                                  40
mncave       and maximized        at zero then yields Claim 1, while Claim 2 follows from setting in w; = m
in the first-order        condition     U’i (~) = O derived              from    (25).    Next,     let ra be the preferred                           tax of
the agent with average wealth,               in w = m + A2/2.                Clearly,     ~“ < Tp if and only if U’a(~p)                                <0,
which by (25) is equivalent             to W’(rP)       + [p~2(l – 7P) – p~/2]A2                  <0,     that is, to P(1 – 7P) < 1/2.

~tivalently,       W’(I    - (29)-1)      >0,     so by (23) and (13),


                                      (1 - ~)A2                       1 – (2p)-1                                    z         4~(2~        – 1)
           7P >1   – (2p)-1     +         20
                                                       > (2p)-’(l         +pp(2~)-’)        *‘1         ‘P)*            >        2+p              ‘


hence      CZaim 3. Finally, let us show that when ~ < 1/4 there exists an interval where the tax rate
Tm set by the median voter is less inefficient                    than that set by the average agent, ~a. As A goes to
zero the median          mnverges      to the mean, and both Tm and To converge                                to the planers’              optimum,

which is 7P(O) = O. Therefore,            from (25):          W’(~a)/p~         = (1/2 –Q(l       –T”))A2           = (1/2 –@)A2                 +O(A2)
and W’(rm)/p~            = –~(1       – 7~)A2         = –@A2          + 0(A2).     Thus if ~ < 1/4 and A is small enough,
W’(~”)      > –W’ (~m), which implies (using Taylor expansions)                            that    Tp – r“      >       rm    – Tp    and therefore
W(r”)       < w(~m).

Proof of Proposition 6
    Strictmncavity of individual preferences U’(7) implies that the equilibrium                                              tax rate is uniquely
defined by the fist~rder              rendition       (26), or




as long as there is an interior            solution      ~“ (A, J) > Z. Since WA < 0 < —Vr it is clear that ~“ is
strictly    increasing     in A. Proposi tion 5 showed that maximizing                            W requires             J w > O; conversely

Aw < A because for J > A, V(O, A, J) <0                        so r“ is negative,        implying        W’(~*)          >0     since 7P(A)             >0.
The fact that growth is maximized                 at ~C > Aw is obvious;                 conversely,       as ~ increases towards the
value which makes 7* (A, ~) equal to Z, T* (A, A) falls below ~g (A),                               implying            g’ (~”) > 0. Therefore
~G is interior,     as long as (A. 3) is satisfied.              This concludes          the proof of Claim 1, which concerns
the effects of A on equilibrium            taxes r*(A,          A).
    I now turn to the effects of A on ~“, and the resulting contributions                                      to W and g. The solution

to (A,5) is interior for all A if and only if maxA{(P@)-lV’(l)                               + (1 – Z)A2            – AA}            >0,    or


                                                                                                                                                       (A.6)



which will be assumed           from here on (since z < – 1, a sufficient                         condition         is ~ 2<_ 4/(1             + 2pp)).
~uations       (A.5)     and (25) then imply:


                                           W’(T*)=               p~A(A      – P(1 – r*) A),                                                            (A.7)
                                                ~T*               2A(1 –7*)         – A
                                                —         =      –vi/(7*)/p@        + A2 “                                                            (A.8)
                                                ~A


                                                                       41
Therefore,      whenever          rising inequality       induces tax cuts, these are always inefficient:

                                                        87”
                                                        ~      <0     +     W’(T*)     >0.                                                      (A.9)


For A < 0 equations                (A.7)     and (A.8)        imply    8r*/8A          > 0 and W’(7*)              < 0, hence         g’(~’)      <0
a fortiori.      This proves          Claim 2.       For A > 0, ~7*/~A                 > 0 if and only if ~“ S 1 – J/(2 A),                            or
equivalently          W(l – A/(2A),        A, A) <0.       Substituting         (13) into (A.5),          this means


                             A/(2A)        – 1
                       (~/2A)(l     + pO~/2A)           ‘%-’A<0eA>~(’::?;:4)                                               =*m                 ‘AIO)

Note now that             (A.6)    implies       that p~A2/4        < 1, hence         ~      > 0. Therefore            r“ is U-s/~aped with
respect    to A : its declines            from r’ (O, A) = O to a minimum                    7“ <0      at ~, then rises again towards

r“(co,    A) = 1, cutting          the ~ = O axis at A = A. Finally,                    (A.5)    shows that as A ~                 +ml   ~“ tends
to one with 1 – ~“ = O/A,                  where


              –&+(l–~)A2–                         AA=      O*–A/O+               AO–     AA=      O~O–             l/0=      A,                (All)


which ha        a unique solution            O > 0 for each A. For further                    reference         note also that this limit is
reached from below:

                                                 V(A, ~) E n:,        (1    –T*(A,A))A<0.                                                      (A.12)

~t   us now turn to the efficiency                  consequences           of these variations          in ~“. By (A.8),           W’(~*)       20     if
and only if ~’ 21            – A/~A.        Equivalently,       W(l – A/(~A),           A, A) 20,         or:




     Two cases are thus possible:

     Case (i):         if A2 > @2/(1         – ~) then W’(~*)               > 0 for all A. Therefore                   on the interval          [0, A]
where taxes decre=e               with inequality,         these reductions          in ~“ are always inefficient.                  On [A, +aI)
taxes     increases       with     inequality,      although        never      sufficiently     fast.      Indeed,        one can show           that

limA+w[A(l             – 7P(A))]      =     (1 – ~)-112,       which        is less than        6 defined         in (All)         if and only         if

A2 > p2/(1       –p).

     Cue      (ii):    if A2 < ~2/(1        – ~) then W’(r*)          >0       on [0, A) and W’(T*)               <0      on (A, +m),          where



                                                                                                                                               (A,13)



Observe       now that ~ > A > A. This implies that W’(r*)                              >0      over the whole interval              [0, A] where
T“ decreases          with inequality,       and even over a strict superset of the interval [0, A] where capital is

subsidized       (~ < O). This is intuitive,               as the planner          always wants to set ~P(A)                      > 0. Only once


                                                                          42
inequality     has reached        A does it drive equilibrium              taxes ~“ (A, A) > 0 to excessively              high levels.
This mncludm            the proof of Claim 3, u far as intertemporal                        efficiency   is conmrned.

    It only remains            to mnsider      the growth      effects of ~r*/dA,              that is, the sign of g’(~”).          Using
(A.2)   and (A.5)       one can write, as long as ~“ # O,

                        (1 - r*)A2     -    AA
 g’(~’)
     >0 e                                         < (1    –@)A2     @     T*[A/A
                                                                               – (1           – ~“)(1    – (1 –P)r”)]      >0.      (A.14)
                           7“(1 – 7*)


Note first that in the neighborhood                  of A = 0+, where ~ R 0–, this condition                        is never sat isfiecl.
This is intuitive       sinm the losses from heterogeneity                are of s-rid         order in A2, whereas the induced
tax effects on savings are of first order.                  Next, mnsider           the condition        in the neighborhood          of A
defined by (A.1O), where T* = 1 – A/(2~)                      <0:


             g’(T*(A,    A))     >    0 e     2<1    – (1 –p)(l          –A/(2A))       e      ~         <    1 ‘A2’4      #
                                                                                                             1 – ppA2/4

                                                                                                                                    (A.15)


It is easily shown that the righ-hand                 side is smaller than that of (A.6) if and only if (1 –~) Izl >1,
or equivalently         (1 — ~)2 (1 + 1/p@)         > 1. This inequality            holds if and only if ~ is not too close to
one, in which case there exists a range of A’s satisfying                           (A.6)    such that g’(~*(A,       A)) >0.      In this
parameter      configuration,        tax cuts induced        by rising inequality            just below A reduce growth,              while
tax increases which occur as A rises just above A tend to improve it. To show that this last result
is not specific to the region regressive of tipi tal subsidies                        (~” < O), let us next examine              g’ (7”)    at
A = A. Sin~        7“(A, A) = O, (A.2)           shows that:


                                       g’(7*(A,     A)) >0 e A2>
                                                                             (1-B):l+PP)”
Again     it can be shown that the right-hand                     side is greater than of (A.6)                as long as ~ is below
some fied       upper bound.         In that case there exists a range of A’s such that increases in inequality
in the neighborhood             of A = A+ generate           tax increases      to positive        levels which still improve              the
growth rate, Finally, let us mnsider                 (A. 14) as A ~        m and 1 – ~“ s O/A,               The condition       becomes
A ~ ~19, which by (Al            1) is equivalent        to A2 2 ~2/(1      – ~). When this condition               (which once more
is compatible      with (A.6)        if and only if ~ is s not too close to one) holds,                        g’(~*(A,   A)) > 0 even
asymptotically:         equilibrium        taxes increase with inequality,             but too slowly from the point of view
of maximizing       not only W but even g. men                    A2 < ~2/ (1 – ~), on the other hand, taxes eventually

increwe    too fast with rising inequality,               whether from the point of view of welfare or from that of

growth,




                                                                    43
Proof of Proposition 7
    CZaim 1 immediately                      results from Propositions                      4 and 6, or directly          from    (A.7)-(A.8),        For
A >0,      let us write out:

                                                                                       (~ -PA(1        -T*))     (2A(1   -~”)    -A)

                                 T—T’                                                             –V’’(7*)/p~        + A2               “


The numerator             of the second               term is a qutiatic                polynomial       in A whose maximal             value is [(2 –

D)(l – ~*) A]2/4.             Therefore,           (dW/dA).=T*             <0     as long as:

                         V“(T*)                                                            –v//(T*)                   1 + pp(l – T“’)

by (Al).        Now, recall from (A. 12) that A(l                               – ~“) <0       for all (A, A, ~), so the right-hand                side is
greater than 6-2 (1+ p~(l – Z) ) -2. Provided                               ~ is below this value, dW/dA                 is therefore       negative for
all (A, A). For ~ close to 1, on the other hand, it is clear that the second term in (A. 16) dominates,

By (A.7)      and (A.8) this second term is positive                              if and only if b~*/~A             >0    and W’(~*)         >0,   which
ouurs      when A E (A, A),                  where these two bounds                        are defined by (A.1O) and (Al               3) (in which ~

can be set equal to 1). This mncludes                              the proof of Claim 2.
    Consider        now growth.              First, we showed earlier that if ~2 < ~2/( 1 – ~), g’ (~”) becomes                                negative
as A bemmes              large enough.                Since 8r*/aA              > 0 for A > A and ~g/~A                  < 0 always, this proves
that dg/dA          <0    for A large enough in this c~e,                             To obtain a result which is independent                  of ~ and
to make clear the role played by @ <1,                                  let us use (A.2)        and (A. 5) to compute:

hence the first part of Claim 3. Conversely,                              one can show from (A. 18) that lim~+O[(dg/dA)T=T.                           ] =

complete     markets we,                  where ~g/ar             <0.

Proof of Proposition 8
    The asymptotic              variance     A&     =    s2/(1     — ~2(1 — T)2) associated                  to a constant       tax rate r

decreases      on the domain              (z, 1); note      in particular        that ~(1 – Z)          <      1. Let T(A)      denote     the
inverse, decreasing           function,     which maps (s2, s2/(1 —@*(l —z)*))                      into (z, 1). A steady–state          is an
intersection       of this decreasing        curve with the equilibrium                  tax function     ~“ (A, A) defined by (26) or
(A.5),     When     A <0      this function       is upward-sloping,          by Proposition          6; hence there can be at most
one equilibrium,           Moreover,       r*(s2, A) < r“(m,         A) = 1 = T(s2)             and ~*(s2/(1      – ~2), J) > ~*(0, A) =

O = T(s2/(1        – ~2)),     so there is a unique steady–state,                   with ~~        E (O, 1). Finally,       a decrease    in A
shifts up the 7“ (A, A) function,               which then cuts T(A)               at a higher ~ and a lower A.

Proof of Proposition 9
    By Proposition            6, the equilibrium         tax function        r“ (A, J) is now [1 –shaped                 in A : it decreases
from ~*(0, J) = O to a minimum                  at A = ~, then rises towards r’ (m, A) = 1, cutting the ~ = O axis
at A = A. The fact that r“ (A, A) now has a decreasing                             segment implies that it can intersect                 T(A)
at several points,         Here I shall only cllaracten”ze               the set of equilibria,         rather than derive sufficient
conditions      for multiplicity       (this is done in B6nabou              (1995a),         for a closely related model).        It is easy
to see that such multiple              intersection      can only happen                in the range A < A where r“ (A, J) <0,

and that this smnario            requires s2/(1 – ~2) < A. The number of intersections                             must then be odd, as
~*(s2/(1–~2),        A) <0      = T(s2/(1–~2))            and T*(s2/(1–~2(1              –~)2),    A) > ~ = T*(s2/(1–@2(l            –z)2)).

Denote     {(Aj,    rj)}~=l      these intersections,         with Aj < Aj+l                 and O > Tj > ~j+l,         and let W(~j,     Aj,)
be the mrresponding             levels of intertemporal            efficiency.      By Proposition           5, each W(-, Aj)     is strictly
ancave      and maximized          at some 7P (A ~) > 0. Since W(7, Aj)                        is decreasing    in its second argument,
this allows us to write:


                                      W(Tj+I,      Aj+I,)     <    ~(~j+l,       Aj,)    <    ~(~j) Aj,),                             (A.19)


hence the result that intertemporal                   efficiency     declines      as one moves to a more regressive                steady-
state.   The same holds a fortiori              for ex–ante welfare, since the insurance                       motive     makes it increas-

ingly costly to reduce incomesharing                      from Tj to ~j+l           as the variability         of income      rises from Aj
to Aj+l.     A ranking similar to (A. 19) obtains for gowth                             rates as long as rj = ~“ (Aj, ~) <79 (Aj);
such is the case in particular              if the Aj’s      satisfy (A,4),        ensuring that 79(Aj)            >0.     Since rj <0     for
all j, implying       A;    > s2/(1       – ~2), it suffices that S2 > (1 + @)/(l                  + pfl).
