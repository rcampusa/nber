              Taxable and Tax—Exempt Interest Rates:
           The Role of Personal and Corporate Tax Rates




                            ABSTRACT

      This paper investigates empirically the effects of personal
and corporate taxes on taxable interest rates and on the spread
between taxable and tax—exempt rates. Two main sets of results
emerge. First, we establish that the effective marginal investors
 in the Treasury bill market are households, as opposed to tax—
exempt institutions or corporations. We find no evidence of cor—
porate tax rate effects on Treasury bill yields. The study is
then extended to an examination of the tax—exempt market. The
results there contradict the hypothesis that commercial bank
arbitrage generally ensures that the taxable—tax--exempt interest
rate spread is determined by the corporate tax rate. Our esti-
mates decisively reject the corporate in favor of the personal
income tax rate as being the relevant tax rate of the marginal
investor in this market as well.

                Personal and Corporate Tax Rates,

              Taxable and Tax—Exempt Interest Rates

     Recently, a number of papers, both theoretical and empirical,
have argued that marginal income tax rates are an important deter-
minant of interest rates. They focus primarily on how these tax
rates are embedded in the expected inflation rate coefficient in
equations explaining the nominal interest rate. While theoretical
studies have incorporated corporate as well as personal tax rate
effects (e.g., Feldstein, 1976; Hamada, 1979), most empirical
studies have only included proxies for marginal personal income
tax rates (e.g., Tanzi, 1980; Peek, 1982; Peek and Wilcox, 1983,
1984). Peek (1982) established that personal income taxes do play
a significant role in interest rate determination.    Furthermore,
Peek and Wilcox (1984) and Mehra (1984) have provided evidence
that interest rates respond completely to changes in personal
income tax rates.

     Here we consider corporate as well as personal income tax
rate effects. The extended model presented in Section I yields an
interest rate specification that allows testing for corporate tax
rate effects, with personal income tax rate effects either
included or excluded.   Section II presents the results of esti-
mating that specification and testing various tax rate hypotheses.
We examine the role of personal and corporate tax rates, and other
factors, in determining the spread between taxable and tax—exempt
yield spreads in Section III. Section IV offers some concluding
remarks.

(1983), augmented with corporate tax effects. The IS, L4, wage,

where    t is the marginal personal income tax rate on interest
income, T          is    the marginal corporate income tax rate, e is the
anticipated inflation rate,                    5 is the rate of economic depre-
ciation, k is the effective rate of the investment tax credit, and
z is the expected real present value of the tax depreciation
allowance associated with a dollar of current investment. The
formula for               assumes that in equilibrium the cost to the firm of

equity is equal to its cost of debt.                     That is, all financial
arbitrage possibilities on the part of the firm are eliminated.
Consequently, we use (l—T)i as the nominal opportunity cost of

                                               —3—
funds.   This reflects the deductibility of nominal interest pay—
ments.   For simplicity, we have also assumed no taxation of
accrued nominal capital gains on the investment goods and that the
prices of capital goods change at the same rate as the general
price level.
     Real expenditures depend on the real after—personal—tax
interest rate, which is relevant for the household consumption—
saving decision, as well as on the real user cost of capital,
which is relevant for firms' investment decisions       They also
depend on an investment accelerator term, real exogenous export
and real government demand, a real balance effect, real shocks
emanating from the supply side, and financial effects arising from
the supply shocks.
     The presence of the liquidity variable (LIQ) allows us to
capture the difference between short—run and long—run IS curves.
This difference follows from the assumed differential adjustment
speeds in real and financial markets. Since real variables (such
as output) adjust more slowly than financial variables (such as
interest rates), we hypothesize a steeper (e.g., vertical) short—
run IS curve.   The liquidity term represents accelerations (or
decelerations) in nominal money growth relative to its own recent
trend growth. An acceleration in nominal money growth shifts the
LM curve to the right and moves the economy from point A to point
B along the vertical short-run IS curve in Figure 1.   This move-
ment down the short—run IS curve is captured by a temporary down—
ward shift of the flatter long—run IS curve to IS' .   Thus, this

                   IS' (Long—run)
term allows us to capture the well known liquidity effect.      If

this higher money growth rate persists, LIQ gradually returns to
its long—run value of zero. This moves the economy from B toward
C as the IS curve returns to its original position.
     Money demand is hypothesized to depend on output, the after—

personal—tax nominal interest rate, which represents the oppor-
tunity cost to individuals when interest income is taxed, and the
before—tax nominal interest rate, which represents the opportunity
cost for both firms and tax—exempt entities. If money is included
in the firm's production function, the pre—tax rather than the
after—tax nominal interest rate is the relevant opportunity cost
variable.   For firms, the return to holding (using) money is
pecuniary; both the increased revenues and decreased costs to a
firm achieved by holding additional money balances result in
higher pecuniary income. These profits, unlike the nonpecuniary
services of money to the individual, are taxed. Since the returns
to both money and bonds are taxable in this instance, in
equilibrium the marginal product of money is equated to the
before—tax, rather than the after—tax, nominal interest rate.
Consequently, a change in the corporate tax rate has no effect on
the opportunity cost measure relevant for firms in the LM rela-

tionship.
     The wage and price equations embody the natural rate hypothe-
sis and incorporate supply shock effects. A supply shock, e.g., a
sudden increase in the relative price of imported oil, shifts the

aggregate supply equation by raising the cost of production,


                               —5—
reduces the equilibrium real wage, and in addition, lowers the IS
curve through its effect on the demand for capital, and hence
investment demand (see Wilcox, 1983). The FB variable is included
to isolate the financial effects arising from thc supply shocks.
In the IS curve, FB serves as a proxy for the decline in expen-
ditures on U.S. goods due to any increase in the world saving rate
that develops as real income is transferred to countries (e.g.,
OPEC) with higher saving propensitieS Similarly, FB enters the
LM equation to allow for the possibility that the demand for money
will be reduced as wealth is transferred to agents who desire a
wealth portfolio with a much higher proportion of U.S. government
securities than do domestic wealth-holders (see peek and Wilcox,

1983)
        Equations (l)—(7) can be combined to yield the reduced—form
equation for the nominal interest rate:

     The real balance and LM effects of money have conflicting
impacts on the interest rate resulting in an ambiguous sign for

5•   Likewise, the sign of                                 is indeterminate a priori.         An
adverse supply shock reduces investment and real wages and thus
the interest rate, while at the same time increasing input costs

operating through the aggregate supply equation which raises the
interest rate. The investment—real wage effect might be expected
to dominate, suggesting a negative value for .                                   Our earlier work
(e.g., Wilcox, 1983; Peek and Wilcox, 1983) can be so interpreted.
     Personal and corporate tax rates enter the reduced—form

                                                         —7—
equation (8) in a complicated manner.               The reduced—form coef-
ficients (the 's) in (8) are not constants. Rather, they are a
function of the four tax series (t, T,        k,   z), which vary over time.
Having a common denominator that depends on these tax series, the
reduced—form coefficients will all have the same movement over
time (up to a scale factor) with the exception of          .    An increase
in any of the four tax variables will reduce the denominator (D)
and cause all of the reduced—form coefficients to increase (except

        Because T,    k,   and z also appear in its numerator,         will
not change in proportion to the other 's. Assuming that (1 — k
—   z) > 0 (which is consistent with the data for the period under
consideration) ,     an increase in -r will raise        more than propor-
tionally to the remaining s because, in addition to D declining
equally for all s's, the numerator of              rises. An increase in k
or z will decrease the numerator of , tending to offset the
upward effect on l operating through the denominator. For reason-
able structural parameter values (i       >    t is sufficient), the net
effect of such a change will be to decrease

II. Empirical Results
      A. Data
      The reduced—form estimates are based on semiannual obser-
vations corresponding to the Livingston survey data collected each
June and December. The sample covers June 1952 through June 1979.
This sample period avoids both the pre—1952 pegging of interest
rates by the Federal Reserve and the period following the October
1979 change in Federal Reserve operating procedures (including the


                                    —8—
temporary imposition of credit controls in 1980) .     Monthly aver-
ages of the one—year Treasury bill yield (on a bond—equivalent
basis) during June and December are used as the nominal interest
rate measure to match the maturity of the Livingston one—year
anticipated inflation rate data' The anticipated inflation rate
series, PE12, is the percentage change in the CPI expected over
the next twelve months derived from the Livingston survey. This
series was provided by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.
This measure of anticipated inflation has the advantage of being
truly ex ante and of embodying whatever sophistication agents
actually use to form their expectations. The remaining variables
are measured with second and fourth quarter data (except for the
four tax variables) to correspond with the end—of—quarter dating
of the interest rate variable. We use the Ml measure of the nomi-
nal money supply. e is the price level expected six months
ahead, again based on the Livingston survey data. N, natural
real output, is from the Council of Economic i\dvisors. (M_Pe_YN)
has been detrended by regressing it on a linear time trend and
using the residual as M' .       LIQ is the difference between the
annualized growth rate of Ml measured from the current to the pre-

vious quarter and its four—quarter growth rate up to that previous

quarter.   x' is the logarithm of the ratio of real government
expenditures plus real exports to real natural output. EY_ is
the four—quarter growth rate of real GNP up to the preceding
quarter. SS   is   the ratio of the import deflator to the GNP defla-

tor, adjusted for exchange rate changes.         FB is the ratio of

                                 —9—
foreign holdings to the sum of private domestic and foreign
holdings of U.S. government short—term marketable securities.
      Our measure of t is the average marginal tax rate on interest
income constructed from data contained in annual editions of
Statistics of Income, Individual Income Tax Returns (see peek,
1982) .   The tax rate is calculated as a weighted average of the
marginal personal income tax rate for each adjusted gross income
class.    The weight for each class is equal to its share of the
total interest received by all income classes. We use the effec-
tive marginal corporate tax rate from Seater (Table 2, column 6,
1982) for T.
      The calculation of the effective rate of the investment tax
credit (k) and the present value of tax depreciation gained from a
dollar of current investment (z)      is more complicated.2     Our

measure of z is based on data provided by Robert S. Chirinko
(1982).    It is calculated as a weighted average of the present
value of tax depreciation from a dollar of current investment in
structures and in three categories of equipment (production machi-

nery, office equipment, and transportation equipment) .         The

weights are based on investment shares. Our measure of k is simi—
larly calculated as a weighted average of the same categories.
The underlying effective investment tax credit rates are based on

Corcoran and Sahling (Table 11, 1981). These data recognize that
the effective investment tax credit rate differs from the statu-
tory rate (in particular, on structures) as noted by Corcoran
(1979).    To check the robustness of our estimates, we also con—

                               —10—
sidered alternative measures presented by Jorgenson and Sullivan
(Table 6, column 1 and Table 10, column 1, 1981). To convert the
annual tax series to semiannual data, we use the actual value for
the June observation and the average of the tax rates for the
current and upcoming calendar years for the December observation.


     B. Test Specification
     Nonlinear least squares can be used to estimate equation (8)
while imposing the across—coefficient restrictions.          Because of
the form of (8), we can estimate the a's and -'s only up to a
scale factor. To obtain a unique set of estimates of the a's and
11s, we arbitrarily fix one of the coefficients (or alternatively,
divide the numerators and denominators of all of the 's by one of

the parameters) .       Since we are most interested in the coefficients
of the explanatory variables, we have chosen to use the constant
term, c, as the scale factor. The reduced—form coefficients are:

          a0/a0         1
     o       D          D

          11/aU +       (y2/a0)(l—k—Tz)/(l--T)   -

     D =   (i3/a0)(l—t) +       y4/a0
                                        +
                                            ('y'2/ag)(l-k—Tz).



We can now obtain point         estimates      of the ratios of the &S and ys

to a0.3     While we cannot perform marginal significance tests for
the a's and l's with the resulting estimated coefficient standard
errors, the summary statistics for the equation itself (S.E.E.,
S.S.R., D.W., and so on) as well as the estimated time series of
the 's are uniquely determined; that is, they are invariant with
respect to the scale factor used. Consequently, a chi—square test
statistic can be used to perform likelihood ratio tests of the
restriction that each of the relevant coefficients (the a's and
y's) is zero.         This produces the desired measures of marginal
significance.
     Here, we are primarily interested in the contribution of the
corporate tax parameters to the determination of the interest
rate. Our earlier work did not allow for these corporate tax rate
effects.    Those studies essentially set a2 and h3 equal to zero
(and hence 12 =        14
                            =   0).     To assess the effects of corporate
taxes, we impose various restrictions on the coefficients asso-
ciated with the tax effects and test whether these restrictions
can be rejected. We test for corporate tax effects in equations

                                            —12—
that exclude, as well as include, personal tax rates.                       In addi-
tion, we test the restriction that the coefficient on T                    is   unity,
i.e., whether there is no "fiscal illusion" with regard to cor-
porate tax rates.

C. Estimation
     In estimating equation (8), it is assumed that the rate of
economic depreciation (6) is equal to .1. This makes the numera-
tor of 2 (the coefficient on (l—k--Tz)/(l—T)) equal to eii2• °
estimate of (8) incorporating the normalization in (9) for the
1952:06—1979:06 period is:

(10) i =   (1.0   + (.133 — •0582((1—k—Tz))e + •0582(0•1)((1TZ)
                                    (1—T)                (l-T)
                    (1.80)  (0.97)             (0.97)
       + .l44L,Y_1 + .27lX + .214M' —          .O112LIQ   —   .316SS   —    .642FB)/
           (0.61)      (1.60)      (0.86)      (4.15)         (5.09)        (3.49)
             .182(l—t) — .0582( l—k—Tz) — .0252)
            (2.47)        (0.97)                (0.35)
     R2 = .9316       SSR = 19.15           SEE = 0.65        D.W. = 1.86

     The numbers in parentheses below the coefficient estimates
can be interpreted approximately as t—statistics. They are calcu-
lated as the square root of the chi—square test statistic used to
perform the likelihood ratio tests of the restriction that each of
the relevant coefficients was zero.4 The estimates of the para-
meters associated with corporate tax rates (y2/c0 and -y'4/a0) are
both negative, contrary to what might be expected, and are both
statistically insignificant; their pseudo t—statistics are 0.97
and 0.35, respectively. The coefficient on the personal tax rate,
on the other hand, has the expected sign and is statistically

                                    —13—
significant.     Similar results were obtained when we used the
Jorgenson—Sullivan (JS) measures of k and z.     Estimates of both

        and 2/o were again negative and statistically insignifi-
cant.     Their pseudo t—statistics were 0.86 for 12 and 0.49 for

14.     Thus, we find no evidence that corporate tax rates affected

the (taxable) one—year Treasury bill yield.        Furthermore, it
appears that neither corporations nor tax—exempt entities are the
relevant marginal investors in the associated LM relationship (we
cannot reject the hypothesis that b3 and hence - equals zero)
When we omitted the insignificant 14/% term and reestimated the
equation, we again obtained an insignificant negative coefficient
on the corporate tax proxies (with a pseudo t-statistic of 0.35;
0.49 with the j5 data). The other estimated coefficients have the
hypothesized signs (although the sign on the M' coefficient is
theoretically ambiguous) and the coefficients on LIQ, SS and FB

are statistically significant.
        This specification assumes the absence of fiscal illusion.
In an earlier study (peek and Wilcox (1984)), the hypothesis of
fiscal illusion with respect to the personal income tax was
rejected.      However, assuming no corporate tax fiscal illusion
might be too restrictive and be contributing to our rejection of
statistically significant corporate tax effects, Consequently, we
replaced (l—k—TZ) and (l—T) with (l—Bk—OTz) and (1—Ot), respec-
tively, where the deviation of 0 from unity measures the degree of
fiscal illusion. A value of one for 0 implies that agents respond
to after—tax, rather than pre—tax, magnitudes and therefore do not


                                 —14—
suffer from fiscal illusion.       At the other extreme, a value of
zero for o would imply that agents disregard taxes entirely; that
is, they suffer from complete fiscal illusion.          When we re—
estimated the interest rate equation that includes the corporate
tax fiscal illusion parameter, the estimated value of e was 0.72
with a t—statistic of 0.27. While it is in the predicted range
(between zero and unity), this parameter is not measured preci-
sely. With a standard error of 2.69 the data reject neither U =     1

nor e =     0.   Similarly, the as data provided an estimate for 0 of
0.64 with a t—statistic of 0.22.         Our estimates of       were

still negative and insignificant. Finally, we tested for signifi-
cant corporate tax effects in the absence of personal tax effects.
We re—estimated the interest rate equation setting 13 = 0.    Again,
we obtained negative and insignificant coefficient estimates for

12/a0.      The pseudo t—statistics were 1.40 and, for the JS data,
1 .28.


III. Evidence from the Tax—Exempt Market
         The statistical evidence presented in the previous section
favored the personal income tax rate, and not the corporate tax
rate, as a determinant of taxable nominal interest rates. Here we
examine the role of personal and corporate tax rates in the
relative pricing of taxable and tax—exempt assets over time.       In

contrast to our finding above that personal rates dominate cor-
porate rates in the pricing of taxable financial assets, it is
often argued that the corporate tax rate is the rate that deter-
mines the spread between short—term municipal and Treasury yields.

                                  —15—
     Table 1 shows that the commercial banking sector and the
household sector each hold large fractions of both taxable and
tax—exempt government bonds.     Though this table does not suggest
which tax rate is relevant to either market, it does indicate
that, by share, banks historically have been relatively more
important holders of municipal bonds, especially shorts, whereas
households have been relatively larger holders of Treasury issues.
     To the extent these tax—exempt instruments act as substitutes
for (taxable) Treasury issues of the same maturity, the after—tax
yields of taxable and tax-exempt instruments should move together.
If these tax—exempt assets are sufficiently closer substitutes
(for taxables) for corporations than they are for households, the
corporate rate may be relevant in determining the taxable—tax—
exempt spread.   Farna (1977) argues for the near—perfect substitut-
ability of these taxable and tax—exempt short—term instruments on
the part of corporations.      The ability to hold tax—exempt and
issue taxable, interest—deductible, short—term debt confers       art

arbitrage opportunity on commercial banks. Their exercise of that
opportunity could be expected to drive the implied tax rate for
this maturity to the corporate tax rate.

    If these taxable and tax—exempt instruments are close substi-
tutes for both households and corporations, we might expect the
same tax rate to operate in both markets.     Miller (1977) argues
that, if the effective tax rate on dividends is zero (as proposed
by Miller and Scholes (1978)), the tax rate implied by the
taxable—tax—exempt yield spread will be the corporate rate. Even

    aThese shares are shares of holdings of the private, domestic
     sector. Corporations do not hold large shares of either bond
     category. "Other" major holders of Treasury issues include
     state and local governments and nonbank financial institu—
     tions, which include public and private pension funds, money
     market and mutual funds, insurance companies, savings and
     loans, and so on. property and casualty insurance companies
     and mutual funds are the largest "other" holders of muni—
     cipals. A breakdown by maturity is not available from the
     Flow of Funds Accounts. Source: Flow of Funds Accounts,

     10).
if individual investors regard these instruments as perfect
substitutes, the yield spread would be driven to the corporate
rate by firms' issuing taxable bonds. If the effective equity tax
rate is positive, other factors, like the relative supply of tax—
exempts, will also influence the spread.6

     The yields of tax—exempt municipal (iM) and taxable Treasury
     bonds of similar maturity (here one year) and risk character-
istics deliver the implied tax rate imbedded in this market, t:7

(11) t =   1 -
                 (iM/iT).
Figure 2 plots the implied, the corporate (ta), and the personal
(tn) tax rates.       The one—year U.S. government and one—year prime
municipal yields from Salomon Brothers Analytical Record_of Yields
and Yield Spreads are used to calculate t.
     Both t and t creflect the major tax law changes over this
             p
period:    the 1954 tax cut, the 1964—65 tax cut and the 1968—70

temporary tax surcharge.       The personal tax series also reflects
the steady rise in per capita nominal income starting in the mid—
1960's. A notable feature of t is its volatility compared with
that of t and tc While changes in the personal and corporate
tax series may account for some of the fluctuations in t, a sub-
stantial portion of its movement must be due to other factors.

     Some recent econometric studies point to corporate—rate.-
payers as the marginal investors in these markets. Skelton (1983)
obtains predicted values of the implied tax rate during the 52 and
48 percent corporate tax regimes which are almost exactly 52 and
48 percent, respectively. He concludes that his results illustrate
"the behavior of commercial banks as tax arbitrageurs" (p. 350)

the relative pricing of tax—exempt and taxable debt.        Poterba
(1984) likewise points to the importance of corporate tax rate
changes and suggests that changes in personal tax rates have small

effects on short—maturity yields.
     Table 2 shows the relation of the implied tax rate to the
personal rate, the corporate rate, and other factors.          The
1952—1979 sample period is chosen to maintain comparability with
that used in Section ii and with the sample periods used to gather
evidence regarding the corporate rate reported elsewhere.     Since

1979, banks have acquired atypically small shares of municipal
offerings, perhaps due to changes in tax laws regarding the deduc-
tibility of interest costs of carrying tax—exempts (see Poterba
(1984)). The dependent variable in the first five rows is the tax
rate implied by one year yields; the last two pairs of rows use

the tax rate implied by five year and twenty year yields, respect-
ively. Row 1 relates t   solely   to t and t. The low Durbin—Watson
statistic associated with the ordinary least squares (OLSO)
results (not shown) led to the use of the Cochrane—Orcutt tech-

nique.   is the estimated autocorrelation—correction factor. Row
2 adds the dependent variable lagged one period (six months) to
show that our results do not stem solely from failure to allow for
dynamics.8 Durbin's h provides a valid statistic for testing for
autocorrelation in the lagged dependent variable specification.
Neither of these simple specifications deliver significant esti-
mated coefficients on either personal or corporate rates.      The

to one; that for the corporate tax rate is very close to zero.
     The third row adds four other factors that may also affect
the implied tax rate. DSEAS is a dummy variable that is zero for
June and one for December observations. 05406 is a dummy variable
that is one during June 1954 and zero otherwise. In that period,
t fell to an unheard—of low (0.04, sample mean =   0.42;   see figure
2) and the tax—exempt share of the flow supply of debt was vastly

larger than for any other period (32 percent, sample mean = 11
percent). FLOW is the percentage of the total flow of debt issued
over the previous three months that is state and local debt.
Including this variable permits testing whether the relative
supply of tax—exempt debt affects the implied tax rate.
     Skelton (1983) argues that when taxable interest rates rose
above the Regulation Q ceiling, banks found arbitrage "difficult,
if not impossible" (p. 347). If banks were ordinarily the margi-
nal investors, these "tight money" periods would then coincide
with departures of the implied tax rate from the corporate rate.
Banks typically held sizeable portfolios of both taxable and tax—

exempt bonds. In tight money years, like 1966, they absorbed few
of the newly issued tax—exempts (see poterba (1984)) and t fell

noticeably. MGR is included here, then, to capture this liquidity
effect. MGR is defined as the annualized growth rate of Ml over
the last six months minus its annualized growth rate over the last
three years. Skelton captured this effect with a dummy variable.

                               —19—
To allow for varying degrees of tightness, we use a quantitative,
rather than a qualitative, proxy. Presumably the tighter are cre-
dit conditions, the smaller is the share of tax—exempts that banks

will acquire. Given the progressive personal income tax system,
this larger supply of tax—exempts to the household sector will
drive down the implied tax rate.

     Row 3 contains the results of estimating the complete specifi-
cation.      The personal tax rate carries a significant and near—
unity coefficient, while the corporate rate coefficient is low and

insignificant.     With the exception of FLOW, the remaining coef-
ficients are each significant, though sometimes barely. As might
be expected, D5406 has a very large coefficient.       Its estimate
indicates that the implied tax during June 1954 is 30 percentage
points below what conditions would otherwise warrant.     Including
D5406 renders FLOW insignificant; the correlation between them is
0.51. Omitting 05406 in row 5 produces a negative and very signi-
ficant FLOW coefficient.
     Since 05406 is a one period dummy, including it produces the
same estimates as if we had omitted that period from the sample.
To the extent that this observation should be treated like any
other, the results then support the view that the relative supply
of tax—exempt debt affects the implied tax rate. That conclusion
is inconsistent with banks driving the implied tax rate to the
corporate rate.     If June 1954 is judged atypical for some reason
other than that there was a large flow of tax-exempts (and we know

of none) ,   row 3 suggests that the relative supply of tax—exempts

                                —20—
has not significantly influenced the implied tax rate.    In sum,
the significance of FLOW is extremely sensitive to that one
period .

     Tighter   money does reduce the implied tax rateJ° This is
consistent with banks altering their relative holdings of tax—
exempts by more than an amount that would preserve their no—
arbitrage position.    Rows 3, 4 and 5 each contain significant
personal and insignificant corporate tax ate coefficients. Those
coefficients are usually close to one and to zero, respectively.
If the arbitrage hypothesis is correct, we would not expect to see

significant personal rate, relative supply (FLOW), or seasonal
effects. If individuals are generally the marginal investors, the
other factors might well be expected to still exert discernible
effects because of the progressive nature of the individual income
tax system. This supports the hypothesis that the relevant supply
curve for tax—exempts generally intersects the demand curve, not
in a horizontal portion at a height equal to the corporate tax
rate, but in the negatively sloped portion, which is generated by
the fact that different investors face different marginal personal
income tax rates.

     Rows 6 and 7 display the results of re—estimating rows 3 and
4, using the implied tax rate derived from the respective five—
year yields of tax—exempt and taxable instruments. Rows 8 and 9
are generated using the tax rate implied by 20—year yields.
Neither Skelton nor poterba contend that the corporate rate is
likely to be the operative rate at these longer maturities. But,
in fact, the estimates for these longer maturities are quite simi—
lar to those for the shorter maturities. The size and confidence
levels of the short—run coefficients generally decline with
increasing maturity, but the estimated long—run responses differ
little across maturities.    None of the tax coefficients in the
last four rows has a t—statistic as large as two.     The earlier
finding of long—run responses of one and zero, respectively, to
personal and corporate tax rate changes is basically reaffirmed,
however.


IV. Concluding Remarks

     The empirical evidence presented here suggests the importance
of personal income tax rates and the irrelevance of the corporate
tax rate in determining both taxable interest rates and the spread
between taxable and tax—exempt interest rates.   The dominance of
personal over corporate tax rates in taxable interest rate
equations is robust.     Using alternative corporate tax proxies,
including or excluding personal tax rates, and even relaxing the
assumption of no corporate tax fiscal illusion, each support the
irrelevance of corporate tax rates.

     Recent theoretical and empirical studies suggest that the
corporate tax rate will determine the short—term taxable—tax—
exempt yield spread. When we include both personal and corporate
tax rates, the data overwhelmingly favor the personal rate at the
expense of the corporate rate. Their respective point estimates,
again over various specifications, are approximately one and zero.
The significance of money growth and the relative supply of tax—

                               —22--
exempt bonds also argues against the hypothesis that the tax rate

implied by the taxable—tax--exempt yield spread will be driven to
the corporate tax rate.   Thus, the evidence consistently points
toward an important response of interest rates to personal income
tax rates.    Major personal rate changes, like those recently
enacted and currently under consideration, are likely to have
substantial effects on interest rates.

1.   Before December 1959, when one—year Treasury bills were
     introduced, the interest ratG measure is the yield on
     Treasury bills with maturities of 9 to 12 months.

2.   unfortunately, the tax depreciation series will be correlated
     with interest and inflation rates due to its construction.
3.   The resulting t—statistics will be for these ratios, not for
     the 's and y's themselves. Both the point estimates and
     their associated t—statistics will depend upon which of the
     parameters is chosen as the scale factor. If, for example,
     we chose to scale by 8 instead, we would obtain estimates of
     (and t—statistics for) a different set of coefficients (for

     example, 4/ 8 instead of 4/      .   Because of this problem,
     we will not be able to obtain the relevant statistics for
     significance tests of the 's and -y'1s from the estimated
     standard errors of the coefficient estimates (i.e., the

     estimates of a4/a0, y1/c, etc.).
4.   The sample size is 55. The square root of the critical
     values for the chi—square distribution and (the absolute
     value of) the critical values for the t distribution cover-
     age as the sample size grows. These likelihood ratio tests
     reject the insignificance of the individual coefficients (at

     the 5 percent level) in (8) when the calculated chi—square
     test statistics exceed 3.84 or, equivalently, when the
     statistics in parentheses in (9) exceed 1.96.

5.   This parameter is identified. Its estimated standard error


                               —24—
     can therefore be obtained directly.
6.   Poterba (1984) provides a lucid and detailed description of
     these and other explanations of the implied tax rate.
7.   Historically the default rate on one—year prime-grade munici-
     pal bonds has been almost zero. Buser and Hess (1984) argue
     that the default risk premium in these instruments is small
     and stable, citing the "trivial" (p. 6) variation in the

     yield spread between good— and prime—grade municipal bonds.
8.   Skelton includes two lagged dependent variables in his
     specification which uses monthly observations.
9.   Poterba (1984), whose sample period starts in 1955, finds
     significant or nearly significant relative (tax—exempt—taxable)
     supply effects for 1, 5, 10, and 20 year maturities.
10. Hendershott and Koch (1980) find a negative effective of a
     1969—70 credit crunch variable on bank holdings of tax—

     exempts.
