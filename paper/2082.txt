                                     ABSTRACT


        Recent research in macroeconomics has emphasized the importance of

linking the financial and real sectors and the need for working with

optimizing models. Tobin's Q model of investment would appear to provide a

framework that can   satisfy   these two criteria. In contrast to the original

presentation of the Q model, the formal development has not recognized that

the   firm actively participates in a number of financial markets; in this

broader context, we show that Q Is likely to be an uninformative and

possibly   misleading signal   for   Investment expenditures. We then endeavor

to turn this negative theoretical result to positive advantage in resolving

a number of empirical problems with Q models, but the modifications

dictated by the theory receive little support from the data.

 I.     INTRODUCTION

         Uncovering    the channels through which financial and monetary variables

 affect real behavior has been of considerable interest during the past few

 years, as radical changes in financial markets and monetary policies have been

associated with sudden swings in macroeconomic activity. Following the

insights of Keynes       (1936) arid   Tobin (1969), a number of researchers have

investigated     these linkages using the Q model, which relates investment in
physical capital to the ratio of the market value of financial claims on the
firm    and   the cost of reproducing its existing stock of capital.1 When this       Q

ratio    exceeds unity, investors in      financial markets are   indicating that

prospective cash flows are likely to be sufficiently high or discount rates

sufficleuLLy low to warrant additional capital spending.

         The Q framework is particularly appealing because the abovementioned link

between financial variables and investment can be derived from a model of

forward—looking, maximizing behavior. Based on a          cash flow model in   which the

firm faces convex costs in adjusting its capital stock, it has been shown that

physical investment is determined by marginal Q, defined as the ratio of the

discounted future revenues from an additional unit of capital (i.e., the shadow

price of capital) to its net—of—tax purchase price (Mussa, 1977; bel, 1979).

Critical to the empirical usefulness of this model is that unobservable

marginal Q must be related to observable average Q, defined above as the ratio

of    financial to physical capital. The conditions under which this connection

Fischer  and Merton (19814, p. 83) state that "Q theory, associated particularly
with James Tobin, ... is now the preferred theoretical description of
investment ."
                                         2


can be drawn have been established in an important paper by Hayashl (1982).

From a theoretical perspective, Q Investment models are appealing because they

Incorporate forward—looking behavior, reflect optimal choices, and contain

estimated coefficients that are readily identified with underlying structural

parameters 2

        In contrast to the original presentation of the Q model, the formal

development has not recognized that the firm actively participates In a number

of   financial markets. This paper develops a model   In   which the firm chooses,
not only the level of Investment expenditures, but also its debt and equity
policies. We find that endogenizing financial policy calls into question the
usefulness of the Q framework, and   show that Q   is likely to be an uninformative
and perhaps misleading signal for investment expenditures.
       This negative theoretical result, however, can have a potentially
positive    Impact on the empirical performance of conventional Q models, which

have been disappointing on three counts. First, contrary to the theory, lagged

variables have proven significant determinants of Investment;3 the

interpretation of these coefficients In terms of the underlying structural

model becomes unclear. Second, relative to alternative investment models, Q

has not performed adequately In terms of either    within sample or out—of-sample


2See Lucas (1976) and Sargent (1981) for a discussion of the advantages of
estimating and identifying structural parameters.

3For example, see von Furstenberg (1977) and Blanchard and Wyplosz (1981),
whose results are based on U.S. quarterly data. Significant lagged variables
have also emerged In studies of other countries (United Kingdom, Poterba and
Summers, 1983; MexIco, Schwartzrnan, 198's). Fischer (1983) has argued that
lagged Q should be an important determinant of Investment spending. There
are two objections to his result. First, he enters lags into the maximization
problem by assuming that adjustment costs depend on both current and lagged
investment, but it is not at all clear what phenomena are being captured by
this formulation. Second, the investment schedule that follows from his model
is quite different fran those actually used in econometric work, and thus the
relation between his result and empirically significant lagged variables is not
apparent.

statistics (Clark, 1979). Third, the implied structural parameters are quite

unreasonable. For example, Summers'       (1981,   P. 101) estimated adjustment cost

coefficient implied that, twenty years after an unexpected change in the

economic environment, the capital stock would have moved only three—fourths of

the way to its ultimate, steady—state value. In sum, these empirical problems

reveal a serious misspecificatiori in conventional formulations of the Q model.

Our analysis of endogenous financial policy allows us to link the specification

error to omitted variables and to exploit this additional information in

econometric estimation.




II. THE THEORETICAL MODEL

  A. The Maximand and Conditions Characterizing an Qptimum

      We    begin our analysis   by assuming that, in formulating real and financial

policies,   the managers of the firm   act   in the interests of   shareholders   and
maximize the    value of equity subject to four constraints. First, the firm's

technology [L(t), K(t), 1(t), D(t), d(t)]) depends positively on labor (L(t))

and capital (K(t)) inputs, and negatively on the remaining three arguments. We

assume that, when Incorporating investment goods (1(t)) into the production

process, the firm incurs adjustment costs, which Increase at an increasing

rate. These internal costs can be viewed as the movement of real resources

from producing output toward Installing capital goods, and hence have a

deleterious effect on •[t]. We further assume that the presence of debt (D(t))

in the firm's capital structure creates agency problems (Jensen and Meckling,

1976; Myers1 1977) that lead to restrictions on the firm's operations (e.g.,



1See Chirinko (1985, Section II.A) for a derivation of the equity value
niaximand from the cash flow identities characterizing the firm and for a
discussion of alternative cost of capital definitions.
                                             4



bond covenants) and have a negative effect on net revenues.5 These agency

costs annul the well—known capital structure invariance result of Modigliani

and Miller and, since we will be assuming that the demand for securities is

perfectly elastic, they are borne entirely by the firm. Negative effects on

[t] also arise from the issue of new debt (d(t)), reflecting flotation and

transactions costs. Throughout the analysis, we assume sufficient curvature

(Inada conditions) on [t] to       ensure interior solutions.6
        Second,   significant analytic convenience is    achieved by assuming all debt
matures   in one period; hence, interest payments are determined      by a nominal

short—term rate. While a long—rate might seem preferable in analyzing

investment decisions, borrowers will be indifferent between a sequence of

one—period rates and a      long—term rate in the presence of perfect capital
markets linking the yields on securities of various maturities. We further
assume that debt is retired     at an   exponential   rate n and that the stock of debt
is   accumulated according to the following equation,


        D(t)       d(t) -      D(t).                                             (1)


        Third, the cost of equity capital (p(t)) is constrained by the return

that investors require to hold financial assets. This return is determined by

the rates of taxation, inflation, and time preference faced by investors, and

thus p(t) is Invariant to the conduct of policies affecting physical investment



5A similar formulation has been employed by Barnea, Haugen, and Senbet (1981),
Gordon and Malkiel (1981), and Taggart (1985). While the introduction of
uncertainty would lead to a stronger motivation f or agency problems, such a
modification would preclude the derivation of the structural econometric model
estimated in Section III.

    most tax systems, interest payments are deductible and, in this model, such
a "tax break" is needed to encourage the firm to issue debt despite the costs
reflected in [t].   Explicit consideration of taxes has been avoided in the
theoretical model for the     sake of notational simplicity (cf., fn. 12).
                                                             5


and debt finance.7

        The final constraint governs the transition of the capital stock through

time,


        K(t)             1(t) —   (S   K(t),                                                        (2)


where (S is the exponential depreciation rate.

        To determine the real and financial policies that maximize the value of

equity subject to these four                   constraints,       we form the current-value

Harniltonian,

              exp(—f(p(u)du) {[L(S),K(5),I(s),D(s),d(s)] —                    w(s)L(s)

                                                                                                    (3)

where w(s) and p(s) are the prices of labor services and investment goods,

respectively, relative to the price of output (the numeraire good), i(s) the

nominal short—term Interest rate, 11(8) the inflation rate, and A(s) and p(s)

the current—value co-state variables associated with the constraints (1) and

(2), respectIvely. Necessary conditions for the maximization of (3)                           are
obtained by applying Pontryagin's Maximum Principle and, for purposes of the

present analysis, we consider the following conditions pertaining directly to

physical capital,

      A(t)      = p(t)      1[t].                                                       (nb)

                           K[tJ>0,     1[t]<O

Equation (na) defines the marginal benefit of an additional unit of capital as

the sum of current          and    future marginal products weighted by the rates of

discount        and depreciation. Along         the optimal path, this marginal benefit must
equal the total marginal costs of acquiring               capital. These involve the sum of

purchase            and      marginal adjustment costs, and the requisite equality Is
given     by (14b).

          Unlike the stock of physical capital, the value to the firm of financial

capital is negative, as indicated by the following expressions for the shadow

price of D(t) derived from the necessary conditions,


                    1 +
                           d[t],                                                        (5a)

                    t

                                     D[t]<0,      1<d[t]<O.

The marginal benefit of issuing debt equals the receipts (at par) less

flotation and transactions costs (5a). The marginal carrying costs of this

additional unit of debt are given in (5b) as real interest and retirement

payments plus the marginal agency              costs associated with debt, all discounted by
the    cost     of capital and weighted        by the debt survival factor, exp(—fl).

          Debt policy is conducted in order to equate the marginal costs of equity

and debt. This intuitively plausible result can be seen to hold in the present

model by differentiating (5b) with respect to time and rearranging,


   -(t) - •-(p(t)+) i(t) -                 [i(t) - r(t)   +     - DLt]],                (6a)

      p(t)      —                                [1+d[t]J] —        +   (t)/1.i(t),     (6b)
                                                7




The left and right sides of equation (6b) define the costs of equity and debt,

respectively. The term in braces represents the marginal carrying costs of

debt grossed—up to reflect the loss due to flotation costs that reduce receipts

below the par value of debt. Retirement payments of n per dollar of real debt

lower future debt costs; in the absence of flotation costs, retirement payments

would disappear from (6b). The final term represents the capital gain or loss

arising from alterations in the stock of debt, and ensures that (6b) will hold

along the optimal path. In the steady—state where ii(t) = 0 (and ignoring

momentarily agency and flotation costs), the equality bet.ieen the costs of

equity and debt is apparent, p(t) =          i(t)   —   ir(t).

     B. Implications for Q Theory

           A particularly attractive feature of Tobin's Q theory is that the

unobserved shadow        price   for physical investment can be linked uniquely and

rigorously to observable variables useful in econometric estimation. When

financial policy is endogenous, however, we show In this sub-section that such

a convenient relationship no longer holds. Key to our demonstration is

Proposition I, following from maximizing behavior, that defines the market

values of debt (D(t)) and equity (V(t)) in terms of current—period stocks and

shadow prices,


PROPOSITION I (the financial value of the firm)

In   the presence of perfectly competitive output and            factor   markets,

                         A(t) K(t)    +   (.i(t)+1) D(t)                             (7)

        In (7), the capitalized value of the firm equals the flow of income to be

generated by the existing stock of capital plus the flotation and                    transaction
costs that have been absorbed in order to attain the current level of debt.

Under certain restrictions, it has been shown that physical investment is

related to the ratio of the shadow price of capital to the relative price of

investment goods (Mussa, 1977; Abel, 1979). This ratio is referred to as

marginal Q (Q(t)) but, since the shadow price of capital is unobservable,

QM(t)   is   not   operationally useful. This problem has                been overcome in empirical

work by replacing marginal Q with average Q (QA(t)), defined as "the ratio of

the market value of firms to the replacement cost of their assets" (von

Furstenberg, 1977, p. 3i7). In terms of our notation, these two definitions

can be stated as follows,


   QM(t) =         A(t)    / p(t),                                                           (8a)

   QA(t) —         (V(t)    +       D(t))   / p(t) K(t)                                      (8b)



and when combined with (7), lead to the following result,


PROPOSITION II (marginal Q and average Q)

   QM(t) —         QA(t)
                                —
                                      (p(t)+1)   *   (D(t)/p(t)K(t)).                        (9)



Proposition II indicates that QM(t), which serves as the signal for alterations

in K(t), is related to QA(t) and an additional term containing an unobserved

shadow price. When financial policy is exogenous, this latter term does not

appear, and marginal and average Q are                    equivalent.9   However, in the presence



   proof is contained in Chirinko (1985, Apppendix A); cf., Hayashi (1982).

9See Summers (1981), Poterba and Summers (1983), and Chirinko (1984) for
derivations with exogenous financial policy. Under the current tax code,
average Q will have to be decremented by the discounted value of tax
depreciation allowances that are attributable to capital assets purchased                     prior
to period t but that will be charged against income in current and future
                                              (Footnote continued)
                                                    9



of endogenous financial decisions, QA(t) no longer proves to be a "sufficient

statistic" for indicating profitable investment opportunities in physical

capital.1°

         Not only can QA(t) be uninformative, it may also be misleading. In order

to demonstrate that QA(t) can increase while QM(t) remains fixed, we assume

that the technology takes the following separable form,


      LL(t),K(t),I(t),D(t),d(t)]                [L(t),K(t)] -    2[I(t),K(t)]
                                                                                          (10)

periods (Hayashi, 1982). The computation of the discounted values associated
with tax depreciation will involve variables unknown at time t. and thus
attenuate the desirable informational properties of the Q model. Since the
primary   variation in Q is likely to be due to other factors, it is doubtful
that this      problem will have much influence on econometric estimates.

a "sufficient statistic" when the firm's production possibilities depend on
many physical capital stocka (e.g.. equipment and structures).

finance (-i(t)); in terms of the diagram, -ii(t) falls instantaneously from A to

B on the transition path to the new steady-state (C). From (14a) and under our

separability assumptions, A(t) and QM(t) will be unaffected. Immediately after

the fall in 1(t) and —i(t) but before the firm can alter D(t), QA(t) must rise

in order to maintain (9) and to reflect the cheaper finance now available to

the firm.13 As the firm acquires debt along the transition path to the new

steady—state, both —j.i(t) and D(t) will rise, and \1(t)     will   fall until QA(t)

retains its steady-state value. Between steady-states, QA(t) would have been

signaling profitable investment opportunities In financial, not physical,

capital. Thus, relating the flow of physical investment to QA(t), as is done

in conventional specifications of Q models, may meet with only limited




The phase diagram is based on the following properties for 3[D(t), d(t)]:

           =
               [t]    > 0,   dd[t] dd[t] > 0,      'D[t] =   Lt]    > 0,


  DDLt]        D[t]     > 0. See Chirinko (1985, Appendix C) for a more detailed

discussion     of   the phase diagram.

     we interpret 1(t) as the net—of—tax Interest rate, then this unexpected
change could be due to government policies that alter the degree to which
interest payments may be deducted against business income or the rate of
business income taxation. (Examples of both of these changes can be found in
tax reform proposals advanced by the Reagan Administration.) With additional
notation, it is straightforward to incorporate taxes into the Hamiltonian (3).

131n terms of the notation, we have that dQA(t) - dV(t)       -   -d(-(t))D(t)   > 0.

empirical success. However, as demonstrated in the next section, we will be

able to regain a useful structural relationship by conditioning on variables
associated with debt finance.



III.    THE ECONOMETRIC MODEL

  A. Specification Issues

        In this section, we exploit the information provided by the model with

endogenous financial policy, and           generate    estimates of the structural

parameters. To translate the theoretical model of Section II into                  an
econometric equation, we need to paraxneterize the               adjustment   cost and
flotation/agency     cost functions.       We assume that        adjustment costs depend on net
investment,

                          (/2)     [I(t)/K(t) —          K(t),                           (11)


where     arid tS are unknown parameters to be estimated. Differentiating (11)

with respect to 1(t), inserting the result into (14b), and utilizing (7), we

obtain the following investment relationship,


   1(t)        s K(t) +   (1/ct) Q(t) — (1/ct) (p(t)+1) D(t),                            (12)

        Q(t)   V(t) +   D(t)   —
                                   p(t)   K(t),


where cz(t) is the difference between the financial value of the firm and its

replacement cost. (This latter term is closely related to QA(t); if adjustment

costs were valued by the price of investment goods rather than output, (t) in

(12) would be replaced by QA(t).) The first term in (12) represents

replacement investment, which is proportional to the capital stock; (t)

indicates the profitable level of investment activity — both physical and

financial -    for   the firm. The last term is the unobservable shadow price
                                            12


associated with debt, and represents flotation costs that are positively
related to Q(t). Thus, for a given movement in c2(t), the amount             of   resources
available for additions to physical capital will be lowered by the costs
associated with the flow of debt used to finance the marginal           project.      It
should be noted that (12) will be immune         from   the problem discussed in Section
II.B   of QA(t) generating    misleading signals. Under that       scenario, dV(t)

-d(—i(t))D(t) (cf., fn. 13), and dI(t) calculated from (12) would be zero.

Conventional formulations of the Q model have ignored the effect of endogenous

financial policy and, in order to gauge its importance on econometric

estimates, we postulate the following agency/flotation cost function,


   •3(D(t),d(t))       = D(t)°   d(t)1,                                                (13)

                              1>0, a>0, D(t)>0, d(t)>0


where a arid y   are   paran:Ieters to be estimated. It should be noted that both

(11) and (13) satisfy the curvature properties on '[tJ           discussed   in the text.1

        An   additional   assumption underlying the Propositions I and II was that

the (J's were all homogeneous of degree one. While this assumption may be

plausible for the production and adjustment cost technologies, it is arguably

inappropriate in regard to debt-related costs. If flotation and agency costs

have a large fixed—cost component, then a÷Y may be less than one; if marginal

flotation costs are positive and agency costs increase at an increasing rate,

then aY may be greater than one. To allow for the possibility that a+11,

Propositions I and II are restated as follows,



1Should dd=3d)O, then the firm would be willing to supply an infinite
amount of debt n order to exploit the concavity in its cost structure. To
eliminate this possibility, we impose legal constraints against paying
dividends in excess of (long-run) operating profits and accumulating excess
funds within the firm. In this case, the firm's additional debt issues mu8t be
used to finance investment, which, if the adjustment cost function is
sufficiently convex, will bound       d(t)<'.

PROPOSITION I' (the financial value of the firm)

Given the assumptions in Proposition I,

   V(t) +    D(t)     =    x(t)   K(t) +         (j(t)÷1)   D(t) +


      X(t)    =    (a+y-1)
                              J exp(-fp(u))        [D(s)° d(s)1] ds                       (1k)
                                       t
                             t

                  if and only     if
                 and 42(I(t),K(t)) are homogeneous of degree one in all
   arguments, c(D(t),d(t)) is homogeneous of degree o1, and exponential rates
   govern the depreciation of K(t) and the retirement of D(t).




PROPOSITION II' (marginal Q and average Q)


   QM(t) =         QA(t)
                             —    (i(t)+1)   *    (D(t)/p(t)K(t))     —
                                                                          (t)/p(t)K(t).   (15)


Note that Propositions I and II are special cases of Propositions I' and II'

when ai=1 ((t)=O), and thus it will be straightforward to test the assumption

of Increasing debt costs. When we allow for the possibility of this more

general situation, the marginal value of an additional unit of physical capital

is lowered by the differential debt costs —                  those that differ from constant

average cost — summed and discounted over the life of the firm. Since X(t)

extends over an infinite horizon, QM(t) in (15) is related to both current and

future variables. Believing that a substantial amount of the variation in x(t)

can be captured by current movements in the rate of discount and stock of debt,

we compute (t) under the assumption that p(s)=p(t), D(s)D(t), and d(s)—nD(t),

for all s>t. Differentiating (13) with respect to d(t), inserting the result

into (5a), and utilizing (1), (8), (12), (13), and (15), we obtain the

following structural econometric equation,
                                                 1'4

        -    (1/ci) [(t),D(t)+n      1 D0+Y I   K(t)
                                                                                          (16)
        — (aY—1)

         +   , I(t—1) / K(t) +

where all terms have been scaled by K(t) to avoid the spurious correlation

possible with variables trending upward over time (Granger and              Newbold,     19714).

Our   review   of estimated Q models indicated that lagged variables have proven

significant, and     the   lagged flow of physical investment has been added to (16)

to capture any dynamic effects not fully accounted for by the adjustment cost

technology.15 A significant value of            ip   can be interpreted as a sign   of
misspecltication in our econometric model. Lastly, c(t) is a white—noise error

term that reflects non—systematic variations in 1(t) and approximation errors

that have arisen in the development of the model.

        Equation (16) stands in sharp contrast to previously estimated investment

models utilizing an adjustment cost technology (11) but maintaining an

exogenous financial policy. In the latter case, debt ratios affect investment

decisions through the purchase price of new capital (p(t)) in much the same way

as investment tax credits.16 If the cost of debt is lower than equity, the

marginal investment expenditure receives a subsidy equal to the capitalized

difference in financing costs, a profit opportunity that firms constrained by

an exogenous financial policy fail to exploit. When the choice of financing is



151t should be noted that the addition of the lagged dependent variable
compromises the structural interpretation of (16).

l6See Ch.trinko (19814), whose formula differs from that of Summers (1981) and
Poterba and Summers (1983). The current analysis suggests that Poterba and
Summers' tests of the effects of dividend taxation within the Q framework may
be biased by their assumption of an exogenous financial policy. For example,
in 1965, changes in the United Kingdom tax code penalized dividends while
favoring debt finance (King, 1977, Table 7.1).
                                              15

determined    simultaneously with physical investment, the profit opportunity

vanishes, and    (16)    indicates that the conventional Q model is misspecif led. It

is possible that the emergence of significant lagged variables in previously

estimated    Q models and their generally disappointing empirical performance may
be due to the omitted debt terms in (16). Furthermore, a standard analysis of
omitted variables bias suggests that the conventional Q specification is likely
to generate estimated values of the adjustment cost parameter (ce) that are
biased upward.17 Whether endogenizing financial policy within the Q framework
mitigates some   of     these empirical   problems is   considered in light of the
econometric   results presented in the next sub—section.



  B. Econometric Results

      The structural equation following from the theoretical model was

estimated   with annual data for the nonfinancial corporate sector over the
period 1950—1981. The length of the sample was dictated by data availability,
and detailed information concerning data sources is contained in the Glossary.
While the theory implies that all capital inputs affecting the firm should be
included   in the series for the capital stock and investment flow, data
availability forces us to define capital as either equipment + structures (the
ES model) or equipment + structures ÷ inventories (the ESI model). As we shall
see, the lessons to be drawn from this paper are robust with respect to the
definition   of capital.
      Estimates of the nonlinear model (16) are presented in Table I, and are
computed   by full information maximum likelihood, which, under the present
circumstances, is equivalent to nonlinear least squares.18 A number of the


17Thls conclusion is based on the assumption of a positive correlation between
[(t)/K(t)]  and    [(d(t)/D(t))1D(t)/K(t)] and onthe constraint a—i—I, where I
is the "true", as opposed to the estimated, value of the parameter.

empirical problems with the conventional Q model (columns 1 and 4) are readily

apparent -   the        are low, the lagged dependent variable in the ES model is

significant, and the residuals are serially correlated.19 Furthermore, the ci's

are larger than the value underlying the simulation result cited in Section I,

and thus they imply a very slow response of the capital stock to unexpected

changes in the economic environment.20 Adjusted f or the difference in the mean

of c2(t) between the ES and ESI models, the      for the conventional ES model

becomes 109.2 and, consistent with the adjustment cost interpretation of this

parameter, indicates that the problem of long adjustment paths is more serious

when we confine our attention to fixed capital.

      The extent to which the analysis of financial policy alleviates these

problems    can be   assessed in a number of ways. The Q model with endogenous

financial    policy   nests the conventional specification, and the parametric

restrictions can be analyzed by a sequential testing procedure. In particular,

we can evaluate the following three hypotheses stated in terms of I and a:




lBSee the Appendix for a discussion of estimation issues and for additional
tables. Note that n has been set to .15 in all of the reported estimates.

19Seria]. correlation is assessed by the rn—statistic, distributed t under the
null hypothesis of no serial correlation. The rn—statistic is calculated in a
regression of the residuals from an equation with a lagged dependent variable (16)
on all of the explanatory variables in the initial regression plus the lagged
residual; m is the t—statistic on the lagged residual. Performing a t—test on
this coefficient is asymptotically equivalent to the Durbin h—test. However,
it can be calculated f or all possible values of the estimated parameters, and
has performed better than the h-statistic in Monte Carlo experiments (Harvey,
 1981, P. 276).

20Summers' (1981) preferred estimate of a is 32.258. AdJusted for the
difference in the means of (t), the comparable a's from Table I are 133.761
and 102.538 for the ES and ESI models, respectively.

and     the subscripts on H correspond to columns 1—3         f or the ES model or columns

14—6    for the ESI model, respectively. The hypotheses            are   evaluated   in

increasing order of restrictiveness by likelihood ratio tests, and an advantage
of this procedure is that the incremental test statistics are all independent
in large samples (Harvey, 1981, pp. 1814—185). For both the ES and                   ESI models,

the    restrictions characterizing the conventional model            are sustained    through
both    steps of the sequential testing procedure at the 5%              level, which implies a
nominal      significance level of 9.75% for the test of the conventional versus

general Q specification. Complementary evidence is provided by the

rn—statistic, indicating that the serial correlation in the residuals remains

when the debt—related variables are introduced. This problem is not mitigated

by   imposing    a second lag of      the   dependent variable (see Table A—I in the

Appendix). Combined with negative (though insignificant) a's and largely

unchanged ci's, these results suggest strongly that the source of

misspecification in Q models is not related to the treatment of financial

policy.

         One possible problem with these results Is         that they may be affected by
simultaneity bias. In (16), all of             the stock and asset price variables are
dated at the beginning of the period; hence, the only variable that might be

correlated with the error term is the current flow of              debt.    Nonlinear

instrinental variable estimates are presented in Table II, and the results are

quite    similar   to those obtained in Table i.21

        Stepping outside of the formal model, we consider the impact of two

additional variables that may be significant determinants of spending for      fixed
investment.22 First, an important assumption   implicit in our derivation of the
investment   equation was that the firm was always able to equate the marginal
costs of alternative sources of finance. During those periods when the firm
may not have ready entree to the capital markets, the presence of internal

funds   may prove important in financing investment expenditures and, to   test

their   importance, current cash flow Is entered as an additional regressor. The
results are displayed for the ES model in the first three columns of Table III,
and reveal a significant role for liquidity but at the expense of c2(t). When
the model is estimated with Instrumental variables, however, this significant

effect   disappears.23    Second, while demand conditions are explicitly accounted

for in the derivation of the Q model, It is possible that (t) is unable to

capture the full extent of this influence. For the ES model In Table IV, the

demand   variable   the percentage change in the constant dollar gross domestic
product of nonfinancial corporations — enters with a positive and significant


21The instrument set comprised a constant, time trend, the level of output
lagged one period, (t)/K(t), D(t)/K(t), and I(t—1)/K(t). The results reported
in Table II were robust with respect to variations In the Instrument list. In
the presence of serially correlated residuals, It would be preferable to lag
the instruments an additional period. However, the correlations between these
instruments and the variables in (16) were too weak to deliver any reliable
results.
22Parallel results for the ESI model can be found in the Appendix. For both
the ES and ESI models, 2(t-1)/K(t) and a time trend were entered separately as
additional regressors, both of which were significant and led to a substantial
decline in cz. Visual inspection of the residuals from a number of regressions
revealed a large, negative residual recurring in 1958. Except for a rejection
of H versus H at the 5% level in the ESI model, the use of a dummy variable
for 1'958 had lttle effect on the results of interest.

         result would   not appear to be due to weak instruments, as the R2   between
the liquidity variable and a constant, time trend, the level of Output lagged
one period, (t)/K(t), D(t)/K(t), I(t—1)/K(t), and LIQ(t—1)/K(t) is .70 and .79
for the ES and ESI models, respectively.

value of   is raised substantially, but becomes insignificant. Unlike the

results for liquidity, the demand variable remains significant with

instrunental variables, confirming the often—observed sensitivity of investment

spending to demand.

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

       Recent research in macroeconomics has emphasized the need for working
with optimizing models and the importance of linking the financial and real
sectors of the economy. Tobin's Q model of investment would appear to provide
a   framework that could satisfy these two criteria. However, when the firm

actively participates in more than     one   financial market, we have shown that Q

is likely to be an uninformative and      possibly   misleading signal   for   investment

expenditures.

       We have endeavored to turn this negative theoretical result to positive

advantage in resolving a number of problems with the empirical performance of Q

models. In the presence of eridogenous financial policy, a structural

investment model can    be   preserved as long as the estimates are conditioned on

debt-related variables. Unfortunately, such modifications to the conventional

Q model receive little support frQn the data. Relative to the specification

incorporating endogenous financial policy, the conventional Q model was

sustained   in asequential testing procedure, and a number of empirical problems
remained   under the more general specification - slow adjustment speeds,
significant lagged variables, and      serially    correlated residuals. In addition,

demand conditions, proxied by the percentage change in output, proved quite

significant at the expense of the Q variable. Thus, on both theoretical and

empirical grounds and    contrary   to the sanguine view expressed recently by

Fischer and   Merton   (198'4), we conclude that Q    theory   is unlikely to provide the

basis for a satisfactory investment model linking the financial and            real
sectors.    Whether a suitable framework is       to be found   by modifying the
adjustment    cost technology or by Introducing additional dynamic elements
remains an open question for future research.

GLOSSARY AND DATA SOURCES

         For ease of exposition, the model developed in the text avoided

considering taxes, an omission that can not be maintained in the econometric

analysis. Tax variables enter the structural econometric model (16) only

through c(t), and three modifications are         necessary   —
                                                                  lowering   the replacement
cost of capital to reflect the subsidies provided by the investment credit and

depreciation allowances; adjusting the price of output to reflect the rate of

corporate income taxation; and subtracting from c2(t) the value of tax

depreciation allowances on real assets purchased prior to t. The calculation

of this latter term is somewhat involved, and the use of available series would

have shortened the sample period. Since the bulk of the variation in (t) is

attributable to the financial assets, the adjustment for the value of existing

depreciation     allowances has not been made. Comparing regressions based on this
adjustment to those contained in Table I indicates that the results, while
slightly improved, are not appreciably affected. The correlation of Q(t)'s
with and without this adjustment is always greater than .95 (time series for
the value of existing depreciation allowances were taken from CO and HA). As
far   as possible, all data pertain to the nonfinancial corporate sector.
Sources   and   descriptions   of the series used in the estimation are detailed

below.

 APPENDIX. ESTIMATION ISSUES AND ADDITIONAL RESULTS

        All computations were performed with version 14.OE of' TSP on the VAX 780

 at the Hoover Institution. The Davidon—Fleteher--powell algorithm was used, and

 the convergence criteria was set at .05 percent. In order to obtain consistent

 estimates of the standard errors, the converged model was iterated an

 additional time using the method proposed by Berndt, Hall, Hall, and Hausman

 (197L). These were generally larger than those obtained under nonlinear least

squares.

        Two problems were encountered in performing the computations. First,

direct estimates of n were not obtainable, and a grid search was conducted over

a range of admissible values. This range was restricted by the flotation/

agency cost function (13), which, if d(t)>0, implies that r)>—D(t)/D(t). Given

our time series for D(t), r must equal or exceed .15, a value implying that,

after 20 years, 95% of a debt issue would be retired. The model was estimated

for 's between .15 and .30 in increments of .01, and the likelihood function

was very flat over this range. For both the ES and ESI models, the likelihood

function generally increases in ri and reaches a maximum at ri-.30, though the

absolute difference between the log likelihoods evaluated at n-.15 and ri—.30 is

less than .126. Since r.15 provides a reasonable pattern of debt retirements,

it is used in all of the reported estimates. Second, in the most general model

with I and a entering freely, the data were not rich enough to permit direct

and accurate estimates of these parameters. To avoid the large standard errors

that occurred in some instances, we defined aI÷a,   obtained   estimates of I and

a,   and calculated a in terms of these directly estimated parameters. Estimates

of the other model parameters remain largely unaffected under either estimation

technique.

       Additional estimates of (16) are presented in the following tables.
