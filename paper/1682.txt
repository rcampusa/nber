               The Cost of Annuities: Implications
                 for Saving Behavior and Bequests


                                ABSTRACT




       The fact that most eldealy individuals in the United States choose

to maintain a flat age-wealth profile, rather than buy individual life

annuities, stands in contrast to central implications of the standard

life—cycle model of consumption—saving behavior. The analysis in this

paper lends support to an explanation for this phenomenon based either

on the cost of annuities, importantly including the element of that cost

due to adverse selection, or on the interaction of that cost and an

intentional   bequest motive.
       Expected yields offered on individual life annuities in the United

States are lower by some 4-6%, or 2 1/2-4 1/2% after allowing for

adverse selection, than yields on alternative long—term fixed—income

investments. Simulations of an extended model of life-cycle saving and

portfolio behavior, allowing explicitly for uncertain lifetimes and

Social Security, show that yield differentials in this range can account

for the observed behavior, even in the absence of a bequest motive, during

the early years of retirement. By contrast, at older ages the combination

of yield differentials in this range and a positive bequest motive is

necessary to do so.

     TEE COST OF ANNUITIES: IMPLICATIONS FOR SAVING BEHAVIOR AND BEOUESTS


                    Benjamin M. Friedman and Mark Warshawsky*


                It is common experience that as we grow older
         and nearer to eternity we become more, not less, anxious
         about money. Derek Brewer, Chaucer and His World (p. 213).

         It   is startling, at least for economists 'fno view consumption—

saving   behavior within the ftamerk of the familiar life cycle model,

to confront the fact that in the     United States   few individuals purchase

life annuities. According to the life cycle model, the chief principle

governing individual saving behavior is the desire to smooth consumption

patterns   over one' s lifetime, within the constraints imposed by limited
lifetime resources.1 Despite ample evidence of such smoothing behavior
with respect to short-run income fluctuations, age-wealth profiles show
little if any tendency for elder individuals to dissave out of available
resources as their remaining life expectancy shortens.2 This behavior would
be   understandable in terms of the standard life cycle model with risk—

averse individuals uncertain about their length of life, only if annuity

markets did not exist. Without access to life annuities, elder individuals

would conserve wealth to self—insure against the risk of having to reduce

consumption in later years if their life span turns out to be unexpectedly

long.3 Well-developed markets for life annuities do exist in the United

States, howeve'r. The puzzle is that so few people choose to use them.4

         Some   of the potential answers to this puzzle bear important implications
not only for the theory of consumption—saving behavior but also for major
issues of public policy. Perhaps the most obvious possibility is that iflst
people   save (or, in old age, choose not to dissave) not for motives related

to the usual life cycle reasoning but, instead, to leave bequests to their
                                              —2—




heirs.5 Although     at   a   formal level    it is easy enough to modify the life

cycle model   to   incorporate a bequest motive, the two rationales for saving

have strongly differing implications. If saving to fund intentional

bequests accounts for a large share of actual wealth holding, then familiar

life cycle conclusions, on issues as diverse as the efficacy of tax

incentives for capital formation and the economic effects of Social Security,

may   no longer hold.
         An alternative explanation for the lack of participation in the

annuity market is that most individuals automatically receive life

annuities   from Social       Security and,   for   an increasing fraction of the labor

force, employer-sponsored pension plans. Nevertheless, it is difficult to
believe that the combination of Social Security and private pension coverage
so precisely matches each individual's preferences for annuity holding
as to leave only minimal individual annuity demand remaining. Moreover,
although both Social Security and private pension coverage have grown
enormously just within recent decades, the minimal extent of individual
life annuity purchases in the         United States is apparently a phenosnon

of long standing.

         A more plausible explanation,which again relegates intentional

bequests to a minor role and thereby rescues the life cycle model and its

implications, is that people shun individual annuities because they are not

priced "fairly" in the actuarial sense. A "load factor," depressing the

yield on an annuity below the corresponding actuarially fair yield, could

reflect ordinary transactions costs (including taxes and a competitive

return to the annuity issuer's capital at risk) , monopoly profits earned

by annuity issuers in imperfectly competitive markets, or               as discussed

at some length below — adverse selection among annuity purchasers.
                                         —3—




Whatever its source, such a differential between the implicit expected
yield on annuities and the available yield on alternative forms of

wealth holding would clearly discourage annuity purchases. In the limit,

if the differential were large enough, standard models of consumption-

saving   behavior without annuity markets could again apply.
         The object of this paper is to examine the pricing of individual
life annuities     in the United States, and to infer from the observed

market price structure the respective roles of actuarially unfair annuity

prices and the intentional bequest motive in explaining the puzzle that

so few individuals actually purchase such annuities. More specifically,

the questions addressed here are, first, how large the yield differential

actually is on readily available individual life annuities and, second,

whether   the          yield differential is large enough to discourage a
                observed

typically   risk-averse elder individual from buying annuities in the absence
of a positive bequest motive.      In light of the great attention devoted to

annuities   in the theoretical literature of consumption—saving behavior,
together with the potential importance of actuarially unfair annuity prices
in explaining the observed behavior, it is surprising that (to the authors'
knowledge) no one has previously    examined these data and their implications.

         Section   I presents data on the implicit yield on individual life
annuities in the United States during 1968-83, and compares these yields
to   those on alternative long—term fixed-income investment vehicles to

measure the effective cost of annuities. Section II, drawing on the work of

Fischer (1973) ,   describes a model representing the consumption-saving and
portfolio allocation behavior of an individual with uncertain lifetime,

who has access to a life annuity market but (in general) also values bequests.

Section III uses simulations of this model, based on observed annuity yield
                                    —4—




differentials, to draw inferences about the respective roles of annuity

costs and a bequest motive in accounting for the typical individual's

preferences for maintaining a flat age-wealth profile instead of buying

annuities. Section IV briefly summarizes the paper's principal findings.

I.   Yields on Individual Life Annuities

        Table 1 presents calculations of the expected yields on individual

life annuities offered in the United States, during 1968—83, based on

annuity premiums quoted in successive issues of the A.M. Best Flitcraft

Compend.6 The premium underlying each reported calculation is that

quoted for a single-premium immediate annuity for 65-year—old males.

The assumed mortality probabilities underlying these calculations are

the general population mortality probabilities for 65-year-old males

reported in the 1970 and 1980 U.S. Life Tables, adjusted by a factor ot

.985 to reflect the 1.5% annual improvement in U.S. male mortality

probabilities that has occurred over the last two decades, and by a

further factor of .9925 to reflect the assumption of a future 0.75% annual

improvement in male mortality probabilities for all ages.7

        The first column of Table 1 indicates the expected yield calculated

from the mean premium charged on this basic annuity contract by the ten

largest insurance companies in the United States. These data are probably

the most relevant for analyzing economy—wide individual behavior. The

largest insurers usually do business in all regions of the country, so

that the typical 65-year-old U.S. male has access to annuities at thLs

mean premium with little or no search costs. The associated expected

yield has risen over time as market interest rates have risen, although the

expected annuity yield has consistently remained well below the contemporary

yields on readily available fixed—income investments. This simple comparison

does not indicate that annuities are a 'dominated asset," however,

because the lifetime guarantee provided by an annuity is not available from

other investment vehicles.

        The remaining columns of Table 1 indicate the potential returns to

market search by showing the dispersion of expected yields calculated

from the premiums charged for this same basic contract by different

insurers.9 The second and third columns show data for the highest and

lowest expected yields on this contract offered by any of the ten largest

insurers. Presumably most 65—year—old males have access to the highest

yields in this group at only modest search cost. The final column of the

table shows the highest expected yield on this contract offered by any

of the fifty—odd insurers in Best's sample. Because the smaller companies

in the sample do not necessarily maintain sales forces in all parts

of the country, however, there is no presumption that the typical

65—year-old male has ready access to this complete-sample highest yield.

       If all individuals had identical mortality probabilities, the

spread between the calculated expected yields shown in Table 1

and some reference yield reflecting the typical individual's opportunity cost

would indicate the effective cost to the individual of the risk avoidance

that annuities provide. In fact, however, many individuals have

information that leads them to expect either a shorter or a longer life

than the population—wide average, By contrast, insurers typically

charge a uniform premium to all individuals of the same age and sex,

presumably because information about individual mortality probabilities

is too costly, or perhaps even impossible, to obtain and use. Individuals

expecting longer (shorter) than average lifespans will therefore perceive

that life annuities bear higher (lower) expected yields, and hence will
                                     10
be more (less) likely to buy them.        This adverse selection — adverse

from the viewpoint of the insurer, that is —      will   lead to underwriting

losses if the insurer continues to charge a premium that is actuarially

fair to the population as a whole.

         Table 2 therefore presents analogous calculations of the expected

yields on the same basic annuity contract for a 65-year-old male, based

on the same annuity premiums as before, but now based on alternative

mortality probabilities compiled from the actual company experience

on individual life annuity contracts issued in the United States during

1971—75, again adjusted as indicated above    to   reflect the improvement

in mortality probabilities.11 Figure 1 indicates the extent to which

the sub-population who choose to buy annuities in fact have a greater

survival probability than the general population. Because of this greater

life expectancy, the expected yields shown in Table 2 are greater than

the   corresponding values shown in   Table 1, based on general population

mortality   probabilities. Nevertheless, even these greater expected yields
resulting   from the actual company experience mortality probabilities are

still lower than the contemporary yields on readily available alternative

forms of wealth holding. Hence even the sub—population who voluntarily

buy annuities still face a negative yield differential repreenting the

cost of the protection from risk that the annuity provides.

         Table 3 summarizes the cost of this basic annuity contract by

showing the 1968-83 mean values of the differential between the

expected yields shown in Tables 1 and 2 and two different market interest

rates: the 20-year U.S. government bond yield and the average yield

on corporate debt directly placed with insurance companies. From the

standpoint of an individual's opportunity cost of funds, the (lower)

yield on U.S. Government bonds is more relevant if the individual has no

better investment vehicle available. Increasingly, however, U.S. financial

intermediaries have offered individuals ways of buying shares in pools

of less liquid but higher—yielding assets.

       The resulting average yield differentials shown in Table 3 range

from a minimum (in absolute value) of - .95% for the highest expected

yield offered by any company in Best's sample, compared to the Government

bond yield and based on actual company experience mortality probabilities,

to a maximum of -6.90% for the lowest yield offered by any of the ten

largest insurers, compared to the direct placement yield and based on

general population mortality probabilities. The differentials in the

table that are probably most relevant for studying economy—wide

individual behavior are those shown in the first row, for the mean expected

yield offered by the ten largest insurers, compared to the yield on

either Government bonds or direct placements, and based on either

general population or company experience mortality probabilities. These

differentials range from -2.43% to -6.13% — large values from some

perspectives, but not, for example, in comparison to the yield differential

that most individuals incur in holding money balances.

       The question at issue here is whether these differentials are

sufficient to account for the preference for maintaining a flat age—wealth

profile over purchasing life annuities observed among the elderly population

in the United States. Since it is impossible to answer this question

on a purely empirical basis, some more formal.   analytical   approach is

necessary. Section II develops a suitable framework for analysis, and

Section III applies this framework in the context of the observed yield

differentials reported here.

II.     A Model of Saving and 2nnuity Demand

          The model developed here to analyze the demand for individual life

annuities in the context of life cycle saving and a bequest motive is an

annuity analog of Fischer's (1973) model of the demand for life insurance,

generalized           to incorporate fixed mandatory holdings of socially provided
annuities.12 Following Fischer, it is useful to represent the individual's
decision problem in this expanded life cycle context as the maximization
of expected lifetime utility
         w-x-l
E(U) =                [PtUt(ct)    +                                                          (1)




where w is the assumed maximum length             of   life, x is the individual's age

as of time t=O, Pt is the probability that an ind.ividual of age                 x at   t=O

will be alive at any time t>O, q1 is the (conditional) probability that

such an individual who was alive at time t would              die   at time t+l)3

Ut(Ct) is utility received from             consuntion C   at time   t,   and Vt÷i(Gt+i) is

utility received from (anticipation of) a bequest G at time t+l. Again

following Fischer, it is convenient to specify the two utility functions

in the iso-elastic form
           -

ut(Ct)
         =               a                                                                    (2)

             G1
         =
Vt(Gt)                   bt                                                                   (3)




where        is the pratt—Arrow coefficient of relative risk aversion, a is the

time   preference        parameter, and bt (in comparison to at) indicates the

relative     utility attached to bequests left in period
         The usual life cycle specification of behavior with no bequest motive
is therefore just            the   special case of this model with btO for all t>O. In
                                              —10-




general, however, people          may   value bequests, and   they   may value them

differently        at different   times. For example, Yaari (1965) has suggested

that bt follows a hump-shaped pattern, with higher values during the

years when family dependency is important, and either level or declining

values during retirement years when children have typically become

financially independent,

         The individual's problem is then to maximize (1), subject to a

given    initial wealth position and to a         nonnegativity constraint on

wealth   in each subsequent time period, given          the   menu of available
investment opportunities (including any mandatory holding of socially
provided annuities) and their respective yields.15 In each period the
individual must decide not only how much of current wealth                to   consume but
also how to allocate the remainder among the available investment vehicles.
The specific asset menu considered here includes a riskiess one—period

bond bearing gross rate of return Rt, a one—period social annuity bearing

gross rate of return S to survivors, and a one—period market annuity
bearing gross rate of return    to survivors)6 Both annuities are
actuarially fair — that is, there is no expected yield differential for
either   — if
           S   =            A                                                            4)
                      ÷1)Q = Rt.
With little relevant loss of generality, it is           also   convenient to set Rt

constant at R for all t>0.

         The   dynamic programming solution to this problem proceeds from the
final period t=w-x-l, in which the certainty of death at the end of the
period (q=l) simplifies the problem of an individual who has survived to
that date to merely choosing C1 to maximize the sum of utility from current
consumption Uwx_l(Cw_x_i) and utility from bequests Vwx(Gwx), subject to

The consunption decision (5)        represents the entire solution for t=w—x—l,
since   in that period the availability of annuities is irrelevant to the

analysis.

         The dynamic programming solution next proceeds to the individuai 's

         The remainder of the dynamic programming solution proceeds backward
to the initial period t=O. in an analogous way. The expressions for
each period's optimal consumption and purchases of market annuities, and
for each period's value of the indirect utility function, are of the same
form (but with subscripts adjusted accordingly) as (12), (13) and (14),
respectively. Because the analytical properties of the model are not
sufficient     to address the more quantitative questions that are the focus

of this paper, however, Section III proceeds with numerical simulations of

the model under several different sets of assumptions about the crucial

bequest motive parameter and the cost of private annuities.

III. Simulation Results

         The model developed in Section II generates lifetime streams of

consumption and annuity purchase values that are optimal for given

values of parameters describing preferences (,          c   and b) ,   the   market

environment (R,          and 2S) and mortality probabilities (p and q). The

principal focus of interest in this paper is on one aspect of preferences

and one aspect of the market environment — the bequest motive and the

cost (yield) of market annuities, respectively.

         The strategy adopted here for representing the bequest motive

is simply to asunsne that the correspondence between bt in (3) and c

in (2) is just



   =          0,                    t=O,...,35                                           (17)



where B is a non—age-specific parameter indicating the individual's

life—long preference for bequests relative to current consumption,

given the other paraitters of the model, including in particular the

interest rate (R) ,       the   curvature of the utility function ()         , and   —
because B implicitly gives the relative weight of a stock (the bequest)

versus   a flow (consumption) — the assumed time unit of analysis. Given
B, the bequest amount is larger as R is higher, and smaller as                 is higher.
For example, from (5)-(7) and (17), e takes the value (Gw—x/Cw—x—l                   )
where     w—x/Cw—x—l )
         (G               is    just the ratio of the final-period bequest to the

prior—period consumption. The normally limiting case for altruistic

bequests, in which an individual provides for his heirs' consumption at

the same level as his own, indicates (l/R—1) 35/R as the logical upper

bound on 0.18 In the simulations reported below, the strength of the

bequest motive is indicated by B and the corresponding bequest/consumption

ratio (G/C1) that would result under access to fair annuities,

given the other assumed   parameters.
        The strategy used to represent the market for private annuities

is simply to assume that such annuities are readily available at some

expected yield differential


D =              -   R.
       Q(l_g1)                                                                     (18)



In the simulations reported below, the values used for D include zero,

all four values shown in the top line of Table 3 for the expected yield

differential offered by the ten largest insurers (ranging from —2.43%

to —6.13%), and the smallest differential shown in Table 3 (-.95%, for

the highest yield offered by any company in Best's sample, compared to

the Government bond yield and based on actual company experience mortality

probabilities). Because these yield differentials are large enough in

some cases to induce an individual to want to act as if he were the

insurer by issuing rather than holding annuities against his own life —

that   is, in effect short-selling the annuity contract by issuing debt

on which repayment (adjusted by his survival probability) is contingent

on his own survival — a nonnegativity constraint is imposed in all

simulations.

         Table 4 summarizes the results of three sets of simulations of the

model, based on different combinations of these assumed values of U              and   D.

In each simulation the assumed time preference parameter is a =           .99,   the

assumed market interest rate is R =      1.01,    the assumed coefficient of

relative risk aversion is     =   4,   the assumed fraction of wealth mandatorily

invested in actuarially fair social annuities is S =         .5,   and the assumed

mortality probabilities are those reported in the 1980 U.s. Life Tables.19

The upper panel of the table presents results based on morta]ity probabilities

for 65—year—old males, while the middle and lower panels present analogous

results for 70— and 75-year—old males, respectively.

        For each set of assumed values, the solution of the model yields an

entire time series representing each year's consumption and each year's

division of privately held wealth (that is, wealth not mandatorily held in

social annuities) between bonds and private annuities 20 Given the
objective   of this paper, however, Table 4 reports        for each simulation only
the    optimal holding of private annuities at three specific ages, expressed

in each case as a percentage of total wealth.21 With one—half of total

wealth assumed to be held in social annuities, and with the nonnegativity

constraint imposed, the range of possible values of the share of wealth

held in private annuities is from zero to 50%.

        The results shown in Table 4 suggest that, within the empirically

relevant range of variation for either D or 0, demand for individual

life annuities is sensitive both to the cost of annuities and to the

bequest motive. If annuities are actuarially fair and there is no bequest

motive, (that is, with D = 0 = 0)     ,   the   optimal solution to the maximization

problem posed in Section II calls for stabilizing the lifetime consumption

stream completely by investing all of privately held wealth in private

annuities, so that A = 50.00%.       Either a negative yield differential or

a positive bequest motive makes annuities less attractive. The results

summarized in the table show how variations in D or 0, or both, reduce A

from   the 50.00% reference point.
        These results suggest not only that the cost of annuities is a key
                                     —17—




part of the explanation for the small participation in the market for

individual life annuities, but also that the adverse selection element

is a crucial part of that cost. Given the near absence of individual

annuity purchases, the real question at issue in these simulations is what

combinations of D and 0 are sufficient to drive optimal annuity holdings

to no more than a trivially small percentage of initial wealth. For 65—year-

old males, for example, none of the values of 0 shown in Table 4 does so

in the absence of a negative expected yield differential. By contrast,

for each of the three largest (in absolute value) values of D considered,

the optimal portfolio allocation decision is to buy no private annuities at

all — regardless   of the presence or absence of a bequest motive. Reference

to Table 3 indicates that D = -2.43%, the largest value considered at

which it is optimal to hold any private annuities at all, is the differential

faced by an individual who knows that his mortality probabilities are like

those of other annuity purchasers rather than the general population, and

for whom the Government bond yield represents the opportunity cost of

funds. By contrast, D = -4.21%, the smallest value considered at which

it is optimal to hold no private annuities, is the differential faced by

a comparable individual without specific knowledge of his mortality

probabilities.

       The results based on mortality probabilities for 70-year-old males

are essentially identical to those for 65—year-olds. For 75-year-olds,

however, the results differ in two interesting respects. First, for this

group positive private annuity holdings are optimal even at D = -4.21%

or -4.35% (although still not at -6.13%) .   Second, at these larger yield
differentials, a bequest motive corresponding to a bequest/consumption ratio

of nearly three is sufficient to reduce optimal private annuity holdings to

less than 15% of initial wealth. A more modest bequest motive still leaves
                                          —18—




the optimal demand for private annuities implausibly large, however.

       Although the simulation results summarized in Table 4 are sensitive

in at least some regard to each of the underlying assumptions, it is

especially interesting in this context to consider the implications of

an alternative assumption about the strength of individuals' risk aversion.

Because the basic purpose of an annuity is to insure against the consumption

risk associated with an uncertain lifetime, greater risk aversion

unambiguously implies a larger demand for annuities.

       Table 5 therefore presents a corresponding set of results, identical

to those in Table 4 in every way except that the assumed coefficient of

relative risk aversion is        = 2.22 As in the results based on     = 4 in

Table 4, the demand     for   private annuities with = 2 appears to be

sensitive   both   to the yield differential and to the strength of the bequest

mctive. For 65—year—olds, for example, at the same D = -2.43% considered

above, the optimal holding of private annuities varies from 50% of

total wealth for 0    =0   to only 1% for 0   = 10,   corresponding to a bequest!

consumption ratio of 2.5. With a zero yield differential, 0 = 50 is

sufficient to reduce private annuity demand to only 12% of total wealth,

but the corresponding bequest/consumption ratio is implausibly high.23 The

results for 70-year-olds are again essentially identical. Finally, again

as in the results in Table 4, for 75-year-olds the combination of D =        -2.43
and 0 = 10 (bequest/consumption ratio of 2.5) is sufficient to reduce

private annuity demand to just over 15% of wealth. Similarly, with a

bequest motive of this strength private annuity purchases are barely positive

for D = -4.21% and are zero for D = -4.35%.

       In sum, during the early retirement years the cost of annuities,

as represented by the expected yield differential, appears to be a

sufficient explanation for the observed general absence of participation

in the individual life annuity market in the United States, for either

level of risk aversion. By contrast, at older ages a combination of the

cost of annuities and a positive bequest motive, acting in conjunction,

is necessary to provide an explanation for this phenomenon within the

context of the analytical framework applied here.

IV.   Conclusions   and Caveats

       The fact that most elderly individuals in the United States choose

to maintain a flat age-wealth profile, rather than buy individual life

annuities, stands in contrast to central implications of the standard

life—cycle model of consumption-saving behavior. The analysis in this

paper lends support to an explanation for this phenomenon based either

on the cost of annuities, importantly including the cost element due

to adverse selection, or on the interaction of that cost and an intentional

bequest motive.

       Expected yields offered on individual life annuities in the

United States are lower by 4.21-6.13%, or 2.43-4.35% after allowing

for adverse selection, than yields on alternative long—term fixed—

income investments. Simulations of an extended model of life-cycle

saving and portfolio behavior, allowing explicitly for uncertain

lifetimes and Social Security, show that yield differentials in this

range can account for the observed behavior, even in the absence of a

bequest motive, during the early years of retirement. By contrast, at

older ages, the combination of yield differentials in this range and a

positive bequest motive can also do so.

       As is usually the case with any initial analysis, caution is

appropriate in relying on these results without further research.

Although the model used in this analysis does generalize the standard

life cycle model in several potentially important ways, it still limits

the conclusiveness of the results by in effect excluding a priori three

further possible explanations for the observed behavior.24

       First, informal discussions with insurers and financial advisors to

individuals suggest that many people choose stable age-wealth profiles, rather
                                            —21—




than either    buying annuities   or   simply   consuming out of   wealth, from

fear   of the consequences of catastrophic illness. Although this
explanation seems to imply (counter to experience) that the introduction
of ?dicare should have changed the typical behavior in a readily visible
way, it is difficult to judge how much knowledge people actually have
about the Jdicare program — or, indeed, how much confidence they have

in   it.
           Second, the entire analysis here, as in most of the literature to
date, is inlicitly in real terms. By contrast, the individual life
annuities available in U.S. markets guarantee specified nominal payments.
Insurers often argue that they would find little market for a "real
annuity" if they marketed such an instrument, but (to the authors' knowledge)
the experinnt is untried.
           Third, while the analysis here employs the standard theory of
expected utility ma.xiinization, evidence exists that apparently contradicts
this theory as a description of decision making under risk, especially when
the prospect of rare events is involved. In particular, individuals appear
systematically to overweight the probability of rare events 25 The more
familiar implication of this psychological tendency is that it contributes
to the attractiveness of both gambling and insurance. In reverse, however,
it would also make annuities less desirable.
           These further possible explanations for the fact that most of the
retired    elderly choose flat age—wealth profiles over purchases of individual

life annuities remain as objects for future research, so that the explanation

provided here in terms of actuarially unfair pricing (either with or

without a positive bequest motive) is necessarily tentative. Within the
                                     —22—




limits of the analysis carried out here, however, the conclusions reported

in this paper point clearly toward the importance of actuarially unfair

annuities.

4. The Retirement History Survey indicates that only 2% of the elderly
    population own individual annuities of any sort; see for example,
    Friedman and Sjogren (1980). A more specific example may further help
    to illustrate the low level of activity in the individual life
                                                                    annuity
    market,: One large insurer, considered to be more active than average
    in this market, sold an average of $18.5 million of individual life
    annuities each year during 1980—83. By contrast, the same company's
    annual sales of individual life insurance averaged $18.1 billion
    during this period.

5. Kotlikoff and Summers (1981) for example, have argued that intergenerational
                                     ,


    transfers account for "the vast majority" of aggregate U.S. savings,
    while life cycle saving accounts for "only a negligible fraction" of the
    aggregate.

6. The expression used to calculate these yields is

                     (l+r) -t
             w-x-l
        P=
              t=l
     where P is the quoted per—dollar premium, w is the assumed maximum length
     of life (here taken to be 110 years) ,      x   is the age at the date of issue
     (here 65 years) ,    r is the relevant interest rate, and         is the
     probability that an individual of age x at time t=1 will survive to
     any year t>l. These annual calculations are then converted to a
     monthly basis. The Appendix to Friedman and Warshawsky (1985) shows
     that calculations for 65-year—old females, or for 70—year-old or 75-year—
     old males, lead to results roughly similar to those for 65-year—old males.

7.   The calculations rely on the 1970 tables for years 1968-70, on the 1980
     tables for years 1980-83, and on both tables (weighted) for years 1971-79.
     See Faber (1982) for a complete description of the U.S. Life Tables,
     and Wetterstrand (1983) for a discussion of improvements in mortality
     probabilities.

     term U.S. Government bond rate, exceeded the mean annuity premium
     charged to 65—year—old males in all years of the sample except
     1980, 1981 and 1982; see Friedman and Warshawsky (1985)

 9. This dispersion probably reflects search costs; see, for example
     Pratt et al. (1979) . Alternatively, it could reflect different
     marketing choices by different insurers.

     application of it to the demand for life insurance.

13. Probabilities Pt and        are, of course, conditional on initial age x.
      Writing them as p(x)t and (x)1 would be appropriate but would clutter
      an already cumbersome notation. Conditionality on x is to be understood,
      here and below.

14. See Hakkanson (1969) for a discussion of the iso—elastic utility
      function.

15.   In a more general context it would also be necessary to take account
      of labor income. Th focus of this paper, however, is on the elderly
      retired population.

16. As in Fischer (1973), the assumption of one-period annuities makes the
     analysis tractable. The annuities actually available for purchase in
     the United States are instead life annuities.

17. The model as written here imposes no nonnegativity constraint on
     choice paramter A — that is, it does not explicitly preclude short
     sales of annuities. The simulations reported in Section III below
      impose A>0.

18. It is also possible, of course, to posit avarietyof circumstances
     in which an altruistic individual may value his heirs' consumption
     more than his own, so that 0 need not be bounded. In addition,
     individuals may value bequests for non—altruistic reasons; see,
     for example, Bernheim et al. (1984)

19. The assumptions ci. = .99 and R = 1.01 follow Kotlikoff and Spivak
      (1981) . The assumption   = 4 follows Bodie et al. (1985) , and
      corresponds to the evidence found by Grossman and Shiller (1981)
      One-half is about the fraction of total wealth constituted by Social
      Security for the average wealth constituted by Social Security for
      the average retired elderly individual in the United States; see
      Kotlikoff and Smith (1983) ,   Table 3.7.19 (p.127)

20. See Friedman and Warshawsky (1985) for illustrations of these time
     paths in the case of fair annuities.
21. Wealth held in annuity form is valued at the present expected value.

22. Friend and Blume (1975) found evidence indicating a relative risk
     aversion coefficient roughly equal to 2.

23. For males Menchik and David (1982, p. 193, Table 1) reported a median
     bequest equal to 2.1 times median annual labor income (defined as
     one—fortieth of average annual labor earnings) , and a mean bequest
     equal to 4.2 times mean annual labor income.

24. An additional factor explored by Kotlikoff and Spivak (1981)
     intergenerational risk sharing within families could also possibly
    explain the &bsence of individual life annuity purchases, but not
    the flat age—wealth profile.
25. See, for example,   Kahneman and Tversky (1979).
