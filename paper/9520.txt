Is deflation depressing? Evidence from the Classical Gold Standard

                                            ABSTRACT

        We distinguish between good and bad deflations. In the former case, falling prices may be
caused by aggregate supply (possibly driven by technology advances) increasing more rapidly than
aggregate demand. In the latter case, declines in aggregate demand outpace any expansion in
aggregate supply. This was the experience in the Great Depression (1929-33), the recession of
1919-21, and may be the case in Japan today.
        In this paper we focus on the price level and growth experience of the United States and
Canada, 1870-1913. Both countries adhered to the international gold standard. This meant that the
domestic price level was largely determined by international (exogenous) forces. In addition,
neither country had a central bank which could intervene in the gold market to shield the domestic
economy from external conditions.
        We proceed by identifying separate ‘supply’ shocks, money supply shocks and demand
shocks using a Blanchard-Quah methodology. We model the economy as a small open economy
on the gold standard and identify the shocks by imposing long run restrictions on the impact of the
shocks and on output prices. We then do a historical decomposition to examine the impact of each
shock on output. The results for the U.S. are clear: the different rates of change in the price levels
before and after 1890 are attributed to different monetary shocks, but these shocks explain very little
of output growth or volatility, which is almost entirely a response to ‘supply’ shocks. For Canada
the results are murkier. As in the U.S., the money supply shocks before 1896 are predominantly
negative and after that are largely positive. However, they are non-neutral, and relative to the U.S.,
money supply shocks play a larger role in determining output behavior in Canada.
        The key conclusion of our analysis is that the simple demarcation of good vs. bad deflation,
where either prices fall because of a positive supply shock, or prices fall because of a negative
demand (money) shock does not capture the complexity of the historical experience of the pre-1896
period. Indeed, we find that prices fell as a result of a combination of negative money supply shocks
and positive supply shocks.

Introduction

        In the four decades before World War I most of the countries in the world adhered to the
classical gold standard. The period was characterized by two decades of secular deflation, fol-
lowed by two decades of secular inflation. This early price level experience should be of great
contemporary interest because most advanced countries have returned to an environment of price
stability not terribly dissimilar to that of the classical gold standard era.1

        Deflation has had a ‘bad rap’. Possibly as a consequence of the combination of deflation
and depression in the 1930s, deflation is associated with (for some, connotes) depression. On the
face of it, the evidence from the late 19th century was mixed: on the one hand, the mild deflation
in the period 1870 - 1896 was accompanied by positive growth in many countries, however,
growth accelerated during the period of inflation after 1896. We distinguish between good and
bad deflations. In the former case, falling prices may be caused by aggregate supply (possibly
driven by technology advances) increasing more rapidly than aggregate demand. In the latter case,
declines in aggregate demand outpace any expansion in aggregate supply. This was the experience
in the Great Depression (1929-33), the recession of 1919-21, and may be the case in Japan today.

        In this paper we focus on the price level and growth experience of the United States and
Canada, 1870-1913. Both countries adhered to the international gold standard, under which the
world price level was determined by the demand and supply of monetary gold, and each member
followed the rule of maintaining convertibility of its national currency into a fixed weight of gold.2
This meant that the domestic price level was largely determined by international (exogenous)
forces. In addition, neither country had a central bank which could intervene in the gold market to
shield the domestic economy from external conditions.3 While both countries had relatively similar
resource endowments, the US was much more developed than Canada and hence was more
exposed to the business cycle. In addition the US unit banking system was more prone to panics

1
  This is not to say that monetary authorities adhere to the principle of gold convertibility but that they are
dedicated to low inflation or price stability.
2
  This is a slight simplification. The US suspended the gold standard during the Civil War, and only returned to
convertibility in January 1879.

insulation. Bordo and MacDonald (1997).

similar base money arrangements, yet different economic structures and institutions, add two
more data points to the slim quantitative history of deflation, and further evidence on the
significance of the distinction between good and bad deflation.

           Table 1 and Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the macroeconomic performance of the US and
Canadian economies over the period 1870 - 1914. Table 1 splits the period 1870 to 1896 in 1880,
because of the distinct difference in the U.S. growth experience before and after 1880. The 1870s,
saw rapid growth accompanied by fairly significant deflation. In the remainder of the period to
1896 growth slowed as did deflation - although price levels continued to fall. In the period after
1896, prices rose at roughly 2% and the growth rate of GDP (and per capita GDP) rose above
that of the 1880s-early 90s, although it remained off the blistering pace of the 1870s.

          In Canada, prices fell by about 0.4% p.a. to 1896 and subsequently rose secularly at about
2%. Real GDP grew at 2.4% during the deflationary period and rose by 6.5% from 1896 to 1913.
A considerable part of the economic growth in the latter period was extensive growth coming
from immigration but the change in the growth rate of real per capita GDP between the two
periods was still stark - 1% in the first period, 4.3% in the latter.

          For both historians and macro economists this period is a teaser. For macro economists
the period provides a rare opportunity to study a secular deflation. For historians the causes of
both the underperformance of the economy in the early years and the boom in the second half of
the period are somewhat puzzling. For both groups the fundamental question concerns the
relationship between the real and the nominal performance of the economy. Was there causation
or merely correlation? In this paper we use time-series statistical methods to try to determine -
albeit at a very aggregate level - the answer to this question.

          We proceed by identifying separate ‘supply’ shocks, money supply shocks and demand
shocks using a Blanchard-Quah methodology. We model the economy as a small open economy
on the gold standard and identify the shocks by imposing long run restrictions on the impact of the

shocks on output and prices. We then do a historical decomposition to examine the impact of
each shock on output. The results for the US are clear: the different rates of change in price levels
before and after 1896 are attributed to different monetary shocks, but these shocks explain very
little of output growth or volatility, which is almost entirely a response to ‘supply’ shocks. For
Canada the results are murkier. As in the U.S., the money supply shocks before 1896 are predom-
inantly negative and after that are largely positive. However, they are non-neutral, and relative to
the US, money supply shocks play a larger role in determining output behaviour in Canada. We
discuss possible explanations for this.

       We begin by providing a brief historical context for the analysis, and then discuss the
underlying theoretical model and empirical strategy that we follow. We then discuss the estima-
tion results for the US and Canada. We conclude by integrating the somewhat contrasting results
for the two countries.

Historical context

       The US economy expanded rapidly in the early years after the Civil War, and the 1880s
saw both the development of heavy industry in the East and rapid settlement of the West. It was
the period of massive expansion of a transcontinental railroad network. Yet, this growth was
accompanied by severe cyclical downturns in the post civil war era most of which were associated
with banking panics and financial crises, 1873, 1893 and 1907 being the most severe. The net
effect was that real GNP per capita was only 5% higher in 1896 than in 1880.

       Williamson (1974) provides a detailed analysis of this period. He argues that the
deceleration in economic growth until the mid 1890s, primarily reflected traditional Neoclassical
forces: a high savings rate put the economy on a transition path to a new steady state, and along
the transition path, capital accumulated, the return to capital fell, and the growth rate of income
declined. His is a purely real model, and he concludes (p. 116) that since the quantitative
predictions of his model capture the behaviour of the economy, monetary factors were not




                                                                                                   3
important in the growth slowdown.5 One view of our paper is that it tests this result in an
empirical model with a monetary side.

        Growth accelerated after 1896. There were dramatic technological changes in goods
production and equally so in the organization of firms and the economy. Industrialization and
urbanization both changed the face of the economy. Yet even in these good years there were
major downturns, and real per capita income fell in 5 different years between 1896 and 1914:
1903, 1907-8, and 1913-14.

        In 1870 incomes per capita in Canada were about two thirds those in the United States.
By 1880 the fraction had fallen to one half. But from 1880 to 1914, Canadian economic
performance – at least by the measure of per capita income growth – outshone that of the US,
although the US was still starkly ahead in levels.6 As in the US, there were significant cyclical
fluctuations embedded in the secular trends. In eleven of the 20 years from 1875 to 1895 per
capita real incomes fell, despite the overall increase across the subperiod.

        Canada experienced a short-lived boom after Confederation which ended in 1873. The
stark contrast with US economic performance in the mid-1870s led to a migration of Canadians
into the northern States (Inwood and Irwin, 2000) and the imposition of the National Policy tariff
in an attempt to protect potential infant industries. The impact of that tariff is debated: certainly
per capita incomes rose, but it was not until the mid-1890s that the economy flourished. Data on
wages and unemployment are notoriously sparse, what little we have suggests that unemployment
rose in the mid-1870s and, after relatively better performance in the end of that decade, was again
high in the late 1880s. Nominal wages fell from 1888 to 1890 and remained flat in the 1890s.7

         From 1896 to 1913, a period known to Canadians as the Wheat Boom, there was massive
migration into Canada (primarily from Europe), rapid settlement of the Canadian West, and
especially after 1907, very large foreign capital inflows. The relationship between the acceleration

  He does not explain the pick up in growth after 1896, and suggests that it remains a puzzle.

  In 1880 Canada and the US had the same gold parity and therefore an exchange rate of 1 between the two
currencies. In 1870 the US dollar was valued at approximately C$ 0.75 as a result of the suspension of gold
convertibility during and after the Civil War.

of intensive growth (rising per capita incomes) and that of extensive growth (increasing
population) has been hotly debated amongst Canadian economic historians. In particular, research
has focused on whether or not there was a mechanism that explains how the increasing population
(assumed to be driven by the new availability of land) can explain the rising per capita income,
given that the rise in the value of farms seems insufficient to explain the gains.8

        Both Canada and the US (after the resumption of convertibility in 1879) were on the gold
standard and so were similarly affected by the world monetary market. In the 1870s Germany and
France (effectively) joined the gold standard and by 1879 the US had resumed convertibility of the
Greenback. Gold stocks, however, were largely stagnant in the face of this increase in demand for
gold, requiring that prices fall. Figure 3 shows that annual gold production averaged about 6
million ounces from 1870-1893. Gold discoveries in South Africa, and to a lesser extent in
Australia and the Klondike, led to dramatically higher levels of gold production after 1893.

        Figure 2a shows the behaviour of price indices for US and Canada. Deflation averaged
only 1.2% p.a. in the US and less than 1% in Canada between 1870 and 1896, but the cumulative
effect over more than two decades was a fall in the price level fell of 37% in the US and 21% in
Canada. This situation was reversed after 1896 when gold discoveries increased the global stock
of gold and therefore national money stocks, and prices rose worldwide. Secular deflation was
replaced by secular inflation in both Canada and the US.

        While both Canada and the US had monetary systems based on gold, the ‘inside’ money
component of the money supply was produced under very different arrangements in the two
countries. In Canada, a branch banking system was permitted to issue bank notes secured by the
general assets of the bank, subject only to the limit that the quantity of notes not exceed the paid-
in capital. As a matter of practice the banks often held significant money at call in New York,
which they looked on as ‘secondary reserves’. In the US, the National banking system established
in 1864 mandated that bank notes be (111%) secured by Federal government bonds and created a
tiering of reserves.9 Thus the US banking system had difficulty dealing with the seasonal

  Country banks had to hold 15% of the value of their deposits on reserve (of which 60% could be a deposit at a
reserve city bank); reserve city banks had to hold 25% reserves (of which 50% could be a deposit at a central

reserve for both countries.

Theoretical perspective

        The fundamental question we are trying to resolve is the role of aggregate demand relative
to aggregate supply shocks in output behaviour over the period. In the context of a simple supply-
demand model, if the short run aggregate supply curve is vertical, then demand shocks will have
no impact even in the short run, and the pattern of output growth would have been entirely driven
by supply shocks. If the aggregate supply curve is upward sloping (for some time horizon)
demand shocks would have an impact on output, and the deflation/stagnation followed by infla-
tion/growth, may reflect demand shocks.

        Earlier studies have applied a bivariate Blanchard-Quah methodology to gold standard
economies, typically in contrasting gold standard and Bretton Woods regimes (for example,
Bordo (1993), Keating and Nye (1998) and Bayoumi and Eichengreen (1995)). These studies
used data on prices and output and identified a ‘supply’ shock as the innovation that has a perma-
nent impact on output. An aggregate supply/aggregate demand model would predict that a posi-
tive supply shock would lower prices, however, in all three studies the estimated ‘supply’ shocks
had a permanent positive effect on prices, the opposite of the theoretically predicted effect.10 One
explanation proposed for this - but not explicitly tested - is that the dominant supply shock is a
terms of trade effect, which raises both output and prices. Figure 2b graphs the price level and the
terms of trade for Canada and provides casual evidence that the price level and terms of trade are
uncorrelated.11 Furthermore, the terms of trade are improving during the 1871-1896 period when
prices and output in Canada are falling and then stagnate while prices and output rise rapidly at
the beginning of the twentieth century. When we included a terms of trade variable in the
estimation of the traditional model it was insignificant and did not eliminate the perverse price
effect of the estimated ‘supply’ shock. The ‘supply’ shock estimated in the bivariate model must

   The positive effect is also found on impact.

confound a demand shock that has permanent positive effects on prices and output with a true
‘supply’ shock.12

          We propose an alternative identification scheme that is consistent with a standard mone-
tary model for a small open economy on the gold standard.13 We model the behaviour of output,
prices and the money stock and identify three stochastic disturbances by assuming that the
demand disturbance has no long run impact on either prices or output and the domestic supply
shock has no long run impact on the price level. Implicitly, we are assuming that in the long run
the domestic price level was tied down by the world price level (through monetary flows). Let Y
represent real GDP, P the price level and M the money stock, and let ε s be the ‘supply’ shock,

ε ms   the money supply shock, and          εd   a demand (that is, demand other than money supply) shock.

Then, if the matrix A(1) represents the long run multiplier matrix where each element aij(1)
captures the long run effect of shock j on variable i, we can write,


           ∆P   a11 (1)        0        0  ε ms 
           ∆Y  =  a (1) a (1)           0   ε s 
                  21          22

           ∆M   a 31 (1) a 32 (1) a 33 (1)  ε d 


         The identification of the demand shock is uncontroversial, but the critical assumption here
is that ‘supply’ shocks do not affect the price level in the long run. Here we rely on the small
open economy assumption under which the domestic economy takes the price level as exogenous.
We assume that the supply shock captures supply shocks that were specific to the domestic
economy – and did not have an effect on the world price level in the long run. (Importantly we
find the restriction is not a binding one for the US economy - a result consistent with Bayoumi
and Eichengreen who find a horizontal aggregate demand curve.) Since the major determinant of
world prices over our period was the changing world production of gold, we refer to the shock



12
  See Calomiris and Hanes (1994) for an extended discussion of the sources of persistence from demand shocks.
13
  Our identification strategy is similar to that of Dupasquier, Lalonde and St.-Amant (1997). They use a tri-variate
Blanchard and Quah decomposition with the same ordering to identify monetary, supply and non-monetary
demand shocks for the post-Bretton Woods period, but use interest rates rather than the money stock (and assume
that the price level is I(2)).


                                                                                                                   7
that has a long run impact on prices as the money supply shock.14 Using this identification of
supply and money supply shocks we can measure separately the effect of each on output.

           The third shock captures impulses that have no permanent effect on prices or output. In
the context of a small open economy on the gold standard these are essentially IS demand shocks,
or money demand shocks, and they cannot be disentangled in this empirical specification. If IS
shocks dominate, the impact effect of the shock on all three variables will be positive, and it will
have no long run effect on the money stock. If money demand shocks dominate then prices and
output will fall on impact and there will be a permanent increase in the money stock.

            The restrictions imply that A(1) is lower triangular, and by imposing the restrictions and
the assumption that the three shocks are orthogonal, we can estimate the parameters of A(L) - the
impulse response functions - and identify the structural innovations.15 The key to the validity of
this methodology is that the identifying restrictions indeed identify objects consistent with the
theoretical model. The usual way to test this is to look at the overidentifying restrictions. That is,
theory has implications for the long-run and short-run impacts of each shock on each variable.
Our basic framework is the Cambridge money demand equation with stochastic money demand
shocks, applied to a small open economy on a gold standard. A positive money supply shock is
defined as one that raises the money stock in the long run, and it is predicted to increase each of
the three variables on impact. If money were neutral, the money shock would cause equal
(proportionate) increases in the money stock and prices in the long run with no effect on output.
A positive supply shock is one that raises output in the long run, and would lead to an
endogenous, long run increase in the money stock. The model predicts that in the short run prices
would fall and the money stock would rise. Finally, the demand shock is defined as one that
causes an increase in the money stock, and its short run impact is indeterminate as discussed
above.

           There are 18 combined impact and long run responses to the shocks. Table 2 summarizes
the predicted effects and indicates whether the restriction was imposed, used as a normalization or
can be used as an overidentifying restriction. If the estimated impulse response functions are

14
     The money supply shock could equally be viewed as a world price level shock.



                                                                                                         8
consistent with these over identifying restrictions then we can be relatively confident that the
estimated shocks are consistent with the innovations in the model.


        Having estimated the matrices A(L) and the innovations ε t we can examine the behaviour

of each of the shocks (the variance of each shock is normalized to 1). The impact of the various
shocks can be measured by a forecast error variable decomposition, which measures the contribu-
tion of each type of shock to forecast errors at various horizons, and most importantly for our
purposes we can measure the effect at each point of historical time of each kind of shock. For
example, we can decompose the growth rate of output in 1880 say into (1) the effect of shocks
that occurred before 1873 - the start of the sample - and are having continued effects, and (2) the
effect of each of the shocks since 1873. The effects of supply shocks, for example, are computed
by taking the supply shock for each period from 1873 to 1880 and multiplying it by the impulse
response parameter for the number of periods between the occurrence of the shock and 1880.


        We use this method of historical decompositions to identify the role of ‘supply’ shocks,
money supply shocks and money demand shocks on the levels of output, prices and money in the
US and Canada from 1873 and 1914.

         There are of course, other approaches that could and have been taken to determine the
role of monetary factors in this period. An approach that is similar would involve estimating a
VAR that incorporated a co-integrated money demand function. The advantage of this approach
is that by imposing the structure of a money demand function, one can get tighter parameter esti-
mates. However, there are major disadvantages. Essentially, it requires the existence of a stable
money demand function, for which the evidence is weak at best.16 For Canada this may be
because of the absence of interest rate data, or because of more fundamental money demand
instability.




15
  See Clarida and Gali (1995). The method is briefly described in the Appendix.
16
  Johansen and Juselius estimation methods reject a co-integration relationship between money, prices and income
for Canada, although Engle and Granger single equation methods do not. The former is however the more
powerful technique, and the one that is appropriate for the multivariate context - i.e. one where money, prices and
output may all respond to deviations from the long run relationship.

Empirical Analysis - United States

        Figure 4 presents the impulse responses for the US.17 The graphs show the cumulative
effect, at every point of time, on each variable, of an isolated shock at time ‘0’. Thus the upper
graphs shows that an average positive money supply shock caused prices to rise on impact, to rise
somewhat further in the next year or two and to stay at that higher level. The lowest graph shows
that the money stock itself behaved very similarly, while the middle graph shows that the money
supply shock caused output to rise on impact, but that after the first 2 years output was back at its
initial level. These results show money to be non-neutral in the short run, and (roughly) neutral in
the long run. Importantly, this long run neutrality is not imposed.18

        The supply shock causes a positive and permanent increase in the level of output, and after
the first year, to the quantity of money. That is, the quantity of money responds endogenously to
the increases in output, with an elasticity of approximately one half. The supply shock causes a fall
in the price level - although probably insignificantly – and after the first period, the price level
returns to its previous level.

        The demand shock leads to a permanent increase in the money stock and a (very)
temporary decrease in prices. These results are consistent with the interpretation of the demand
shock as a money demand innovation, but the demand shock also causes an increase in output
which is not consistent with such an interpretation. As noted above, the model does not have
sufficient restrictions to enable us to identify the demand shock, other than as a compound of the
temporary disturbances to output.

        While impulse response functions indicate the impact of an isolated shock over time on
each variable, since their variance is normalized to unity, they do not measure the relative impor-
tance of the shocks. A forecast error variance decomposition (FEVD) combines the information in
the variances of the shocks and the impulse responses, and so describes their relative contribu-

17
   The money supply data and output data are found to be unambigously I(1) in pre-testing. The characteristics of
the price level are more ambiguous with the order of integration (0 vs. 1) depending on the lag length selection
criterion, and unit root test used. The unrestricted VAR is estimated with 2 lags.
18
   The imposed restrictions are that the supply shock does not affect prices in the long run, and that the demand
shock only affects the stock of money in the long run.


                                                                                                                10
tions. The FEVD are presented in Table 3, and can be interpreted as follows: Take the 2 year
ahead decomposition of the forecast error for output. If one were trying to forecast output 2 years
ahead, one would on average make an error that depends on the size of the three (definitionally
unobservable) shocks in each future year, their usual impact on the variable and their persistence.
In an extreme case supply shocks might have a permanent impact while money supply shocks
have only a one year influence. Thus the two year ahead forecast would reflect two years worth of
supply shocks but only one year of money supply shocks.

         Largely by assumption, at the five year horizon forecast errors for the price level
primarily arise from money supply shocks. However, output is mostly driven by ‘supply’ shocks.
The money stock is driven by shocks to both demand and the money supply. The estimated
structural innovations themselves are illustrated in Figure 5. Again, since they are normalized to
have a variance of unity, their absolute size has no interpretation. There is a run of negative
money supply shocks in the early 1890s followed by a run of positive shocks after 1896. In the
last decade of the sample there was a string of negative demand shocks.

       The historical decompositions are illustrated in Figures 6-8. We are particularly interested
in output, shown in the three panels of Figure 7. In each of the three panels, two curves are
reproduced – the actual growth rate of income, and the base case, which comprises trend growth
plus the lingering effects of shocks that occur before the start date. The third curve shows the sum
of the base case plus the effect of one particular shock. For example, the top graph in Figure 7 the
3rd curve shows how (according to the model) output growth would have evolved if there had
been no supply or demand shock, isolating the impact of the money supply shock on output
growth. The fact that this curve is, particularly after 1890, not very different from the base case,
shows that the money supply shock did not drive output growth. Similarly, the fact that in the
middle panel the 3rd line is very close to the ‘actual’ line implies that the supply shock explains
most of output growth. (Non-monetary) demand shocks, in the lowest panel, were nontrivial, but
much less important than the supply shocks.

       The historical decomposition of the price level (Figure 6) tells a parallel story. The price
level was very largely determined by the money supply shocks, while supply shocks (and again to



                                                                                                  11
a lesser extent non-monetary demand shocks) were not important drivers of prices. The money
stock reflected both money supply and money demand shocks, but not supply shocks. This latter
effect is a reflection of the low income elasticity of money demand seen in the impulse responses
(compare the impact of supply shocks on output and the money stock in the bottom 2 panels of
Figure 4).

         The interpretation of behaviour in the US over the period is fairly straightforward: positive
(negative) money supply shocks explain the behaviour of the price level, and did have temporary
positive (negative) effects on output. However, apart from the volatility between 1877 and 1887,
money supply shocks had only a small impact on output, and do not explain the trends in output
growth.

Empirical Analysis - Canada

         Figure 9 shows the estimated impulse response functions for Canada.19 As in the US case,
the money supply shock is estimated to cause an increase in prices and the level of the money
stock but, unlike in the US, money is not neutral in the long run. We find a persistent positive
effect on output from a positive money supply shock. We return to this surprising result below.20
The supply shock has the expected positive effect on the level of output and the stock of money,
and again the elasticity of money demand is approximately one half. The price level falls on impact
of the supply shock, and quickly returns to its initial level. The demand shock has its major
impact on the money stock, with a small temporary positive impact on output and prices.

         The forecast error variance decomposition results (Table 4) show that supply shocks
explain most of the forecast error variance for output. The forecast error variance of prices is
explained by money supply shocks at all horizons, while both money supply and demand shocks
have a significant impact the money. Figure 10 shows the estimated structural innovations over
time. As in the US, money supply shocks were predominantly negative in the pre 1896 period, and
then positive in the post 1896 period. Perhaps surprisingly, supply shocks were positive from
19
   As for the US, the money stock and output series were found to be I(1) and the price data either I(1) or I(0)
depending on the test. We estimate the model in first differences to be sure the data are stationary. For Canada lag
length tests led us to use only first order terms in the unrestricted VAR.
20
   The result is robust to changes in specification such as lag length and use of alternative monetary aggregates.


                                                                                                                  12
1876 to 1883 with the exception of 1880. The decade from 1884 to 1895 however saw a run on
negative supply shocks.

         The historical decompositions for Canada are in Figures 11-13. Again for each variable,
we present three panels. In each panel the behaviour of the growth rate of the variable over time
and the ‘base case’ (trend growth) are depicted as well as a line illustrating the base case plus the
effect (contemporaneous plus lagged) of one of the shocks. Again beginning with the
decomposition of output in Figure 12, the similarity between the dashed line and the actual
behaviour in the middle panel indicates that the behaviour of output was driven very much by the
supply shocks. The upper and lower panels show that both money supply shocks and demand
shocks affected output (their dashed lines deviate from the almost horizontal base case), but do
not play as major a role as the supply shocks. In Figure 11, we see that the money supply shocks
do explain price behaviour.21 Finally, Figure 13 suggests that money supply shocks and demand
shocks were the major forces driving the evolution of the Canadian money stock. The supply
shock did cause some of the variation in the growth rate of the money stock, as that stock
responded to changes in money demand coming from changing income, but the other factors were
larger influences.

         Overall, in Canada as in the US, we find that the economy evolved in a relatively classical
way. Exogenous changes in the money stock drove the behaviour of the price level, and ‘supply’
shocks drove the behaviour of output.


Discussion of results and conclusion

         In the 1870s the gold standard became virtually universal, raising monetary gold demand
with no significant increases in supply. Unsurprisingly the world price level fell. Gold discoveries
in the 1890s caused the world gold stock to rise, and so did prices. In the US, and more so in
Canada, the deflation was contemporaneous with slow economic growth, and the inflation with a
booming economy. Was there a direct connection? Did monetary forces generate the bust and
boom? We find that the connection was more coincidence than causation. The money supply
21
  In Figure 11 the base case and actual are very similar since the trend rate of inflation over the entire period was
virtually zero.


                                                                                                                    13
shocks were large and explain most of the variation in the price level. Yet, in both the United
States and Canada, they do not explain the behaviour of output. That behaviour was driven
primarily by supply shocks.

       An open question that our analysis has raised is the apparent non-neutrality of the money
supply shocks in Canada, and why the Canadian responses are so different from those in the US.
One possible answer would be that there were greater nominal rigidities in Canada, although it is
difficulty to ascertain what those would have been. An alternative resolution relates to the
differences between the banking systems in the two countries, and their possible consequences for
the transmission of monetary shocks to the real economy. For example, the Canadian banking
system had lower reserve ratios than that of the US, and proportionately more loans in their
portfolios, implying that the credit channel may have been more significant leading to greater
persistence of monetary shocks in Canada. This is obviously an area for future work, and in
particular, we plan to expand the data set by including other gold standard countries, and use a
panel approach that will give us more power to identify global monetary and technology shocks.

       Finally, the fact that growth was lower in both countries during the deflation era, 1870-96,
than during the subsequent period of inflation may be due to a different real environment but it
could also be due to another set of issues which we do not explore in this paper, namely the
relationship of deflation/inflation to growth via channels such as expectations formation and
incomplete contracts, as in for example, Irving Fisher’s debt deflation story. Again this is an area
for future research. The key conclusion of our analysis is clear however. The simple demarcation
of good vs bad deflation, where either prices fall because of a positive supply shock, or prices fall
because of a negative demand (money) shock does not capture the complexity of the historical
experience of the pre-1896 period. Indeed, we find that prices fell as a result of a combination of
negative money supply shocks and positive supply shocks.

Define a structural model:
                           ∆X    t   = A ( L )ε     t

                                     = A0ε     t   + A1ε   t −1   + A 2ε   t−2   + ...
The objective is to find the values of the Ai and ε t .

We begin by estimating a reduced form model
              B ( L ) ∆ X t = et
And invert the model to get its moving average representation
  ∆X t = B( L) −1 et
        = C ( L)et = et + C1et −1 + C 2 et − 2 + ....

where by definition C0=1
Let E(etet') = Σ be the estimated reduced form variance covariance matrix, and note that
e t = A0 ε t and C1 e t − 1 = A1ε t −1 which together imply A1 = C1A0 and more generally Ai=CiA0.

Thus knowledge of A0 combined with the estimated Ci and et will identify all Ai and ε t .


Assume that the structural innovations are orthogonal to each other and normalize them to have
unit variance. Then, E (ε t ε t ' ) = I . But since E(etet') = Σ , E ( A0ε t ε t ' Ao ' ) = Σ and therefore

A0A0'= Σ . Since there are only 6 independent variables in Σ , and nine elements in A0, this
relationship does not uniquely identify the elements of A0. To do so we impose the restriction that
A(1), the matrix of long run multipliers is lower triangular, as described in the text.


Define C(1) = C0 + C1 + C2 + …, where C0 = I, and rewrite this as
C (1) = A0 A0−1 + A1 A0−1 + A2 A0−1 +
     = A(1) A0−1
Form C(1) Ó C(1)' and find the Choleski decomposition of this which yields the unique lower
triangular matrix H such that C(1`) Σ C(1) ' = HH'. Note that C(1) Σ C(1) ' =A(1)A(1)', so that
H=A(1). Now we can find A0 from C (1) = A(1) A0−1 .
