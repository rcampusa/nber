             DEVELOPING COUNTRY BORROWING AND DOMESTIC WEALTH


                                  ABSTRA




    We show that across developing countries, external debt to private

creditors rises more than proportionately with income. We then develop a

simple theoretical model consistent with this phenomenon and also consistent

with the well-documented relationship between capital market development and

growth. Our framework stresses information asymmetries at the level of

individual borrowers as the source of frictions in world capital markets.

Because of moral hazard problems, marginal products of capital and

borrowing—lending spreads are higher in poorer countries. In a two—country

version of the model, we demonstrate the possibility of a siphoning effect

which exacerbates the costs of transfers. Also because of the siphoning

effect, increased wealth in the rich country can stunt investment in the poor

country.

I. Introduction
       The standard neoclassical model of trade and growth predicts that
rich—country savers will lend to investors in high—marginal—product—of—capital
poor countries. After the deregulation of international capital markets             in

the    19608, the 1970s indeed witnessed a broad expansion of lending from
industrialized countries to the developing world. However, for certain
features    of the data, the standard model does not seem to provide the simplest

explanation. For example, during the 1970s middle income' developing

countries were able to borrow more per          capita   than poorer countries. Using

data from 1980 for a cross-section of seventy countries, we show that for each

percentage point increase in per capita income, per capita external debt to

private creditors tends to rise significantly            more than   one percent.

Moreover,    this relation between   external debt and national income tends to

hold   across countries   within the same   region (Africa, Asia, and Latin
America).

       Our ala is to provide a natural explanation of this evidence which is

also consistent with the well—documented positive relationship between capital

market development and growth (Goldsmith (1969) and Mckinnon (1973)1. The

framework here stresses asymmetric information at the level of individual

borrowers as a source of (endogenously—derived) frictions in world capital

markets.1 A positive relation between external borrowing and the state of

development can emerge because in wealthier countries firms are better

capitalized. Informational problems consequently have less impact, resulting




1Our analysis draws on recent developments in the closed—economy literature on
interactions between the real and financial sectors; see Gertler (1988) for a
survey. To abstract from sovereign risk, we assume that there is a
supranational legal authority, capable of enforcing contracts across borders.
Hence our analysis is really as much a model of capital flows between
Manhattan and the Bronx as between Japan and India.

in a lower cost difference between internal (to a firm) finance and external

finance.

     Thus even in a world of perfectly integrated capital markets, In which

riskiess rates are equalized, marginal products of capital can differ across

nations. An Important empirical Implication Is that the spread between

borrowing and lending rates should be larger in poorer countries, which most

development economists take as a stylized fact.

     Section II of the paper presents some simple correlations between

national income and borrowing. A small-country model Is presented in section

ru and a two—country general equilibrium version is given in section IV.      The


two—country model   yIelds   an interesting new perspective on the classic

transfer problem: The cost to a country of repaying a debt may exceed the face

value of the debt, since the decline in wealth exacerbates the

information—induced loan market inefficiencies. Also, a rise In capital

market efficiency In the rich country can lead to a 'siphoning' of Investment

funds from the poor country. In the conclusions, we discuss some possible

alternative explanations for the positive relation between capital Inflows and

domestic wealth.




II. External Debt and GNP for Developing Countries

     In Table 1, we present 1980 data on income and external borrowing for

seventy developing countries, listed In order of GNP per capita The second

column lists external debts owed to private lenders; the third column also

includes debts owed to other governments and to multilateral credit agencies

(e.g., the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank). A casual

comparison of column one with either column two or three indicates a strong

correlation between GNP and external borrowing. Table 2 contains two sets of

regressions, both using the log of GNP per capita as the explanatory variable.

In the first, the dependent variable is the log of total external debt per

capita. Over the entire sample 2, the coefficient on GNP was 1.05, with a

standard error of .08. Separate regressions for Asia, Africa, and

Latin America yield similar results.

     One problem with using total external debt to measure country borrowing

is that the component consisting of official (public) debt is probably best

viewed as foreign aid. Whereas most official debt is senior in principle, it

is junior to private debt in practice. Though technically, developing-country

debtors have promptly repaid official debt, in most cases official creditors

have made new loans in excess of any principal and Interest repayments due.

[See Bulow and Rogoff (1988)].

     In the second set of regressions reported in Table 2, the dependent

variable Includes only external debt owed to private creditors. Note that the

coefficients are always larger than one and the difference Is significant over

the full sample.3 Again, this simple relation explains a very large share of

the variation In external borrowing across countries, and the coefficients are

relatively stable across regimes.4




2Nepal, which had zero private debt per capita, had to be excluded when the
regressions were run in logs. Because It is poor, Nepal's exclusion biases
the estimated coefficients downwards.

3The results are quite robust to excluding trade credits and/or short term
debt from the regressions. However, when "Micronesian" countries with
populations under one million are included, the coefficients become smaller
and the standard errors larger.

4We also ran a regression that included the growth rate of per capita GNF from
1980 to 1986 as a proxy for expected productivity change. The variable,
however, was unimportant. One can also Interpret the regional regressions as
a crude attempt to control for differences in expected productivity across
countries — the idea being that, while technology may differ between Brazil
and Nigeria, it is less likely to significantly differ between Brazil and
Argentina. Obviously, it would be desirable to explore the dynamics of the

    We chose the year 1980 because after the debt crisis began In 1982, the

correspondence between book   value   and the market value of loans becomes much

weaker.5 There did not exist a secondary market for bank loans as of 1980,

but most of the private loans were indexed to short—term interest rates. Thus

any capital gains or losses would mainly have to involve sovereign risk. The

fact that most debtor nations were still receiving new funds in 1980 suggests

that expectations of default were still quite low. Almost all sovereign debt

to private creditors is of equal priority (for a rationale see Bulow and

Rogoff (1988)), so countries can generally only get new loans only if their

old loans are valued near par.6



III. A Siill-Country Model with Agency Coats of Investment

     Our goal throughout is to provide the simplest possible model capable of

illustrating our main points. Before turning to the two-country case, we

first develop and analyze a small country framework. We consider an open

economy inhabited by a large number of identical individuals; the economy is

small in the sense that It cannot affect the world Interest rate. There are

two periods and one good. The representative individual Is risk neutral and

cares only about consuming in period two:


                                  U(c)       c,                               (1)




external debt—GNP relation more fully, but unfortunately short—term debt
data for years prior to 1980 is suspect.
5However, the appendix presents similar regressions for the 1986 data, with
similar results.
6Our results do not include direct     investment, since including this would not
be in the spirit of the asymmetric     information model of section III. However,
we note that for within Africa and     Asia, direct investment was small relative
to debt. For South America, it was     somewhat larger, though still small
relative to debt.



                                         4
where c is her second-period consumption.

        Entering period     one,   each person is endowed with W units of the

consumption good.7 There exist two ways to convert this endowment into final

period consumption. The first option is to lend abroad at the (gross) world

riskiess interest rate r; the alternative is to Invest in a risky technology.

In particular, each person in the country has a project. All projects are

identical cx ante, and yield cx post returns as follows: k units invested in

period one yield 9 units of second-period output with probability i(k), and

zero units with probability I —         s(k).       That is,



                               (   9 with probability n(k)

                                                          1—ir(k)


where y is second—period output. The function i(')              is   increasing, strictly

concave and twice continuously differentiable, with w(O)                0, it(m)   = 1, and
r/9 <   r'(O)   <        Thus, investment raises the probability that the

individual's project will yield a high level of output, and the marginal

expected return to investment is diminishing.9 We assume that output

realizations are independent across the projects of different individuals.

        If an individual wants to invest more than her endowment in her project,




   can include any future income which is collateralizable. The distinction
between current and future endowment is not important here. It is important in
the two—country case since the world equilibrium will depend on the total
supply of current endowment; see below.

8(o) > ne           is needed to guarantee that it is optimal to invest under perfect
information.  It is not essential that '(0) be finite, but introducing this
restriction makes the exposition a bit simpler.

91t is easy to generalize the results to a technology with a large set of
possible output realizations. We choose the two—point distribution for ease
of exposition.

then she must raise funds from the world capital market; that is,



                                           W+bmk                                      (3)



where b    is   the amount   she   borrows. In return for this amount, she issues a

state—contingent security which pays 2g            in   the event the project yields the

good outcome, and    in the event of the bad outcome. The security must offer
                                             10
lenders the market rate of return r, so that


                                       +   [1 — ,(k)lZb     rb                        (4)



The left—hand side of (4) is the expected payment to lenders.

     The individual's expected second period consumption is given by

                 E{c} =   t(k)fe   —       — (1 — iz(k)lZb + rfW + b —   kI            (5)


where the last term is the individual's return from risk—free investments

abroad, and the first two terms represent the expected net return on her

project.

     The information structure is as follows: Lenders may observe a borrower's

initial wealth and the total amount she borrows. What the borrower does with

the funds, however, is her private knowledge. In particular, she may secretly

lend abroad rather than invest in her project. Whereas investment is

unobservable, lenders can freely observe realized output. The production

function n() is common knowledge.

     If there were no information asymmetries, the individual would invest to

the point where the expected marginal project return equals the world interest

rate. Let k denote this first—best level of investment; thus




1°It is not necessary to assume that lenders are risk neutral, but only that
idiosyncratic project risk be diversifiable in world capital markets.




                                               6
                                                      r                                       (6)



    Under asymmetric information, however, it is not generally possible to

implement the first best allocation because the borrower's choice of

investment k   is   not verifiable.   Contracts can             be conditioned only   on

realized output y, and not on k. Given any output—contingent payoffs (z,                      z
specified by the contract, the borrower will pick k to maximize her expected

consumption, given by (5). Thus she will equate her expected marginal gain

from investing with her opportunity cost of (secretly) holding assets abroad12


                                      —           —
                                                      zbn   =   r                             (7)



So long as Z9 differs from Zb, k will differ from its first—best optimum

value k", given by (6).      The problem is that the borrower's marginal benefit

from investing depends not only on the marginal gain in expected output, but

on the change in her expected obligation to lenders, as well. We will

subsequently refer to (7) as the "incentive constraint."

     If the borrower could promise lenders a fixed payment                        =   r(k"   - W)


then (by (7)] she would invest the first best amount k. This is not

feasible, however, since the project yields nothing in the bad state. Since

the borrower's consumption must be non—negative, an important constraint on

the form of the contract is
                                          b
                                      2 O                                                     (8)




The incentive problem emerging here is classified as moral hazard because the
informational asymmetry arises after contracting. See Dixit (1987) for an
application to international trade.
12The analysis would be qualitatively similar if the borrower had the option of
secretly consuming in period one instead of secretly lending abroad.




                                              7
      For the case where V <         k   the optimal incentive compatible contract Is

found by choosing           Zb. b, and k to maximize (5) subject to (3)          (4) (7)

and   (8).   The solution is as follows13: The contract pays lenders zero in the

bad state, so that (8) is binding.            (More generally, the contract always pays

lenders the maximum feasible amount in the bad state.) This serves to

minimize the spread between Z5 and Zb, thereby minimizing the difference

between the borrower's decision rule for k (eq. (7)1 and the socially

efficient rule (eq. (6)1.14 Similarly, equation (3) is binding; 4 +               b     k.


Thus, in     equilibrium,   the borrower does not secretly lend abroad. Borrowing

more than is essential to finance k would raise the gap between                  and   2b•


      Since (3) and (5) hold with equality for the information—constrained
case, one can use these equations to eliminate b and 2b             from (4) and (7). The

result is the following two equations, which determine k and

Equation     (9) is the incentive constraint, and is drawn as the curve IC In

Figure 1.      It is downward sloping. A rise in Z5 lowers the borrower's

expected marginal gain from investing and therefore must be offset by a

decline in k. The curve Intersects the vertical axis at a value of Z9 which

lies between zero and e (recall that ne <              r'(0)   <   m).   It   intersects the

horizontal axis at k since eq. (9) resembles eq. (6) when Z9 equals zero.

Equation (10) is the constraint that lenders must receive the market rate of

best   value k .    The result that k <      k       follows immediately from a comparison

of (6) and (9), as well as from inspection of Figure 1.                        If k Is below k,

then cx post per capita output, ex(k), must lie below its first best value,

               An implication is that both per capita investment and per capita

output will depend on per capita wealth. A rise in W shifts the MR curve

downward in Figure 1 and leaves the IC curve unchanged, thereby raising k and

lowering Z5.17 Additional wealth increases the amount of internal funds

available to the borrower; so for a given level of investment,                            declines.

mitigating the Incentive problem. Investment rises, in accordance with

eq.(9). thus raising output as well.18

       Now consider the link between external borrowing and country wealth.




15The slope of the MR curve equals [r/t(k)1[1 — Ø(k)(1 — W/k)]; where 0(k) is
the ratio of the marginal product of capital to the average product, given
by ir'(k)/(ir(k)/k). Since 0 <        0(k)   < 1 and since W <        k   along the MR curve, the
slope must be positive.


16Because the productivity risks are Independent across investment projects,
and because the number of projects Is large, there is no aggregate risk.

External borrowing will rise with W if a dollar increase in wealth induces

more than a dollar increase in investment. This will be the case if

diminishing returns set in slowly, i.e., ir(k) is small relative to ir'(k).

(Inspection of eq. (ii) indicates that the magnitude of                    varies inversely

with the absolute value of i(k)/i' (k). ) Thus, to the extent that per capita

GNP can be considered a proxy for per-capita wealth, the framework is capable

of explaining the positive relation between external borrowing and output for

developing countries, documented in section II. The informational problem is

of course key to the result; when the incentive constraint is not binding,

external borrowing simply declines a dollar for each dollar increase in

wealth; this occurs since investment is no longer influenced by changes in W.

        A corresponding result is that the spread between the marginal product of

capital and the world riskless interest rate will vary across countries, and

will in particular be larger the poorer the country. Note that cross-country

differences in marginal products of capital may arise here even though the

world capital market is perfectly integrated (the riskiess rate is the same
               19
everywhere).

        Finally, consider how changes in the world interest rate influence




19Thus our model is completely consistent with Frankel and MacArthur's (1988)
finding that covered interest differentials are relatively small for many
LDCs.

investment. As r goes up, the IC curve shifts to the left. The borrower's

opportunity cost of Investing rises, so for any given value of Z9, k must

decline. The MR curve moves inward as well. Some combination of a rise in

2g and a fall in k is necessary for lenders to continue to receive a

competitive return. The interest-elasticity of investment in the

information—constrained case may or may not be greater than in the full

information case. It is greater if                   > 0.       This will likely be the case

if the initial amount borrowed, k — W, is large or if the production function

is sufficiently concave so that the decline in k is not enough to offset the
                                  20
higher rate of interest.

       None of the countries listed in Table 1 represents more than a tiny

fraction of the world's GNP. However, taken together, they are economically

larger than Japan. Therefore, for some issues involving multi-lateral

transfers of wealth (e.g., due to a global restructuring of Third World debt).

it is of interest to analyze the general equilibrium implications of these

nations' capital market activities.



IV.   The Two-Country General Equilibrii Case
        Suppose    there    are two countries of equal population size, country R

("rich") and country P ('poor"). In each country, a percent of the

individuals are "entrepreneurs" and 1—u percent are "lenders." All

individuals have the same utility function, given by equatIon (1). That is,




20The adjustment of k in response to a change in r is given by

      = (1   +                          —                   <   0
                 ,r'(k)Z]/((a(k)/z'(k))r s'(k)Z]
where 25(r,k) =       r(k   —   W)/ir(k), so that Z > 0 and         <   0.




                                               ii
they are risk neutral and care only about second period consumption. Entering

the first period, all entrepreneurs in the poor country are endowed                     with
units of the good, and all lenders are endowed with                        units.   Similarly,
entrepreneurs and lenders in the rich country are endowed with                        and

units, respectively. For the time being,                  the   only restriction we need impose

is titat   w'   < WR.

     Each entrepreneur owns and manages a risky investment project. The

project technology is the same across entrepreneurs and across countries, and

is given by equation (2) above. As before, if an entrepreneur wants to Invest

more than her endowment she has to borrow, so that equation (3) still applies.
                                                                                                   21
Lenders do not have projects; their only option is to lend to entrepreneurs.

     The information structure is the same as in the small country case.

Lenders observe a project's realized output, but cannot observe the capital

input. They cannot directly see whether the entrepreneur is secretly lending

to other entrepreneurs.

     If there were no information asymmetries, the following three equations

Is independent of the pattern of endowments.

        Under asymmetric information, the following five equations characterize

the world equilibrium:

Equations (15) and (16) correspond to equation (9)                        for the small country
case,    and equations (17) and (18) correspond to equation (10). Equation (19)

is the condition that the total demand for investment capital must equal the

world supply, and is drawn as the negatively—sloped WV curve in Figure 2.

k < kR,      since WP <   WR.    Because Investment is distorted, world output is

lower than in the perfect information case. The world interest rate must al

be lower; this is easily demonstrated by comparing conditions (16) and (13),

and noting that kR >       kR.    and that    >   0.   Thus lenders must be worse off

under asymmetric information. Equation (20) is drawn as the positively—slop

pp curve in FIgure 2.

       In general, the pattern of world investment depends on the agency costs

of lending In one country relative to the other, which In turn depends on th

net asset positions of entrepreneurs across countries.23 To illustrate this

point, suppose that the wealth of rich country entrepreneurs Improves, but

that both total world endowment and the endowments of poor country

entrepreneurs remain unchanged. Consider, for example, a redistribution of

wealth In the rich country from lenders to entrepreneurs. This corresponds

an upward rotation In the pp curve in Figure 2; the WV curve remains

unchanged. kR rises and k falls. The decline in the agency costs of finan

in the rich country induces a "siphoning" of investment funds from the poor

country.24      The increased demand for funds by rich country entrepreneurs driv

up the world interest rate, drawing capital out of the poor country.

23An important difference between our model and earlier frameworks emphasizin,
capital market frictions (e.g., Persson and Svenson (1987)) is that the
Imperfections and the forms of the financial contracts are derived
endogenously. An important exception Is Greenwood and Williamson
(forthcoming) who develop a monetary model of International business
fluctuations under Incomplete Information. Another related paper is Samolyk
(1988), who studies the transmission of regional disturbances in financial
markets.

capital flight. This loss of rents Is aggravated by the rise in the world

interest rate. Lenders In the poor country benefit from the rise in interest

rates but as long as the poor country Is a net borrower, its national income

must fall.

     A fall in the wealth of poor country entrepreneurs similarly induces

siphoning of capital from the poor to the rich country. The reduced

efficiency of lending in the poor country causes funds to flow out to the

world capital market.    In contrast to the previous case, the world interest

rate declines.    (Inspection of eq. (20) indicates that är/8W1' < 0 since k5

increases while     remains unchanged.] The shift of investment funds from the

high marginal product of capital poor country to the low marginal product of

capital rich country depresses the equilibrium Interest rate.

     Now consider a transfer of wealth from the poor country to the rich.       In

particular, suppose that_t units of wealth are taken from each citizen of the

poor country and are distributed evenly among the citizens of the rich

country. This transfer can also be graphed as an upward rotation of the pp

curve In Figure 2. However, for a given change In       the pp curve shifts by

more than for our earlier example in which the transfer came from rich country

lenders. Both the increase In      and the decline In     Induce kR to rise and

   to fall. The net effect on the world Interest rate is ambiguous; greater

   tends to move the Interest rate up while less W' moves It down, as

discussed earlier. Note that under perfect InformatIon a similar transfer of

wealth would affect neither Investment nor the interest rate (see eqs. (12) -

(14)).
     The wealth transfer naturally imposes a direct cost on the poor country.

But there may be indirect costs as well. Holding constant the world interest

rate, entrepreneurs in the poor country lose additionally because their




                                       15
project rents decline due to the reduction in investment. Thus, to the exter

that the movement in the world interest rate is not large, the indirect

effects always magnify the costs of the transfer. If the change in the

interest rate is large (owing to highly concave production functions) then tt

exact effect on the poor country's national income depends on whether it is

net debtor or creditor in the world capital market. However, if the poor

country is small, the movement in r Is negligible so that the capital market

problems always magnify the costs of wealth transfers.

     This model accordingly produces a transfer" problem in the sense that

the cost to a country of paying a foreign debt may exceed the face value of

the payments. Here the transfer problem relates to intertemporal trade rathe

than contemporaneous trade, as in the classic debate between Keynes and Ohlin

It arises because the distribution of wealth affects the allocation of

investment, due to information asymmetries.

     As another variation on this theme, consider a shock which increases the

initial endowment of all Individuals in the rich country, thus Increasing the

total supply of Investment funds available to the world capital market.

Under perfect Information, capital investment would rise the same In each

country. But under asymmetric Information, there will be a siphoning effect

since the wealth of rich country entrepreneurs rises as well. Thus the

increase In investment will be greater in the rich country, and It is even

conceivable that investment may decline In the poor country.

     Note that In a dynamic context, the relevant measure of a borrower's

wealth, W, includes not only lIquId assets, but any collaterallzable expected

future profits as well.25 Thus good news about future business conditions In




25 See Gertler (1988), who studies a closed economy with repeated production
and asymmetrIc information where entrepreneurs enter long—term financial



                                     16
the rich country can also induce the slphoning effect described above.

      Finally, we consider a shock to world productivity, 8. By inspection of

of equation (20). we see that a world productivity shock has no effect on the

distribution of investment capital, since 8 factors out of both sides. As in

the full Information case, the rise In 8 Increases per capita world output and

the world interest rate r




V.   Conclusions
       Across   developing countries, external debt to private creditors rises

more than proportionately with Income. Our simple model of international

finance under asymmetric Information provides one natural explanation of this

phenomenon. There are, however, other plausible theories. Sovereign risk is

clearly an important feature of developing—country borrowing, and modern

bargaining—theoretic analyses of sovereign lending suggest a strong relation

between Income and external debt. In the standard models, the relationship is
                        26
generally proportional.    It would be Interesting to extend the present model

to include both sovereign risk and asymmetrically—informed borrowers and
         27
lenders.    The Marshall—Romer model of growth under increasing returns to

scale yields a very different rationale for why the Income elasticity of

external borrowing might exceed unity (Romer (1989)]. One testable difference

between the Marshall-Romer model and the one developed here is that our




contracts with lenders.

26See Bulow and Rogoff (1989). or Fernandez and Rosenthal (1988).


27The model of Atkeson (1988) does incorporate both sovereign risk and moral
hazard, though the private information in his model is at the level of the
government and not the individual.




                                         17
framework would predict that marginal products of capital are higher in poor

countries. Our framework yields a similar prediction for borrowing and

lending spreads.

     It Is important to stress that although there are capital market

Imperfections in the model,   government    Intervention cannot be Pareto

Improving. To achieve Pareto ImprovIng Interventions the public agency would

have to be more efficient than private lenders In overcoming the Informational

problems.

     Finally, we note that the present analysis suggests an alternative

explanation for the Feldsteln—Rorioka (1980) puzzle that savings and

Investment tend to be highly correlated across countries.28 In a world of

perfect Information, If a small country's endowment increases without any

corresponding increase in its productive opportunities, It will invest any

increased savings abroad.     In a model where borrowing is subject to

Informational problems, however, a large part of the increase in savings may

be invested domestically.




28Feldstein and Horloka appeal to imperfectly integrated world capital markets
to explain their puzzle. Obstfeld (1986), Stulz (1986) and Tesar (1988) show
how the saving—investment correlation could arise in a frictionless setting if
technology shocks are dominant.

For example, it is straightforward to show that                         a   rise in        may lower the

national income of the poor country, and definitely does so if the poor

country is a net debtor in the world capital market (i.e., if                                      +

(l—))W'i —        k'}    < 0).
