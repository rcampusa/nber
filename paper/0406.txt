                International Adjustment With Wage Rigidity



                                   ABSTRACT



      Two of the puzzling macroeconomic phenomena of the 1970s have been the

persistent stagnation in Europe, and the disagreement between the U.S. and

Europe on the feasibility of recovery by demand expansion. This paper de-

velopes the hypothesis that the source of both the stagnation and the policy

differences is money—wage stickiness in the U.S. and real—wage stickiness

in Europe and Japan. A real wage which is sticky above its equilibrium

level in Europe and Japan would account for stagnation and infeasibility

of recovery by demand expansion. The theoretical models are developed

in both   the one-commodity and   two-commodity-bundle cases. The empirical
results   confirm   that in the U.S. the nominal wage adjusts slowly toward

equilibrium, while in Germany, Italy, Japan, and the U.K. the real wage

adjusts slowly.

              International Adjustment with Wage Rigidity


I. Background and Introduction

     Since 1974 the OECD area has seen several attempts at recovery from the

1974—75 recession, but the result has been stagnation. The recovery of

1975—77 in the United States took it uell ahead of the rest of the OECD

in the business cycle, even though the unemployment rate reached a low

of only 5.7 percent. The U.S. recovery led to a massive increase in its

current account deficit and the sharp depreciation of the dollar in 1978.

The "balance of payments constraint" on uncoordinated recovery reappeared

as an "exchange—rate constraint."

     In November 1978 U.S. policy shifted sharply toward restraint and sup—

port for the dollar; the shift was announced publicly by President Carter.

Demand policy has remained tight ever since, especially with monetary poiicy

tightening in West Germany in 1979. The tightening of U.S. policy simply

recognizes that the U.S. cannot attempt recovery significantly faster than

Europe or Japan. The OECD countries appear to be locked into a system in

which economic growth is significantly limited by the growth rate of the

slowest major participant. The result of the shift in policy is renewed

recession and rising unemployment throughout the OECD area.

     The constraining factor in the stagnation since 1974 seems to be the

difficulty of recovery, or reluctance to stimulate demand, in Europe and

Japan. The question we address is: why is recovery so hard in Europe

and Japan? During 1976—77 the OECD policy debate on recovery was mainly

the U.S. suggesting (more or less politely) that the countries in "strong"

current account positions, Japan and West Germany, take the lead, and those

governments either refusing or reluctantly proposing fairly timid measures.

 Essentially their position was that rapid demand    expansion   would lead only

 to more inflation, with no significant gains in real output.

     One   popular   explanation for the policy difference between the U.S. and,

mainly, West Germany was that their sensitivity to or expectations of infla-

 tion differed. Another could be that the implicit model behind the German

view was a textbook "classical" model with no money illusion and fully flex-

ible wages and prices, while the implicit U.S. model has sticky wages or

money illusion. This view of the German economy did not seem realistic.

     A more satisfactory model of the European side was presented by Herbert

Giersch when he talked in Princeton on March 1, 1978. Our interpretation of

his view was that the German real wage was rigid, at least downward, above

its equilibrium value. This model would give the "classical" results that

demand expansion only raises prices with no effect on output, but not in a

flexible wage—and—price context. As we see in Section II below, an assump-

tion of real—wage rigidity of this sort in Europe and Japan plus nominal

wage stickiness in the U.S. would make sense of the 1976—77 policy debate.

     As an initial check on the empirical plausibility of this model, we

perused the time—series data on real wage rates in major OECD countries. If

differences between real—wage and nominal—wage rigidities were a major fea-

ture of the OECD economies, they should appear in the 1974 recession, with

rigid real wages resisting the downturn more than sticky nominal wages.

This is especially true with the oil price increase.

     The time—series data are sunarized in Table 1. There we see that the

only country with a protracted decline on real wages in the 1973—75 period

was the United States. There the real wage index peaked at 1.042 in 1973:2,

and did not pass that level again until 1975:2. In Germany, real wage growth

continued straight through the recession until 1976. In Italy and Japan

there was a pause in 1974, with growth resuming by the beginning of 1975.

In the U.K. the real wage index continued to grow to mid—1976, with pauses

in 1974:2 and in mid—1975. These data provide some initial support for the

hypothesis, and were the basis for an informal discussion of it at the

International Seminar on Macroeconomics in 1978. This paper reports on our

continuing theoretical and empirical investigation of demand policy in a

series of models with differing types of wage rigidity across countries.
      In Section II of the paper we develop a model of two countries with one

commodity   and purchasing—power—parity (PPP). Here we obtain the clear—cut
Giersch results. Expansion in the country with rigid real wages raises the
world price level, increases output in the country with rigid nominal   wages,

and   also reduces that country's trade deficit.
      The clarity of these results is blurred in Section III, where we study

a model with two commodities and do not assume PPP. This is the same general

framework used by Bruno and Sachs [1979] and Argy and Salop [1978]. The main

differences are that the Section III model is analytic and focuses on effects

of demand policy, while Bruno—Sachs' several—country model is solved by

simulation and focuses on analysis of stagflation. Argy—Salop look only at

supply—side conditions, while we study demand and supply. As we see in

Table 3, the Bruno—SachsandArgy—Saiop results can be viewed as special

cases of ours.

      The reason that the clear—cut Giersch results are lost in the two—

commodity case is that the relevant prices for workers' and producers'

decisions are different [as in Bruno—Sachs and Argy—Salop]. Producers look

at the price of domestic output; workers look at a cPI with imports in it

as well. Thus even if the real wage relative to the PI is rigid, if a

demand expansion at home pulls up the price of domestic output relative

to the CPI, employment and output expands. Only if exchange—rate adjust-

ment were immediate and complete, putting us back in the Section II PPP

world, would the difference not appear. The result is that, in Section

III, we see that the degree of "money illusion," or real wage vs. nominal

wage stickiness, is at least as important as actual wage rigidity for sort-

ing out the effects of demand policy.
                                   —4—


     In Section IV we report some empirical tests of wage rigidity and money

illusion for five major OECD countries (U.S., U.K., Japan, Italy, Germany)

on time—series data since 1961. The sample is split at 1971 to see if pa-

rameters have changed in the l970s. An important thing to note about our

Table 4 regressions is that they report equations for gradual adjustment of

wage levels, with lagged wages and the level of demand as regressors. This

formulation follows from the theory of Sections II and III, where wage

rigidities are stated in terms of the relevant wage leveL Bruno—Sachs

[1979, p. 161 have the same basic theoretical structure but estimate Phillips—

type equations with the wage change depending on the level of demand.

     The empirical results give us a classification as follows. The U.S.

stands out as the only country with short—run stickiness of nominal wage

rates. The U.K., Japan, Germany, and Italy all seem to have gradual adjust-

ment of real wages, consistent with effective indexation. In all five coun-

tries, response of the relevant wage to demand pressure is much less in the

1970s than over the entire period. These results are consistent with the.

Giersch   hypothesis extended to the OECD.

II. Wage Rigidities in the PPP Model

       In this section we develop the simplest macro model with wage rigities

that yields interesting results for the effects of demand policy. The model

has two countries and one commodity (the "schmoo"), and assumes that the

t1aw of one price" holds, so that there is one world price, P, for the one

connnodity.' We hold the exchange rate constant at unity; alternatively we

could assume two different domestic prices for the commodity, P and *,

with   the exchange rate e defined by P = eP*.         We begin with the specification

of aggregate supply conditions, then move on to demand in each country and

determination of the equilibrium price level. Next we study the effects of

demand policy and the consequences of different forms of wage rigidity.


       Labor Market and Aggregate Supply

       On the demand side of the labor market we have a production function

and a marginal productivity condition which yields the labor demand function


(1)       y =   y(N;   K);         >   0;   y <   0;       (production function)

                                   >   0;   y <   0.

(2)       w = W/P =          K).                           (demand wage)


       In an equilibrium model, we would add a labor—supply function w         w5(N),

and solve for equilibrium w and N. Here we assume that alternately either the

nominal wage or the real wage is rigid above its equilibrium value. We assume

that with the relevant wage rigid above its equilibrium level, employment is

determined along the labor demand function. This is the familiar minimum

condition in non—market—clearing models.-' Thus if the wage rigidity is

effective, labor is constrained in the amount     of   hours that employers will

buy. This is consistent with the specification of the demand side in the

next   sub—section.
       In the case of the real wage rigidity we have w =      > equilibrium   w,

and employment is determined along the labor demand function:


(3)       v YN(N; K).

This gives us N as a function of v and the production technoJogy, and through (1)

it fixes y from the supply side. This is similar to the textbook tTclassical"

model (see Branson [1979]) and is illustrated in Figure 1.

       With a nominal wage rigidity we have

trated in Figure 2. The response of employment and aggregate supply to a

change in the price level is obtained from total differentiation of (4)

An increase in the capital stock shifts out the supply curve in Figures 1

and 2. Thus with the rigid nominal wage we can write the aggregate supply

function of FIgure 2(b) as

with a rigid real wage y,           0; with a rigid nominal wage y, > 0.

       In the two—country model we will assume that each country has an aggre-

gate   supply function of the form y = y (P, K). The "home" country will be
identified by unstarred variables; the "foreign"         country by   stars. Thus
the two aggregate supply functions are

(8b)        y     y (P, K).
Remember that there is         only one world price level.

       In   the solution for equilibrium     and comparative statics below we will

assume   y, >    0; y > 0   in general. Then when we analyze the effects     of differ-

ing wage rigidities on the results of demand policy we will assume the "home"

country has a real wage rigidity so that y = 0, and the "foreign" country

has a nominal wage rigidity with y > 0.           The effects of changes in invest-

ment will come in only when we discuss policy to adjust to a real wage

rigidity, so we omit the K argument In y and y until we reach that dis-
cuss ion.

       Demand and Equilibrium P

       With rigid wages above equilibrium in both countries, real absorption

will be a function of income, the price level, and a demand policy variable.

Income appears through a Keynesian effective—demand consumption function.

The price level represents a real balance effect with predetermined outside
                                                  —10—




money.       The demand policy variable can be thought of as the real deficit,

or real goverrunent purchases with given tax revenue. The income—expenditure

equilibrium conditions for the two countries are then


(9a)             y(P) =   a(y(P),   P, g) + x;


(9b)
                  *         **
                 y (P) = a (y (P), P, g ) —
                                              *
                                                    x.

Here net exports (the current account balance of the home country) x is

residually determined by income y less absorption a. With only one good

there are no terms—of—trade effects. This simplification will be re-

moved in Section III below. With two countries, x enters negatively in

(9b). The partial derivatives of a are signed a > 0,                   a < 0,       ag > 0 (=1),

and similarly for a

       The equilibrium world price level P is obtained by equating income

less absorption at home to absorption less income abroad:


(10)             y — a =.(y* —      a*).

Here we sum the excess demand functions in the two countries and find the

price level at which world excess demand is zero.

       The next step is to derive expressions for the effects of changes in
                               *
demand policy g and g on the price level. The effects on outputs y and
 *
y    will follow immediately from the supply functions. The effects on the

current account x can then be solved from (9a) or (9b). Total differenti-

ation of (1Q) and solution for dP yields

positive slopes, both levels of output and employment are increased by a

demand expansion in either country.


       The Role of Wage Rigidities

       We can now use the one—commodity model to study the effects of differing

wage rigidities on response to changes in demand policy. To be specific, let

us assume that in the home country the real. wage is rigid above equilibrium,

                                                                                         W* =   __*
                                                                                    —
while   in tne foreign country the nominal wage is rigid. Thus w = w;                           W


by assumption. What are the consequences for the effects of a demand ex—

pans ion?

       First, with a real wage rigidity at home y,              0 and 4>   in   equation (11)

reduces to —a. When the price level rises, there is an effect on absorp-

tion in the real—wage country, but no effect on output. The reaction of the

world price level with this pattern of wage rigidities is given by

                      1             *
(13)        dP        — a   (dg + dg ).
                 'V
                                      —12--



The source of the demand disturbances still does not matter, but the price

multiplier is increased from equation (11) by elimination of the y output

effect. The expression for dx in equation (12) is also changed by sub-

stitution of —a for 4,.       It is still the case that dx/dg   0 and dx/dg >   0,
but it is more likely that a balanced increase in g and g decreases x be-

cause of the zero supply response in the home country.

     To swnmarize, an increase in g in the real—wage country (a) increases

P, and by more than in    a   world with no real—wage rigidity, (b) increases

output only in the other country, and (c) reduces the trade surplus In the

real—wage country. Thus if Germany were the real—wage country and the U.S.

were the nominal wage country, a fiscal expansion in Germany would be in-

flationary and reduce the German trade balance, but all the output and

employment effects would appear in the U.S.

     This model can be generalized easily to a world of several countries,

some with real wage rigidities, some with nominal wage rigidities. A de-

mand expansion originating anywhere in the system will raise the price for

all, but increase output and employment only where nominal prices are

rigid. The trade surplus (deficit) will be reduced (increased) in the area

where the demand expansion originated, and a balanced expansion of demand

will reduce the trade surplus of the real—wage countries.


     Effect of Capital Stock Expansion

     Expansion of the capital stock in one country will increase supply in

that country, drive down the world price level, and in general reduce out-

put in the other country. We can see this by putting (8a) and (8b) for y
     *
and y into the equilibrium conditions (9a) and (9b), inserting these Into

(10) for the world price level, and totally differentiating with respect to

P and K. The result is
                                       —13—



                      — YK(l_aY) <
                 dK
                           +   *
                                 4'




If    the home (unstarred) country increases its capital stock, its output rises

unambiguously. The    expression      for dy is

                                y (1—a )
                 d"      (1—


Since Y(l—a) < 4', dy/dK    >    0.


       If the real wage in the home country is rigid above equilibrium, so that

       0, capital stock expansion can increase output to the point where the
y1,

wage rigidity is no longer binding on the side of the demand for labor. Thus

one policy to escape the wage rigidity is incentives for investment. This

was Giersch's conclusion for West Germany. However, by reducing the world

price level P, this policy would tend to reduce output abroad unless y, = 0.

III. Adjustment with Diffrent±ated Product Bundles

       The clear—cut results of Section II were derived in a framework with

only one good and one world price level. The sharpness of these results

is reduced when we go to a world of differentiated product bundles with

different prices. In reality the industrial countries trade products

that can be roughly aggregated into bundles of exportables and import—

ables, with the possibility of terms—of—trade changes between them. To

capture the effects of movements in the terms of trade, we turn to a

model in which the two countries produce different goods. These can be

thought of as different fixed—weight product bundles with their associated

price indexes. Introduction of two goods, and two prices, changes funda-

mentally the characterization of both the supply and demand sides of the

model, and makes the signs of the effects of expansionary policy in either

country on both outputs depend on particular parameter values.


       The Demand Side with Two Commodities

       In this section we develop a fairly standard two—country Keynesian

model with two goods. The two goods are the home exportable y with a
                                            *                     *
price   index P, and the foreign exportable y with a price index P .    In
this framework we again study the effects of differing wage rigidities,

i.e., aggregate supply specifications, on the effectiveness of demand

policy in influencing output.

       On the demand side we have the usual absorption equation for an open

economy:

(14)       y =   a(y,   P, g) + X(P/ep*).


The consumer price index entering absorption is a function of the home

and foreign prices:
                                                           —15—


(15)                P = e(P         p*);         0, 0*, > 0;       0+0* = 1.

The restriction on the sum of 0 and     * follows from specification of P
                               p      p
                                 *                                     *
as a weighted average of P and P , and the initial normalization P = P = 1.

        Total differentiation of (14), holding the exchange rate constant at

e =    1,    yields:


(16)                dy =                 [(a    0 + x)dP + (a 0* _x)dP* + dg].
                           1


Here x <             0 is the derivative of x with respect to eP/P. From (16) we
            p
can write the demand function for y:


(17)                y =   V(P, p* g);               VP <    0;    V* > 0;      Vg > O•


The partial derivatives of V are the coefficients in equation (16) above.

V* > 0 assumes that the terms of trade effect outweighs the absorption
effect when the foreign price level P rises. If the home good share in

the consumption bundle is at least equal to the import share, 0 <                        0*,
then V >                   V       *.   This condition is not necessary since x enters V
                p              p                                                  p        p
while —x enters V .
       p        p

       Aggregate Supply with Two Commodities

        On the supply side we first develop expressions for labor market

supply, demand, and equilibrium, and then show how these are affected

by the existence of wage rigidities above equilibrium levels.

        The production function is equation (1) of Section II, where output

is the exportable good. The usual demand function for labor is given in

equation (2) above:                        =            As an alternative we also introduce the
                                               YN(N).
possibility that producers have market power in both home and foreign

markets, and can effectively prevent entry in the short run. In this case,
                                           —16—


both the home and foreign prices would enter the demand function for labor:


(18)               N (N),

with P defined by:


(19)       P           p*);       p, ip* > 0;                p   + 4,* = 1.


In the competitive case P = P, and                  =   1.       However, (19) provides

the price index for a discriminating monopolist producing at home and

selling in both markets.-' In the algebra that follows, the competitive

case can be obtained by setting               = 1   and * =
       The labor supply function makes the real wage demanded a function of

the level of employment, with the nominal wage deflated by the consumer

price index P defined earlier in equation (15). Thus labor supply is

given by:


(20) =             g(N);
            P

Equilibrium in the labor market equates the nominal supply wage from (20)

to the demand wage from (18):


(21)        P •    g(N)=   P


       Total differentiation of (21) plus the production function (1) gives us
                                                                              *
the    expression for changes in y as functions of dP and dP on the supply

side:


(22)        dy =                [(iv — 0   )dP + (p      * — 0 *)dp*].

                                            -I I—



Here we have set all prices at unity initially. It may help to note that

this implies also that initial w = g =                  =

        From (22) we can write the general form of the supply function for
                                                                           y
as:


 (23)       y     /i(P, p*);         A > 0;           A* < 0.

The signs of the partial derivatives of (23) are the coefficients of

 (22), where we assume 0* >           b*.     This simply says the weight of foreign

prices in the worker's CPI is larger than it is in the firms' profits

function.

      An interesting property of the A supply function should be noted here.

If workers focus on the real wage, correctly measured, in making the labor

supply decision, theti 0 ÷ 0* =             1.      Together with   ÷    1, this
implies that A              —A*; the supply function is syniietric wIth respect to

the two prices.


      The Role of Wa Rigidities

      We can now introduce wage rigidities on the supply side as special cases

of (22) and (23). Consider first the case in which the real wage Is rigid

above equilibrium. We interpret this as an infinitely elastic supply curve

for labor at the rigid wage w, so that the supply function (20) becomes:


(20R)            = w,
             P

and In (22)             =   0.

      This simply removes           from (22) and (23), not changing the qualitative

slopes of (23). Thus going to a two—good model fundamentally changes the

"classical" effect of the real—wage rigidity. With the two price indexes

entering differentlyin producers' demand for labor and ifl workers' supply,
                                        —18—

a change of either price influences output supplied, with y/3P > 0 arid
     *
2y/3P < 0 even with a real—wage rigidity. This will eliminate some of

the sharp results of the one—commodity model.

    To impose a nominal wage rigidity, we re—write (20) as:


(20N)        WW;
in addition to       = 0,   i'   no longer enters the supply function. This

eliminates 0 and 0* from (22) and (23). In the usual case of L               1,

this takes us back to the supply function of Section II, equation (5),

with y/P =
               —l/y.
       With complete wage rigidity, or complete "money illusion" in labor

supply, 0 and 0* = 0, since the price level does not enter the labor supply

function as it affects the level of employment. With flexible nominal wages

and no money illusion, 0 ÷ 0* = 1.             In an intermediate case of partial

money illusion, the labor force would "perceive" a price index with 0±O* < 1.

The perceived price index could be thought of as the actual CPI raised to a

power less than unity: P with              <

       To summarize, real wage rigidity would eliminate N from (22) and nominal

wage rigidity would further eliminate 0 and 0*. Both types of rigidity would

leave us with the supply function (23) with A >          0. The sign of A*, the
cross—price effect on supply, is less clear. Normally A* < 0.            However, in
the case where ip     1, complete nominal wage rigidity would eliminate P from
the A supply function. If *           is   sufficiently large compared to 0*, then
   >    0.


    Demand and Supply in the "Foreign" Country

    Equations (17) and (23) give demand and supply in the home country as

functions of the two price levels. At this level of generality, demand

and supply in the foreign *          country     are mirror images. The only point to

note especially is that the trade balance at home must equal the deficit

abroad. Thus the demand equation in the *              country   is solved from:


(24)
             *  ** -.* *      *
            y =a(y,P,g)—x(eP/P).

The foreign demand equation is then:


(25) y = V*(P,           p*   g*);     V > 0;          V* < 0;        Vg* > 0;

The supply equation is:


(26)        y* =   *(p   p*);           <   0;       A** > 0.


The entire discussion for wage rigidities, etc., in the home case applies

in the tiforeignht case as well.

       Given the values of the two demand policy variables g and g , the                  two

demand functions (17) and (25), and the supply functions equations (23)
                                                                  *       *
and (26) give us four equations in the variables y, y , P, P .                    These

already include the restriction that the trade balance x is the same for

both countries. Next we study the properties of this equilibrium by con—

sidering the effect of a demand increase dg in the home country.


       Expansionary Demand Policy in One Country

       We analyze the effect of expansionary demand policy in the home country

under    a variety of institutional assumptions concerning wage rigidity. It

will be apparent that these have impacts on the results for the effectiveness

of fiscal poilcy. The model is summarized in equations (17), (23), (25) and

(26).

       Totally differentiating these we obtain the following linear system:

This   is the product of the own effects of price changes less the product of

the cross effects. The discussion after equation (17) led us to notIce that

the own demand effects are larger than the cross demand effects. Further—

more, in general, the own supply effects are larger than or equal to the

cross supply effects. Therefore, A can in general be taken to be positive.

       The comparative status of the model of equation (27) following an in-

crease in g are summarized below:

       The numerator of equation (29) for dy/dg is essentially Vg times the

own price effects less cross—price effects. Therefore in general we ex-

pect It to be positive. A major exception would be when home supply is

insensitive to prices; then dy/dg                 0.       The numerator of (30)   contains

depends on the relative absolute values of the demand effects, and is

therefore negative." We return to a detailed analysis of (29) and (30)

below.

          The condition that A > 0 is required to obtain the result that an

increase in g will increase both P and P in (31) and (32). If A <                             0,
an increase in g will decrease P and P .

illusion, so that 0 + 0* = 1.           Whether the real wage is rigid will effect

only the size of the multipliers, with                 <    0.    For the "foreign" country

we will vary the assumptions across several of the differing cases of wage

rigidity distinguished earlier. These are:

       4. Sticky nominal wages, with 0 + 0* < 1.

 Clearly this is only a small subset of the possible combinations of assump-

 tions for wage behavior in both countries, as is obvious in equations (29)

and (30).

       The four cases are summarized in Table 3. In the first case, even

with no money illusion at home, demand expansion increases home output

 through the differentia]. effects of P arid P on noine supply. In Section II

with one commodity and corresponding prices dy/dg       0. This may be the

proper case to associate with Giersch.

       An important thing to note about cases 2 and 3 is that our results are

completely classical when, in any country, workers and firms are equally

sensitive to the home price level: 0* =      ip*. In   this case expansionary

policy in either country will not affect supply in that country.

       If the foreign country (i.e., the one that does not expand) has a

fixed real wage while workers are more sensitive to the cross price than

are firms (case 2), the expansion at home is contractionary abroad. This

result -is the one obtained by Argy and Salop, Sachs, and Bruno and Sachs.

However, there are two caveats to this result. These are shown in cases

3 and 4. Enough money illusion in the foreign country will make the increase

in g expansionary there, as in case 4. By "enough" we mean that

In   general the EELS of (33) will be close to unity since (a)   +
is small relative to        and (b) (C* — O'*) is between minus one and

one. Therefore it takes but a little money illusion to reverse the con—

tractionary effect abroad of an increase in g at home. A final caveat is

that if in the foreign country firms are more sensitive to the cross price

than are workers, a rare case of which Hoag Kong may be an example, then

our increase in g is expansionary abroad.

IV. Empirical Results on Money Illusion and Wagegi4i

         To test for the existence of money illusion or wage rigidity we   begin
by specifying a labor supply equation making the level of the nominal wage

dependent on the expected price level and a measure of labor demand. A

time trend is added to account for productivity growth and trends in the

variables. An estimating form of this static model would be


(34)         Ln W a0     a1         a2 ifl Dt + a3t +c.

Here e represents the expected price level, D is a measure of labor demand,

proxied below by real GNP, and the time trend is included to detrend W, F,

and D.

         If the coefficient a1 were unity, money illusion would be absent and the

real—wage cases of Sections II and III with 0 + 0 * = 1 are relevant. If
                                            p    p
in addition a2 is insignificant, the real wage would be rigid in the rele—

vant period and        = 0 in Sections II and III. If a1 were less than unity,

money illusion exists (0 + 0* <       1),   and the extreme case would have a1

         Estimation of (34) directly would assume that wages adjust within a

quarter to changes on their determinants. The literature on wage equations

shows clearly that this is not the case. We have estimated equations in the

form of (34), and observed generally quite significant serial correlation in

the residuals. These equations using instrumental variables for          and D,

as described in detail below, and the Cochrane—Orcutt adjustment for serial

correlation, are shown in Appendix B. The first—order serial correlation

coefficients p are generally in the .7 to .9 range, and the U.K. shows evi-

dence of higher—order correlation. This can be taken as evidence that there

is   a   lagged adjustment process moving wage rates, adjusting the average wage

toward the statIc supply of labor schedule, whatever its slope. This fric-

tion could be due to the existence of long—term (more than one quarter)
                                            —27—


contracts, in nominal or real terms.

       In a dynamic context we wish to test whether the adjustment process is

in terms of real or nominal wages, and how sensitive it is to demand con-

ditions. Thus the question is whether it is today's real wage that depends

on past real wages and curcent labor market conditions or today's nominal

wage that depends on past nominal wages and current labor market conditions.

The former adjustment mechanism (which results for instance from indexed

contracts) implies that our model is neutral to fiscal policy in the absence

of terms of trade effects. The latter corresponds to the presence of "money

illusion."

       Let us reinterpret the static supply of labor function in equation (31t)
                                   *
as giving the target wage W

               *          e

                          t+l          th Dt +     +

We consider only models of the partial adjustment type. Nominal wage sticki-

ness is given by:


(36)       in(Wt/Wti) =        X(in W/Wi).

Real wage stickiness is given by:


(37)         in (W/P)      —   in (Wi/Pi) p . [in (W/P) — in (Wi/Pi) 1.

These two equations lead to two different short—run supply of labor schedules.

Using (35) and (36) we obtain for the nominal rase,


(38)       in (We/P)           (A—i) in(Pe/W       + Ac1 in Dt + Aa2t + Xc.

Using (35)   and   (37)   we   obtain for the real—wagecase,

(39)       in (W/P) = (l—i)            in (Wi/Pi)      +
                                                           pa3 in Dt
                                                                       +   pci9t
                                                                                   +
                                          —28—


These two models are nonnested. We can embed both hypotheses in a more

"general" adjustment mechanism which combines (36) and (37) in the follow-

ing manner:

Here if       =   0,   we have equation (36) representing nominal wage adjustment;

       = 1 —           we have equation (37) instead. Substituting (36) for W

into (40) we obtain the estimating equation:


(41)      2,n (WIPe) =                   2.n (P/W1) +          2,n (W1/Pti)

                                 y1a1n Dt + y1a2t     + 1i6t

This is the common alternative hypothesis against which we test (38) and

(39). We can compare the three equations directly. If 2 = 0, l in (41)

is equal to X in (38); if 12 =                   then 2 is also equal to (l—p) in
                                        1_li,
equation (39).

       We reject the hypothesis that it is the real wage that adjusts according

                                                                 is significantly differ-
to equation (37) if the coefficient on 2,n(P /            W1)
ent from zero. On the other hand we reject equation (36) if the estimate of

   in (41) is significantly different from zero.- Of- course the models are

                                                                              =
indistinguishable when the adjustment is instantaneous, i.e.,                     1,   2
       The estimating equation (41) is derived from specification of an equation

for the level of the nominal wage, (34) or (35), dependent on the level of

demand, and a standard adjustment mechanism. This is a different procedure

from that followed by Bruno and Sachs [l979]", Gordon [1977], and Spitaeller


     -'Bruno and Sachs' 1979 specification involves a partial adjustment of
the rate of cha of wages to the equilibrium rate of change of wages which
depends on GNP. This leads to an equation similar to (41). We are working
on a paper that tests their specification directly against our "real" and
"nominal" wage adjustment models.

[1976]. In particular, their specification assumes that the level of demand

affects the rate of change of wages, while a simple differencing of equation

(41) would put the change in demand into the equation for the change in the

wage rate. This difference must be kept in mind in interpreting our results

below.

       In estimating equation (41) for five major OECD countries, we used price

data from the OECD Main Economic Indicators and CNP data from the International

Financial Statistics published by the IMP. The Dt variable is real GNP for

all countries except Italy where it is real GDP. The dependent variable is

hourly compensation, provided by the INF.-' The price variable is the

Consumer Price Index. All variables were seasonally adjusted using the

X—ll method.

      We estimated all equations using instrumental variable estimates for

     and GNP. For each country regressions were performed of the CPI and GNP

on four lagged values of CPI and GNP plus the current and four lagged values

of the money stock. Fitted values from these regressions were used in the

wage equation for     and GNP. These are denoted as P and GNP in Table 4

below. This procedure can be interpreted econometrically as eliminating

the simultaneity bias running from the real wage to GNP and the CPI, or as

imposition of rational expectations on the wage equation.

 -
      We estimated equation (41) with quarterly observations for two periods,

one running from 1961 to 1978, the other from 1971 to 1978. This was done.

because the latter period exhibits a higher rate of inflation and it is

likely that workers are more sensitive to the price level when its increases

are larger. Furthermore, the period 1971—1978 saw a large increase in oil


          also estimated the equations using hourly earnings and the hourly
wage as dependent variables. The results are virtually identical to those
using compensation data and are available upon request.

prices which should have led to a reduction in the equilibrium real wage,

therefore making this an ideal period to test the rigidity of the real

wage. Equations in Phillips curve form have been estimated for the period

1958—73 quarterly by Gordon, for the period 1957—72 semiannually by

Spitaeller, and for the period 1962—76 annually by Bruno and Sachs.

     The estimates of equation (41) are shown in Table 4. In all cases the

dependent variable is W/P. There are two equations for each country, one

for the full period 1961—78, and one for the shorter period 1971—78. The

coefficients are presented with their standard errors in parentheses. In

the last column of the table we give the result of the test of real versus

nominal wage adjustment. R means that the real wage hypothesis is accepted

and the nominal hypothesis is rejected, and vice versa for N. The R, N

entries signify that neither hypothesis can be rejected.

     The first thing we notice in Table 4 is that. .the coefficient of the de-

mand variable GNP is significantly positive in all countries for the full

period, but insignificant for 1971—78. This says that in each of these

countries wage movements became less sensitive to demand variation in the

1970s than earlier; in terms of our theoretical model 8N = 0.

     Turning to the real vs. nominal wage issue, we see that the U.S. is the

only country where the nominal adjustment model dominates. The coefficient

of W1/P1 is effectively zero for both periods, and the estimate of the

A adjustment coefficient in the money wage model is approximately 0.7. This

result is consistent with the earlier findings of Bruno—Sachs [1979], Gordon

[1977] and Spitaeller [1976]. The U.K. regressions yield ambiguous results.

The nominal wage model is rejected over the full period, but neither hypothesis

can be rejected in the 1971—78 period. On the presumption that the real wage

model is accepted, the estimate of the p adjustment coefficient is approxi-

mately 0.45 over both periods. This fits the results of Bruno—Sachs, but

not Spitaeller.

     For Japan and Italy, the nominal wage model is rejected for both periods.

The W1/P1 coefficient is insignificantly different from unity in all four

regressions, suggesting a long adjustment process with i   close to zero. These
results are roughly consistent with the literature.

     For Germany, neither hypothesis can be rejected for the full period,

but the nominal wage model is rejected for 1971—78. As in Italy and Japan,

the p estimate is close to zero. These results are also roughly consistent

with the literature. Gordon and Spitaeller found money illusion in earlier

data sets ending in 1972 and 1973, respectively, and Bruno—Sachs reject it

on data through 1976.

     In summary, it seems that sensitivity of wage movements to fluctuations

in demand has been reduced sharply in the 1970s relative to the earlier period

in all five countries. The U.S. is the only country in which the model of

nominal wage stickiness is supported; in the U.K., Japan, Italy and Germany

it is the real wage that adjusts slowly. This is consistent with effective

indexation in these countries as compared with the U.S.

     In terms of the model in Sections II and III, only the U.S. seems to

have enough money illusion to bring about an expansion in response to third

country increases in demand. On the other hand, money illusion appears to

be absent in the U.K., Germany, Italy, and Japan. This means that these

countries may have to worry about the effect of expansionary fiscal policy

in the other countries.
