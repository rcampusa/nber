Saving Teens: Using a Policy Discontinuity to Estimate the Effects of Medicaid Eligibility

                                              ABSTRACT

This paper uses a policy discontinuity to identify the immediate and long-term effects of public health
insurance coverage during childhood. Our identification strategy exploits a unique feature of several
early Medicaid expansions that extended eligibility only to children born after September 30, 1983.
This feature resulted in a large discontinuity in the lifetime years of Medicaid eligibility of children
at this birthdate cutoff. Those with family incomes at or just below the poverty line had close to five
more years of eligibility if they were born just after the cutoff than if they were born just before. We
use this discontinuity in eligibility to measure the impact of public health insurance on mortality by
following cohorts of children born on either side of this cutoff from childhood through early adulthood.
We examine changes in rates of mortality by the underlying causes of death, distinguishing between
deaths due to internal and external causes. We also examine outcomes separately for black and white
children. Our analysis shows that black children were more likely to be affected by the Medicaid expansions
and gained twice the amount of eligibility as white children. We find a substantial effect of public
eligibility during childhood on the later life mortality of black children at ages 15-18. The estimates
indicate a 13-20 percent decrease in the internal mortality rate of black teens born after September
30, 1983. We find no evidence of an improvement in the mortality of white children under the expansions.

I. Introduction


        Interest in public health insurance in the U.S. is motivated by the relatively poor

health of children in families with low incomes. Not only are children from poorer

families more likely to be born in poor health, but the relative health of these children

worsens with age (Case, et al. 2002). To address this disparity in child health, U.S. policy

has largely focused on increasing access to medical care for children through expansions

in publicly provided health insurance.1 These expansions aim to promote health among

children by providing timely access to child health services that meet national standards

for pediatric care. A major focus is preventive care and the early diagnosis and treatment

of the physical and mental health needs of low-income children.

        There is strong evidence that public coverage improves utilization of medical care

for children. Several papers have documented an increase in preventive care for children

under public health insurance expansions in the form of an annual doctor visit, including

Card and Shore-Sheppard (2004), Currie and Gruber (1996a), and Currie, et al. (2008). In

addition, other papers have found an increase in hospital use (see Currie and Gruber

1996a, Dafny and Gruber 2005).

        There is also some evidence that this increase in utilization translates into

improved immediate health outcomes for children, but as Howell and Kenney (2012)

emphasize the evidence is much more limited.2 In a widely cited paper, Currie and

Gruber (1996a) find that increased Medicaid eligibility is correlated with a decline in

  A series of expansions of the Medicaid program beginning in 1984, and later expansions under the State
Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), are estimated to have more than doubled the share of
children eligible for public health insurance from 17.8 percent in 1987 (Cutler and Gruber 1996) to 41.7
percent in 2000 (Lo Sasso and Buchmueller 2004).

  Although not discussed here, improvements in birth outcomes under expansions in pregnancy-related
coverage have also been documented (see Currie and Gruber 1996b).

child deaths where the underlying cause of death reflects disease, or other conditions

likely to be influenced by medical care. Finding no effect on deaths due to other

(external) causes, such as accidents or homicides, their results suggest an improvement in

child health achieved through improved access to care.3 A recent paper by Howell et al.

(2010) finds additional evidence of a decline in child mortality associated with expanded

public insurance, although their findings indicate a decline in external-cause mortality.

The authors cite anticipatory guidance, improved access to mental health services, and

timely medical care in the incidence of accident or injury as potential mechanisms behind

this improvement.

         There is little evidence regarding the effect of public health insurance during

childhood on later life health. From a program evaluation standpoint, the effect of public

coverage on the long-term health of children is an important component of program

benefits. Many preventive services are designed to protect healthy children from future

disease or risks, such as immunizations and health education. Physician monitoring and

screenings during childhood may identify and target precursors for later health problems

such as cardiovascular disease. The payoffs from these types of interventions might not

be evident until later in life. For those children with mental and physical disabilities or

chronic illness, early diagnosis and treatment may help the management of these

conditions or limit their persistence into adulthood. Medical care may also have a




3
  A number of studies using more subjective health measures, including parental reports of child health
status and restricted activity days, find little effect of improvement under public health insurance (Currie
and Gruber 1995, Racine, et al. 2001, Currie, et al. 2008).

positive impact through counseling regarding behavior risks and linking children to

helpful social services.4

        This paper provides new evidence on the role of public health insurance coverage

during childhood on both immediate and long-term health. Our identification strategy

exploits a unique feature of several early Medicaid expansions that extended eligibility

only to children born after September 30, 1983. A path-breaking study by Card and

Shore-Sheppard (2004) identified and used this policy discontinuity to examine the

takeup of public health insurance and the crowdout of private insurance under these

expansions. The authors estimate an 8 percent Medicaid takeup rate among newly

eligible children born after this birthdate cutoff. They find that the expansions resulted in

an overall increase in health insurance coverage with little evidence of crowd-out. The

authors also provide evidence that this new Medicaid coverage led to a large increase in

the utilization of medical care. Their estimates suggest that children with new coverage

were 60 percent more likely to have at least one doctor visit within the last year.

        Building on this earlier work, we show that the early Medicaid expansion rules

led to a large cumulative difference in public eligibility for children born before and after

September 30, 1983. Children in families with incomes at or just below the poverty line

gained close to five additional years of eligibility if they were born in October 1983

rather than just one month before. We use regression discontinuity and difference in

difference methods to examine outcomes for cohorts of children born just before and

after the birthdate cutoff to identify the impact of this additional public coverage during

childhood.

 The standard economic argument is also applicable that providing free medical care may free up resources
for making other investments with long term impacts.


                                                   4
         Importantly, this research design allows us to examine the impact of childhood

coverage later in life by following these cohorts of children into early adulthood. The

discontinuity in insurance coverage under the expansions occurred between the ages of 8

and 14. In addition to studying the immediate impact of coverage at these ages, we follow

these cohorts through age 18 to observe any long-term impacts on health. We also

provide some early evidence on impacts through age 22. Most previous studies of the

Medicaid expansions have only considered contemporaneous impacts on child health.

         Two existing studies have considered the long-term effect of public health

insurance for children. Using variation in eligibility across states, Currie et al. (2008) find

some evidence to suggest improvements in adolescent health resulting from past

eligibility. The authors regress parent-reported health status for children of ages 9 to 17

on the fraction of children who were eligible in the child’s birth cohort and current state

of residence for a given year of age between 0 and 8.5 They find that more generous

coverage at ages 2, 3, and 4 is associated with better health status for older children.

         De la Mata (2012) also examines longer-term effects of public eligibility using a

regression discontinuity design that compares children in families with incomes just

above and below the income eligibility thresholds for public health insurance. In addition

to looking at changes in contemporaneous health, she examines whether eligibility for a

child age 5-18 in a given year leads to health improvements after 1 or 5 years have

passed. Using health status, obesity, and the number of school days missed due to illness

as outcome measures, she finds no evidence of significant effects on health in the

immediate or longer-term.

5
 Citing collinearity between eligibility at various ages, they run a separate regression with eligibility at
each age. In general, regressions of outcomes on eligibility at a single year of age will give coefficient
estimates that reflect the correlation of eligibility at other ages with eligibility in that given year of age.


                                                         5
        In general, very little is known about the potential long-term effects of health

insurance coverage on health (Cutler and Zeckhauser 2000). The RAND Health

Insurance Experiment examined the health of children at entry and exit during its 3- and

5-year periods of study. Researchers found no significant differences in health measures

for children in families randomly assigned to health insurance plans providing medical

care free of charge and those requiring some form of co-payment, despite reduced

demand for ambulatory care for children in families enrolled in the cost-sharing plans

(Valdez et al. 1985).6

        The main focus of this paper is measuring the effects of childhood Medicaid

eligibility on immediate and long-term mortality. We focus on mortality as our health

measure because it is accurately measured and higher values are unambiguously bad. We

considered other outcomes such as doctor visits and hospitalizations, but power

calculations suggested that the effects would need to be quite large to be detectible with

available data. In addition, the direction of any changes in these outcomes is not as

clearly predicted a priori and not obviously good or bad for health.

        Following Currie and Gruber (1996a), we examine rates of mortality by the

underlying causes of death distinguishing between deaths due to internal and external

causes. Because we are using national-level data in our analysis, we also examine

outcomes for subsamples that are more likely to be affected by the change in Medicaid

policy. We estimate models separately for black and white children, and also split our

sample into states with a high or low gain in years of public eligibility for children at the

September 30, 1983 cutoff.

6
  Some gains in health were observed among poor adults with existing chronic health problems, while
individuals between the ages 12 and 35 on the free-care plan showed some improvement in dental health
(Manning et al. 1987).

       This paper is structured as follows: Section II provides some background on the

Medicaid expansions used in our estimation and the resulting discontinuity in childhood

eligibility for children born around the September 30, 1983 birthdate cutoff. Section III

reviews our research design and empirical specifications. Section IV describes the data

we use in our analysis while Section V presents our mortality results. Section VI

compares our results to past work and estimates the cost per life saved. Section VII

concludes with a summary of our findings and their applicability to public policy.


II. The Discontinuity in Eligibility


       Medicaid is a joint federal-state program that provides health services to certain

low-income beneficiaries. Since 1967, the program has included a special benefit

package for children designed to provide comprehensive health coverage including

preventive care. This benefit package provides all Medicaid children with early and

periodic screenings for physical, mental and developmental health; vision, dental and

hearing examinations and follow-up care; and all health services they are found to need.

       Historically not all children in poor families were eligible for Medicaid coverage.

Eligibility for non-disabled children was previously linked to participation in the Aid to

Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program. Beginning in 1984, a series of

Congressional acts expanded eligibility for Medicaid to children who were not

traditionally eligible for AFDC, often with income levels above AFDC cutoffs. To phase

in the Medicaid expansions, many of the legislative changes were applied only to

children born after September 30, 1983 (see Table 1). This legislative provision meant

that children born in October 1983 faced more generous eligibility criteria for the



                                             7
Medicaid program than children born just one month earlier in September 1983. The

result of this provision was a large discontinuity in the number of childhood years of

Medicaid eligibility for children born around this birthdate cutoff.

         To illustrate the discontinuity, we model childhood public eligibility for cohorts

born between 1980 and 1987. Using detailed federal and state eligibility rules for the

years 1980 to 2005, our simulation program uses information on state of residence,

family structure and size, parent employment, and family income to calculate monthly

public eligibility status through age 17. 7 To obtain a nationally representative sample of

these characteristics of children and families, we employ data from the March

Supplements to the Current Population Survey (CPS). We use a random sample of 500

children of ages 0-17 from each year of the 1981-1988 CPS and estimate the childhood

eligibility for this pooled sample for each birth month between January 1980 and

December 1987. 8 This simulation holds family characteristics constant over the child’s

lifetime.9

         Figure 1 shows the results of our simulation for children in families with income

below 150 percent of poverty, those most likely to be affected by the change in Medicaid

eligibility rules. This graph depicts the average total number of years of public eligibility

during childhood by birth month cohort. Each line on the graph represents an income

bracket. For all income brackets, we see a gradual increase in childhood eligibility across


7
  For the years prior to welfare reform, we estimate eligibility for Medicaid under AFDC, state Ribicoff
rules, and federal and state Medicaid expansions. For 1997 forward, eligibility is estimated under the post-
welfare reform eligibility rules for Medicaid, as well as under continuing state Medicaid expansions and
new separate state programs funded by SCHIP.
8
  We use the 1981-1988 CPS surveys because the information collected on income is for the previous
calendar year.
9
  This convention may understate eligibility during early childhood and overstate eligibility during the later
years of childhood if family income grows with child age and is not counterbalanced by changes in family
size that alter the poverty thresholds to which income is compared.


                                                      8
birth cohorts prior to a jump in years of eligibility for children born in October 1983.

Children born in October 1983 are the first cohort of children to be eligible for the

Medicaid expansions with the September 30, 1983 birthdate cutoff. Following this jump,

we again see a gradual increase in childhood eligibility for the remaining birth cohorts.10

         The magnitude of the discontinuity in childhood eligibility at the September 30,

1983 cutoff varies by family income. Figure 2 presents the size of the discontinuity as

captured by the average difference in years of eligibility for a child born in October

versus September 1983 by income group. The largest jump in years of eligibility occurs

among children with family incomes above AFDC eligibility levels but below poverty.

Children in families with incomes just below poverty see the largest gain with an

additional 4.7 years of eligibility during childhood, while those with incomes between 50

to 74 percent of poverty see a gain of 3.9 years. We see a smaller discontinuity in

childhood eligibility among children in families with incomes at or below AFDC levels,

around 50 percent of poverty. This is unsurprising since many of these children were

already eligible for Medicaid under AFDC before the expansions. Finally, we also see a

very small discontinuity among children in families with incomes above poverty.

         Across all family income groups, the main legislative source behind the jump in

eligibility is the implementation of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA90).11

Effective July 1, 1991, OBRA90 mandated state coverage to children under age 19 born

after September 30, 1983 with family incomes below poverty. Children born in October

1983 were almost 8 years of age when this change was implemented. To illustrate the

10
   Much of this gradual increase is due to a larger share of each successive cohort’s life occurring when
younger children were Medicaid eligible under various age cutoffs rather than a gradual change in rules.
11
   We estimate that OBRA accounts for 92 percent of the 4.7 year gain in eligibility for children with
incomes between 75 and 100 percent of poverty and 89 percent of the 3.9 year gain for children with
incomes between 50 and 75 percent of poverty. See Appendix Table 1.


                                                     9
timing of the gain in eligibility, Figure 3 compares the share of children eligible for

public health insurance if born in October versus September 1983 by each year of age.

Corresponding to the introduction of OBRA90, we see a sizeable jump in the share of

October-born children with eligibility at age 8. Faced with new and more generous

eligibility criteria, this cohort remains more likely to be eligible for public health

insurance until the introduction of the State Children’s Health Insurance Program

(SCHIP) in August 1997. Authorized by the Balanced Budget Act, SCHIP allowed states

to expand eligibility for public health insurance to children of higher incomes, regardless

of the child’s month of birth, under existing state Medicaid programs or new state

programs. These expansions were quickly adopted by states and served to close any

discontinuity in eligibility by age 15.

       We distinguish between three different age ranges in our analysis. Ages 4 to 7

captures a period prior to the implementation of OBRA90 where differences in eligibility

at the birthdate threshold are small. Our analysis of this period serves to establish a

baseline difference in health for children at the cutoff. We do not expect to find any

discontinuity in health for this age group.

       Next we examine children at ages 8 to 14. Children who benefitted from the

expansions primarily gained eligibility during this age range, as shown in Figure 3. We

interpret any discontinuity in health observed during this period as an immediate effect of

public health insurance coverage, similar to the existing estimates using cross-sectional

data in the literature (e.g., Currie and Gruber 1996a). However, any difference in health

observed in our estimates may also be due to a cumulative gain in exposure to health

insurance coverage over the period. For instance, a child at age 14 born in October 1983




                                              10
may have gained Medicaid coverage for the five years prior, beginning at age 8. There is

little research that has examined the effect of multi-year coverage on health care access or

outcomes for children.12

         Finally, we examine children at ages 15 to 18, the period following the gain in

public eligibility. Although equally as likely to have public eligibility during this age

range, children born in October 1983 received an average of 0.43 years of additional

health insurance during their 8-14 years when compared to children born one month

earlier (see Table 3). We already showed that for children with incomes just below

poverty, the average difference in eligibility was 4.7 years. By examining this older age

group, we are able to consider the longer-term effects of childhood coverage as these

cohorts enter adulthood.

         We also examine differential effects of the expansions by the race and state of

residence of the child. Black children in the U.S. are more likely to be in low-income

families and without health insurance than white children. At the time of the Medicaid

expansions, black children were nearly three times as likely to be in poverty as white

children. Therefore, we may see a larger impact of the expansions among black children.

The gain in Medicaid eligibility for children born after September 30, 1983 will also vary

across states due to differences in Medicaid policies before and after the expansions.

States had different eligibility criteria in place prior to the expansions depending on state-

determined AFDC program rules and optional eligibility programs. In addition, state

decisions regarding optional Medicaid and SCHIP expansions varied in terms of timing

12
  One exception, Cassedy, et al. (2008) show that children with any gap in insurance coverage over a two-
year period have higher odds of lacking a usual source of care and not having well-care visits than those
with continuous insurance coverage, regardless of whether that continuous coverage was public or private.
This is also a substantial literature finding that continuous coverage during a year is associated with better
access to care (see Leininger 2009 for evidence and cites to the literature).


                                                      11
and child age and family incomes covered. We should emphasize that this source of

variation in Medicaid eligibility across states is not as clearly exogenous as birthdate.

States with improving child mortality may be less likely to expand coverage, for

example. However, this type of variation is the main source of identifying variation that

has been used in the literature on Medicaid expansions.

         To compare the eligibility gains by child race and state of residence, we use a

sample that draws a maximum of 500 children ages 0-17 from each race (black, white,

other) and state cell from the pooled 1981-1988 CPS years, giving us 50,874 child

observations. Holding family characteristics constant, we estimate eligibility for each

child for each year during childhood by calculating eligibility in July of the appropriate

calendar year. We use these estimates to calculate the average gain in years of eligibility

at the September 30, 1983 cutoff by child race.13

         To estimate the eligibility gain for each state that resulted from legislative

variation in Medicaid policy, we follow the literature and use a simulated eligibility

measure constructed using the national sample of children. We estimate the average

eligibility gain for the national sample given the rules in each state and, in this way,

capture variation due to legislative differences rather than demographic differences across

states. Ranking the state average estimates, we divide states into a “high” eligibility and a

“low” eligibility group that each represent approximately half of the total child

population. The high eligibility group includes the states with the largest average gain in

years of eligibility while the low eligibility group includes the states with the smallest

13
  In calculating all averages that we report in the text and in tables, we multiply the CPS-provided survey
weights by an adjustment factor specific to each cell in order to account for the manner in which we
constructed our sample. This factor is calculated as the inverse of the ratio of the sum of the survey weights
of individuals in the cell in our sample and the sum of the survey weights of individuals in the cell in the
CPS.


                                                     12
average gain in years of eligibility. We use this method to identify the high and low

eligibility gain states for children of each race, in addition to the identification for all

children. Table 2 gives the ranking of states by their gain in eligibility for all children.14

           Table 3 presents summary characteristics for children in each of the state groups

in 1983 prior to the first Medicaid eligibility expansions. Children in the high eligibility

gain states were less likely to be eligible for AFDC or Medicaid than children in the low

eligibility gain states, despite similar shares of children with family incomes below the

poverty level. This indicates that more children stood to gain from the Medicaid

eligibility expansions in the high eligibility gain states because pre-expansion eligibility

levels for Medicaid were lower.

           Table 4 reports the estimated discontinuity in childhood eligibility at the

September 30, 1983 cutoff separately by race and state group. Looking across all states,

black children, on average, gain 2 times the average years of eligibility gained by white

children. Figure 4 gives additional insight into the nature of the gain in eligibility specific

to each racial group. Although the gain is concentrated during the 8 to 14-age range, a

much larger share of black children are affected by the expansion in eligibility.

Meanwhile, Table 3 shows that children residing in high eligibility gain states receive 5

times the average number of additional years of coverage of those in low eligibility gain

states.

III. The Research Designs



Regression Discontinuity Methods

           Our research design uses comparisons across the September 30, 1983 birthdate

cutoff to measure the impact of Medicaid eligibility on health outcomes. Since factors

other than date of birth determine childhood eligibility for public health insurance, such

as childhood family income, this is an example of a “fuzzy” RD design. Birth cohort is

defined in our sample using the month and year of birth for cohorts born between 1980

and 1987. We denote birth cohorts using the integer values c [45,50], where c=0 for

the birth cohort October 1983, the first cohort born after the cutoff date September 30,

1983. Our main analysis is based on a regression discontinuity (RD) model of the form

                      (1) yca    f ( ; c)   1(c  0)   a Aa   m M c   t Yt   ca

where yca represents mortality or another health-related outcome for cohort c at age a,

 f () is a smooth function of birth month cohort with parameter vector  , and 1(c  0) is

an indicator for whether the cohort was born after September 30, 1983. Control variables

included in our regression are age dummies Aa, calendar year dummies Yt (where t is a

function of c and a), and month of birth dummies Mc. We may interpret  as the effect of

the eligibility expansions averaged across the full sample of children at the cutoff.15

           The central question for implementation is how to model the function of birth

month cohort f () . We present estimates of the treatment effect  using both linear and

quadratic specifications of the regression function. We also report estimates where we

allow the parameter vector  of these specifications to differ on both sides of the


15
     In other words, we estimate the proportion eligible times an intent-to-treat parameter.

birthdate cutoff (i.e. linear and quadratic splines). All regressions are estimated using

OLS.

        As described above, we estimate equation (1) separately for each of the following

three age groups: 4-7, 8-14, and 15-18. All graphical representations plot the means of

the outcome variable for each birth cohort at each of the three age groups. The lines are

fitted values from a regression that includes a second-order polynomial in birth cohort

and a dummy variable for children born after September 30, 1983. In our regression

results, heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors are clustered by birth month cohort to

account for our grouping of narrow age ranges into broader ones as we describe below.16



Differences, and Differences in Differences

        The regression discontinuity approach allows us to examine how mortality

changes precisely at the date of the eligibility discontinuity. As a consequence it puts a

great deal of weight on a small number of data points. As a check on the results, we also

present simple differences that compare the mortality of children born over the twelve

months prior to the September 30, 1983 cutoff to that of children born over the following

twelve months. Particularly when we examine rare outcomes such as narrow causes of

death, the reliance on data for the full year before seems to be a better balancing of bias

and precision. Finally, when the underlying trends in mortality are similar across race

groups, we sometimes compare the magnitude of the estimated differences for the twelve

month before and after the cutoff for black and white children.

16
  Clustering on each value of the discrete assignment variable can also account for uncertainty in the
choice of the functional form, as shown by Lee and Card (2008). Their model of deviations from the true
regression function (i.e. “specification errors”) introduces a common component to the variance term for
each value of the assignment variable provided that the specification errors on either side of the
discontinuity are the same.


                                                    15
IV. Outcomes and Data


         Our empirical analysis requires data on child health or the utilization of medical

care with information on child birthdate. The main focus of this paper is measuring the

effects of childhood Medicaid eligibility on immediate and long-term mortality. We

initially considered using a broader range of outcome measures in our analysis. These

measures included doctor visits, hospitalizations, and the incidence of certain reportable

diseases. We considered the presence of at least an annual visit to the doctor as reported

in the National Health Interview Survey. We also considered the incidence of

hospitalizations, particularly avoidable hospitalizations, sometimes referred to as those

due to ambulatory care sensitive (ACS) conditions, as reported in the National Hospital

Discharge Survey.

         Two issues, however, pointed us toward a focus on mortality. First, we conducted

extensive power analyses that suggested that reasonably large effects of Medicaid

eligibility on other outcomes might be hard to detect with the available data sources.

Second, for some of these outcomes such as hospitalizations, the interpretation of

changes in rates is unclear. Higher rates of contact with a medical provider do not

unambiguously mean that children are healthier. The availability of public health

insurance may lead to an increase in access that could even increase the rate of

hospitalizations that are commonly classified as avoidable.17

         Our analysis uses mortality data records for all deaths in the United States. We

focus on this measure of the success of health insurance because mortality is precisely

17
  In their analysis of expansions in public health insurance on child hospitalizations, Dafny and Gruber
(2005) find an increase in avoidable hospitalizations but it is not statistically significant. They find a larger
and significant increase in unavoidable hospitalizations under the expansions.


                                                       16
measured, it is very likely to be recorded even for those without access to health care, and

higher values are unambiguously bad. Previous path-breaking research has found an

impact of public eligibility on child mortality at young ages (Currie and Gruber 1996a).

       Mortality is also an outcome for which we might potentially see long-term

impacts of health insurance coverage for children. Figure 5 shows the age profile of rates

of mortality due to internal and external underlying causes for children in their first year

of life through age 19 in the year preceding the Medicaid expansions. For both types of

death, the relationship with child age takes on a U-shape, though it is much less

pronounced for internal causes. Children face lower mortality rates during the middle

childhood years and higher rates of death in early and late childhood. Given this

relationship, the gain in health insurance coverage during the middle childhood years and

its impact on health might be more apparent during the later childhood years when

mortality is higher.

       We construct aggregate mortality outcomes using information from the National

Vital Statistics System (NVSS) Multiple Cause of Death files for the years 1980 to 2006

and NVSS Birth Data files for the years 1980 to 1987. To take maximum advantage of

the discontinuity in childhood eligibility by birth cohort, we construct cohort-specific

death rates, where cohort is defined as the month and year of birth. While the date of

birth of the decedent is excluded from the publicly available mortality files, we are able

to access this restricted information at the Chicago Census Research Data Center.

Necessarily, we drop all observations from the mortality data with missing information

on child birthdate. The average share of child observations with missing birthdate

information for each year of mortality data is about 2 percent. We also exclude those




                                             17
observations where the birth year information contradicts the reported age of the child.18

In addition, we use only those observations of children born in the U.S. with residence in

the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, excluding any residents of U.S. territories

or foreign residents.19

         For our outcome measure, we construct the rate of death Rca for each of the 96

monthly birth cohorts in our sample for the following age groupings: 4-5, 6-7, 8-10, 11-

12, 13-14, 15-16, and 17-18. We tally the total number of deaths Dca for each birth cohort

c at specified years of age a. We then divide this number by the total population at risk,

calculated as the total population of births for each birth cohort Nc minus the total number

of deaths for all ages prior to age a.20 We express all final rates as the number of deaths

per 10,000 children in each birth cohort.

                      Total population at risk ca

     In addition to examining mortality among all children, we also focus our analysis on

subpopulations that were more likely to benefit from the Medicaid expansions.

Specifically, we examine outcomes by child race and state of residence. As shown

earlier, black children gained on average twice the length of coverage as white children.

Meanwhile, children in states with a “high eligibility gain” saw an increase in coverage

that averaged six times that of children in low eligibility gain states.

18
   The average share of child observations with conflicting responses for birth year and age for each year of
mortality data is approximately 0.09 percent.
19
   The exclusion of foreign-born observations reduces our sample of mortality records by 10,232 out of
157,244 cases, or 7 percent. This count includes observations for whom place of birth was reported to be
unknown.
20
   The NVSS Birth Data files for 1980-1984 offer only a 50% random sample of births for a handful of
states, stratified by month of birth and county of occurrence. For each of these states and years, we double
the number of births for each birth cohort to approximate the universe. We make this adjustment for the
following states and years: AZ, CA, DE, GA, and DC in 1980-1984, ND in 1980-1982, and NM in 1980-
1981.


                                                     18
         We also examine the underlying cause of death for children and distinguish

between internal and external causes of death, which we classify according to the medical

code reported on the death certificate. For the years 1999-2006, the cause of death is

reported according to the Tenth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases

(ICD-10), while the Ninth Revision (ICD-9) is used for the 1980-1998 years. We follow

the definition of external causes of mortality presented under both classifications, and

classify all other causes of death as internal.21

     Table 5 presents the average rates of death for cohorts born prior to September 30,

1983 in our sample by race, age and state group. Mortality is much higher among older

children across all groups with mortality rates for 15-18 year-olds more than twice as

high as those of children of ages 4-7. Although deaths due to internal causes are more

common among older children, it is the frequency of deaths due to external causes that

drives most of the increase in total mortality for this age group. Black children have

higher rates of mortality than white children across all age and state groups. For the most

part, mortality rates are higher in the high eligibility gain states compared to the low

eligibility gain states. This suggests that the largest Medicaid expansions occurred in the

states that had children with poorer baseline health.

         Finally, we examine more narrow classifications of the underlying causes of

death. For internal causes, we code subcategories following the chapter structure of the

ICD-10.22 We code subcategories for external causes following the groupings in a



21
   The ICD-10 and ICD-9 differ in several respects including in the classification structures and rules for
coding of deaths. These changes may result in a slight definitional change between the revisions but the
inclusion of year dummies in our regression specifications should control for this change.
22
   There are 18 chapters of internal causes in the ICD-10. Since deaths falling under a handful of chapters
are extremely rare among children, we chose the 11 chapters with the highest number of deaths in our
sample and grouped the remaining 7 chapters into an “other” category for a total of 12 categories.


                                                     19
tabulation list developed by the National Center for Health Statistics for use with

mortality data classified by ICD-10.23 To aid in constructing comparable measures over

time, we draw on the assignment of ICD-9 codes to the ICD-10 tabulation list presented

in Anderson et al. (2001).24

     Table 6 gives the average rates of death under each subcategory for cohorts born prior

to September 30, 1983 by race and age group. Among all children, the most common

causes of internal death are neoplasms (tumors), diseases of the nervous system (which

include meningitis, epilepsy, and cerebral palsy), cardiovascular diseases, respiratory

diseases, and congenital malformations and chromosomal abnormalities. With the

exception of neoplasms, deaths from these causes are more frequent among black

children than white children. Additionally, infectious and parasitic diseases are also a

major cause of death among black children.

     A common cause of deaths due to external causes is transport-related accidents,

particularly among older children. Accidental drowning and submersion is also a

frequent cause of death. Among older children, deaths due to suicide and homicide are

prevalent with suicide almost twice as likely among white children than black children

and homicide over six times more likely among black children.




23
   We follow the List of 113 Selected Causes of Death (113-cause list) to create our subcategories for
external causes. We have omitted deaths due to “Operations of war and their sequelae” since there were no
deaths in our sample falling under this subcategory.
24
   Anderson et al. (2001) provide detailed information on the classification and rule changes between the
ICD-9 and ICD-10 revisions and construct comparability ratios by case of death. They find substantial
discontinuities in mortality trends resulting from implementing the ICD-10. Again, the inclusion of year
dummies in our regression specification should serve to control for this change.


                                                   20
V. Mortality Results


        Table 7 presents estimates of the effect of the eligibility expansions on rates of

mortality by age and race. Each cell reports the estimated discontinuity for children at the

September 30, 1983 birthdate cutoff, or coefficient  in equation (1), from a regression

for the specified sample. The first set of rows in the table present our estimates for all

children. Our results, and the visual evidence presented in Figures 6 and 7, show no

evidence of an improvement in mortality under the eligibility expansions. In fact, we see

a slight jump in the rate of deaths due to external causes for children at 15-18 years of

age. The coefficient estimates indicate an increase of 0.26 to 0.27 deaths per 10,000

children in the first three specifications, but the effect is not significantly different from

zero in the quadratic spline specification. This increase represents approximately a 5

percent change over the baseline rate of 5.16 external-cause deaths per 10,000 children.

        Next we examine mortality separately for black and white children. Figures 8-10

accompany the estimates presented in the bottom two panels of Table 7 for these groups.

For black children, there is evidence of a decline in mortality at the September 30, 1983

cutoff during the period of extended Medicaid coverage (ages 8 to 14). With a baseline

rate of 3.31 deaths per 10,000, the coefficient estimates for the first three specifications

suggest approximately a 7-8 percent decline in the total mortality rate for black children

at these ages. However, the estimate under the quadratic spline specification is not

statistically significant. The coefficient estimates for internal and external mortality

suggest that declines in deaths due to both types of causes are behind any change in

mortality, although these results are not significant. The visual evidence of a

discontinuity in either measure of mortality for black children ages 8-14 is not obvious.



                                               21
       When we examine the long-term impact of the expansions on black children at

ages 15-18, we find evidence of a substantial decline in deaths due to internal causes. Our

estimates show a 13-20 percent decrease in the internal mortality rate for black children

at these ages. The coefficient estimates indicating a discontinuous fall in mortality are

significantly different from zero in all four specifications. Figure 8 gives strong visual

evidence to support this decline in internal mortality for older black children. With no

evidence of a baseline discontinuity at ages 4 to 7, these findings indicate improvement in

the health of black children under expanded Medicaid eligibility.

       For white children, we find no evidence of improvements in mortality.

Surprisingly, we find some indication of an increase in external mortality beginning at

ages 8-14. Our estimates suggest up to a 5-8 percent increase in external mortality over

the baseline of 1.22 deaths per 10,000 children but are not consistently significant. At

ages 15-18, we find evidence of an increase of approximately 5 percent under the first

three specifications. The estimate under the quadratic spline is smaller and not

statistically significant. The visual evidence is presented in Figure 10. Presumably, this

change for white children is driving the increase in external mortality we saw among all

children of ages 15-18.

       Table 8 provides additional evidence by examining differences in mortality rates

for children born just one year before and after the birthdate cutoff. Again, we find strong

evidence of a decline in internal-cause deaths for black children at ages 15-18. Using a

simple difference-in-difference estimate that compares this change to that experienced by

white children, we estimate a decline of 0.37 deaths per 10,000 black children. This

estimate is within the range of our earlier RD regression results. It is also worth noting




                                             22
that the comparison of the external mortality rate of older white children born before and

after the birthdate cutoff reveals no significant difference. This last finding suggests the

absence of a robust relationship between Medicaid eligibility and white external

mortality.



State Eligibility Groups

           We next examine changes in mortality by state eligibility group.25 The results of

our earlier simulation indicated that children residing in high eligibility gain states on

average received 5 times the number of additional years of coverage of those in low

eligibility gain states. We showed that the high eligibility gain states had less generous

AFDC and Medicaid eligibility rules prior to the expansions and fewer children eligible

for these programs. This meant that a larger share of children stood to gain coverage in

these states under the federally-mandated OBRA90 expansion.

           Table 9 presents the estimation results for children residing in the high eligibility

gain states. Looking at all children, we find no evidence of improvements in internal

mortality and an increase in external mortality among older children. This increase

appears to be driving an increase in the total mortality rate for children residing in these

states. When we examine the results separately by race, we find that evidence of an

increase in external mortality at ages 15-18 is particularly strong for white children,

although there is some suggestion of an increase among black children as well. There

also appears to be some indication of an increase in total mortality for white children at

ages 8-14. Among black children, there is some evidence of decreases in internal and



25
     The RD graphs for each of the state eligibility groups are included in the Appendix.


                                                       23
external mortality at ages 8-14 and a decrease in internal mortality at ages 15-18 but the

estimates are not statistically significant.

        Table 10 presents the estimation results for the low eligibility gain states. There is

no evidence of a change in mortality in either direction for the children residing in these

states. It appears that the increase in external mortality was confined to the high

eligibility gain states only. When we examine the results by race group, there is again

some evidence of an improvement in mortality for black children at ages 8-14 but the

estimates are not statistically significant. There is a modestly significant decline in

internal mortality for black children at ages 15-18. The evidence of any change in

mortality for whites is not strong.

        It is somewhat surprising that we do not see major differences in the mortality

trends across state groups. Specifically, we find no significant evidence that children

residing in the high eligibility gain states saw greater improvements in health. If

anything, our results are more indicative of an improvement in black mortality in the low

eligibility gain states. Furthermore, the increase in external mortality for white teens

appears to be confined to the high eligibility gain states.

        One potential explanation for not finding stronger improvements in health in the

high eligibility gain states is that larger expansions in eligibility do not directly translate

into higher levels of enrollment or improvements in access to medical care for children.

Increases in enrollment require outreach by states and the dissemination of eligibility

information to parents. In addition, larger numbers of new beneficiaries may strain

limited supply-side resources, particularly if physicians opt not to accept Medicaid clients

due to low reimbursement rates or slow payment. Finally, we should emphasize that this




                                               24
source of identification is not sharp and not clearly exogenous like the variation due to

birthdate.



Specific Causes of Death

       Our results indicate changes in the mortality rates of black and white children

born after September 30, 1983 at older ages. We find strong evidence of a 13-20 percent

decrease in the internal mortality rate among black children. We also find some evidence

of a 5 percent increase in the external mortality rate among white children at ages 15-18,

but this increase is not robust to specification choice nor is it apparent in the differences

for children born the year before and after the discontinuity. To better understand the

potential role of expanded Medicaid eligibility in these changes, we study the more

specific underlying causes of death for each racial group using the classification

described earlier.

       Specific cause mortality is often very low, leading to little information being

available in the months that are relied upon by the regression discontinuity method, those

that immediately surrounding the September 1983 cutoff. The paucity of the data

encouraged us to focus on differences in mortality between those born the year before

and after the discontinuity. Comparisons of internal-cause deaths of children born one

year before and after the September 30, 1983 cutoff reveal no significant differences in

the rates of death due to any of these causes among black or white children (see Table

11). There are moderate sized but statistically insignificant declines for black children

spread across many causes. In the aggregate, however, these estimates still support a

large decline in the total number of internal-cause deaths occurring among older black




                                              25
children. Thus, although we provide evidence of a decline in deaths related to disease, we

are unable to definitively say what were the underlying causes for which health insurance

coverage mattered most. This is an important question and area for future work. With

access to Medicaid claims data from this period, researchers might be able to learn more

regarding the nature of health care and services accessed by children benefiting from the

eligibility expansions. This information would provide valuable insight into the role of

public health insurance in preventing child mortality.

       Estimates comparing mortality from external causes for white children born one

year before and after the birthdate cutoff provide no support for a change at the birthdate

cutoff (Table 12). This agrees with our earlier result indicating that the discontinuity in

external mortality is not present among older white children born closest to the cutoff.

The estimates for black children in Table 12 do, however, suggest the presence of

changes in several external causes at the birthdate cutoff at different ages. However,

when compared to similar estimates for white children, they are not statistically

significant. We should also note, as can be seen in Figure 10, that external mortality for

each of the age and race groups has a pronounced trend decline over time. The presence

of such a trend makes the year-to-year differences over time in external mortality less

sensible as a summary measure because they at least partly reflect that trend.



Robustness and Additional Results

       Earlier we show that the decline in internal mortality for black teens born after the

September 30, 1983 cutoff is largely robust to the choice of functional form of the

regression discontinuity specification. In addition, we also test the sensitivity of this




                                              26
result to the use of narrower windows of observations around the birthdate cutoff. When

we restrict the sample to children born within 36 of the cutoff date, the estimated decline

in internal mortality for black teens remains strong under the first three specifications

(Appendix Table 3). In addition, the evidence of an increase in external mortality for

white teens at ages 15-18 is no longer significant, although there remains some evidence

of an increase at ages 8-14. When further limiting the sample to children born within 24

months of the cutoff date, the coefficient estimates mostly indicate a decline in internal

mortality for black teens but they are no longer statistically significant (Appendix Table

4). Surprisingly, there is a significant decline in internal mortality for black children ages

4-7 in most specifications.

       We also expand our analysis to examine the impact of the Medicaid expansions at

older ages to the extent possible. Not enough time has passed for us to observe mortality

for our entire RD sample at early adult ages but we are able to construct simple

differences that compare mortality at ages 19-22 of children born 12 months before and

after the birthdate cutoff. These results do not indicate any change (increase or decrease)

in internal mortality for blacks at these later ages (Appendix Table 5). This result

suggests that the improvement in internal mortality observed at ages 15-18 for black

children is not reversed during the early adult years. Our results for ages 19-22 also

suggest a decline in deaths due to external causes among black children, primarily from a

reduction in accidents (Appendix Table 6). However, a visual examination of the data

suggests that these declines are the result of preexisting trends.




                                              27
VI. Interpreting the Estimates: Comparisons to Past Work and Cost per Life Saved
         In this paper, we our point estimates suggest a 13-20 percent decrease in the

internal mortality rate of older black teens as a result of increased childhood eligibility for

Medicaid. We find no evidence of a similar effect among white children, although the

implied 95 percent confidence intervals for three of our four estimates allow us only to

rule out a decline greater than 3.1 percent over the baseline for white teens. This finding

is supported by previous work examining the Medicaid expansions of 1984-1992. In their

working paper, Currie and Gruber (1995) estimate that an increase in the fraction of

children eligible for Medicaid at the state-level had a much larger impact on mortality for

blacks (more than four times as big) than for whites, although neither estimate is

significantly different from zero and they are not significantly different from each other.26

The authors explain that black children are poorer and more likely to be affected by

Medicaid expansions. In the first stage of our analysis, we estimated that black children

born at the September 30, 1983 cutoff on average gained 2 times the total years of public

health insurance eligibility as white children. Currie and Gruber also provide suggestive

evidence that newly covered black children under the Medicaid expansions used more

health care than their white counterparts.

         Using back-of-the-envelope calculations, we can further interpret the magnitude

of our estimates. In our regression analysis, we estimate a decline in the annual internal

mortality rate of older black children ages 15-18 of between 0.30 deaths and 0.47 deaths

per 10,000 children. Meanwhile, we estimated an average gain in years of eligibility of


26
  Howell, et al. (2010) report testing for whether black and white children were differentially affected by
the public expansions with the use of an interaction term and finding a nonsignificant coefficient. However,
the estimates are not reported in the paper so we are unable to determine if they are small and precisely
estimated or imprecise and potentially large.


                                                    28
0.8 for black children. When we consider the more conservative estimate of a decline of

0.30 deaths among all black teens, it suggests that 0.30 times four (for the four years

between ages 15-18) divided by 0.8 = 1.5 deaths were avoided for each 10,000 black

children made newly Medicaid eligible for a year. Furthermore, with black children

representing approximately 15.6 percent of all children and our calculation of 0.43 years

of eligibility gain on average for all children, our estimates imply an overall decline of

(0.30 x 4 x 0.156) ÷ 0.43 = 0.435 deaths per 10,000 children of all races made eligible.27

         This mortality derivative with respect to eligibility can be compared to that found

by Currie and Gruber (1996a) for children 1-14. They found that 1.277 deaths in a year

were avoided for every 10,000 children of all races made eligible for that year. While our

estimate is somewhat lower than that found by Currie and Gruber, we should emphasize

that their estimate is for children 1-14, while ours is for children ages 15-18. Maybe

more importantly, their estimate is based on variation in eligibility from one year to the

next and is for contemporaneous mortality, while our estimate is for eligibility that likely

lasts for several years and is for mortality during the years following the change in

eligibility.

         To further interpret our results, we estimate the approximate cost to the Medicaid

program of each child life saved. By its nature, this calculation ignores any effects of the

expansions on morbidity or quality of life. To calculate the cost of provision of Medicaid

services for every 10,000 children, we use the 8 percent take-up rate among newly

eligible children under the OBRA90 expansion estimated by Card and Shore-Sheppard

(2004). With the average gain in eligibility of 0.43 years among all children, this rate

27
  We consider only the reduction to black mortality observed at ages 15-18 in our calculation and assume
that the expansions had no effect on mortality at other ages or for other race groups. In 2000, 15.6 percent
of all children in the U.S. were black.


                                                     29
implies an increase in Medicaid coverage of 0.43 x .08 = 0.034 years per child. We

estimate the average cost of Medicaid coverage per child during this time period at

approximately $891 (in 1992 dollars). 28 Thus, the Medicaid program pays $891 x 0.034 x

10,000 = $302,940 for every 10,000 children.

        With our estimate that 0.30 x 4 x 0.156 = 0.187 deaths per 10,000 children were

prevented by the expansions, this implies that it cost $302,940 ÷ 0.187 = $1.62 million

(in 1992 dollars) to save one life. This estimate is extremely similar to the $1.61 million

cost per child life saved calculated by Currie and Gruber (1996) under the Medicaid

expansions in 1984-1992. Both estimates are much lower than the Environmental

Protection Agency statistical value of life of $7.9 million (1996 dollars).

        These calculations rely on the large decline in black internal mortality observed at

ages 15-18. Once we take into consideration the potentially low takeup rate of Medicaid

coverage, the plausibility of our estimates requires that pre-OBRA internal-cause deaths

among black children be highly concentrated among those groups gaining coverage.

Using information on deaths for children ages 15-18 prior to the expansions available in

the 1993 National Mortality Followback Study, we estimate that 64 percent of the deaths

occurring among black children at these ages were to decedents with household incomes

below the poverty line. Combining this estimate with our measured 13-20 percent decline

in internal mortality among blacks under the expansions, this implies a 20-31 percent (13-

20 divided by 0.64) decline in the internal mortality rate for poor blacks.29 This is not

implausible given that our first stage estimates indicate that 31 percent of poor black

29
   This assumes that the share of internal-cause deaths for black children aged 15-18 with incomes under
poverty is similar to the share for all deaths.

children at the birthdate cutoff gained eligibility under the expansions. Furthermore, it is

reasonable to hypothesize that the children who do takeup Medicaid coverage are most in

need of medical care. In their study of takeup and the utilization of health care under

OBRA90, Card and Shore-Sheppard (2004) estimate that children with new Medicaid

coverage are 60 percent more likely to have an annual doctor visit. It is worth also noting

that even if the typical newly eligible child is not enrolled in Medicaid, upon

commencing any costly hospital or physician care it is likely that an eligible child would

be enrolled.




VII. Conclusions


       This paper provides new evidence on the mortality effects of expansions in public

health insurance eligibility for children in the mid 1980s to early 1990s. Our

identification strategy exploits a unique feature of several early Medicaid expansions that

extended eligibility only to children born after September 30, 1983. This feature led to a

large cumulative difference in public health insurance eligibility for children born on

either side of this birthdate cutoff. Children in families with incomes at or just below the

poverty line gained close to five additional years of eligibility if they were born in

October 1983 rather than just one month before. Black children were more likely to be

affected by the Medicaid expansions and gained twice the years of eligibility on average

as white children at this birthdate cutoff. The average gain in eligibility also varied by

state of residence due to differences in state Medicaid eligibility rules prior to and during

the expansions, as well as differences in the demographic characteristics of state

residents.


                                             31
       Using a regression discontinuity design, we examine the impact of public health

insurance eligibility during childhood on mortality by comparing outcomes for cohorts of

children born just before and after the September 30, 1983 cutoff. The discontinuity in

public health insurance eligibility under the expansions occurred between the ages of 8

and 14. We measure mortality outcomes for this period as well as through age 18 to

gauge any longer-term impacts. We also examine differential effects of the expansions by

the race and state of residence of the child.

       The results provide strong evidence of an improvement in mortality for black

children under the Medicaid expansions. Although there is some evidence of a decline in

mortality rates during the period of coverage (ages 8-14), we find a substantial decline in

the later life mortality of black children at ages 15-18. The regression estimates indicate a

13-20 percent decrease in the internal mortality rate of black teens born after September

30, 1983. Because deaths due to internal causes are more likely to be influenced by

access to medical care, this result supports an improvement in the underlying health of

black children under the eligibility expansions. Early evidence indicates that this gain in

health is not reversed during the early adult years. We find no evidence of an

improvement in the mortality of white children under the expansions. Furthermore, we

are unable to detect mortality improvements among children residing in those states with

the largest gains in public health insurance eligibility under the expansions.

       The effectiveness of public health insurance in the long-term improvement of the

health of children has important policy implications. Despite drastic expansions in public

health insurance over the last thirty years, the evidence connecting this expanded

coverage to improved child health remains hard to come by. However, the payoffs from




                                                32
health insurance coverage during childhood might not be fully evident until later in life.

A major focus of pediatric care is prevention and the early diagnosis and treatment of

health conditions. Without considering the long-term effects of these types of

interventions, we may be missing an important component of program benefits. Even in

our study, one limitation is that not enough time has passed to look at longer-term adult

outcomes for the cohorts of children affected by the change in Medicaid policy. With

time (and further study), we may be able to evaluate both the persistence of the mortality

improvements for black children and whether there are additional gains to childhood

coverage.

Notes: Weighted average calculated using the characteristics and state of residence of a sample of children of
ages 0-17 in the 1981-1988 March CPS. See text for more information. Family income is indexed using the
CPI-U and assumed to be constant over the child's lifetime. For each race category, states are classified as
having a high eligibility gain by first ranking state-level estimates of the difference in years of eligibility for
a child of that race born in October versus September 1983 and then selecting the number of states with the
largest average gain in eligibility that comprises 50% of the national population of children of that race. See
Appendix Table 2 for the ranking of states by eligibility gain for all children.

Notes: Mortality rates for each age group are calculated as the sum of the total number of
deaths divided by the sum of the population at risk for those ages. Counts of deaths are from
the NVSS Multiple Cause of Death files for the years 1980-2007. The population at risk for
each age is calculated as the population at birth minus the number of deaths for all preceding
ages. Population counts at birth are from the NVSS Birth Data files for the years 1980-2007.
Standard errors are calculated based on the binomial distribution, *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, *
p<0.1.

Notes: Mortality rates for each age group are calculated as the sum of the total number of deaths divided by the sum of the population at risk for those ages. Counts of death are from the
National Vital Statistics System Multiple Cause of Death files for the years 1980 to 2007. The population at risk for each age is calculated as the population at birth minus the number of deaths
for all preceding ages. Population counts at birth are from the NVSS Birth Date files for the years 1980 to 2007. Standard errors are calculated based on the binomial distribution, *** p<0.01,

Notes: Mortality rates for each age group are calculated as the sum of the total number of deaths divided by the sum of the population at risk for those ages. Counts of death are from the
National Vital Statistics System Multiple Cause of Death files for the years 1980 to 2007. The population at risk for each age is calculated as the population at birth minus the number of deaths
for all preceding ages. Population counts at birth are from the NVSS Birth Date files for the years 1980 to 2007. Standard errors are calculated based on the binomial distribution, *** p<0.01,
** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

Mortality rates by cohort (per 10,000 children) were constructed using Multiple Cause of Death Data files for the years 1980−
2006 and Birth Data files for 1980−1987. Points represent means of the age−specific mortality rates for each birth cohort,
as described in the text. The lines are fitted values from a regression that includes a quadratic in birth cohort
and a dummy variable for children born after September 30, 1983.

Mortality rates by cohort (per 10,000 children) were constructed using Multiple Cause of Death Data files for the years 1980−
2006 and Birth Data files for 1980−1987. Points represent means of the age−specific mortality rates for each birth cohort,
as described in the text. The lines are fitted values from a regression that includes a quadratic in birth cohort
and a dummy variable for children born after September 30, 1983.

Mortality rates by cohort (per 10,000 children) were constructed using Multiple Cause of Death Data files for the years 1980−
2006 and Birth Data files for 1980−1987. Points represent means of the age−specific mortality rates for each birth cohort,
as described in the text. The lines are fitted values from a regression that includes a quadratic in birth cohort
and a dummy variable for children born after September 30, 1983.

Mortality rates by cohort (per 10,000 children) were constructed using Multiple Cause of Death Data files for the years 1980−
2006 and Birth Data files for 1980−1987. Points represent means of the age−specific mortality rates for each birth cohort,
as described in the text. The lines are fitted values from a regression that includes a quadratic in birth cohort
and a dummy variable for children born after September 30, 1983.

2006 and Birth Data files for 1980−1987. Points represent means of the age−specific mortality rates for each birth cohort,
as described in the text. The lines are fitted values from a regression that includes a quadratic in birth cohort
and a dummy variable for children born after September 30, 1983.

Notes: Weighted average calculated using the characteristics and state of residence of a sample of
children of ages 0−17 in the 1981−1988 March CPS. See text for more information. Family income is
indexed using the CPI−U and assumed to be constant over the child's lifetime. Coverage under
federally mandated rules is considered to supplant coverage under state optional rules or programs.
Differences in years of eligibility under AFDC- and poverty-related expansions may not always equal
total difference in years of childhood eligibility since optional state expansions under SCHIP are not
included in the table.

Notes: For each race category, states are classified as having a high eligibility gain by first
ranking state-level estimates of the difference in years of eligibility for a child of that race
born in October versus September 1983 and then selecting the number of states with the
largest average gain in eligibility that comprises 50% of the national population of children of
that race.

Notes: Mortality rates for each age group are calculated as the sum of the total number of deaths divided by the sum of the population at risk for those ages. Counts
of death are from the National Vital Statistics System Multiple Cause of Death files for the years 1980 to 2007. The population at risk for each age is calculated as
the population at birth minus the number of deaths for all preceding ages. Population counts at birth are from the NVSS Birth Date files for the years 1980 to 2007.
Standard errors are calculated based on the binomial distribution, asterisks on differences indicate *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

Notes: Mortality rates for each age group are calculated as the sum of the total number of deaths divided by the sum of the population at risk for those ages. Counts
of death are from the National Vital Statistics System Multiple Cause of Death files for the years 1980 to 2007. The population at risk for each age is calculated as
the population at birth minus the number of deaths for all preceding ages. Population counts at birth are from the NVSS Birth Date files for the years 1980 to 2007.
Standard errors are calculated based on the binomial distribution, asterisks on differences indicate *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

Mortality rates by cohort (per 10,000 children) were constructed using Multiple Cause of Death Data files for the years 1980−
2006 and Birth Data files for 1980−1987. Points represent means of the age−specific mortality rates for each birth cohort,
as described in the text. The lines are fitted values from a regression that includes a quadratic in birth cohort
and a dummy variable for children born after September 30, 1983.

Mortality rates by cohort (per 10,000 children) were constructed using Multiple Cause of Death Data files for the years 1980−
2006 and Birth Data files for 1980−1987. Points represent means of the age−specific mortality rates for each birth cohort,
as described in the text. The lines are fitted values from a regression that includes a quadratic in birth cohort
and a dummy variable for children born after September 30, 1983.

Mortality rates by cohort (per 10,000 children) were constructed using Multiple Cause of Death Data files for the years 1980−
2006 and Birth Data files for 1980−1987. Points represent means of the age−specific mortality rates for each birth cohort,
as described in the text. The lines are fitted values from a regression that includes a quadratic in birth cohort
and a dummy variable for children born after September 30, 1983.

 Mortality rates by cohort (per 10,000 children) were constructed using Multiple Cause of Death Data files for the years 1980−
 2006 and Birth Data files for 1980−1987. Points represent means of the age−specific mortality rates for each birth cohort,
 as described in the text. The lines are fitted values from a regression that includes a quadratic in birth cohort
 and a dummy variable for children born after September 30, 1983.

 Mortality rates by cohort (per 10,000 children) were constructed using Multiple Cause of Death Data files for the years 1980−
 2006 and Birth Data files for 1980−1987. Points represent means of the age−specific mortality rates for each birth cohort,
 as described in the text. The lines are fitted values from a regression that includes a quadratic in birth cohort
 and a dummy variable for children born after September 30, 1983.

 Mortality rates by cohort (per 10,000 children) were constructed using Multiple Cause of Death Data files for the years 1980−
 2006 and Birth Data files for 1980−1987. Points represent means of the age−specific mortality rates for each birth cohort,
 as described in the text. The lines are fitted values from a regression that includes a quadratic in birth cohort
 and a dummy variable for children born after September 30, 1983.

 Mortality rates by cohort (per 10,000 children) were constructed using Multiple Cause of Death Data files for the years 1980−
 2006 and Birth Data files for 1980−1987. Points represent means of the age−specific mortality rates for each birth cohort,
 as described in the text. The lines are fitted values from a regression that includes a quadratic in birth cohort
 and a dummy variable for children born after September 30, 1983.
