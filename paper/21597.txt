We study the relationship between ethnicity, occupational choice, and entrepreneurship.
Immigrant groups in the United States cluster in specific business sectors. For example, Koreans
are 34 times more concentrated in self employment for dry cleaning than other immigrant groups,
and Gujarati-speaking Indians are 108 times more concentrated in managing motels. We quantify
that smaller and more socially isolated ethnic groups display higher rates of entrepreneurial
concentration. This is consistent with a model of social interactions where non-work relationships
facilitate the acquisition of sector-specific skills and result in occupational stratification along
ethnic lines via concentrated entrepreneurship.

1     Introduction

Immigrants engage in self-employment and entrepreneurship more than natives, espe-

cially among new arrivals. Using the 2007-2011 Current Population Surveys, Fairlie

and Lofstrom (2013) calculate that immigrants represent 25% of new US business own-

ers compared to their 15% workforce share. Moreover, immigrant business owners tend

to specialize in a few industries, and these industries vary across ethnic groups. Promi-

nent US examples include Korean dry cleaners, Vietnamese nail care salons, Yemeni

grocery stores, and Punjabi Indian convenience stores. Earlier ethnic specializations

included Jewish merchants in medieval Europe and Chinese launderers in early twen-

tieth century California. Despite the importance of these patterns economically— for

example, The Economist reported that one-third of all US motels in 2016 were owned

by Gujarati Indians— few studies examine the origin or consequences of this ethnic

specialization for self-employment.

    We focus on how small ethnic group size and isolated social interactions among

group members can yield entrepreneurial specialization. We develop a simple model

that considers a small industry where self-employed entrepreneurs bene…t from social

interactions outside of work (e.g., family gatherings, religious and cultural functions,

meetings with friends). At these social events, self-employed entrepreneurs can discuss

customer trends, share best practices, coordinate activities, and so on. The model

describes how a small ethnic minority group that has restricted social interactions can

have a comparative advantage for self-employment, similar to the account of Chung

and Kalnins (2006) for better resource access through ethnic networks in the case of

Gujarati hotel owners.

    We analyze the model’s predictions using Census Bureau data for the United States



                                           2
in 2000. The size of groups and their social isolation, which we measure using in-

marriage rates, strongly predict industrial concentration for immigrant self-employed

entrepreneurs. A 10% decline in group size raises the group’s industry concentration for

self-employment by 6%, and a 10% increase in group isolation boosts concentration by

5%. These results are robust under many speci…cation variants and using instrument

variable techniques outlined below.

   We focus on ethnic group size and social isolation due to the exceptionally broad

and pervasive nature of immigrant concentration for self-employment. While the par-

ticulars vary across ethnic groups, time periods and national settings, we consistently

observe self-employed specialization among immigrant groups. Thus, we seek a general

mechanism that does not revolve around the traits of any single ethnic group or setting,

and our empirical analysis includes as many immigrant groups in the United States as

possible. Understanding how group-level behavior can generate group-level di¤erences

is important, as we know that the higher immigrant propensity towards entrepreneur-

ship remains after controlling for the observable traits of individuals. Moreover, group

size and group social isolation manifest in many ways in the literature: risk sharing,

provision of support and mentoring, sanctions for misbehavior, etc. These factors be-

come more powerful for smaller, tighter ethnic groups. Group in‡uences could also

lead to behavioral factors prompting self employment (e.g., Åstebro et al., 2014).

   While there are anecdotal and sociological accounts of how social interactions can

connect to entrepreneurial activity (e.g., Fairlie and Robb, 2007), the re‡ection problem

described by Manski (2003) makes identi…cation of social interaction e¤ects challeng-

ing. Econometric challenges like omitted factors and reverse causality also exist. We

consider two instrument variable speci…cations to address this issue. One approach

uses the 1980 group sizes and in-marriage rates in the United States. Our second ap-

                                           3
proach instruments US ethnic group size with the predictions from a gravity model

for migration to the United States and instruments US in-marriage rates with those

observed for the same ethnic group in the United Kingdom. These estimations, along

with many robustness checks, con…rm the OLS results.

       Our work connects to prior studies of immigrant entrepreneurship and self-employment

behavior1 but with a focus on industrial specialization across groups. Classic accounts

of entrepreneurship focus on factors like risk taking (Kihlstrom and La¤ont, 1979),

business acumen (Lucas, 1978) or skill mix (Lazear, 2005), with the connection of en-

trepreneurship to migration being frequently noted but unexplained. We emphasize

how social interactions can generate group-level e¤ects around entrepreneurship and

industry choice that go beyond the individual traits. We also relate to literatures

regarding minority and immigrant group occupational specialization.2 Our setting

resembles but di¤ers substantially from the standard theory of discrimination, as we

analyze environments when groups are economically integrated but culturally isolated.3

These important di¤erences shape whether minority group isolation provides a com-

parative advantage for self-employment. We also relate to literature on the importance

of social interactions for economic behavior within or outside of the workplace.4

Christians and Jews in Renaissance Europe. Following a negotiation over a large loan to a Christian
man who has always scorned him, the Jewish moneylender Shylock comments: "I will buy with you,

2     A Model of Entrepreneurial Clustering
2.1    Model Set-Up

We construct a simple model to illustrate how social isolation and small group size

can generate ethnic entrepreneurial clustering when social interactions and production

are complementary. To keep the model tractable and intuitive, we make several strong

assumptions. Everyone has equal ability and is divided into two ethnic groups. Group

A is the minority, with a continuum of individuals of mass NA , and group B has mass

NB > NA . Both groups have equal access to industries and there is no product market

discrimination, but the groups are socially segregated and spend their leisure time

separately. Social interactions are random within ethnic groups, such that each person

interacts with a representative sample of individuals in their own group.

    We analyze how these two ethnic groups sort across two industries. Industry 1 has

a production structure where self-employed entrepreneurs obtain advantages through

social interactions with other self-employed entrepreneurs in the same industry. When

socializing during family gatherings and religious/cultural functions, entrepreneurs in

this industry can mentor each other and exchange industry knowledge and profes-

sional advice. The more an entrepreneur socializes with other entrepreneurs, the more

knowledge is exchanged. Industry 0, by contrast, exhibits constant returns to scale

with worker productivity normalized to one. This industry can be equally comprised

of individuals working in self-employment or in larger …rms; the core assumption is

that private social interactions do not have the same bene…t in industry 0 as they do

in industry 1.

    More formally, de…ne Xl for l 2 fA; Bg as the fraction of the population in group l
Scheinkman (2002). Durlauf and Fafchamps (2006) and Durlauf and Ioannides (2010) provide broad
reviews.


                                              5
who are self-employed entrepreneurs in industry 1. Since social interaction is random

within groups, a fraction Xl of the friends and family members of every individual

in group l are also self-employed entrepreneurs in industry 1. For industry 1, denote

individual entrepreneurial productivity in group l as (Xl ) : Our assumption that pro-

ductivity increases when socializing with other entrepreneurs in industry 1 is formally

stated as:

Assumption 1a Entrepreneurial productivity in industry 1 increases in
                  0
specialization:       > 0.

   Denote aggregate output of industry 1 as Q1 , which is a function of the distribution

(XA ; XB ):

                        Q1 (XA ; XB ) = XA NA (XA ) + XB NB (XB ) :                      (1)

Since social interaction plays no role for industry 0, its aggregate output is simply:

                         Q0 (XA ; XB ) = (1   XA ) NA + (1         X B ) NB :            (2)

Demand for the two industries need to be complementary enough to avoid the compli-

cations of multiple optima possibly generated by non-convexities. We simply assume

them to be perfect complements via a Leontief utility function for consumers:

                                                            q1
                                  U (q0 ; q1 ) = min q0 ;      ;                         (3)
                                                            v

where v > 0 is a preference parameter and q0 and q1 are individual consumption of

each industry’s output, respectively.


2.2    The Pareto Problem

We now describe the e¢ cient outcome. Since the outputs of both industries have uni-

tary income elasticities, distributional aspects can be ignored when characterizing the

                                               6
e¢ cient outcome. The problem simpli…es to choosing an industry distribution (XA ; XB )

that maximizes a representative utility function U (Q0 (XA ; XB ) ; Q1 (XA ; XB )). A mar-

ginal analysis is inappropriate since this is a non-convex optimization problem. We

consider instead the most specialized industry distributions, where as many individu-

als as possible from a single group A or B are self-employed entrepreneurs in industry

1.

     Figure 1 depicts the production possibilities for the two specialized distributions.

De…ne V (XA ; XB )      Q1 =Q0 as the ratio of industry outputs under the distribution

(XA ; XB ). Along the curve with the kink V (1; 0) in the …gure, group A specializes as

self-employed entrepreneurs in industry 1. Starting from a position on the far right

where everyone works in industry 0, members of group A are added to the set of self-

employed entrepreneurs in industry 1 as we move leftward along the x-axis. When the

kink at V (1; 0) is reached, all members of group A are self-employed entrepreneurs

in industry 1. Thereafter, continuing leftward, members of group B are also added

to industry 1 until Q0 = 0. Similarly, along the curve with the kink V (0; 1), group

B …rst specializes as self-employed entrepreneurs in industry 1. Members of group B

are added moving leftward along the x-axis until the kink at V (0; 1), where all Bs are

working in industry 1. Thereafter members of group A are also added until Q0 = 0.

     The curve with minority specialization is above the curve with majority specializa-

tion, so long as the need for self-employed entrepreneurs in industry 1 is su¢ ciently

small. A large fraction of As are self-employed entrepreneurs in industry 1 when the

minority specializes, allowing minority entrepreneurs to socialize mostly with other

entrepreneurs in industry 1, improving productivity. The same is not true for the ma-

jority, since even if a large fraction of self-employed entrepreneurs in industry 1 are Bs,

most Bs are nevertheless employed in industry 0.

                                            7
   The argument can be generalized to show that minority specialization is Pareto

e¢ cient so long as industry 1 is small enough. Perfect complementarity simpli…es the

problem of solving for the optimal allocation, since any bundle where industrial outputs

are in the exact ratio v of the Leontief preferences (3) is strictly preferable to all other

bundles that do not include at least as much of each industry. The Pareto optimal

distribution (XA ; XB ) must therefore satisfy v = V (XA ; XB ). De…ne the total number

of entrepreneurs in the population as M       XA NA + XB NB . It follows that:

Proposition 1 If v       V (1; 0), all self-employed entrepreneurs in industry 1 belong

to minority group A.

Proof: Take the distribution (XA ; 0) where XA is such that v = V (XA ; 0). This is

feasible since v   V (1; 0). Assume by contradiction that it is not the uniquely e¢ cient

distribution. Then there exists an alternative distribution (XA0 ; XB0 ) with Q01        Q1

and Q00     Q0 . Given Q00     Q0 , it follows that M 0     M , or equivalently, XA0 NA +

XB0 NB    XA NA , which implies XA0      XA and XB0 < XA , with XA0 < XA if XB0 = 0.

Manipulating the expression for Q01 :

                   Q01 = (M 0      XB0 NB ) (XA0 ) + XB0 NB (XB0 )

                        < (M      XB0 NB ) (XA ) + XB0 NB (XA ) = Q1

This contradicts Q01    Q1 .

   The e¢ cient outcome requires that a single group specializes as self-employed en-

trepreneurs in industry 1, and importantly, which group specializes is not arbitrary.

Minority specialization is more e¢ cient since the minority’s social isolation enables

entrepreneurs in A to socialize mostly with other entrepreneurs in their small isolated

group. For v       V (1; 0), the transformation curve and the curve with minority spe-

cialization in Figure 1 coincide. Group A has absolute and comparative advantages as

                                             8
self-employed entrepreneurs in industry 1: If the demand for industry 1 is su¢ ciently

great, however, then the minority is too small to satisfy demand by themselves. In the

special case when v = V (0; 1), the demand for industry 1 is great enough for group B

to specialize completely. In this case minority involvement would dilute the majority’s

productivity advantage, and the Pareto e¢ cient solution is for Bs to specialize in being

self-employed entrepreneurs in industry 1.


Corollary If v = V (0; 1), all self-employed entrepreneurs in industry 1 belong to the

majority, B.


   Thus, the relationship between group size and productivity is not monotonic, and

the group with the absolute advantage is the group with a population size that most

closely adheres to the size of industry 1. Other production possibilities generated by

more unspecialized distributions, such as XA = XB , are not displayed in Figure 1.

Our online theoretical appendix proves that a convex production function in social
                 00
interactions (        > 0) is su¢ cient to ensure that at least one group specializes, in

which case the e¢ cient frontier is the outer envelope of the curves shown in Figure

1. Consequently, above a certain value of v, there is a discrete jump from minority

specialization to majority specialization.


2.3    Model Discussion

This simple model provides a stark economic environment for considering how isolated

social interactions impact the sorting of ethnic groups over industries. While our model

considers only two industries, this simpli…cation is not as limiting as it may …rst appear.

The model captures a setting where a small industry of self-employed entrepreneurs

can bene…t through non-work interactions. Allowing the baseline industry 0 to be an


                                              9
aggregate of many constant-returns-to-scale industries would still lead to the e¢ cient

solution being for the small ethnic group to specialize in being the self-employed en-

trepreneurs if their group size matches the demand preferences for industry 1: In fact,

framed this way, the baseline industry 0 would be expected to be quite large to any

one industry, making it more likely that the minority group should specialize.

   Another obvious simpli…cation is that we only have two ethnic groups, whereas

the world is much more diverse. Yet, a complex model allowing for several small

industries and also several minority ethnic groups would lead to the same conclusions.

For example, consider an economy with industries 1a and 1b that have equal demand

and display the same productivity bene…t for social interaction. Also allow there to

be two minority groups of equal size. If the demands for industries 1a and 1b are

su¢ ciently small, then the e¢ cient outcome is for one minority group to specialize in

being self-employed entrepreneurs in 1a, and for the other minority group to specialize

in 1b. Which minority group specializes in which sector is arbitrary. In this multi-sector

economy with sector-speci…c skills, otherwise-similar groups consequently specialize in

di¤erent business sectors. Pushing further, if the economy has several small industries

of varying sizes that bene…t from these social interactions, and multiple minority ethnic

groups, the e¢ cient outcome will be characterized by minority groups specializing in

speci…c self-employment industries as much as possible.

   Our online theoretical appendix also provides several formal extensions to the

model: analysis of competitive market outcomes; occupational strati…cation and the

dynamics of group specialization; endogenous social interactions and marriage mar-

kets; and the potential formation of splinter groups. These extensions reinforce the

core insight that a small and socially isolated group can have advantages for industry

specialization towards self-employment.

                                           10
        An additional extension in the appendix considers individual heterogeneity in ability

and earnings and predicts that members of an ethnic group can achieve greater earnings

when entering a common self-employed industrial specialization. This is important for

distinguishing this choice to specialize from discrimination against minority groups.

The empirical work of Patel and Vella (2013) show a positive earning relationship for

immigrant groups and common group occupational choices, and we note below some

complementary evidence from our own data.5


3         Analysis of US Entrepreneurial Strati…cation
3.1        US Census of Populations Data

We analyze the 2000 Census of Populations using the Integrated Public Use Microdata

Series (IPUMS). We focus on the 5% state-level sample, and we use person weights to

create population-level estimates. We also use the 1980 5% sample to construct one set

of instruments, while a second set of instruments uses 1991 information on the United

Kingdom from IPUMS-International.

        We de…ne ethnic groups using birthplace locations and, to a lesser extent, lan-

guage spoken. We merge some related birthplace locations (e.g., combining England,

Scotland, Wales, and non-speci…c U.K. designations into a single group). We also uti-

lize the detailed language variable to create sub-groups among some larger birthplaces

(e.g., separating Gujarati and Punjabi Indians into separate groups). Our preparation

develops 146 potential ethnic groups from 198 birthplace locations, although most of

our empirical work focuses on 77 larger ethnic groups that have at least one industry

with ten or more IPUMS observations (equivalent to about 200 workers in the industry
    5
     The favorable economic outcome does not necessarily carry over to utility. Related work includes
Chiswick (1978), Borjas (1987), Simon and Warner (1992), Rauch (2001), Mandor¤ (2007), Bayer et
al. (2008), Beaman (2012), and Cadena et al. (2015).


                                                 11
nationally).

       We assign industry classi…cation and self-employment status through the industry

and class-of-work variables. IPUMS uses a three-digit industry classi…cation to cate-

gorize work setting and economic sector of employment. Industry is distinct from an

individual’s technical function or occupation, and those operating in multiple indus-

tries are assigned to the industry of greatest income or amount of time spent. We

utilize the 1990 IPUMS industry delineations for temporal consistency. The class-of-

work variable identi…es self-employed and wage workers6 , and we de…ne a "cluster" as

an {industry, class of work} pairing. For example, a self-employed hotelier is classi…ed

di¤erently than a wage earner in the hotel industry. The sample excludes those whose

self-employment status is unknown and industries without self-employment.7

       We retain males between 30 and 65 years old who are living in metropolitan sta-

tistical areas. We further require that immigrants to have migrated between 1968 and

1990 and to have 20 years of age or older at entry. The start year of 1968 re‡ects

the Immigration Reform Act of 1965, and the …nal entry of 1990 was chosen to avoid

issues related to migration for temporary employment (which is employer-sponsored in

America). Our …nal sample contains 1,604,350 observations, representing 34,984,436

people. Of these, 143,327 observations, representing 3,141,080 people, are immigrants.
   6
      In the IPUMS data, self-employment is assigned when it is the main activity of an individual (e.g.,
not capturing academics who consulting part-time). The de…nition includes both owners of employer
…rms and sole proprietors.
    7
      Our …nal sample includes 200 industries. We are cautious to not rely on very aggressive de…nitions
of industry boundaries, even if this leads us to underestimate some concentration. For example, Greek
restaurateurs will sort into Greek restaurants and Chinese restaurateurs into Chinese restaurants,
independent of social relationships, but we consider the restaurant industry as a whole to avoid taste-
based factors. Similarly, we look at industries on a national basis, even though additional clustering
happening at localized levels for some industries (e.g., taxi cabs). We use this uniform approach to be
consistent over industries, versus for example de…ning the motel industry in a di¤erent way from taxi
cabs, and because ethnic connections can provide long-distance knowledge access (e.g., Rauch, 2001;
Agrawal et al., 2008).



                                                   12
3.2       Clustering in Entrepreneurial Activities

We design "overage" ratios to quantify for an ethnic group the heightened rate of self-

employment it displays for a particular industry and also across the full range of in-

dustries. Our primary metrics focus on the specialization evident among self-employed

individuals only, while robustness checks build samples combining wage earners and

self-employed.8

       We …rst de…ne OV ERlk as the ratio of an ethnic group l’s concentration in an

industry k to the industry k’s national employment share. Thus, if an ethnic group l

has Nl total workers and Nlk workers in industry k, then Xlk = Nlk =Nl and OV ERlk =

Xlk =X k . This baseline metric measures the over- or under-representation of the ethnic

group for a speci…c industry, and by de…nition both cases exist for an ethnic group

across the full range of industries.

       To aggregate these industry-level values into an overall measure of industry con-

centration for an ethnic group, our primary metric takes a weighted average using the

share of the group’s self-employment by industry as the weight:

                                                X
                                                K
                                  OV ER1l =           OV ERlk Xlk :                               (4)
                                                k=1

Our estimations ultimately use the log value of this OV ER1 metric. We also test the

following variants:


   1. Weighted average over the three largest industries for ethnic group l: OV ER2l =
      P3               k0
                          P3       k0           0
                                                                P3       k0

       k =1 OV ER lk 0X =

                            k =1 X l  , where k   = k such that   k0 =1 Nl is maximized.
   8
    It may seem appealing to use wage earners instead as a counterfactual to self-employed workers.
This approach is not useful, however, as ethnic entrepreneurs show a greater tendency to hire members
of their own ethnic groups into their …rms (e.g., Andersson et al., 2014a,b; Åslund et al., 2014; Kerr
et al., 2015).




                                                 13
   2. Weighted average over the three largest industry-level overages for ethnic group l:
                 P                  0 P                                    P

        is maximized.

   3. Maximum overage: OV ER4l = maxl [OV ERlk ]:


    These calculations measure extreme values, and we need to be careful about small

sample size. Our earlier requirement that ethnicities have at least one industry with

ten or more IPUMS observations avoids spurious clusters that could appear in small

ethnic groups and obscure industries due to very small sample size or small population

size.

    We investigate our entrepreneurial concentration hypotheses over the 77 primary

ethnic groups. OV ER1l takes the weighted sum across industries, while OV ER2l con-

siders the three largest industries for an ethnic group. In most cases, OV ER2l is bigger

than OV ER1l as concentration is often linked to substantial numerical representation;

some exceptions happen when an ethnic group is focused on bigger industries. We cal-

culate our metrics of extreme values, captured in OV ER3l and OV ER4l , over ethnic

group-industry clusters where we have at least ten observations.

    Figure 2 displays the 16 ethnic groups with the highest OV ER1l metric. There is

substantial entrepreneurial clustering, with Yemeni immigrants displaying the overall

highest industrial concentration for entrepreneurship. Appendix Tables 1a and 1b give

a detailed list of overage ratios for each ethnic group and the industries with the largest

overage ratio. In most cases, the industry where the ethnic group displays the highest

concentration for self-employment is the same as the industry where the ethnic group

shows the highest concentration for total employment. Appendix Tables 2a and 2b

document the strong correlations between the four overage metrics.


                                            14
3.3       Social Isolation and In-Marriage Rates

We measure social isolation and concentrated group interactions through within-group

marriage rates evident among ethnicities. This metric is a strong proxy if sorting in

the marriage market is similar to sorting in other social relationships.9 High marriage

rates within an ethnic group, also termed in-marriage, suggest greater social isolation

and strati…cation.

       We calculate in-marriage rates for ethnicities using a second dataset developed

from IPUMS. We focus on women and men who immigrated to the United States

between the ages of 5 and 15 and who are between ages 30 and 65 in 2000, and exclude

individuals already married at the time of immigration. Importantly, this sample is

mutually exclusive from the earlier sample used to calculate our overage metrics.

       Most immigrant groups are socially segregated with respect to marriage, some very

strongly so. With random matching for marriage and equal male and female migration,

in-marriage rates would roughly equal a group’s fraction of the overall population.

Group in-marriage rates (also shown in Appendix Table 1a) are typically much higher,

almost always exceeding 50%. Pairwise correlations of 0.51 and 0.60 exist for in-

marriage rates and the OV ER1l and OV ER2l metrics, respectively.


3.4       OLS Empirical Tests

To quantify whether smaller and more-socially isolated ethnic groups have greater

industrial concentration for entrepreneurship, we use the following regression approach:


                        OV ER1l =        +   1 SIZEl   +   2 ISOLl   + "l ;                    (5)
   9
    Representative work includes Kennedy (1944), Bisin and Verdier (2000), and Bisin et al. (2004).
Furtado (2010) shows how inter-marriage can provide better access to the formal labor market, and
Furtado and Theodoropoulos (2011) consider shifts in likelihood of inter-marriage by when someone
migrates to the US. Furtado and Trejo (2013) provide an extended review.


                                                15
where SIZEl is the negative of the log value of group size and ISOLl is the log in-

marriage rate of the group. We take the negative of group size so that our theoretical

prediction is that     1   and   2   are positive. We report all coe¢ cients in unit standard

deviation terms for ease of interpretation. Our baseline regressions winsorize variables

at their 10% and 90% levels to guard against outliers, weight estimations by log ethnic

employment for each group, and report robust standard errors.

       Column 1 of Table 1 measures that a one standard-deviation decrease in group size

is correlated with a 0.63 increase in average entrepreneurial concentration across all

industries. Similarly, a one standard-deviation increase in the in-marriage rate is cor-

related with a 0.52 standard-deviation increase in overage. The next columns consider

robustness checks on our metric design. Column 2 uses the full worker sample, Column

3 calculates overages only relative to immigrant populations by excluding natives from

the denominator shares, and Column 4 adds rural workers into the self-employment

overage calculations.10 The results are very robust to these adjustments. Column 5

shows that a focus on the three largest industries for an ethnic group (i.e., OV ER2l

discussed above) increases the relative importance of social isolation for predicting

overages. Columns 6 and 7 examine extreme values using the OV ER3l and OV ER4l

metrics de…ned above. These extreme values show a weaker connection to group size,

placing even more prominence on group isolation.11

       Table 2 shows additional robustness checks on the OV ER1l outcomes. Columns 2

and 3 drop sample weights and winsorization steps, respectively, Column 4 introduces

…xed e¤ects for each origin continent, Column 5 uses a median regression format, and
  10
     Faggio and Silva (2014) analyze di¤erences in self-employment alignment to entrepreneurship in
urban and rural areas.
  11
     We obtain similar results when modifying of our overage measures with industry-level propensities
for being an employer …rm vis-à-vis sole proprietors using data from the Survey of Business Owners.




                                                 16
Column 6 bootstraps standard errors. These last two columns should be compared to

Column 2 given their unweighted nature.

   Columns 7 and 8 test whether smaller sample sizes for ethnic groups mechanically

create concentration ratios, using Monte Carlo simulations. In one version, used for

Column 7, we draw industry and self-employment status independently from each

other, which means that we tend to predict the same self-employment rates across

industries. In a second version used in Column 8, we jointly draw the two components

such that we mimic the industry-by-industry entrepreneurship rates observed in the

data. From these 1000 Monte Carlo simulations, we calculate for each ethnic group the

average observed overage. Introducing these controls does not impact our estimations

except that the size relationship diminishes modestly.

   We further test the relationships of relative size and isolation on entrepreneurial

clustering by using non-parametric regressions. We partition our size and isolation

variables into terciles and create indicator variables for each combination of {smallest

size, medium, largest size} and {most isolated, medium, least isolated}, and assign

ethnic groups that fall into [largest size, least isolated] as the reference category.

   The results continue to support the theory, as depicted in Figure 3. The [smallest

size, most isolated] groups have entrepreneurial concentrations that are 2.5 standard

deviations greater than the [largest size, least isolated] groups (see Table 3 for detailed

coe¢ cients). Equally important, the pattern of coe¢ cients across the other indica-

tor variables shows the relationships are quite regular and not due to a few outliers.

For example, holding the ethnic group size constant, higher levels of social isolation

strongly and signi…cantly correspond to larger overages. Flipping it around and holding

social isolation, smaller group sizes promote greater concentration within each isolation

category, with the exception of the least socially isolated tercile.

                                            17
3.5       IV Empirical Tests: 1980 Values

We next consider IV speci…cations to test against reverse causality concerns (e.g.,

where isolated business ownerships lead to greater social isolation or lower group sizes)

or omitted variables.12 We use two sets of instruments. The …rst set builds upon

a dynamic version of our model where initial conditions have lasting and persistent

impacts for immigrant groups; this has been demonstrated empirically by Patel and

Vella (2013). We thus use the lagged 1980 values of ethnic group size and in-marriage

rates in the United States to instrument for 2000 levels. The ethnic divisions in 1980

are less detailed than in 2000, and in some cases, the same 1980 value must be applied

to several 2000 ethnic groups. We thus cluster standard errors around the 43 groups

present in the 1980 data, with other aspects of the IV estimations being the same as

OLS speci…cations.

       The …rst-stage results with this instrument set are quite strong. The …rst two

columns of Table 4 show that these instruments have very strong individual predictive

power and a combined joint F-statistic of 24.13 The exclusion restriction requires that

the 1980 group sizes and in-marriage levels only impact entrepreneurship in 2000 to the

extent that they shape current group size and social isolation. This seems reasonable,

although some 1980 respondents may still be employed in 2000, and this may carry

with it persistence that violates the exclusion restriction.

       The second-stage results in Column 3 are quite similar to the OLS …ndings. The

IV speci…cations suggest that a one standard-deviation decrease in ethnic group size

increases overage by 0.76 standard deviations. A one standard-deviation increase in
  12
     An example would be an ethnic group disproportionately located in areas with stringent employ-
ment veri…cation procedures (e.g., Amuedo-Dorantes and Bansak, 2012; Orrenius and Zavodny, 2016),
leading to more social and workplace isolation.
  13
     The F-statistic comes from the Kleibergen-Paap Wald rank F-statistic used when standard errors
are clustered or robust and is based o¤ the Cragg-Donald F-test for weak instrumentation.


                                                18
isolation leads to a 0.52 standard-deviation increase in entrepreneurial concentration.

These results are well-measured and economically important. The size coe¢ cient grows

modestly from its OLS baseline, while the in-marriage rate coe¢ cient declines slightly.

The results are precisely enough estimated that we can reject at a 5% level the null hy-

pothesis in Wu-Hausman tests that the instrumented regressors are exogenous. These

IV results strengthen the predictions of our theory that smaller, more isolated groups

are more conducive to entrepreneurial clustering.


3.6    IV Empirical Tests: Gravity Model and UK Values

Our second IV approach uses as instruments the predicted ethnic group size from a

gravity model and in-marriage rates from the United Kingdom in 1991. To instrument

for ethnic group size, we use a gravity model to quantify predicted ethnic size based

upon worldwide migration rates to the United States. The original application of

gravity models was to trade ‡ows, where studies showed that countries closer to each

other and with larger size tended to show greater trade ‡ows, similar to the forces of

planetary pull. This concept has also been applied to the migration literature, and we

similarly model

                        SIZEl =     +   1 DISTl   +   2 P OPl   + "l ;                (6)

where DISTl is the log distance to the United States from the origin country and P OPl

is the log population of the origin country. For this purpose, we estimate log ethnic

group size in the United States as the dependent variable (without a negative value

being taken as in earlier estimations). Unsurprisingly, lower distance (     1   =   1:56

(s.e.=0:22)) and greater population (   2   = 0:38 (s.e.=0:06)) are strong predictors of

ethnic group size in the United States. We take the predicted values from this regression

for each ethnic group as our …rst instrument.


                                            19
   For our second instrument of in-marriage rates in the United States, we calculate

the in-marriage rates in the 1991 UK Census of Populations. This approach is attrac-

tive as the social isolation evident in the United Kingdom a decade before our study is

only likely to be predictive of US self-employment rates to the extent that the British

isolation captures a persistent trait of the ethnic group. The limitation of this instru-

ment is that we are only able to calculate this for 24 broader ethnic divisions. We map

our observations to these groups and cluster the standard errors at the UK group level.

   Columns 4-5 of Table 4 again report the …rst-stage relationships. The instruments

remain individually predictive of their corresponding endogenous regressor, and they

have a joint F-statistic of 35.5. Similar to the 1980 US instruments, the minimum 2SLS

relative bias that can be speci…ed is less than 10%. This implies that we can specify a

very small bias and still reject the null hypothesis that the instruments are weak. The

bias level is determined by the minimum eigenvalue statistic and the Stock-Yogo 2SLS

size of the nominal 5% Wald test.

   The second-stage results are again comparable to our core OLS …ndings. The size

results are a bit lower than OLS, while the social isolation e¤ects are even stronger

than OLS, with elasticities of around 0.67. We now reject at a 10% level that the

instrumented regressors are exogenous.

   Tables 5-7 show robustness checks with the two IV approaches. Results are very

similar with simple adjustments like excluding sample weights, dropping winsorization,

or using bootstrapped standard errors. The results with simulated overage controls

are very similar for the …rst instrument set, and we can only instrument for social

isolation in the second set as the predicted size relationship in the gravity model has

an insu¢ cient …rst stage when including the simulated metrics. Intuitively, both the

instrument and predicted overage are being built upon the same data, making it hard

                                           20
to separate them.

   Further analyses show comparable patterns with the alternative overage metric

designs. The results for social isolation are robust in all speci…cations. Those for group

size are mostly robust, with a few exceptions with the predicted size instruments. We

also …nd very similar results when expanding the gravity equation to have a squared

distance term or an indicator for Canada and Mexico as bordering countries or when

using underlying components of the gravity equation as direct instruments.

   In summary, the OLS and IV variants provide consistent support to the model.

The strongest …ndings are those for social isolation, which is a very strong predictor

of immigrant entrepreneurial concentration. The weight of the evidence also supports

that smaller group sizes promote entrepreneurial concentration.


3.7    Earnings Estimations

Our model makes an additional prediction that members of an ethnic group can achieve

greater earnings when entering a common entrepreneurial setting. In our framework,

social complementarities produce a positive relationship between earnings and entre-

preneurship at the group level. This prediction is in direct contrast to what would

be expected if discrimination in the marketplace is the most important factor leading

to segmented group self-employment. The empirical work of Patel and Vella (2013)

strongly shows a positive earning relationship for immigrant groups and common group

occupational choices using the 1980-2000 Census of Populations data. To close the loop

for this paper, we thus provide a brief analysis of earnings and refer readers to these

complementary pieces for additional evidence.

   Table 8 provides individual-level estimations of the earnings relationship. The out-

come variable is the log yearly income of individuals. We report three core explanatory


                                           21
variables. The …rst is whether the individual is self-employed. The second is the per-

centage of an individual’s ethnic group who are self-employed (similar to the values

reported in Table A1a), regardless of industry. Third, we measure the share of the in-

dividual’s ethnic group that is employed in the industry of the focal individual. With

the model developed, we anticipate both of these group measures to have positive pre-

dictive power. For natives, these latter variables are simply measured over the whole

US-born population.

   Our estimations also include many unreported controls for individuals that relate to

earnings. We include …xed e¤ects for PUMA geographical locations and for industries.

We also control for high-school and college education, whether the individual is a native

or an immigrant, whether the individual is ‡uent in the English language, and …xed

e¤ects for seven age categories and seven age-at-immigration categories. Regressions

cluster standard errors by ethnic group and use IPUMS sample weights.

   The …rst three columns show that all three elements are predictive of earnings.

Being self-employed (a binary measure) is directly associated with a 3% increase in total

earnings in the cross-section. A 1% increase in the rate of overall self-employment for

an ethnic group connects to a 1% increase in total earnings. To aid interpretation, the

bottom of the table also provides the standard deviation x beta coe¢ cient for group-

level variables; a one standard-deviation increase (0.0255) in group self-employment

connects to 3% higher earning. Similarly, looking at ethnic group concentration for the

individual in his particular industry, a 1% increase in group concentration connects to

a 0.6% increase in total earnings. In standard-deviation terms, the relative e¤ect of

5% is even larger than the 3% for group self-employment. Columns 4-6 show similar

outcomes when we exclude those in professional occupations and holders of doctorate

degrees.

                                           22
    These results support the model’s structure and are consistent with a potential

positive bene…t from immigrant entrepreneurial concentration. It is important for fu-

ture theoretical and empirical work to consider both owners and employees of …rms.

Empirical work can particularly target employer-employee datasets to observe more de-

tailed hiring and wage patterns; such work can also evaluate job transitions during the

assimilation of new members of ethnic groups, perhaps ultimately leading to starting

their own business.


4     Conclusions

A striking feature of entrepreneurship is the degree to which immigrants of di¤erent

ethnic backgrounds cluster into self-employment in di¤erent industries. These con-

centrations are su¢ ciently visible to be captured in popular culture (e.g., the Indian

immigrant entrepreneur Apu who runs the convenience store in The Simpsons), and

the cumulative magnitudes can be shocking: the Asian American Hotel Owners Asso-

ciation claims to be the largest hotel owners association in the world and represent half

of the hotels in the United States. Yet, while noticeable, the economic implications of

these tendencies are underexplored.

    Our model outlines how the social interactions of small, socially isolated groups

can give rise to this self-employment pattern by reducing the cost of acquiring sector-

speci…c skills. Our online appendix explores several extensions to the basic framework,

and many other avenues for future research exist. A fruitful path would be to model

the intergenerational transmission of skills and to follow occupational structure and

entrepreneurial persistence across generations. This interaction mechanism can also be

applied to the study of the transmission of other types of skills beyond entrepreneurship.

    Empirically, the Census data con…rm small and, especially, socially isolated immi-

                                           23
grant groups in the United States display heightened entrepreneurial clustering. Fur-

ther quantifying these forces in employer-employee data and …rm operating data are

important to understand hiring patterns, career trajectories, and market power. The

recent US patterns resemble many earlier observations of the economic success and so-

cial isolation of specialized minority groups throughout history. We hope this study can

be replicated in settings outside of the United States given its general nature (Fairlie

et al., 2010).

Notes: Estimations describe the OLS relationship between industry concentration for ethnic entrepreneurship and ethnic group size and in-marriage isolation. The outcome
variable in Columns 1-4 is the log weighted average overage ratio across industries for each ethnic group, where the weights are levels of self employment in each industry
per group. Variables are winsorized at their 10%/90% levels and transformed to have unit standard deviation for interpretation. Regressions are weighted by log ethnic group
employee counts in MSAs, include 77 observations, and report robust standard errors. Column 2 considers the metric that uses all employed workers for the ethnic group,
Column 3 compares industry-level overages only to rates of other immigrant groups, and Column 4 includes rural workers in the sample. Column 5 restricts the overage
measure to just the three largest self-employment industries for an ethnic group. Columns 6-7 consider extreme values among industries by ethnic group. These latter
overages are done without reference to industry importance in terms of ethnic group self-employment, but they require at least ten observations exist for an ethnic group -
industry cluster to be included.

Notes: See Table 1. Columns 2-6 provide robustness checks on the baseline specification. Regressions in Columns 5 and 6 are unweighted and should be referenced
against Column 2. Column 5 reports pseudo R-squared values. Columns 7 and 8 include control variables for predicted overage ratios based upon 1000 Monte Carlo
simulations. In these simulations, pools of similarly sized ethnic groups to our true sample are formed and randomly assigned industry and entrepreneurship status
according to national propensities. From these random assignments, we calculate 1000 overage metrics for each ethnic group that exactly mirror our primary data
construction. The average of these simulations is entered as a control variable. In the first version included in Column 7, self-employment status and industry status are
separately randomized, such that we overall predict roughly the same self-employment rate in each industry. In the second version included in Column 8, self-
employment status and industry are jointly drawn such that we overall replicate observed self-employment levels across industries.

Notes: See Table 1. Estimations describe the IV relationship between industry concentration for ethnic entrepreneurship and ethnic group size and in-
marriage isolation. The column headers indicate the instruments used. The 2SLS relative bias reports the minimum bias that can be specified and still
reject the null hypothesis that the instruments are weak. This level is determined through the minimum eigenvalue statistic and Stock and Yogo's
(2005) 2SLS size of nominal 5% Wald test. The null hypothesis in Wu-Hausman exogeneity tests is that the instrumented regressors are exogenous.
The test statistic used is robust to clustering of standard errors. Regressions cluster standard errors by the 43 and 24 ethnic groups in the US 1980 and
UK 1990 datasets used to build the respective instruments.

Notes: Estimations describe the OLS relationship between log yearly income of individuals and entrepreneurial activity of their ethnic
group. Sample is taken from 2000 Census IPUMS. Sample includes native males and immigrant males who migrate after 1968 (effective
date of the Immigration Reform Act of 1965), are aged 30-65 in 2000, and have lived in the United States for at least 10 years. Sample
excludes workers whose self-employment status is unknown or not applicable, industries without self-employment, and workers living
outside of metropolitan areas. Baseline estimation includes fixed effects for the following person-level traits (category counts in
parentheses): PUMA geographical location (625), industry (200), native/immigrant (2), age (7), age at immigration for migrants (7),
education (3), and English language fluency (2). Regressions cluster standard errors by ethnic group and use IPUMS sample weights. The
bottom of the table provides the standard deviation x beta coefficient for the group-level variables (0.0255 for (1), 0.0810 for (2)).
Columns 4-6 exclude workers in professional occupations and holders of doctorate degrees.
               Online Appendix: Empirical
    Table A1a provides our largest overage ratios ordered by OV ER1l . We …nd ev-
idence of strong entrepreneurial clustering. For example, Gujarati Indians have an
average overage ratio of 33 across the industries of their self-employment work, and
an average overage ratio of 59 in their three largest industries. Their max overage
is in the hotel and motel industry, which we further explore in Table A1b. The last
three columns of Table A1a provide broader statistics about each ethnic group, such as
its total employment (entrepreneurial and wage workers), self-employment share, and
in-marriage rates.
    Table A1b displays the maximum overages observed at the industry level for ethnic
groups, ordered by max self-employment overage. The table displays for the ethnic
groups their industry of max self-employment overage, the industry of max overage
when using all workers, and the industry where the most workers for the ethnic group
are occupied in terms of absolute counts. In 17 of 25 cases shown, the industry where
the ethnic group displays the highest concentration for self-employment is the same as
the industry where the ethnic group shows the highest concentration for total employ-
ment. In 8 of 25 cases, the industry of maximum concentration is also the industry
where the ethnic group employs the most workers in an absolute sense. The industry
size variable ranks industries from largest (1) to smallest (200) in terms of their overall
size in the economy. Most of the maximum-concentration industries in the …rst two
industry lists are of moderate size; industries in the third set for highest absolute count
of ethnic employees tend to be larger industries.
    It is noteworthy that some important factors aid group concentration are conceptu-
ally similar to but are not captured by our theoretical and empirical work. For example,
we treat the taxi industry as a single industry for our empirical work, but taxi markets
are often segmented by cities. Frequent travelers note the degree to which di¤erent
ethnic groups appear to dominate the taxi industry on a city-by-city basis, with the
most important group for each city being di¤erent. In fact, more broadly, many in-
dustries of maximum concentration (e.g., grocery stores, gas stations) are cases where
geography can play an important role. This suggests we are likely under-estimating
true concentration in this regard.1
    On a related note, social interaction e¤ects should in principle be relevant to any
setting where the complementarity between social interaction and skill acquisition is
strong. However, occupations and industries that require speci…c education and skills
that are typically acquired early in life are not amenable to the forces that we model
in which immigrants arrive in the United States as adults. Thus, adult immigrants

    Unfortunately, the data counts become very thin for segmenting by geography using IPUMS.
Future work using universal linked employer-employee data can analyze these features.

social and professional interactions, given medicine’s deep professional requirements
and extensive training period. Many of the displayed entrepreneurial activities that
are subject to ethnic concentration have much shorter training cycles and fewer degree
or occupational licensing requirements.
    Tables A2a and A2b report pairwise correlations and pairwise rank correlations
for eight variants in overage ratios. All correlations exceed 0.4 and are statistically
signi…cant at a 5% level.

Notes: Descriptive statistics from 2000 Census IPUMS. Sample includes males immigrating after 1968 (effective date of the Immigration Reform Act of 1965),
aged 30-65 in 2000, and living in the United States for at least 10 years. Sample excludes workers whose self-employment status is unknown or not applicable,
industries without self-employment, and workers living outside of metropolitan areas. The overage ratios and industry titles are specific to self-employment and
weight industries by the number of self-employed workers for the ethnic group. Two small groups that are partially composed of residual individuals are not
listed in this table but have overage values in this range (Indochina, ns 9.4; Africa, ns/nec 8.2). The employment column displays the total workforce size
included in the sample for each ethnic group.

                   Online Appendix: Theory
    The theory in this paper consists of two fundamental building blocks. First, social
interactions and production are complementary. Second, di¤erent social relationships
are not close substitutes for one another. The former is analyzed in the main text, and
this appendix begins with additional discussion. We then consider pricing equilibrium
and social networks with endogenous matching. The numbering of assumptions and
propositions continues from the main text.


1       Discussion of Baseline Model
1.1     Quality and Convex Productivity
In addition to the quantity of social interactions with other self-employed entrepreneurs,
the quality of these interactions could also matter for productivity. Let individual
productivity for self-employed entrepreneurs in industry 1 increase both in the quantity
and average productivity of other entrepreneurs in the sector of the same group. Write
this as
                                         = + Xl ;                                      (1)
where > 0 is a productivity term, 0 < < 1 is a social multiplier, Xl is the fraction
of entrepreneurs in group l, and is the average productivity of these entrepreneurs.
Solving for equilibrium productivity by setting equal to , individual productivity in
group l is a function:
                                        (Xl ) =     :                               (2)
                                           1     Xl
Under these conditions, productivity is convex in the degree of specialization when
taking both the quantity and the quality of interaction into account.1 With this result
in mind, we make the following assumption:

Assumption 1B Productivity of self-employed entrepreneurs in industry 1 is convex
in specialization: 00 > 0.

    Assumption 1B allows a full characterization of the e¢ cient solution without having
to resort to explicit functional form. We discuss further below. Convex productivity
gives the following result:
    1
    This speci…cation highlights the di¤erences from a standard interaction model. The standard
model is generally speci…ed so that individual productivity is a function of a group-speci…c term
and the discounted mean of the group, . Solving = + , interaction exacerbates the di¤erence
in across groups, = 1 > , but the degree of specialization Xl has no e¤ect on productivity.


                                               1
Lemma If productivity is convex, both groups never work in both industries.

    Proof: Assume by contradiction that an e¢ cient distribution (XA ; XB ) exists where
0 < Xl < 1 for l = fA; Bg. Consider a marginal change in the ethnic composition
of self-employed entrepreneurs in industry 1 while holding …xed the overall number of
said entrepreneurs M (and therefore also the outputs of both industries). Taking the
derivative of Q1 with respect to , and evaluating it at = 0:

       @Q1
              XA +        ; XB          = (XA ) + XA 0 (XA )             (XB )    XB 0 (XB )        (3)
        @            NA          NB

Since (XA ; XB ) is e¢ cient, and since Xl is interior, this derivative has to be zero.2 But
with convex productivity the derivative is zero only at XA = XB , which is the global
minimum. This contradicts e¢ ciency.
    The e¢ cient economy aims for maximum ethnic homogeneity in self-employed en-
trepreneurship in industry 1. Ruling out that both groups work in both sectors implies
that only the specialized distributions along the two curves depicted in Figure 1 of the
main text could possibly coincide with the transformation frontier. The shape of the
entire transformation frontier can therefore be deduced by tracing out the maximum
of the two curves in that …gure.

Proposition 2 If productivity is convex, there is a cuto¤ value v such that for
v < v , the minority group specializes as self-employed entrepreneurs in industry 1,
whereas for v > v , the majority specializes.

       Proof: Direct from Proposition 1 and Lemma proofs with convexity.
    The right panel of Figure 1 of the main text also shows how the degree of special-
ization varies with the size of industry 1, as governed by v, and the cuto¤ value v for
majority group specialization. The greater the value of v, the greater is the demand for
industry 1 and the more people work in it. As industry 1 increases in size, the interac-
tion externality generates a characteristic discrete jump from one type of equilibrium to
another. At the point v , where many from group B have also joined self-employed en-
trepreneurship in industry 1, the economy abruptly moves from minority specialization
to majority specialization.
   2
     If the derivative is nonzero, then the output of industry 1 could increase while keeping the output
of industry 0 constant. By subsequently increasing the number of workers in industry 0 marginally, a
Pareto improvement is feasible, thus contradicting e¢ ciency.




                                                   2
1.2    The Case of Non-Convex Productivity
To see that convexity is needed for the Lemma on ethnic homogeneity to hold, con-
sider a non-convex production function where a threshold fraction must work as self-
employed entrepreneurs in industry 1 for interaction to have value: > 0 if Xl         b
and zero otherwise. This speci…cation violates the assumption that productivity is
strictly increasing in the degree of specialization. Then, if the demand for industry 1
output is so great that a single group cannot satisfy it entirely, v > V (0; 1), and if
in addition V (b; b) < v < V (b; 1), e¢ ciency requires that both ethnic groups work in
both industries, contradicting the Lemma.
    To see why, consider what would happen if one of the groups specialized completely.
In this case the non-specialized group’s degree of specialization would be positive but
below b, causing the self-employed industry 1 entrepreneurs in that group to have zero
productivity. If, however, the industrial distribution was unspecialized instead, with
XA = XB , then self-employed industry 1 entrepreneurs in both groups would be as
productive as those in the most productive group were under the alternative. Clearly
this would be Pareto superior, contradicting the Lemma. This special case shows
how the Lemma fails for non-convex productivity, and how in this case the qualitative
features of specialization will depend on speci…c functional form assumptions. Recall
however that the results for both v      V (1; 0) and v = V (0; 1) are more general and
apply both for convex and non-convex productivity. This condition is less important
for the remaining model discussion.


2     The Price Equilibrium
The model in the main text characterizes the e¢ cient outcome. The focus now turns
to the competitive outcome. An equilibrium analysis will yield two insights into how
social interaction a¤ects distribution over industries. First, it shows how stratifying
forces act to make groups more and more di¤erent, and second, how group earnings
are positively related to the degree of specialization.
    To see how social interaction works as a stratifying force, begin by introducing time
into the analysis, with t = 0; 1; :::; 1. Dynamics are built into the model by making the
interaction e¤ect work with a lag. Denote by Xlt the degree of specialization in period t
for group l, and let self-employed individual entrepreneurial productivity in industry 1
in period t be a function Xlt 1 . This one-period lag speci…cation for the interaction
e¤ect could easily be generalized to a distributed lag. Interaction now e¤ectively works
as a form of social capital, with the group’s self-employment activities in the previous
period bene…ting individual productivity today. Let pt1 and pt0 be the prices of industry
1 output and industry 0 output respectively. Entrepreneurial earnings in industry 1

Avoid for now the knife-edge unspecialized case where XAt 1 = XBt 1 . Since there is a
single price of labor, pt , at least one of the two groups A and B must then be in a
corner:

                       (XAt = 1; 0 < XBt ) or (XAt   1; XBt = 0) if XAt   1
                                                                              > XBt   1
       XAt ; XBt   =                                                                      (6)
                       (0 < XAt ; XBt = 1) or (XAt = 0; XBt   1) if XAt   1
                                                                              < XBt   1


    In equilibrium, supply must satisfy (6) and production must meet demand so that
markets clear. Because of perfect complementarity, meeting demand reduces to satisfy-
ing v = V (XAt ; XBt ). The resulting equilibrium distribution is unique. To see why, take
the case when group l is more specialized than group l0 in the previous period, with
Xlt 1 > Xlt0 1 . Given that at least one of the two groups must be in a corner according
to (6), the equilibrium distribution must either be of the type (Xlt ; 0) or of the type
(1; Xlt0 ). Since the function V is strictly increasing in both arguments, it follows that
V (1; Xlt0 ) > V (Xlt ; 0). Only one distribution can consequently make V equal to v.
    The equilibrium distribution is therefore uniquely determined by the distribution
in the previous period. Continuing to avoid the knife-edge unspecialized case, de…ne a
function that maps every previous distribution into a new distribution:

                               XAt ; XBt =        XAt 1 ; XBt   1
                                                                                          (7)

Next, proceed to characterize stationary equilibrium distributions. Like other equilib-
rium distributions, stationary distributions must satisfy (6) and must meet demand.
Following the same argument as above, based on V being strictly increasing in both
arguments, it follows that there is a stationary equilibrium where each of the two
groups specializes. Denote the stationary distribution as XAA ; XBA when the minority
specializes, and the stationary distribution as XAB ; XBB when the majority specializes.
    Finally, returning for a moment to the unspecialized knife-edge case where XAt 1 =
XBt 1 , this type of initial condition is of measure zero and therefore not elaborated

                                              4
on. Note only that since V is strictly increasing in both arguments, there can only be
one such stationary unspecialized equilibrium distribution. Denote that equilibrium
distribution as XAU ; XBU . In the unspecialized case, although there is only one sta-
tionary equilibrium, the uniqueness of equilibria no longer applies. To summarize, there
are consequently three stationary equilibrium distributions: two specialized, XAA ; XBA
and XAB ; XBB , and one unspecialized, XAU ; XBU . Figure A1 shows the two specialized
equilibria, as well as the knife-edge equilibrium, when v is less than V (1; 0).


2.1       Industrial Strati…cation
Our next analysis shows that the dynamic system in (7) converges to a stationary
specialized equilibrium, so long as the interaction externality is not too strong. This
analysis only examines unspecialized initial conditions, which establishes convergence
on measure one. Consider what happens to the aggregate production of industry 1
when one (in…nitesimal) person in group l becomes a self-employed entrepreneur in that
industry. First, aggregate production increases by an amount equal to the individual
productivity of that person, (Xl ). In addition, all other self-employed entrepreneurs
in industry 1 from group l bene…t from the interaction externality when socializing with
this new entrepreneur. Individual productivity therefore increases by N1l 0 (Xl ) for all
Xl Nl self-employed industry 1 entrepreneurs in group l. Consequently, the internalized
e¤ect on aggregate production of one person joining the self-employed entrepreneurial
sector of industry 1 is (Xl ), and the external e¤ect is Xl 0 (Xl ). Assume that the
external e¤ect is smaller than the internal e¤ect.3
                                                          0
Assumption 2 The internal e¤ect dominates:                    (Xl ) Xl < (Xl ).

    This condition is satis…ed if productivity is concave in Xl , but it also holds for some
convexity as long as (0) > 0. To see why the assumption is needed for the system to
be stable, consider the extreme case when group A has no mass at all, with NA = 0.
Since the derivative of V with respect to XAt is zero in this case, group A can be ignored
altogether in the general equilibrium analysis. There is then a single stationary level
of specialization for group B; denote this value as XB .
    Consider a perturbation in period t so that the majority starts out with too many
entrepreneurs in industry 1, XBt > XB , shown in Figure A2. Such a deviation boosts
the interaction e¤ect in period t + 1 relative to the stationary equilibrium, (XBt ) >
  (XB ). With perfect complementarity, the outputs of both industry 0 and industry 1
must therefore increase relative to their stationary equivalents. Increasing the output
of industry 0 requires an increase in the number of workers in that industry, and
consequently, a decrease in the number of self-employed entrepreneurs in industry 1 to
  3
      We thank Rachel Soloveichik for this interpretation of Assumption 2.


                                                  5
below the stationary value XB . With fewer of these entrepreneurs in period t + 1 than
the stationary number, the tables turn in period t + 2, so that the interaction e¤ect
now is reduced to below that in the stationary equilibrium. Reducing the production
of industry 0 and industry 1 in period t + 2 in response, the number of industry 0
workers in period t + 2 has to decrease and the number of self-employed industry 1
entrepreneurs has to increase relative to the stationary equilibrium. These reversals
repeat every period in cobweb-style dynamics.4
    The question of whether the system is stable reduces to whether the number of
self-employed entrepreneurs in industry 1 in period t + 2 is less than the number of
such entrepreneurs in period t, so that the degree of specialization in group B gets
closer and closer to the stationary value XB over time. Using the derived direction
of the change in industry 1 production, Qt+11   > Qt+2
                                                     1 , this latter inequality can be
equivalently expressed, after multiplying and dividing the left-hand side by XBt and
dividing both sides by XBt+1 NB , as:

                                        (XBt )    t+2 XBt+1
                                  XBt          > XB                                               (8)
                                        XBt           XBt+1

Given that productivity is not too convex, as stipulated by Assumption 2, it follows
that (XXl
         l)
            is strictly decreasing in Xl . Since XBt > XBt+1 , equation (8) then establishes
that XBt > XBt+2 . This proves convergence and the stability of group B’s degree of
specialization around XB .
    Having established stability in the case of NA = 0, the same example also serves
to show how the stratifying force comes into play. Let group B be in its stable state,
with XBt = XB , and perturb the minority’s industry distribution so that XAt > XB .
Since group B is so much greater in size than group A, the former is una¤ected by the
perturbation and the price continues to be locked in at pt+1 = (XB ). The interaction
e¤ect in period t+1, generated by the perturbation in period t, then results in everyone
in group A becoming more productive as self-employed entrepreneurs in industry 1
than as workers in industry 0, with (XAt ) > pt+1 . Group A’s degree of specialization
consequently jumps from XAt to XAt+1 = 1, and the distribution stays in this strati…ed
state forever. This strati…cation result is extended later for the general case of any
population size of the two groups, and it follows that for l 2 fA; Bg and l0 2 fA; Bg:

Proposition 3 Initial di¤erences result in long-run specialization: If group l is more
specialized than group l0 initially, Xl0 > Xl00 , then group l specializes in the long run
and the limiting distribution is XAl ; XBl .
   4
    The ‡ip-‡opping character of the equilibrium distribution is a result of the one-period lag speci-
…cation for the interaction e¤ect. The distribution would change more gradually with a more general
speci…cation allowing for distributed lags.



                                                  6
   Proof : Consider the equilibrium sequence of industry distributions:

                                     XA1 ; XB1 ; XA2 ; XB2 ; :::                               (9)

If one group l is more specialized than the other group l0 initially, Xl0 > Xl00 , supply in
(5) requires that the equilibrium sequence begins in one of the following three ways:
                                                     8
                                                     < ((< 1; 0) ; :::)
                   Xl1 ; Xl10 ; Xl2 ; Xl20   ; ::: =   ((1; 0) ; (1; 0) ; :::)                (10)
                                                     :
                                                       ((1; 0) ; (< 1; 0) ; :::) :

The proof proceeds by establishing that the sequence converges to XAl ; XBl in each
                                                   (Xl )
of these three cases. De…ne the variable (Xl )     Xl
                                                         for Xl > 0. From Assumption
                  0
2 it follows that (Xl ) < 0. Proceed to establish convergence:

Case 1 Xl1 < 1 and Xl10 = 0.

   Show …rst that group l0 stays out of entrepreneurship in industry 1 for good. By
contradiction: if not, then there exists a time t where Xlt+1
                                                           0  = 0 and Xlt+2
                                                                         0  > 0. Since
                                              t+1            t+2
supply must satisfy (6) it then follows that Xl > 0 and Xl = 1. The change in the
output of industry 1 can then be written as:

            Qt+2
             1      Qt+1
                     1   = Nl          Xlt+1      Xlt+1    Xlt     + Xlt+2
                                                                        0  Nl 0     Xlt+1
                                                                                       0  :   (11)

This di¤erence is strictly positive if the …rst term is positive. Clearly this is the case if
Xlt+1 Xlt . If, instead, Xlt+1 < Xlt , then again focusing on the …rst term:

               Xlt+1      Xlt+1     Xlt      =      Xlt+1 Xlt+1      Xlt+1        Xlt Xlt     (12)
                                             = Xlt+1       Xlt+1          Xlt Xlt > 0:

This establishes that Qt+2
                       1   > Qt+1
                              1   . Since the output production of both industries must
move in the same direction to clear the market, because of perfect complementarity, it
follows that the output of industry 0 also increases from t + 1 to t + 2. This in turn
requires that the number of workers in industry 0 increases, or equivalently, that the
number of self-employed entrepreneurs in industry 1 decreases:

                          Xlt+2 Nl + Xlt+2
                                        0  Nl0 < Xlt+1 Nl + Xlt+1
                                                               0  Nl0 :                       (13)

Since Xlt+2 = 1 and Xlt+1
                        0  = 0, this inequality can be simpli…ed as Nl + Xlt+2
                                                                            0  Nl0 <
  t+1
Xl Nl . This inequality is a contradiction and establishes that group l0 stays out
of self-employed entrepreneurship in industry 1 for good. The stationary equilibrium
must consequently be of the form Xll ; 0 .


                                                   7
   Assume …rst that Xlt > X , in which case it is easy to show that Qt+1
                                                                     1   > Ql1 > Qt+2
                                                                                  1
as well as Xlt+1 < Xll < Xlt+2 . Since Qt+1
                                        1   > Qt+2
                                               1   it follows that:

                         Xlt+1 NA      Xlt   > Xlt+2 NA     Xlt+1                        (14)
                         Xlt+1     Xlt Xlt > Xlt+2        Xlt+1 Xlt+1
                                 Xlt   Xlt   > Xlt+2      Xlt+1 :

The last line implies that Xlt > Xlt+2 . The exact same argument, but with reverse
inequalities, can be made for Xlt < Xll . Therefore, having established that Xlt >
Xlt+2 > Xll when Xlt > Xll , and vice versa when Xlt < Xll , it has been shown that Xlt
approaches the stationary equilibrium value Xll over time. This establishes convergence
in Case 1.

Case 2 Xl1 = 1, Xl10     0, Xl2 = 1 and Xl20       0.

    Show …rst that in this case, group l stays specialized for good. By contradiction:
if not, then there exists a time t when Xlt = 1, Xlt+1 = 1 and Xlt+2 < 1. Since supply
must satisfy (6), it follows that Xlt+2
                                     0  = 0. The change in the output of industry 1 can
be written as

              Qt+2
               1       Qt+1
                        1   = Nl Xlt+2 (1)          (1)    Xlt+1
                                                              0  Nl 0    Xlt < 0:        (15)

Since the supply of output of both industries must move in the same direction to clear
the market, it follows that the output of industry 0 also decreases, which requires that
the number of self-employed entrepreneurs in industry 1 increases:

                         Xlt+2 Nl + Xlt+2
                                       0  Nl0 > Xlt+1 Nl + Xlt+1
                                                              0  Nl0 :                   (16)

Since Xlt+20 = 0 and Xlt+1 = 1, this inequality can be rewritten as Xlt+2 Nl > Nl +
  t+1
Xl0 Nl0 , which is a contradiction. This establishes that group l stays specialized in
industry 1 for good. The stationary equilibrium must consequently be of the form
 1; Xll0 . By the same argument as in Case 1, the sequence can be shown to approach
the stationary equilibrium value Xll0 over time, both if Xlt0 > Xll0 and if Xlt0 < Xll0 . This
establishes convergence in Case 2.

Case 3 Xl1 = 1 and Xl10       0 and Xl2 < 1 and Xl20 = 0.

   By the same argument in Case 1, it follows that group l0 stays out of entrepreneur-
ship in industry 1 permanently. Repeating the arguments in Case 1, convergence can
then be established also in Case 3.
   Consequently, in all three cases there is convergence.

                                               8
   This also implies that the stationary unspecialized equilibrium XAU ; XBU is un-
stable. If the minority group is slightly more specialized initially, then the economy
converges to minority specialization XAA ; XBA , and if the opposite is true, then the
economy converges to majority specialization XAB ; XBB . Over time, social segregation
ampli…es initial group di¤erences.


2.2     Initial Conditions and Multiple Groups
Depending on the initial conditions, as is clear from Proposition 3, either of the two
groups A and B can specialize as self-employed entrepreneurs in industry 1. Social
interaction ampli…es initial di¤erences, but it does not explain why they are there
to begin with. The di¤erence in group size has some implications for what initial
conditions to expect, however.
    Consider an economy with more than two groups. As before, the group with more
self-employed entrepreneurs in industry 1 initially will specialize in the long run. If
the initial industrial distribution is subject to randomness, one of the smaller groups is
likely to be the most specialized initially. To see why, let the initial distribution be gen-
erated by random draws, where each person becomes a self-employed entrepreneur in
industry 1 with probability .5 This probability structure results in the same expected
initial degree of specialization for all groups, but since the population size varies across
groups, the variance in the degree of specialization also varies. The smallest groups
have the largest variance, and therefore, the smallest groups are most likely to exhibit
the lowest and also the greatest initial degrees of specialization. Consequently, with
the smallest groups the most likely to specialize initially, as interaction ampli…es initial
di¤erences over time, the smallest groups are also the most likely to specialize in the
long run.


2.3     Assimilation
Our model does not feature assimilation of immigrants and their o¤spring and thus
yields permanent social and industrial segregation. In our framework, assimilation
would reduce the social isolation of an ethnic group (or some members of it) to the
majority group. Our framework then predicts the industry choices of the assimilated
individuals to look like those of the majority, especially if another ethnic group shows
strong social isolation.
   5
     These draws can be partially correlated within groups with the assumption that the correlation
is the same for every group.

Social complementarities also have implications for earnings. To examine how inter-
action e¤ects would show up in earnings data, it is necessary to move away from the
framework of identical skills. Returning to a static environment, endow each person i
with entrepreneurial skills relevant to self-employment in industry 1, s1 (i), and with
another set of skills necessary for industry 0, s0 (i). Self-employed entrepreneurial earn-
ings in industry 1 are now a function of both interactions and skills. Denote the earnings
of individual i in group l when she is a self- employed entrepreneur in industry 1 as
y1 (Xl ; i) = p1 (Xl ) s1 (i), and when she is a member of industry 0 as y0 (i) = p0 s0 (i).

De…ning the ratios s          s1
                              s0
                                 , p p1
                                        , and q      p yy01 , the earnings-maximizing industry
choice of individual i is to consider becoming a self-employed entrepreneur in industry
1 if:
                                          q (Xl ; i) p                                    (17)
and to consider working in industry 0 if q (Xl ; i)       p. Here the term q (Xl ; i) =
  (Xl ) s (i) summarizes the individual’s comparative advantage in self-employed entre-
preneurship in industry 1, at parity prices, as a function of social interaction and skills.
    When individuals have di¤erent skills, the character of the price equilibrium de-
pends crucially on the marginal self-employed entrepreneur and how her comparative
advantage changes as more and more untalented people also become entrepreneurs in
industry 1. If the bene…ts of interaction are weak and the marginal entrepreneur “dete-
riorates”as more intrinsically untalented people enter the industry, then the economy
reduces to a standard Roy model, or sorting model, with a unique unspecialized equi-
librium. Only if the interaction e¤ect is strong enough to overcome skill heterogeneity
can interaction change the character of the equilibrium.
    Without loss of generality, order individuals from the greatest to the smallest com-
parative advantage in industry 1-style entrepreneurship, so that the skill ratio is de-
creasing in i, s0 (i) 0. The marginal entrepreneur is then the individual indexed by
i = Xl , and her comparative advantage is q (Xl ; Xl ). To prevent the economy from
reducing to a sorting model, assume that the interaction e¤ect trumps heterogeneity:

                                                             d
Assumption 3 Interaction dominates at the margin:           dXl
                                                                q   (Xl ; Xl ) > 0.

This assumption implies that the solid line in Figure A3 is upward sloping. The
equilibrium distribution (XA ; XB ) must be competitively supplied and enough output
must be produced by both industries to meet demand. Using a similar line of reasoning
as in the previous section, based on V being strictly increasing in both arguments, it
follows from Assumption 3 that there are three equilibria: one unstrati…ed, denoted
 XAU ; XBU ; one where the minority group A specializes, denoted XAA ; XBA ; and one



                                             10
where the majority group B specializes, denoted XAB ; XBB .6
   In the equilibrium where minority A specializes as self-employed entrepreneurs in
industry 1, the mean earnings of members of group A are higher than the mean earnings
of members of group B, and vice versa in the equilibrium where group B specializes.
To see why, let y = max (y0 ; y1 ) be actual individual earnings, and denote mean group
                 R1
earnings as = 0 ydi.

Proposition 4 Earnings covary with self-employed entrepreneurship in industry 1:
 (Xl ) > (Xl0 ) if Xl > Xl0 .

      Proof: Since people sort into industries, mean earnings can be rewritten as
                              Z 1             Z Xl
                      (Xl ) =     y0 (i) di +      (y1 (Xl ; i) y0 (i)) di               (18)
                               0              0

Rearranging, the di¤erence in mean earnings between the two groups is:
                     Z Xl0                                Z Xl
    (Xl )    (Xl ) =
                0          (y1 (Xl ; i) y1 (Xl ; i)) di +
                                              0                (y1 (Xl ; i) y0 (i)) di   (19)
                         0                                 Xl 0

where both parts of the expression are positive. The …rst part is strictly positive due to
the interaction e¤ect, @y1@X(Xl ;i)
                              l
                                    > 0, and the second part is positive because of sorting,
y1 (Xl ; i) y0 (i) for all i Xl .
    This unequivocal e¤ect on mean earnings at the group level does not carry through
to the industry level. Depending on the joint distribution of skills, mean earnings
in either industry can increase or decrease as interaction increases self-employed en-
trepreneurial productivity in industry 1 and shifts people of di¤erent ability between
industries. The e¤ect of interaction on industry earnings is similar to the e¤ect of
changing skill prices, which cannot be signed for a general skill distribution (Heckman
and Honore, 1990).
    The di¤erence in mean earnings, normalized in units of industry 0 output, is shown
in Figure A4 for the equilibrium with minority specialization. The exact derivation
is included below. The relative price of industry 0 to industry 1 outputs is always
such that the marginal entrepreneur is indi¤erent between industries. Keeping track
of whether the marginal entrepreneur is in group A or in group B depending on the
industrial distribution, the equilibrium price can be expressed as:

                  q (Xl ; Xl ) if Xl > Xl0 and Xl0 = 0, or Xl < Xl0 and Xl > 0
           p=                                                                            (20)
                  q (Xl0 ; Xl0 ) if Xl > Xl0 and Xl0 > 0, or Xl < Xl0 and Xl = 0
  6
    Note that Assumptions 2 and 3, when combined, put both an upper and a lower bound on the
interaction e¤ect: ddX
                     ln s
                       l
                          < ddX
                              ln
                                 l
                                   < X1l .


                                             11
When increasing the number of self-employed entrepreneurs in industry 1 in equilibrium
with minority specialization, the relative price of industry 0 output to industry 1 output
increases continuously as the marginal entrepreneur in group A becomes more and more
productive. This increase in price continues until all As are self-employed entrepreneurs
in industry 1. To expand industry 1’s self-employed entrepreneurial sector further from
the point where everyone in group A are entrepreneurs, the price has to drop discretely
from p = q (1; 1) to q (0; 0), to lure the unproductive Bs into the sector as well. The
earnings di¤erential between groups A and B moves accordingly, as shown in Figure
A4, increasing continuously until all As are self-employed entrepreneurs in industry
1, at which point earnings jump in response to the discontinuous drop in the relative
price.
    Derivation of Earnings Di¤erential in Figure A4: Mean earnings denominated in
terms of industry 0 outputs are:
                                Z Xl                        Z 1
                       (Xl )            1
                             =       p    (Xl ) s1 (i) di +     s0 (i) di:            (21)
                       p0         0                          Xl

Replace the relative price of industry 0 output to industry 1 output, p = pp10 , with the
comparative advantage of the marginal entrepreneur, q, since these two are equal in
                                                                    (Xl ) (Xl0 )
equilibrium. Denote the earnings di¤erential as (Xl ; Xl0 )              p0
                                                                                 . It can be
expressed as:
                  Z Xl 0                                 Z Xl
                           1
    (Xl ; Xl0 ) =        q ( (Xl )   (Xl0 )) s1 (i) di +      q 1 (Xl ) s1 (i) s0 (i) di:
                  0                                                  Xl 0
                                                                                       (22)
For Xl < 1 and Xl0 = 0, where q = q (Xl ; Xl ), and q (Xl ; Xl ) = (Xl ) s (Xl ), di¤erenti-
ating with respect to Xl gives
                                                    Z Xl
                    @ (Xl ; 0)    0               2
                               = s (Xl ) s (Xl )         s1 (i) di > 0:                (23)
                      @Xl                            0

For Xl = 1 and Xl0 = 0, the drop in price from q (1; 1) to q (0; 0) results in a jump in
the mean earnings di¤erential equal to
                                                                  Z 1

For x = 1 and Xl0 > 0, where q = q (Xl0 ; Xl0 ), di¤erentiating with respect to Xl0 gives

3       Relationships in a Social Network
Since interactions have been restricted to be random, the analysis has so far abstracted
from changes in the social structure that could arise in response to the productive value
of interaction. The most interesting question is whether the majority will split up into
smaller social groups, formed around choice of industry, to capitalize on interaction. If
such splinter groups could form costlessly, then social interaction would no longer be
able to generate industrial strati…cation along ethnic lines.
    By developing a utility-based theory of interaction, explicitly stating social prefer-
ences and characterizing the optimal social structure, this section shows that splinter
groups will not arise so long as preferences are su¢ ciently diverse, and so long as dif-
ferent social relationships are not close substitutes for one another. Under these two
premises it is costly to con…ne social interactions to within a small group since the
quality of social matches deteriorates with decreasing group size.
    The theory developed in this section is constructed around a standard marriage
market as in Becker (1973). In addition to spousal matching, people are also related
by birth, which yields a larger social structure where individuals are interrelated not
just pairwise but in a social network. Since the social network is derived as the out-
come of matching, the problem analyzed here is di¤erent in nature from the problems
most commonly analyzed in the social network literature, for example in Jackson and
Wolinsky (1996), which focuses on strategic interaction between identical agents.


3.1     The Marriage Market
Take a very large …nite population i = 1; :::; N , which is divided into mutually exclusive
and exhaustive families by birth, with each family consisting of d > 3 individuals.
Every person i independently draws a trait ti , which could be for example beauty or
intelligence, uniformly distributed between zero and one:

Assumption 4 Individual traits ti are independent draws.

    The independence of the draw signi…es what can be thought of as maximal diversity:
even within families people have di¤erent traits.
    Based on realized traits, each person is assigned a spouse. To simplify, there are
no gender restrictions and spouses can belong to the same family.7 Traits are assumed
to be complementary inputs in marriage. A marriage between i and j yields utility
u (ti ; tj ), where the function u is symmetric and strictly increasing with a positive
cross-derivative:
    7
   Removing gender restrictions maps this problem into a one-sided assortative matching problem.
One-sided assortative matching is used in a di¤erent context in Kremer (1993).



                                              13
Assumption 5 Inputs are complementary: u (ti ; tj ) = u (tj ; ti ), u1 > 0, u2 > 0 and
u1;2 > 0.

    Since di¤erent relationships produce di¤erent utility, social relationships are not
perfect substitutes and there is an optimal matching of spouses. Assume that utility
is transferable, in which case the e¢ cient spousal matching has to maximize aggregate
utility. Labelling individuals according to rank, so that t1 < t2 < :::,8 it follows that
the e¢ cient matching is positively assortative: person one marries person two, person
three marries person four, ..., and person N 1 marries person N . To see this, let
the matching function v be symmetric and the cross-derivative positive. For traits
t1 < t2 < t3 < t4 , we show that the only e¢ cient matching is (t1 ; t2 ) and (t3 ; t4 ). As in
Becker (1973), we use a property of v when the cross-derivative is positive,

                                 v (a; d) + v (c; b) < v (a; b) + v (c; d)                           (26)

for a < c and b < d. Take an arbitrary e¢ cient matching (x1 ; x2 ) and (x3 ; x4 ), which
is a permutation of the traits t1 ; t2 ; t3 and t4 . Without loss of generality, relabel these
traits pairwise so that x1 < x2 and x3 < x4 . Also without loss of generality, relabel
the pairs so that x1 < x3 . This implies that x1 < x3 < x4 . Using the symmetry
of v, the aggregate utility from the arbitrary e¢ cient matching can be written as
v (x1 ; x2 ) + v (x4 ; x3 ). Since x1 < x4 it follows from (26) that x2 < x3 , otherwise
aggregate utility could be increased by interchanging x2 and x3 , just as b and d were
interchanged in (26). Consequently, with x1 < x2 < x3 < x4 , the arbitrarily chosen
e¢ cient matching (x1 ; x2 ) and (x3 ; x4 ) is identical to the e¢ cient matching (t1 ; t2 ) and
(t3 ; t4 ).


3.2       Splinter Groups
Say that two people i and j are related if they are married and/or belong to the same
family. De…ne a splinter group as a proper subset of the population where no one in
the subset is related to anyone outside of that subset. Given an e¢ cient assignment of
spouses in a very large population where traits are independently distributed, it follows
that:

Proposition 5 The probability that splinter groups exist is zero.

    Proof: De…ne a d-regular multigraph with loops, where every vertex corresponds to
a family, and every edge corresponds to a marriage. A splinter group is equivalent to
an unconnected component of this graph. Assortative marriages on independent traits
generate a random con…guration of vertices. A random con…guration is equivalent to
  8
      Since having equal-valued traits, ti = tj , is of measure zero, this possibility is ignored.

                                                      14
a regular random multigraph, as de…ned in Janson et al. (2000). A regular random
multigraph is asymptotically almost surely Hamilitonian for d > 3 (Janson et al. 2000).
Connectivity follows from Hamiltonicity, which rules out the existence of unconnected
components, and consequently, the existence of splinter groups.
    A partial explanation for this result is that if person i marries person j, then because
of the independence of traits, it is unlikely that anyone else in i’s family marries into
j’s family as well. As the population grows larger, it becomes less and less likely that
there is more than one marriage between the families of i and j. This “mismatch”
prevents i and j, and their families, from socially isolating themselves from the larger
population. The problem is more interesting than what this partial intuition conveys,
however. The likelihood of more than one marriage between two particular families
decreases as the population grows larger, but on the other hand, the number of families
for whom this event could occur increases. If, for example, d had been equal to two,
then these two e¤ects would have balanced, so that small splinter groups would have
formed even as the population approached in…nity. This proof most likely also goes
through for d      3, since it really only needs connectivity and since connectivity is
closely related to cubic graphs. The fourth edge is necessary in the case of multigraphs
to ensure Hamiltonicity, but Hamiltonicity is stronger than connectivity.
    In addition to the above proof, we can provide a more structured intuition for no
splinter groups by using a branching tree to trace out relationships in the population.
Let be the set of all families. De…ne an arbitrary family in as the singleton set
  (0). Let (1) be the set of families in = (0) with at least one family member
married to someone in the original family (0). De…ne (2) as the set of families in
  = ( (0) [ (1)) with at least one family member married to someone in (1). Con-
tinuing by iteration to more and more distant relations, let (r) be the set of families
in = ( (r 2) [ (r 1)) married to someone in (r 1). The variable r denotes
what is sometimes called the degree of separation between the initial family (0) and
the families in (r). The degree of separation is a measure of the social distance be-
tween individuals; compare Milgram (1967). The collection of these sets, [rq=0 (q),
constitutes a branching tree. The sets in this collection are mutually exclusive, but if
there are splinter groups, the sets are not exhaustive even as r ! 1. Denote by s (r)
the cardinality of the set (r). Since each family in (r) is composed of d family mem-
bers, where at least one member in each family by de…nition is married into (r 1),
the expansion of the tree [rq=0 (q) is bounded by

                                s (r + 1)    s (r) (d   1) :                           (27)

If equation (27) holds with equality, then as r increases s (r) very soon encompasses
the entire population. It turns out that the equation generally holds as an inequality,
however. The reason for this slowdown is threefold. First, a person in (r) could marry

                                            15
another person in (r). Second, a family in (r) could have more than one family
member married to someone in (r 1). Thirdly, several people in (r) could marry
into the same family. These three types of events combine to prevent each family in
  (r) from contributing a full d 1 new families to (r + 1), and consequently cause
(27) to hold as an inequality.
    Applying the branching tree [rq=0 (q) to the e¢ cient assortative matching, the
branching tree is overwhelmingly likely to grow to encompass the entire population in
the limit. Since the branching tree only expands to include people who are directly
or indirectly related, this limit result is equivalent to Proposition 5 that there are no
splinter groups. To see why the entire population is included in the limit, consider what
would happen if it were not true, if the branching tree died out without having reached
a positive fraction of the population. If this were the case, then (r) would eventually
have to grow arbitrarily small relative to the remainder set = ( (r 2) [ (r 1)),
and therefore the likelihood that someone in (r) married someone else in (r) rather
than in the remainder set, or that several people in (r 1) married into the same
family in (r) rather than in the remainder set, or that several people in (r) married
into the same family in the remainder set, must also grow arbitrarily small. But then
equation (27) should hold as an equality, implying that s (r + 1) > s (r), which contra-
dicts the premise that the branching tree died out without having reached the entire
population. Consequently, everyone in the population is either directly or indirectly
related, and there are no splinter groups.


3.3    Implications for Productivity
The social network developed here allows more individual choice than the random in-
teraction model analyzed earlier, since here industry choice can be made contingent
on every aspect of the social structure. The main results from the random interaction
model continue to hold nevertheless. A large group cannot align social relationships so
as to maximize productivity in a small industry where social interaction and produc-
tivity are complementary, without incurring the cost of deteriorating social matches
that comes from breaking up into smaller groups. This follows from the result that no
splinter groups arise under …rst-best matching on social traits. Since the social choice
set of ethnic minority groups is restricted anyway, these groups can limit their social
interactions to a single industry at no alternative cost. Ethnic minorities are therefore
well suited for social interaction-intensive industries.
    A social network with the same properties could also be derived from a meeting
technology where spouses meet and marry at random. The social structure derived
here can therefore equally well be thought of as arising in a rigid environment where
people meet randomly, as arising from e¢ cient matching. Since randomness is likely to

3.4    Future Model Extensions
An interesting extension for future work is to include both general and speci…c skills
in the same framework. In such a model of spillovers between sectors, it should be
possible to derive strati…cation in overall entrepreneurial activity as well as industry
strati…cation between di¤erent forms of self-employed entrepreneurship at the same
time. This would correspond to the current situation in the United States, where
groups like the Koreans are strongly clustered in a few business sectors, while at the
same time being overrepresented as self-employed owners in almost all other business
activities as well.
