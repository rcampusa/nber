We examine whether adult alcohol consumption and traffic fatalities are associated with the legal drinking
environment when a person was between the ages of 18 and 20. We find that moving from an environment
in which a person was never allowed to drink legally to one in which a person could always drink
legally was associated with a 20 to 30 percent increase in alcohol consumption and a ten percent increase
in fatal accidents for adult males. There were no statistically significant or practically important associations
between the legal drinking environment when young and adult female alcohol consumption and driving
fatalities.

Introduction

        Minimum legal drinking age (MLDA) laws are intended to curb alcohol use of young

adults and are justified primarily by evidence showing that higher minimum legal drinking ages

are associated with reduced alcohol consumption and fewer traffic fatalities among those

affected by the law.1 Recently, however, there have been calls from presidents of several

prominent colleges to lower the minimum drinking age, and to date, 135 presidents of colleges

have signed a statement, which is known as the Amethyst Initiative, asking for public officials

to:

        •   Support an informed and dispassionate public debate over the effects of the 21 year-

            old drinking age.

        •   Consider whether the 10% highway fund “incentive” encourages or inhibits that

            debate.

        •   Invite new ideas about the best ways to prepare young adults to make responsible

            decisions about alcohol.2

In addition to this high profile questioning of the desirability of a minimum legal drinking age of

21, several states have recently considered legislative action to lower the legal drinking age.3

        An important aspect of the renewed debate about the efficacy of a minimum legal

drinking age of 21 is whether it has long term benefits. Those who support a legal drinking age

of 21 argue that the law reduces alcohol consumption throughout life by reducing adolescent

consumption that sets the pattern for lifetime alcohol use. To support this argument, proponents

cite research linking early onset of alcohol use to later alcoholism, and research by

neuroscientists on how alcohol affects adolescent brain development. Those who want to lower

the legal drinking age argue that early onset of alcohol use is simply a marker for a personality

type most prone to alcoholism and not a cause of later alcoholism, and they are skeptical of the

neuroscience research because most has been done on rats. They argue that the evidence of long

term effects from human subjects is too sparse and inconclusive to justify a minimum drinking

age of 21.

        Almost all social science research related to MLDA laws has focused on young adults,

and therefore, social science has not contributed much to the debate over the long term

consequences of MLDA laws.4 In this paper, we begin to fill this gap in the social science

research base. We examine whether lower minimum drinking ages during late adolescence are

associated with higher rates of alcohol use and traffic fatalities among adults with an average age

of 35. It is widely acknowledged, even by opponents of a legal age of 21, that a lower minimum

drinking ages increase alcohol use among those 18 to 20, although opponents of an age 21 limit

argue (without much evidence) that a lower legal drinking age decreases heavy (e.g., binge)

alcohol use. Assuming that lower minimum drinking ages increase alcohol use of those 18 to 20

years of age, adult alcohol consumption would also be higher if alcohol use during late

adolescence has long term consequences, as some research suggests. The reduced legal

sanctions associated with a lower legal drinking age will increase alcohol use while young, and

  The only prior study that we are aware of is Cook and Moore (2001). They examined the association between
whether a person’s state of residence at age 14 had a minimum legal drinking age of 18 (versus higher) and alcohol
consumption at approximately age 24 (sample ages were 17 to 31). They found that the age 14 drinking
environment was significantly associated with binge drinking at later ages; a drinking age of 18 was associated with
a 7% greater probability of binge drinking at least four times in the last month at later ages. One issue of concern
about this study is the relevance of the age 14 legal drinking environment, as relatively few 14 year olds drink. In
addition, many states lowered the legal drinking age between 1972 and 1976, so a substantial portion (perhaps as
many as 25 to 30 percent) of NLSY79 respondents (aged 7 to 18 between 1972 and 1976) faced a legal drinking age
at age 18 that was different than at age 14.


                                                                                                                   3
this increase will in turn increase adult use beyond the level that would occur if the drinking age

was 21. It is this hypothesis that motivates our research.

         We find that lower minimum drinking ages are associated with significantly higher rates

of alcohol use and more traffic fatalities among adult males. We do not find similar effects

among females.5 These findings suggest that a minimum legal drinking age of 21 has benefits

that extend beyond adolescence and these benefits need to be considered in the debate over the

efficacy of current MLDA laws. Our study also highlights that more social science research is

needed in this area and that social science research can contribute significantly to the debate,

which is grounded in biology and neuroscience, about the long term consequences of MLDA

laws.



Neurobiology, Economics, and Long Term Consequences of MLDA Laws

         Problematic alcohol use is associated with a variety of behavioral characteristics that

have been referred to as psychological dysregulation (Clark and Winters 2002; Clark et al. 2008).

         “Psychological dysregulation is a deficiency in the ability to regulate attention,

         emotions and behavior in response to environmental challenges.” (p. 376, Clark

         et al. 2008)

The part of the brain that controls many functions related to psychological dysregulation is the

prefrontal cortex. Notably, adolescence is a period during which changes in the prefrontal cortex

are at a peak; there is an increase in white matter and a decrease in gray matter in this area of the

brain (Klingberg et al. 1999; Spear 2000; Schmithorst et al. 2002; Chambers et al. 2003; White

5
 The different effects by gender may be due to different effects of MLDA laws on adolescent alcohol consumption,
different neurological and social effects of early alcohol use, or both. There is some evidence that minimum
drinking age laws had different effects on male and female adolescents (Kaestner 2000; Cook and Moore 2001).
Evidence that neurological effects of adolescent alcohol use differ by gender is also available (Medina et al. 2008).
Finally, peer effects on alcohol use have been found to differ by gender (e.g., Duncan et al. 2005).


                                                                                                                    4
and Swartzwelder 2004; Nagy et al. 2004; Zhang et al. 2005; Clark et al. 2008). In addition,

during adolescence the frontal lobe of the brain increasingly controls behavior, a process known

as frontalization (Rubia et al. 2000; White 2004).

       White matter is important because it is the tissue through which information is passed to

different areas of the brain, for example, for executive cognitive functioning. Executive

cognitive functioning, which is the individual’s ability to set goals, monitor and regulate

behavior, think flexibly and abstractly, and control attention, is a major component of

psychological regulation/dysregulation (Luna et al. 2001; Luna and Sweeney 2004; Moss 2008;

Clark et al. 2008; McNamee et al. 2008). White matter volume is associated with improved

executive cognitive functioning. One study found that performance on tests designed to measure

executive cognitive functioning were strongly correlated with white matter volume (Warner et al.

2006). Therefore, changes in white matter in the prefrontal cortex are an important aspect of

brain maturation and are likely related to behaviors that depend on psychological regulation such

as alcohol use. In fact, white matter development has been shown to be susceptible to disruption

by exposure to alcohol. Adolescents who consumed large amounts of alcohol have been found

to have smaller prefrontal white matter volume (DeBellis et al. 2005). Similarly, adolescents

with high levels of alcohol use have been found to have white matter abnormalities compared

with control groups (Tapert and Schweinsburg 2005). These neurological effects of adolescent

alcohol use can possibly lead to an impaired ability to achieve psychological regulation and may

result in increased rates of alcohol use throughout life.

       Adolescence is also a period of change in other parts of the brain than the prefrontal

cortex. Changes in the hippocampus and amygdala also occur during this period, and these areas

of the brain are thought to affect memory and reward functions (White 2004; Clark et al. 2008).




                                                                                                   5
Alcohol use has been associated with changes to these areas of the brain (White 2004; Clark et

al. 2008). It has been hypothesized that adolescent alcohol use leads to a reduced ability to

respond appropriately to risk and reward situations, a problem shown to lead to higher

prevalence of risky behaviors such as alcohol consumption (Fromme et al., 1997). Here too, if

the neurological effects are permanent, it may result in higher lifetime use of alcohol.

       Social factors may also cause early alcohol use to result in a permanent increase in

alcohol use. Early use of alcohol may change peer groups, school performance and other

behaviors that in turn can cause greater current and future use of alcohol. In addition, early

alcohol use can lead to functional and learned tolerance that decreases impairment and may

increase future alcohol use (National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism 1995). These

social mechanisms reinforce any biological mechanisms that may cause long term effects of

minimum drinking age laws on alcohol consumption.

       These biological and social effects of alcohol use integrate well with economic models of

addiction that have been developed to explain persistent use of alcohol and other addictive

substances (e.g., Becker and Murphy 1988). One of the key features of these models is that past

consumption influences present consumption. For example, the model of Becker and Murphy

(1988) hypothesizes that consumers recognize this inter-temporal link and respond accordingly

when making decisions about current consumption. Thus, a (known) future price increase will

decrease current consumption because consumers realize that their current consumption will

likely raise future consumption at a time when the price will be relatively higher. Neurological

changes related to alcohol such as those described above provide a biological basis to link past

and current alcohol consumption.




                                                                                                   6
       Adolescence may be a particularly critical period for economic models of alcohol

addiction, as they are for neurological models. If alcohol use during adolescence results in

contemporaneous and permanent (neurological) decreases in the ability to achieve psychological

regulation, then current and future alcohol use are likely to be higher. Individuals (teens) are

unlikely to know of these effects, although they may realize that those who consume a lot of

alcohol while young tend to also do so while old. However, alcohol use may decrease the ability

to recognize the future impact of current consumption because it adversely affects executive

cognitive functioning, which itself is still developing during adolescence. Moreover, adolescents

have been shown to discount the future more heavily than adults (O’Donoghue and Rabin 2000,

Greene 1986, Nurmi 1991).

       It is straightforward to apply these considerations to the case of minimum legal drinking

age laws. Consider a reduction in the minimum legal drinking age from 21 to 18. Such a

decrease will reduce the full cost of alcohol (inclusive of legal sanctions) for those ages 18 to 20

and as a result will increase their consumption of alcohol. This is shown in Figure 1 by the

arrows showing an increase in alcohol consumption prior to age 21.

                             Figure 1-Long Term Effects of MLDA

Alcohol Consumption




                      Age 21                                 Age 35


                                                                                                   7
       We show two possible patterns. The smaller shift in alcohol consumption prior to age 21

is consistent with a change in consumption due only to reduced legal sanctions. The lower legal

drinking age raises consumption prior to age 21, but at age 21 and beyond when the legal

sanctions no longer apply, alcohol consumption is the same as it would be if the legal drinking

age was 21. The larger shift in consumption prior to age 21 reflects the possibility that a lower

legal drinking age will have additional effects besides those due to legal sanctions, for example

because of the biological and social effects described earlier. In this case, a lower legal drinking

age puts the youth on a higher trajectory of alcohol use, and alcohol consumption in later life

would be higher for those who could legally drink prior to age 21. This is the hypothesis that we

investigate.

       Interestingly, if a lower legal drinking age puts youth on a different trajectory of alcohol

consumption, as shown in Figure 1, then estimates of the effect of the MLDA on consumption

that use a regression discontinuity design (RDD) based on the age 21 threshold will

underestimate the effect of the MLDA—effect of lowering the drinking age, for example, to age

18. In terms of figure 1, the RDD estimate of the effect of the age 21 threshold will correspond

to the smaller arrow. Carpenter and Dobkin (2009) conduct such an analysis and find that

alcohol consumption, drinking days, increases by 21 percent at the threshold. This is a sizeable

effect, and as noted, smaller than the effect of lowering the drinking age if lowering the drinking

age changes the trajectory of alcohol use as evidence suggests is possible. It is also important to

note that the difference in drinking patterns could grow larger with age, as shown in Figure 1.

The biological and social determinants of alcohol use imply that alcohol use is a dynamic (e.g.,

addictive) behavior, and early differences in use may become exacerbated as people age.




                                                                                                      8
Research Design

           Our objective is to obtain estimates of the association between the minimum legal

drinking age, and adult alcohol use and traffic fatalities that could plausibly be given a causal

interpretation. To accomplish this goal, we estimate the following regression model for alcohol

consumption:

       ALCLijkt = β 0 + δ jt + γ k + β 1 PROP _ LEGAL jk + β 2TREND jk + β 3TREND _ SQ jk
                 + β 4 ALC _ TAX jkt + β 5 DEMOGijkt + u ijkt


(1) i = 1,..., N            (persons)
    j = 1,...,51            (states)
    k = 1960,...,1975        (birth year)
    t = 1995,...,2005        (year)

In equation (1), the dependent variable is alcohol consumption of person i, in year t who was

born in year k and in state j. The key independent variable is the proportion of years between

ages 18 and 20 that the person could legally drink (PROP_LEGAL), which varies by state (j) and

year of birth (k). We include controls for state-year fixed effects (δjt); birth year fixed effects

(γk); and demographic (DEMOG) characteristics (race and education).6

           As noted, ideally, we would like to interpret estimates of the association between the

minimum legal drinking age and adult alcohol consumption obtained from equation (1) as causal.

The primary threat to a causal interpretation of the estimated association is from omitted factors

that vary by state and year-of-birth because our key independent variable, the proportion of years

between ages 18 and 20 that a person could legally drink, varies only by state and birth year.

States changed laws over time and we use these state-specific differences to identify the long

term consequences of MLDA laws. To partly address this potential threat, we include in the

                                                                                                      9
regression model a state-specific trend for year-of-birth (TRENDjk). We allow for a quadratic

trend. We also include the average of the sum of federal and state beer taxes (ALC_TAXjkt) from

the time the person was 18 to the current year. The inclusion of TRENDjk and ALC_TAXjkt is an

attempt to control for unmeasured factors that affect alcohol consumption that are state-specific

and that vary by birth cohort.

          A similar model is estimated for traffic fatalities:

      FATAL jkt = α 0 + π jt + ρ k + α 1 PROP _ LEGAL jk + α 2TREND jk + α 3TREND _ SQ jk
                 + α 4 ALC _ TAX   jkt   + vijkt

(2)
      j = 1,...,51      (states)
      k = 1960,...,1975 (birth year)
      t = 1995,...,2005 (year)

Equation (2) is similar to equation (1), but is estimated using data aggregated at the state (j), year

of birth (k), and year (t) level. The dependent variable is the number of fatal traffic accidents per

100,000 persons in the state/year-of-birth/calendar year cell. Demographic controls are not

included in equation (2) because of data limitations. We control for unmeasured state-year and

year of birth fixed-effects, and we include a state-specific, year-of-birth (quadratic) trend and

average alcohol tax described above.



Data

          The two outcomes we examine are alcohol use and traffic fatalities. Data on alcohol use

comes from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) from the years 1995 to

2005. We limited the sample to individuals from those survey years born between 1960 and

1975 because these individuals were in their late teens in the early to late 80s when most states




                                                                                                    10
raised the MLDA to 21.7 Those born in 1960 were 18 years old in 1978, which is a period when

many states had a drinking age of less than 21, age 35 in 1995, and age 45 in 2005. Those born

in 1975 were 18 in 1993, when all states had a minimum drinking age of 21, age 20 in 1995, and

age 30 in 2005. Approximately 36% of the selected sample could drink legally for some period

between ages 18 and 20. In sum, the sample selection criteria provided a group of adults with a

mean age of approximately 35 with a significant portion who were able to drink legally between

ages 18 and 20.

         The BRFSS contains self reported information about alcohol use in the past month.

Based on the available information, we constructed several measures of alcohol use: the

proportion of days drank alcohol in past month, number of drinks in past month, whether binge

drank in past months (5 or more drinks at one time), and the proportion of days binge drank in

past month. Number of drinks in past month was constructed from information about the

number of days drinking in the past month and the average number of drinks on days drinking.

Studies evaluating the reliability of self reported measures of substance use in BRFSS have

generally found that the data is of high quality (e.g., Nelson et al. 2001).

         Additionally, the BRFSS contains information about state of residence, socioeconomic

status and demographic characteristics. We used a limited number of personal characteristics in

the regression model: age, race, gender, and education status. All variables are measured as

dummy variables for each possible category except education, which is grouped into four

categories (less than high school degree, high school degree, some college, and bachelor’s degree

7
  We did not use earlier birth cohorts that were affected by changes in the minimum legal drinking age that occurred
in early 70s (mostly 1972-73) because the BRFSS was not a national survey prior to 1995. Thus, the composition of
states would be changing prior to 1995, and therefore, age, period and cohort effects would be mechanically linked
to state effects. Including additional birth year cohorts and limiting the data to post 1994 period, as we have done,
would make it difficult to identify age, period and cohort effects. These problems are exacerbated by the desire to
control for state-specific year of birth trends. Finally, extending the number of birth cohorts provides greater
opportunity for the model to be mis-specified given our dependence on the use of state-specific trends in year of
birth to control for unobservable variables.


                                                                                                                  11
or more). We did not want to control for characteristics that may have been affected by alcohol

use such as employment and marital status. We included education, which may also be affected

by alcohol use, but show results with and without it in the model. As shown later, including

education in the model had virtually no effect on estimates. In addition, results not presented

revealed that the minimum legal drinking age was not associated with employment or marital

status. State of residence is used to merge state-specific information; most notably information

about the minimum legal drinking age when the person was between ages 18 and 20.

       Data on fatal traffic accidents were taken from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System

(FARS) from the years 1995 to 2006. FARS is a dataset containing information about every

traffic accident in which there was a fatality including information about driver and passenger

characteristics. We aggregated the number of fatal accidents each year by state of residence,

year of birth and gender using the characteristics of drivers involved in the accident. Thus, each

aggregated cell contains the number of fatal accidents each year that involved drivers of a given

age and gender from a particular state. The aggregate number of fatal accidents was then

normalized by the relevant (gender and age) population of the state and multiplied by 100,000 to

create a measure of the number of fatal accidents per 100,000 residents for a given gender and

age. We also aggregated fatal accidents by specific times of the day. We examined two periods:

8 pm to 12 am, and 12:01 am to 4 am. Focusing on nighttime fatalities is consistent with the

literature on the effects of minimum legal drinking ages on youth traffic fatalities. However, the

rationale for focusing on this time period is not as strong for adults as it is for youth because

among adults, a smaller proportion of fatalities occur at night as compared to youth. At age 40,

about 30 percent of all fatalities are between 8 pm to 4 am whereas at age 20, the similar figure is

45 percent, and the difference is almost all between the 12 am to 4 am period.




                                                                                                    12
       FARS does not provide socioeconomic characteristics and provides only limited

demographic attributes—age and gender of driver. Race is either missing or unknown for over

half of the drivers. As in the case of BRFSS, state of residence is used to merge information

about minimum legal drinking age.

       The key independent variable is the minimum legal drinking age. MLDA laws in many

states were raised to 21 between 1978 and 1988. We used data from the Distilled Spirits Council

of the United States to identify the specific years of law changes in each state. These data have

been frequently used in the literature (e.g., Carpenter and Dobkin 2008). Based on state of

residence and computed year of birth, we determined if an individual could legally drink at the

ages of 18, 19, and 20 and computed the proportion of years between the ages of 18 and 20 that

the individual could legally drink. As an alternative measure of a person’s drinking status, we

classified people into groups by whether they could always legally drink between ages 18 and

20, sometimes legally drink between these ages, or never legally drink between these ages

(reference category). In cases where a law change occurring midyear affected an individual’s

ability to drink legally, their ability to drink at that age was computed as the proportion of the

year for which the lower drinking age was in effect. Laws with grandfather clauses were taken

into account when determining the ability to drink legally.

       A limitation of both BRFSS and FARS is that there is no information on year of birth.

Thus, year of birth was computed as (current year) – (age). There is the potential for

measurement error in this computation, so year of birth was alternatively computed as (current

year) – (age + 1). In the case where the two methods produced differing estimates of an

individual’s ability to drink legally between ages 18 and 20, the observation was dropped;

otherwise the first method was used. This exclusion eliminated less than 10% of the sample.




                                                                                                     13
       A second limitation of both data sets is that there is no information on state of residence

at ages 18 to 20 that we can use to construct a measure of the legal drinking environment at that

age. Instead, we use the current state of residence to make these assignments. The

misclassification of the legal drinking environment resulting from this data limitation is non-

trivial. Data from the 2000 US Census suggests that approximately 55% of persons in our age

ranges currently reside in the state that they were born. However, this is likely to be an

understatement of the proportion of people who currently reside in the same state they did at age

18. For example, evidence we describe below suggests that using the proportion of people who

were born in the same state that they currently reside understates the proportion of persons

currently residing in the same state as they were at age 14 by nearly 10 percentage points, which

would increase the fraction of the sample correctly assigned to 65%. In addition, approximately

30% of those people who do not currently reside in the state they were born were born in a

bordering state. The correlation between the legal drinking environment at age 18 in a person’s

current state of residence and in their border states is approximately 0.7. So we can expect an

additional 7% of the sample to be correctly assigned for this reason. In sum, we expect that at

least 70%, but perhaps as much as 80%, of our sample will be assigned the correct legal drinking

environment.

       To reduce the extent of this measurement problem, in some analyses, we limited the

sample to states that had a relatively high proportion of current residents that were born in that

state. Using data from the 2000 US Census, we constructed a measure of the proportion of non-

immigrant (non foreign-born) current residents that were born in the same state for three age

groups (20 to 30, 31 to 40, and 41 to 50). We divided states into two groups: states in which

50% or less of current residents were born in that state, and states in which more than 50% of




                                                                                                     14
current residents were born in that state. We refer to these as high- and low-migration states,

respectively. Approximately 56% of the BRFSS sample and 60% of the FARS sample lived in

what we will refer to as low-migration states. The proportion of current residents born in that

state was 66% and 38% respectively.8 Note that these proportions likely understate substantially

the proportion of people who currently reside in the same state they did at age 18, as described

above. It is also the case that low-educated persons are less likely to migrate, and a relatively

high proportion of low-educated persons live in the state that they were born. For example, data

from the 2000 US Census indicate that for those 31 to 40 the proportion of low-educated persons

living in the same state they were born in is 72 percent. Additionally, data from the National

Longitudinal Survey of Youth indicate that among those with an average age of 40,

approximately 80 percent of those with a high school degree or less live in the same state as they

did at age 14. Given this evidence, we limit the sample to low-educated, which is defined as

high school or less, to reduce measurement error associated with assigning the legal drinking

environment based on current state of residence.

         The purpose of limiting the sample to those in low-migration states, or to low-educated

persons, is to reduce measurement error. If such measurement error was random, we would

expect larger (absolute value) estimates because random measurement error biases estimates

toward zero.9 However, the association between the legal drinking age and alcohol consumption

(fatalities) may be heterogeneous and may differ by state groupings (i.e., low-migration states)

and by education status. Therefore, it is not clear that estimates obtained using these samples

8
  In addition, the lack of information about state of residence at ages 18 to 20 also led us to drop persons identified
as Hispanic from the alcohol use analysis because of their greater likelihood of not living in that state between ages
18 and 20. We are unable to exclude Hispanics in the analysis of traffic fatalities because information about
race/ethnicity is frequently either missing or unknown.
9
  This is not necessarily the case when the mis-measured variable is binary. In the binary case, the error and true
variable are negatively correlated (Aigner 1973; Savoka 2000). However, unless more than half of the sample is
mis-classified, estimates will still be biased toward zero.


                                                                                                                      15
will be larger in absolute value. Nevertheless, the estimates from analyses using these sub-

groups will be much less affected by measurement error. Thus, while such estimates may not be

informative about the long term effect of the MLDA for the entire sample, they are unlikely to be

seriously biased by measurement error.



Results

       Table 1 presents estimates of the association between legal drinking restrictions when

young and the proportion of days that adults drank alcohol in the past month. The format of the

table is as follows. Estimates for males are presented in the top half of the table and those for

females are in the bottom half. For each sample (male and female), several different model

specifications are estimated. Estimates in column (1) are from a model that includes state-year

fixed effects, year-of-birth fixed effects, and race fixed effects. Estimates in column (2) are from

a model that includes the previous controls and a quadratic, state-specific trend for year-of-birth.

In column (3), educational attainment (HS, some college, BA or more) is added to the model.

Estimates in columns (4) and (5) are from a model that is identical to that in column (3), but the

samples are limited to those in low-migration states (column 4) or low-educated persons (column

5). Finally, we also estimate each model (as indicated by column) twice using a different

measure of the legal drinking environment: either the proportion of years between ages 18 and

20 that a person was able to legally drink, or two dummy variables indicating that a person could

always drink legally between ages 18 and 20 or that a person could drink legally only some of

the years between ages 18 and 20 (reference group is never able to legally drink).

       Estimates in Table 1 suggest that the legal drinking environment while young has no

statistically, or practically important, association with the proportion of days in the past month




                                                                                                     16
that adults drank alcohol. There are no statistically significant estimates and all estimates are

small in magnitude. The largest estimate is in column (5) for males and it indicates that always

being able to drink while young is associated with a 10 percent, or 0.017 percentage point,

increase in the proportion of days that adult males drank. All other estimates are considerably

smaller and there is no consistent pattern to the estimates to suggest an association between the

legal drinking environment while young and the proportion of days that adults drank.

       The next outcome we investigated was the number of drinks consumed in the past month.

Estimates related to this outcome are presented in Table 2. Estimates in the top half of the table

indicate that among adult males, there is a significant association between the legal drinking

environment while young and the number of drinks consumed in the past month. Estimates in

columns (1) through (4) indicate that moving from an environment of never being able to drink

to always being able to drink is associated with an increase in consumption of approximately 3.5

drinks (18 percent) per month.

       It is noteworthy that estimates in columns (1) through (3) are so similar. Adding controls

for state-specific, year-of-birth trends and the average state alcohol tax for each birth cohort had

little effect on estimates. Similarly, adding education to the model, a factor that may be

influenced by alcohol use, had little effect on estimates.

       Limiting the sample to those from low-migration states yields estimates that are also

similar to those obtained using the complete sample. While we expected that limiting the sample

in this way would reduce measurement error and likely increase in absolute value the magnitude

of estimates, we did not find this to be the case. However, as noted, it is not necessarily true that

we should find larger estimates in this sample, because although measurement error may be less,

there may be differences in the underlying association. We stress, however, that the estimate in




                                                                                                    17
column (4) is much less likely to be affected by measurement error. Approximately 70% of

persons in these states were born in that state and it is likely that a larger proportion (perhaps

80%) of persons lived in that state at age 18. While estimates in column (4) may not be useful

for making inferences about the effect of the young adult legal drinking environment on adult

alcohol consumption in all states, it is an arguably credible estimate of the effect in those states.

Finally, standard errors of estimates are relatively large and it is not possible to differentiate in a

statistical sense between estimates in columns (3) and (4).

        Estimates pertaining to the sample of low-educated persons (column 5) indicate that

always being able to drink legally between the ages of 18 and 20 is associated with an increase in

alcohol consumption of between 5.9 (27 percent) and 7.7 (36 percent) drinks per month for this

group. In this case, estimates are larger than those obtained for the complete sample. This may

reflect less measurement error or a different underlying relationship between minimum legal

drinking age and alcohol consumption. Here again, however, we stress that for this group,

measurement error is not severe—according to data from the NLSY, approximately 80% of low-

educated persons live in the same state of residence as they did at age 14. Thus, it is likely that

an even higher proportion of this group lived in the same state of residence as they did at age 18,

and the estimate for this group is likely to be credible even if it may not be useful for making

inferences about the effect of the young adult legal drinking environment on adult alcohol

consumption for all persons.

        In contrast to males, estimates related to females indicate that there is no statistically

significant association between the legal drinking environment while young and the number of

drinks consumed in the past month. Besides the lack of statistical significance, most estimates

for the female sample are relatively small and not robust to small changes in specification.




                                                                                                     18
Consider estimates in column (3). The estimate associated with the dummy variable “Always

Legal” is 0.188. However, changing the specification of the legal drinking environment only

slightly, using the proportion of years that a person can legally drink instead of the two dummy

variables (“Sometimes” and “Always”), yields an estimate of the same association of -0.549.

Neither estimate is particularly large. Only among the low-educated sample of women do we

obtain an estimate that is not small, but this estimate is not statistically significant and not

consistent with other estimates.

        Table 3 presents estimates of the association between legal drinking restrictions when

young and the probability that an adult had five or more drinks at one time (binge drinking) in

the past month. In general, estimates suggest that there is not a statistically significant, or

practically important, association between the legal drinking environment while young and the

probability of binge drinking in past month. The exception is for the low-educated male sample.

Among such males, always being able to drink legally between ages 18 and 20 is associated with

a 4.9 to 5.8 percentage point, or 16 to 19 percent, increase in the probability of binge drinking.

These estimates are consistent with the pattern of results for the complete sample of males;

estimates in columns (1) through (4) are similar and suggest that being legally able to drink in

late adolescence is associated with a five percent increase in adult male binge drinking.

        We also examined whether the proportion of days of binge drinking episodes in the past

month among adults was associated with the legal drinking environment while young. Table 4

presents these estimates. Here, we find evidence of a statistically significant association for

males, but not females. Among adult males, the estimate in column (3) indicates that those who

grew up in an environment in which they were always able to drink legally between the ages of

18 and 20 have a 1.2 percentage point (30 percent) higher proportion of binge drinking days in




                                                                                                     19
the past month than those who grew up in an environment in which they were never allowed to

legally drink. Again, estimates in columns (1) through (4) are quite similar. For low-educated

males, always being legally able to drink versus never being able to legally drink is associated

with a 2.6 percentage point (50%) increase in the proportion of binge drinking days. We note

that analyses underlying Table 4 have limited statistical power to detect small effects. In

addition, while point estimates are large, standard errors do not rule out much smaller (or larger)

effects. Finally, we reiterate that estimates obtained using the low-migration and low-educated

samples are much less likely to be affected by measurement error.

       To summarize, estimates presented to this point indicate that the legal drinking

environment when young appears to have lasting effects for males. Men who grew up in an

environment that allowed them to drink between the ages of 18 and 20 reported drinking a

greater number of drinks in the past month and more episodes of binge drinking in the past

month than men who grew up in an environment that prohibited them from drinking during late

adolescence. Magnitudes of the associations were non-trivial suggesting differences of 20 to 30

percent in these measures of alcohol use, and even larger for low-educated males. No such

associations were found for females.

       One question that arises is whether effect sizes of this size are plausible. We believe so

for two reasons. First, our estimates are in line those in Cook and Moore (2001), which is the

only other study of this type. Cook and Moore (2001) reported that a MLDA of 18 (versus

higher), measured when a person was 14, was associated with a 7 percent increase in severe (at

least four times) binge drinking at approximately age 24. However, this was for a sample of both

men and women, but as Cook and Moore (2001) also showed, the effect of the MLDA on binge

drinking of those ages 18 to 21 who were constrained by the law was nearly three times larger




                                                                                                   20
for males than females. Extrapolating from this estimate of the male-female difference suggests

a 21 percent effect of the age 14 drinking environment on binge drinking at age 24. This is

similar in magnitude to what we found. Second, as noted above, there are plausible reasons to

expect that the effect of minimum legal drinking age laws will grow with age because of the

neurological and social aspects of alcohol addiction. Cook and Moore (2001) reported a

contemporaneous effect of the MLDA of approximately 20 percent for males. Similarly,

Carpenter and Dobkin (2009) reported that a MLDA of 21 reduced drinking of 20 year olds by

21 percent, which is an underestimate of the effect of lowering the MLDA.. Therefore, our

finding of a 20 to 30 percent effect of the legal drinking environment while young on alcohol use

of adult males at age 35 is quite plausible.

        To investigate whether the legal drinking environment had any association with other

outcomes related to alcohol use, we conducted similar analyses for two measures of health, the

proportion of days in poor mental and poor physical health, and a measure of tobacco use—

whether a person smoked at all in the past month.10 These estimates are presented in Table 5.

Only those estimates obtained from a model corresponding to column (3) in the tables presented

earlier are shown. In general, estimates in Table 5 are statistically insignificant and small in

magnitude when measured against the mean. The only exception is for females and the estimate

of the association between the proportion of years between ages 18 and 20 that a person could

legally drink and the proportion of days in poor mental health. However, when we use a slightly

different characterization of the legal drinking environment when young (i.e., always or

sometimes legal), this significant association is no longer evident. In sum, there is little evidence



10
  We also examined current marital status and employment. Results indicated that there was no statistically
significant or practically important association between minimum legal drinking age and current marital status and
employment.


                                                                                                                 21
of an association between the legal drinking environment while young and the outcomes shown

in Table 5.

         Given that we have found evidence consistent with a long lasting effect of the legal

drinking environment while young on alcohol use of adult males, we investigated whether this

apparent change in alcohol consumption was also associated with traffic fatalities. Unlike self-

reported alcohol use, traffic fatalities are an objective measure of greater alcohol use because of

the strong, firmly established association between alcohol use and traffic fatalities. Moreover,

for males, we found evidence of an association between the legal drinking environment while

young and heavy alcohol use—those legally allowed to drink while young reported a greater

number of drinks in the past month and a higher proportion of days binge drinking. It is likely

that this elevated use of alcohol, which we found to be non-trivial in magnitude, would result in

more traffic fatalities.

         Table 6 presents estimates of the association between the legal drinking environment

while young and fatal traffic accidents among adults. We consider two measures of fatal

accidents—all accidents and evening (8 pm to 12 am) accidents. Estimates are obtained from

model specifications similar to those used for alcohol. There are only a few differences. We do

not have information about education and race/ethnicity, so we cannot control for these

variables. Estimates pertaining to all fatal accidents are presented in the top half for both males

and females, and estimates pertaining to evening fatal accidents are presented in the bottom half.

         We focus the discussion on estimates in columns (2) and (3) because, unlike the case of

alcohol consumption, there is evidence that inclusion of controls for state-specific trends for

year-of-birth matter.11 Estimates in these columns are obtained from arguably a more credible


11
  Some (as a previous reader of the paper did) may ask why the inclusion of state-specific trends matter for traffic
fatalities and not alcohol consumption. The answer is that there is no reason for the (mediating) effect of this control


                                                                                                                    22
specification. For males, estimates indicate that growing up in an environment that allowed

drinking between ages 18 and 20, versus not being able to drink legally during these years, is

associated with an increase in fatal traffic accidents as an adult. In the top panel, estimates in

column (2) indicate that traffic fatalities (per 100,000) of those who were always able to legally

drink between ages 18 and 20 are between 2.6 (9 percent) and 3.1 (11 percent) higher than for

those who were never able to legally drink between ages 18 and 20. A similar result is obtained

in the case of evening accidents; those always able to legally drink had approximately 10 percent

more accidents than those never able to legally drink. Restricting the sample to low-migration

states (column 3) yields similar estimates, although slightly larger in magnitude. In other results

(not presented), we obtained estimates of the association between the legal drinking environment

while young and fatal accidents between 12 am and 4 am. Estimates from these regressions

indicated that the legal drinking environment was not associated with fatal accidents during this

period of the day.12

         Among females, estimates in the top half of Table 6 indicate that there is no statistically

significant, or practically important, association between the legal drinking environment while

young and fatal accidents of adults. However, there is an association between the legal drinking

environment and evening fatal accidents for females. This is surprising given the absence of any

evidence that the legal drinking environment while young was associated with increased alcohol

consumption for females. Some caution should be used in interpreting the estimates for females

in the context of evening accidents because of the lack of statistical power; standard errors of the


variable to be symmetric in its importance. There is simply more changes in traffic fatalities that are correlated with
year of birth and differ by state than in alcohol consumption.
12
   It is important to note that the time of day pattern of traffic accidents is very different for adults than youth. Most
studies of the effect of alcohol and alcohol policies on youth traffic accidents focus on the night (8 p.m. to 12 a.m.)
and late night (12 a.m. to 4 a.m.) period. This is because these periods of the day constitute a relatively large share
of all traffic accidents for youth. This is not the case for adults. The late night period has a much smaller proportion
of traffic fatalities among adults than youths.


                                                                                                                       23
estimates are large and unable to detect effect sizes below approximately 30 percent. More

importantly, these estimates are inconsistent with estimates of the association between legal

drinking environment and all fatal accidents for females. Finally, in the case of nighttime (12 am

to 4am) fatal accidents (results not presented), estimates of the association between the legal

dinking environment while young and adult accidents indicated no significant associations.



Conclusion

       There is a large literature on the effects of minimum legal drinking age laws on young

adult’s use of alcohol and traffic fatalities. The preponderance of evidence from this literature

suggests that higher minimum legal drinking ages reduces alcohol consumption and traffic

fatalities among young adults, and this evidence has been used to justify a minimum drinking age

of 21. Recently, however, there has been a renewed debate over the wisdom of having a

minimum legal drinking age of 21. Opponents of the minimum drinking age of 21, most notably

university administrators associated with the Amethyst Initiative, argue that legal sanctions have

not prevented drinking by those age 18 to 20 and, in fact, have exacerbated problem drinking

(e.g., binge drinking). Empirical evidence to support this view has been provided by Miron and

Tetelbaum (2007).

       An issue that is relevant to the debate over the efficacy of a minimum drinking age of 21,

but that has largely been ignored by the social science research community, is whether a

minimum drinking age of 21 has long term consequences. Supporters of the higher legal

drinking age often argue that a higher legal drinking age has long term benefits, but support for

this argument is sparse and at best preliminary. Most of the evidence comes from neurobiology




                                                                                                    24
and studies of brain imaging and laboratory experiments with rats. Scientists involved in these

studies readily admit the preliminary nature of the research:

       “Several small cross-sectional studies have suggested that there may be measurable

       differences between adolescents with AUD [alcohol use disorders] and reference

       adolescents in specific areas of brain structure and function. … Policies advocating

       alcohol abstinence during adolescence would be supported by findings indicating

       augmented adverse effects on brain development. In this context, it is not surprising that

       the available findings have sometimes been over-interpreted. While the assertion that the

        adolescent brain is invulnerable to alcohol effects is implausible, research on the effects

       of alcohol on adolescent brain has not, as of yet, produced definitive results.” (p. 381,

       Clark et al. 2008)

The absence of social science research on the long term consequences of minimum legal

drinking age laws is notable and unnecessary. Social scientists have the ability to provide

empirical evidence as to whether higher minimum drinking ages have lasting effects. While

neuroscience can provide the biological basis of these effects, eventually it is necessary to assess

whether long term effects exist.

       In this paper, we presented the results of an analysis of the long term consequences of

higher minimum legal drinking ages. We examined whether differences in the legal drinking

environment between ages 18 and 20 is associated with alcohol use and fatal traffic accidents

among adults with an average age of 35. We found that moving from an environment in which a

young male was never allowed to drink legally to one in which a young male could always drink

legally was associated with a 20 to 30 percent increase in alcohol consumption of adult males,

and a ten percent increase in fatal traffic accidents for adult males. These estimates are in line




                                                                                                     25
with the only other study of this type (Cook and Moore 2001) and with the nature of alcohol

addiction, which suggests progressively larger effects with age.

         These estimates, if true, imply substantial benefits of a minimum drinking age of 21. To

provide a very rough estimate of one benefit, we assume that reducing the minimum legal

drinking age to 18 from 21 will (in the long run) increase fatal traffic accidents by ten percent

(Table 6 estimate for those with average age of 35) for all males between the ages of 21 to 80.

Data from FARS for the year 2007 on the number of fatal accidents involving male drivers

between the ages 21 and 80, suggests that a minimum drinking age of 21 will prevent 3,480 fatal

accidents and will save 3,956 lives per year.13 The value of these lives can be computed using

estimates of the value of life remaining for men of different ages. Murphy and Topel (2006)

provide such estimates and they are listed in the table below next to the number of lives saved.14

Assuming that all those who die in an accident are in the same age range as the driver, the total

value of the lives saved in a year from a higher minimum drinking age is more than $20 billion.

   We used approximate values based on Figure 3 in Murphy and Topel (2006).


                                                                                                             26
       The $20 billion represents just part of the benefits of a minimum legal drinking age of 21,

as there may be other benefits from lower alcohol use besides fewer traffic fatalities. Of course,

there are also costs associated with a minimum legal drinking age of 21, which may be

substantial. At a minimum, the cost of the higher drinking age is the value of foregone alcohol

consumption of young adults and any other intangible costs such as the erosion of the respect for

the law that comes with frequent violation of the law. A more complete assessment of these

costs and benefits would be valuable. Here we have provided an estimate of just one benefit,

albeit one with great public policy importance.

       To summarize, we found that a minimum legal drinking age of 21, versus a minimum age

of 18, is associated with a 20 to 30 percent reduction in adult male alcohol use and a ten percent

reduction in fatal traffic accidents with adult male drivers. These estimates support arguments

made by those in favor of keeping the minimum legal drinking age at 21 that such laws have

long term, beneficial consequences. Importantly, the evidence we present is a direct assessment

of that argument and does not rely on hypotheses of long term effects of such laws derived from

neurobiological studies of how alcohol use affects adolescent brain development. Clearly, more

research in this area by social scientists is needed. While neurobiology can provide a biological

basis for long term effects of minimum drinking age laws, such effects eventually have to be

measured to assess whether they exist. We have provided such an assessment.
