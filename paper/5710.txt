       We argue that recent currency crises reflect clashes between fundamentals           and pegged

exchange rates, just as did crises in the past. We reject the view that crises reflect self-fulfilling

prophecies   that are not closely related to measured fundamentals.     Doubts about the timing of a

market attack on a currency are less important than the fact that it is bound to happen if a

government’s policies are inconsistent with pegged exchange rates. We base these conclusions on

a review of currency crises in the historical record under metallic monetary regimes and of crises

post-World   War II under Bretton Woods, and since, in European and Latin American pegged

exchange rate regimes.

            WHY CLASHES BETWEEN INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL STABILITY GOALS

                           END IN CURRENCY CRISES, 1797-1994




1. Introduction

The Mexican crisis of December 1994 and the European Monetary System (EMS)

crisis of September 1992 have aroused interest in the subject of currency

crises. Academics seek to understand their causes and propagation mechanisms,

Policy makers debate the need for new mechanisms to prevent them.

       In the traditional view, a country faces a currency crisis when

inconsistencies arise between preserving pegged exchange rates, whether fixed

or crawling pegs, and protecting domestic monetary and fiscal policy -- the

fundamentals      -- for the sake of internal stability and competitiveness.   For

countries that are part of a pegged exchange rate system, such as Bretton

Woods or the EMS, crises are an endemic part of the system. They arise because

of unexpected shocks that may make unsustainable policies that were previously

compatible with existing exchange rate arrangements. Market participants

understand this tension and precipitate an attack on a currency by selling it

short when destabilizing shocks occur.

       Recently, the traditional view and its modern extension, speculative

attack models based on rational expectations, have been challenged by the view

that currency crises reflect self-fulfilling prophecies that are not closely

related to measured fundamentals. Crises instead can happen under conditions

of multiple equilibria in the foreign exchange market. In this paper we argue

that recent crises reflect fundamentals, just as did crises in the past. The

trick is to identify the fundamentals.

       We define a currency crisis as a market-based     attack on the exchange

value of a currency. It involves a break with earlier market judgment about
                                        2

the exchange value of a currency. If a devaluation, which also involves a

change in the peg, does not occur because of market pressure, it does not

qualify as a currency crisis. In both cases, however, it is imperative to sort

out the inconsistency between fundamentals and the pegged rate. 1 A currency

crisis is also different from a banking panic, which sharply increases the

demand for currency, but the two types of crises may feed upon one another

(Krugman, 1991; Bordo, Mizrach, and Schwartz, 1996).

      We report in section 2 the discussion in the literature of the two

competing theories of currency crises: the classical view based on

fundamentals , and the recent view based on self-fulfilling prophecies.   For a

judgment on   the validity of the competing theories we believe the crises of

experience offer guidance. In section 3 we examine famous historical   examples

of crises from 1797 to World War II. In section 4 we examine post-World War II

crises . In section 5 we offer lessons from history.

2. The Literature on Currency Crises

In the traditional view on currency crises, pegged exchange rates are durable

only as long as monetary authorities are credibly committed to maintaining

them. This requires that domestic policy always is subordinated to the

objective of maintaining   the fixed exchange rate. Under the classical gold

standard, the commitment to the fixed price of gold was credible for the core

countries of Western Europe and the United States. Speculative attacks on




     1 Frankel and Rose (1996) define a currency crash in emerging markets as
       a nominal depreciation of at least 25% that is also at least a 10%
       increase in the rate of depreciation. Eichengreen, Rose, and Wyplosz
        (1995) distinguish between a devaluation and a currency crisis. Both
       are preceded by monetary and fiscal expansion and the deterioration of
       other fundamentals, but in a devaluation inconsistent policies are
       reversed with a change in parity, whereas in a currency crisis
       inconsistent policies continue after the parity change.
                                        3

their currencies that forced abandonment or alteration of the parity rarely

occurred.z

      Under special circumstances,   such as wartime emergencies or financial

exigency, the commitment might be temporarily suspended, but the market

understood that the original parity would be restored once the emergency had

passed. These events, moreover, were rarely characterized by the type of

duress crises today are subject to. For peripheral countries, such as the

Latin American countries, however, the pattern set by the core countries is

not observed. They suspended convertibility and altered parities when

subordinating domestic needs to the dictates of external balance proved

onerous (Bordo and Schwartz, 1996) .

      Of two recent interpretations of currency crises, both based on the

postulate of rational expectations, one extends the traditional view,

maintaining that speculative attacks on a currency are driven by the

incompatibility of the pegged exchange rate and expansionary domestic

financial policy, the other, maintaining that currency crises are not

necessarily driven by a conflict between deteriorating fundamentals and the

pegged exchange rate, but reflect self-fulfilling prophecies. The innovation

of the first interpretation is that the timing of the attack is predictable,

It occurs before the monetary authority has exhausted its reserves, In the

second interpretation, the timing is not predictable.   Crises may be self-

fulfilling prophecies of market participants. Because their expectations are

that the monetary authority’s policies will be inconsistent with the peg, they


    2 Incipient attacks on the Bank of England and other central banks were
      countered on several occasions by central bank cooperation and, more
      important, stabilizing short-term capital flows by market participants
      confident of the credibility of the commitment to gold parity (Bordo
      and Kydland, 1996; Eichengreen, 1992).
                                                              4

take actions to force the authority to abandon the peg and thereby ratify

their expectations. Crises occur in circumstances of multiple equilibria                                               --

indeterminacy          -- in foreign exchange markets, in which random shocks called

sunspots can trigger an attack.

2.1. Classical Currency Crises

Two seminal articles by Krugman                     (1979) and Floyd and Garber (1984a) argue

that, in a world of perfect foresight, a speculative attack on a currency with

a fixed exchange rate will occur when a monetary                              authority,        in disregard          of

the     inconsistency       with    maintaining       the peg,        expands        domestic    credit       to finance

a budget       deficit.     The path       of domestic        credit       expansion     is assumed to be

exogenous.       Unlike     the traditional          view,        a speculative        attack    that     forces

abandonment        of the peg and adoption             of a floating           exchange        rate,    occurs       before

the point       at which     reserves       would    have been        exhausted.        Speculators          sell    the

currency       short    in anticipation        of the depreciation              that     is bound       to occur,

eince     international         reserves     are declining           pari    passu     with    domestic       credit

expansion.

          In this      literature,       a speculative            attack    takes    place     when    the    shadow

exchange       rate    -- the exchange        rate    that would           prevail     if exchange        rates      freely

floated,       determined       by the     interaction        of the growth          of money        supply    and money

demand     -- equals      the existing        peg.    When        the attack    occurs,        reserves       fall to

zero,    the    exchange     rate    depreciates       and nominal           interest     rates       rise,    on a path

determined       by the growth        of money       supply        and money    demand.        At the     time      of the

attack,     the decline         in reserves     and the money              supply    equals     a decline        in real

money    demand,       in turn     a reflection       of expected           depreciation        incorporated          in

nominal     interest      rates.     The    size of the decline              in money     demand       and reserves

is determined          by the    semi-elasticity         of       demand    for money.        Thus    the money
                                                             5

market     is always       in equilibrium.

          The equilibrium          is unique       and the timing          of the attack           ia precisely

determined.        This    is so because,          were    the attack       delayed        until    reserves        are

exhau~ted,      the exchange           rate    would    jump,     providing       opportunities            for arbitrage

by Bpeculators        taking       short      positions      in the domestic         currency;        alternatively,

if the     attack    were     staged     too soon,        opportunities          for arbitrage         in the

opposite     direction        would     arise.     Only    when    the    shadow    exchange        rate     equals       the

pegged     exchange       rate   do no further          opportunities           for arbitrage        profits        arise.

          The original        model     has been       extended     in a number           of ways.    In one

extension,      incorporating           uncertainty        over    the path       of domestic        credit

expansion     permits        nominal     interest       rates     to rise       steadily     up to the collapse,

whereas     in the original            model,     interest       rates    increase       with     a jump when        the

collapse     occurs       (Agenor,      Bhandari,       and Flood,        1992) . In addition,             other

fundamentals,        such     as the     real    exchange        rate,    the    current     account       deficit,        and

the ratio     of debt       to GDP,      consistent        with    the extension,           deteriorate          before

the   crisis.      Velasco       (1987),      citing    Chile     in 1982,       argues     that    currency        crises

can be driven        by banking         crises.     Chilean       authorities       by bailing        out     insolvent

banks     fueled    an expansion         of domestic        credit.

         The model        has been      applied    to hypothetical              and actual        crises:     the    case

of a depreciation           of one country’s            currency     that       damages     the    competitiveness

of a trading        partner       (Gerlach      and Smets,        1994;    Eichengreen          and Rose,        1996);

the   1976 Mexican        devaluation          (Blanco     and Garber,          1986);    the attack        on

Argentina’s        crawling      peg    in 1981     (Cumby       and Van Wijnbergen,              1989);    the

postmortem      on Mexico’s         1994      crisis,     as well    as the       1982 Chilean        and Mexican

crises,     and the Finnish            1992    crisis     (Dornbusch,       Goldfajn,        and Valdes,          1995].

         Another     strand      in the       literature     is a critique          of the        classical       model     of
                                                           6

currency     crises     by a number        of authors,         who    find that       it cannot        explain      the

1992 EMS exchange         rate     crigis       (Eichengreen,         Rose,       and Wyplosz,        1993,    1995;

Obatfeld,     1995;     Obstfeld       and Rogoff,        1995).      According       to the       critique,        in most

of the countries,         fundamentals           before    their      currencies       were     attacked       did not

appear     inconsistent        with   pegged      exchange      rates,       reserves       were    adequate,       budget

deficits,     money     growth     and    inflation       rates      were    low, and       interest

differentials         between    EMS members        and Germany         -- a measure           of credibility

financial     markets     monitored        -- did not predict               the    September       1992    crisis     until

late August      1992    (Rose and Svennson,              1994).      The basic       assumption          of the

Krugman     model,     that    the growth        of domestic         credit       is exogenous,       has been

challenged     because        it fails     to take    account         of the policymaking             environment.

When    governments      are viewed        as optimizing          agents,         making    choices       between

competing     objectives,        subject     to constraints            that       are influenced          by market

participants’         expectations,        domestic       credit      expansion       becomes       an endogenous

variable     (Obstfeld,        1995).     This    approach      opens       up the possibility             of multiple

equilibria     and self-fulfilling               speculative         attacks.

2.2.   Currency Crises Reflecting Self-Fulfilling Speculative Attacks

The    1992 EMS crisis         is cited     as an example            of a currency          crisis    seemingly

unrelated     to the behavior            of fundamentals.            The explanation          offered       for    its

occurrence     is the presence            of multiple       equilibria            in foreign       exchange       markets

that   can be triggered          by random       events     like sunspots.            The    approach       derives

from articles         by Flood    and Garber        (1984b)       and Obstfeld          (1986),      which    showed

that   the classical          currency     crisis    model     could        accommodate       multiple

equilibria.     In Obstfeld           (1986),    on the assumption                that domestic credit growth

in normal circumstances is consistent with the currency peg, there are two

possible equilibria, which depend upon the expectations of market participants
                                                             7

about    monetary       authority     actions          in the event        of a speculative          attack:           (1) If

an attack     never      comes,     the    fixed       exchange     rate    survives       indefinitely;           (2) if

an attack     happens,      the     system       may    collapse.     Essentially          the    approach        extends

the Diamond       and Dybvig        (1982) model          of bank     runs    -- whether          a run on a bank

will    or will      not occur      depends       on depositors’           expectations.

         In multiple       equilibria        models,       the monetary        authority’s          decision           to

maintain     the currency         peg or float           is determined        by a cost-benefit              analysis         in

a world     of rational        expectations.            In a typical        model    (Obstfeld       and Rogoff,

1996;    Ozkan    and Sutherland,           1994),       the central        bank minimizes          a loss        function

based    on unemployment          or the deviation           of output        from potential,          the expected

inflation     rate,      and some measure              of the credibility           cost    of abandoning              the

peg.    The authority       adopts        the currency       peg as a commitment                 mechanism        to

maintain     low inflation,         but     in the event          of a large        shock    to output,           it can

decide     to abandon      the peg        in favor       of a floating        exchange       rate    and an

expansionary        monetary      policy.        The central       bank,     given    such       a shock,        weighg      the

cost of maintaining            the peg,      i.e. , a decline          in output       and a rise           in

unemployment,        against      the cost        of abandoning        it, i.e.,       a loss of credibility.

Market     participants        understand         this    choice    and,     in light       of their        assessment

of the     central      bank’s    judgment        of the    state     of the economy             relative        to a

potential     loss of credibility,                may    or may not provoke           an attack.

         It is this       scenario        that    creates    the possibility           of multiple           equilibria.

If unemployment          is low and the           state    of the economy           is sound,       then     the

likelihood       that    the peg will        be abandoned          in the event        of an external              shock      is

low. Hence       there    will    be no attack.           If unemployment           is high       and the economy             is

sluggish,     the    likelihood       that       the peg will       be abandoned           in the event           of an

external     shock      is high.    Hence        speculators       are likely        to attack       the     currency.
                                                              8

The     attack    may    be triggered        by a seemingly           trivial    event.       If the     response       is

an increase        in interest          rates     to astronomical        heights,        it may      succeed     in

temporarily        repulsing        the attack,         as Sweden      did    in September        1992,    but the

weakening        effect    on the economy            of the    interest       rate    increase,       heightens        the

likelihood        of a later        successful         attack.

          The    credibility        of the      central    bank,      which    may be path        dependent,          can

affect     the    likelihood        and    success      of an attack         (Kenen,     1996) . Past      adherence

to the peg under           the gun may          help    forestall      future    attacks        (Davies    and Vines,

1995) . On the other             hand,     a central      bank which         had high     credibility       in the

past    could     still    be exposed        to an attack         on its currency          if the      state    of the

economy     were     bad enough         (Drazen      and Masson,       1994) .

          The    state    of the economy           is not the only           factor    that    could    create

conditions        for a self-fulfilling                speculative      attack.       Another     factor    is rising

interest        rates    with    effects     on government         debt,      mortgage     interest       rates,       and

the    stability        of the banking          system    (Obstfeld,         1994).    Concern       for each    of

these     objectives       competes        with   the commitment         to maintain          a peg,    and creates           a

situation        that    makes    the     cost of maintaining           the peg prohibitive             in the event

of a speculative           attack.

         As noted        above,     the    events      of the September         1992 EMS       crisis     spawned       the

model    of self-fulfilling               attacks.     Obstfeld       (1994)    explains       the    attack    on the

Italian     lira on Black           Wednesday,         16 September,         in this    way.    Market

participants,           expecting       a devaluation         of the    lira,    bid up domestic           interest

rates,     thereby       threatening        the government’s           ability       to roll    over    its short-

term    debt,     which    caused       the devaluation,          and validated         their     expectations.

Similarly,        the attacks        on the Swedish           krona    reflected       the effects        of high

interest        rates    on unemployment          and the      stability       of the banking          system.     The
                                                              9

rise    in German       interest        rates    following        reunification       was the       factor    that

triggered        ~elf-fulfilling           attacks    on EMS member          currencies        (Ozkhan      and

Sutherland,        1994).

         The Maastricht           Treaty     itself    has been       held       responsible     for self-

fulfilling        attacks      on the EMS        (Eichengreen        and Wyplosz,          1993).    The    argument        is

that what       occasioned        the    attacks     was   the belief        that,    if members       devalued,

they    would    not qualify          for admission        to the European           Monetary       Union    (EMU) and

therefore       would     no longer       have     an incentive       to adopt       conservative          policies.

The    adverse     news    of the Danish           “no” vote       on the referendum           in June      and the

tight    race     in France       on the referendum            in early      September       led to the       attacks.

         A different          systemic      explanation       for the EMS exchange              rate   collapse        is

that    it was     a response         to market      perceptions          that    the cooperative          arrangements

between     Germany       and the peripheral           EMS    countries          and among     the peripheral

countries       themselves        broke    down     following       the    shock    of German       reunification

(Buiter,     Corsetti,         and Pesenti,         1996).    The Germans          refused     to reflate,         and the

other    countries        were    unwilling        to adopt       a coordinated       moderate       devaluation

strategy.       Sensing       the breakdown         of the    “rules       of the game”        of the EMS,         market

participants          staged     attacks     on individual          members.

         Contrary       to the     self-fulfilling           explanation,          there    is no dearth          of

evidence     that      fundamentals,         in the EMS crisis             as in earlier        crises,      augured

the outcome.          The evidence        includes     deterioration             of unemployment,

competitiveness,           and debt       to GDP     ratios       for virtually       all the EMS          devaluers,

following       the German        reunification        shock       (Krugman,       1996;    Branson,       1993;

Dornbusch,       1993).       These     patterns     suggest      that     the market       anticipated       that

money   growth        would    become     more    rapid    were     the exchange       rate    unpegged.

Moreover,       the    crisis    was     preceded     by surprise         political        developments       (the
                                                           10

results     of the Danish           and French      referenda)       that would       have    altered       the way

marketa     assessed       the    fundamentals.

          For Krugman         (1996),    the key aspect         of the new crisis            models       that

distinguishes          them    from his own,        and that     produces      multiple       equilibria,          is not

that    they    are based        on a more    sophisticated          objective       function       but    that    they

do not     assume      that    fundamentals        deteriorate       predictably.        If the parameters               in

the monetary        authority’s         loss function       deteriorate        over    time,       then,    just       as in

his model,        a predictable         speculative       attack    will     follow,     and the equilibrium

will    be unique.        A possibility       of multiple        equilibria         arises    if the evaluation

of fundamentals           is uncertain,       but the range          will    be narrow.       Moreover,

speculators        who    attempt    to profit       from multiple          equilibria       will    limit       the

range    even     more.

          In our opinion,          it is incontrovertible             that    currency       crises occur

because     of inconsistency            between     domestic     policy      objectives       and a pegged

exchange       rate.     Doubt   about    the timing       of the attack         is less      important          than    the

fact that       it is bound       to happen        if governments         pursue     inconsistent          policies.

         The    logical       possibility     of multiple        equilibria         in foreign       exchange

markets     in a world         of rational     expectations         does     not mean       that    they    have

actually       occurred.       In every     case    in which     events      have    been    explained       as self-

fulfilling        prophecies,       the events       can also be explained             by    fundamentals.             The

important       task     for economic       historians      is to uncover           the real       world    forces

that    lead to inconsistency.              That   task    involves       an understanding           of the

political       process       and the preference          function       of monetary        authorities.          In this

context     the    classical      approach     is a useful         way    to study     currency       crises.

3. Famous       Historical       Examples     of Currency        Crises

         The examples          we briefly     describe      in this       section     were    crises       affecting
                                                             11

currencies        linked     to    (or in the process             of restoring        a link to) a gold              (or

metallic)        standard.        The usual     symptom      of an impending           crisis     was    a loss of

epecie     reserves.       The circumstances            that      produced     the    reserve     loss    varied.          No

case was typical.            The    stylized     portrayal         of the monetary         authority          failing       to

ltiit     money    creation        in order     to finance         government        budget    deficits        or

maintaining        low interest        rates,       when    adhering       to the commodity          standard

required       restraining         monetary     growth      or raising        interest     rates,       capturee          the

features       of only     one of the         individual       crises      - the     1923-26     French       franc

crisis     -- although          it applies      in some respects            to other      crises     as well.

          Currency      crises      that    occurred       in wartime       must     be distinguished           from

those     that    occurred        in peacetime.        In wartime,         a suspension        of convertibility

might     be the correct           policy,     to allow      the authorities           to pursue        an optimal

fiscal     policy    of taxation,           borrowing,       and seigniorage.           The    classical        theory          of

tax smoothing        postulates        that     a rational         government        should    finance        wartime

expenditures        with    debt,     which     would      be retired       in peacetime         (Barre,       1979) .

High    collection        costs     of conventional          taxes    in wartime        might     also    make       it

optimal     to use the          inflation     tax    (Vegh,       1989).

          Thus,    how wartime        expenditures          were    financed         taxation,      borrowing,            the

printing       press)     was     crucial     for currency         stability.        Moreover,      wartime

exigencies        could    create     internal       or external        drains       of specie      reserves,         even

if monetary        authorities        behaved       prudently.       Sometimes        legal    arrangements           (the

Us.     Independent        Treasury)        or adventitious          events      (enemy    invasion;          military

mutiny)     accounted       for reserve         losses.

         The     common    element     in the       individual       episodes        we review      is that         in each

case the       authorities         confronted       the dilemma       of choosing         between       the    internal

or external        objective.        Giving     up the external            objective      -- convertibility                of
                                                             12

the currency        into the weight of specie specified by the fixed exchange rate --

constituted the currency crisis. Besides                           the common          element,     as the

descriptions        that       follow     show,    each    episode       had unique        features.

3.1. John Law’s Operations, 1716-20

          John    Law     in 1705 theorized          that    currency          creation     could    finance       a major

economic      project      that    would     employ       unused    resources          and expand        real wealth

without     raising       prices.       He put the theory           to work       in France        with    the Regent’s

support     by establishing             a note-issuing        bank       in 1716,       and organizing           a company

to take     over    a monopoly          on trade     with    Louisiana,          then     adding    the tobacco

monopoly,        trade    with    Africa,       and finally        all French          trade    outside     Europe.       The

conglomerate        company       in 1719 purchased           the       right    to issue       new coinage,        and the

right    to collect        all French        taxes,       first    indirect       ones     and then       direct    taxes.

He also bought           up the French          national     debt,       at market        prices    below    par,    to

refund     it at an interest             rate     below    that paid          by the    state     while    collecting

the government           service.       Despite     Law’s    theory,          the conglomerate           never    undertook

a major     economic       project.

         To sell        shares    in the company,           the bank          increased     its note       issue.    By

January     1720 share          prices    began     to fall below             10,000    livres     per    share,    as

holders     converted          their    gains     into    specie.       Law    countered       by prohibiting        specie

payments      above      100    livres.     In February       1720 the company              took    over    management

of the bank,        made       its notes     legal tender          for payments           above    100 livres,       and

terminated        support       of the    stock     price    by note          creation.     The ensuing          price

decline     led the bank          to peg the price           at 9,000          livres,     intervening       to convert

shares     into banknotes.             The pegging        operation       ended    in May       1720,     by which       time

the   legal      tender    note    circulation           and price       level    had doubled        and the       specie

stock    had disappeared.              At the     same time       Law    in several        steps    devalued       specie

in terms        of livre    tournois,        and imposed        exchange    controls.       There        is evidence

that Richard        Cantillon,        the French       financier     and economist,           who    recognized           the

incompatibility           between     Law’s    domestic       operations     and the exchange              rate,     sold

banknotes        and managed        to buy Dutch       guilder     by evading       the exchange           controls

(Murphy,        1987).    Events     proved    Cantillon        right.    A run on the Banque              Royale’s

specie     reserves       forced     Law to reverse        his policy,       precipitating           a massive           loss

of confidence,           and a quick     collapse       of his operations.

          The    collapse     occurred       even    though     Law presided       over    a deflation            from May

to December        1720.    The note     circulation          fell by 56% by October              1720,     and the

price     level    declined        by one-third       from its peak.        Following       his     fall    from

power,     the    share    price     fell to 500 livres           in September        1721,      about     the     same

price     as in May       1719.     Specie    reappeared        and was    revalued       to the definition               it

had at the beginning               of 1720    (Garber,     1990).

3.2. England, 1797

         The Bank        of England     suspended       the gold     standard       on February           27,     1797,

when    its bullion        reserve     fell to just above           El million.          In February        1793,        at

the    start     of the war with        France,       it had stood        at E4 million.          According         to

O’Brien     (1967),       contractionary        actions       by the Bank      in response          to    its

dwindling        gold    reserves     hindered       the government’s        war    finance.        The tension

between     the exigencies           of war    finance     and specie       convertibility           increased           from

1793 to 1797.           Finally,     to prevent       the Bank’s     collapse       in the       face of a massive

external        drain    occasioned     by a premium          on gold     in France       (marking        its return

to a metallic           currency     after    the disastrous        assignat       inflation),           and of     an

internal        drain    in February     1797       (because    of an invasion           scare    when     a French

frigate     landed       a handful     of men       in Ireland),     the government           authorized          the

suspension        of convertibility.           Soon    after    suspension,        the    Bank    was prepared            to
                                                               14

resume     payment,       but the government              demurred,      and the       act of suspension                was

renewed     year       after    year    until    1803,       when    it was extended          until    six months

after a definitive peace treaty had been ratified.

3,3. The United States, 1861

          The Civil       War broke out in April 1861. When Treasury Secretary Salmon                                             P.

Chase     took    office       in March,       he met with          the banks    of New       York,    Philadelphia,

and Boston,        who    agreed       to make    three       advances     of $50 million            each    to the

government.        Immediately          they    paid    $5 million       to the Assistant             Treasurers             in

coin,     the    remainder        to be paid      in coin       as needed.       The    secretary          agreed       to

issue     3-year       7.30 bonds       or Treasury          notes    and to reimburse          the banks          from the

national        subscription.          The    arrangement       was    intended       to give       the government

large     sums needed          to redeem       maturing       treasury     notes      and    for other

disbursements,           and to maintain          specie       payments.       According       to the       Independent

Treasury        Act of 1846        under      which    the Treasury        operated,         the proceeds          of

government        loans       subscribed       to by banks          had to be transferred             to subtreasuries

in coin.        This    much    of the       act was repealed          on 5 August          1861,    to permit          the

secretary        to leave       the proceeds          with    the banks       until    needed,       but    he accorded

the Treasury’s           needs     a priority         ahead    of the banks’.

          In New       York    City    the banks       had agreed       to keep       a specie       reserve       of 25%

against     net    liabilities,          and the Clearing             House    tried    to assure          that    no bank’s

specie    would        fall    short.    On 19 August          $35 million       was    credited       to the

government,        and banks          began    to pay the       subtreasury        $3.5 million            in specie

weekly.     By 2 September             some banks       had a deficiency           and the Clearing               House

charged     them       interest       daily.    On 19 September          the Clearing          House       began    to issue

loan certificates.              To escape       the    interest       charge,    the banks          with    the

deficiency        exchanged       the    loan certificates             for gold.       On 1 October          the    second
                                                             15

$35 million          of treasury        notes     was allotted        to the New York          banks,       and on 16

November,       another        loan of the        same    amount,     half    in coupon      bonds,       half    in

registered        bonds.       (These    issues     collateralized           to 90% of their         value       the    loan

certificates          the Clearing        House     issued. )

          In December       the    secretary        issued       demand    notes    (greenbacks),           further

draining       specie    from the banks.            At the end of the month,                the banks        suspended

specie     payments,       and the Treasury              followed     suit.    It is important            to note       that

suspension        did not occur          because       of an overissue         of paper      money        (domestic

credit)     that      forced     a decline        in international           reserves.      It occurred          because

of the     institutional          peculiarities           of the     Independent       Treasury,         and the

inflexibility          of the treasury            secretary.       Given     the magnitude         of the greenback

issues     that      followed,     it is likely           that    a suspension        of payments         associated

with    a currency       crisis     would       have     eventually       occurred.

         The    suspension        of specie       payments        in 1861     immediately      put gold          at a

premium     over      paper.    Resumption         of payments        did not occur         until    1 January          1879

(Myers     I, 1931).

3.4. U.S. Currency Weakness, 1894-96

         In the       context     of a U.S. budget           deficit       after    1890    and the       creation       of

legal    tender       Treasury     Notes    of 1890,        redeemable        in coin,      that    the Sherman

Silver     Purchase      Act of 1890 mandated,               uncertainty        about      the convertibility             of

the U.S.       dollar    surged,        despite     the    repeal     of the Sherman         Act    in 1893.       To

finance    the deficit,           the Treasury           ran down     its stock      of gold       and    legal

tenders.       The    increase     in legal       tenders        outstanding,       however,       when    presented

for redemption          threatened        the gold        reserve.     In January       and November          1894,     the

Treasury       attempted       to restore        its gold        reserve     to at a minimum         $100 million             by

offering       for public       subscription           $50 million        10-year    5% bonds.       The    subscribers
                                                           16

used     legal    tenders     to obtain gold to pay for the bonds with no increment to

the gold reserve. In January                  1895 a run on gold           in exchange         for legal        tendera

reduced     the reserve        to $45 million.

          Stymied,       in February        1895 the Treasury           secretary     contracted       with      the

Belmont-Morgan           banking     syndicate,        under    a law which       authorized       him to purchase

coin    on terms     he negotiated,           to market        a 30-year     4% bond      issue    and provide          the

Treaaury     with    a 6-month         line of short-term            intereat-free        gold    credit    to

restore     the gold        reserve.     One-half       of the    3,500,000       ounces     of gold      delivered

waa to be shipped            from Europe       at a rate        not exceeding        300,000      ounces    a month.

The    syndicate     agreed     to protect        the Treasury          against    gold     withdrawala         paid    out

to redeem        legal    tenders     or sold to obtain           exchange.       It delivered        an additional

$25 million        in gold     in exchange        for legal tenders,             and borrowed       exchange       in

London     to sell       in New York,        effectively        controlling       the exchange        market.      The

syndicate        marketed     the bonds       for a total        of $68.8     million.

         During     the     five months       after    the contract        was    signed     no gold      was

withdrawn        from the Treasury.           At the end of August            1895,    when      agricultural

exports     and associated           gold    imports     rose,    the    syndicate     was dissolved.            During

the electoral        campaign        in 1896,    domestic        accumulation        of gold      and gold       exports

resumed     in response        to the       strength     of the pro-silver           forces,      and gold

reservea     declined.        Once    the Republicans          won   the election,         pressure       on the

dollar    eased,     this     time permanently.

         The crisis        of the U.S.        gold    standard       in 1894-96     haa been modeled             as a

speculative        attack,     and the probability              of the timing       of the       attack    eatimated

as only     6%    (Grilli,     1990).       The episode        has been    interpreted        as displaying            the

advantage        of obtaining        a line of credit           in foreign       currency     to avoid      a

devaluation        (Garber     and Grilli,       1986).

3.5. Crisis of 1914

           What was distinctive about the 1914 crisis, on the outbreak of war,

unlike earlier gold standard wartime crises, was the breakdown of

international clearance through London that followed. Indeed, it was a crisis

in the sense of a disruption of the foreign exchange market but different from

others in not being           associated        with    an inconsistency           between       internal       and

external       balance.     Moreover,     it was       a systemic     crisis,       affecting          the entire

worldwide       gold   standard,      and not     just one country           in isolation.

         Under    these     conditions,       banks     contracted       their     short-term          loans    to be

ready    for panic        demands    for cash.     The London        discount       market       was    deprived       of a

flow of new bills.           The London       acceptance        houses     responded       by refusing          new

acceptance       credits.     Foreigners        as a result        could    not replenish          their       sterling

balances.       Long-term     credits     ceased.       While    the London        Stock    Exchange       continued

to operate,       it was possible         to sell       securities       and obtain        sterling.       Fearing       a

price    collapse      in the      face of an attempt           worldwide     to liquidate             securities,

stock    exchanges       everywhere     closed     down.    Payment        in gold     in any event            would

have    been    inadequate        to replace     international        remittance,          and gold       embargoes

were    established       worldwide.

         By 1 August        the    Bank of England        had raised        Bank    rate    to    10%, made       loans

to discount       houses     and the Stock        Exchange       to replace        call    loans,       and gotten      a

letter     of indemnity       from the Chancellor           to permit        issue    of notes          beyond    the

limits    of Peel’s       Act.     The Treasury        issued    Currency     Notes,       although       no panic

withdrawals       from banks        occurred.     On 13 August        the Bank       of England          undertook      to

discount       at Bank    rate     approved     bills    accepted     before       4 August       and granted

acceptors       postponement        of payment     on maturity        on condition          of paying          2% above

Bank    rate.    On 5 September        the Bank        announced     that    it would       have       funds    for
                                                              18

repayment of all pre-moratorium                       acceptances, thus enabling acceptors to meet

their obligations at maturity, and the banks agreed to finance discount of new

bills. The reopening                 of   the London       Stock    Exchange       on 4 January         1915,      marked

the end of the transactions                     impasse     the outbreak          of war     had created.

          In New York          the breakdown          of the money         market    led interior           banks    to

drain     gold    from their          correspondent         banks.    The Aldrich-Vreeland               Act banknote6

relieved     the domestic             demand     for currency,        but    a solution        was    needed       for the

lack of sterling.              New York      banks     provided      credits       in New     York    against

obligations        falling       due abroad         at provisional          rates    of exchange.           London,

however,     demanded          gold.      A gold    pool    of $100 million          was     arranged       on 1

September        by banks       in and outside            New York.       They    obtained     complete       knowledge

of international            indebtedness           that    had to be settled             by remittance        of dollar-

sterling     exchange.          The banks       knew      from day to day what             the exchange         rate      would

be. Little        gold was       shipped.

         When     wartime       international          movement      of goods       took    over,     the    sterling-

dollar     exchange       rate       reached    and passed         par.    By December        1914,    the dollar          was

strong     in terms       of the belligerent               currencies.       Early       in 1915 the        sterling-

dollar     exchange       rate       fell below       the gold      export       point    to the United         States.

During    the     rest    of the year          sterling      depreciated,          but    in January        1916,

sterling     was pegged          at $4.76       7/16,      where    it was held          for the rest        of the war.

          In Britain,          the    Defense      of the Realm       Act on 5 December              1916,    prohibited

melting     of gold       coin,       and the Act of 18 May               1918, made       it illegal        to buy       or

sell gold        at a premium.            The operation       of the bullion             market,     a key    feature          of

a functioning        gold       standard,       was    suspended.          In the United          States,     the export

of gold    was     licensed          from September         1917 to June          1919.    Interconvertibility                 of

note~    and gold        and    free      international       movement       of gold       were    suspended        in both

3.6. French Franc Crisis, 1923-26

          When the franc was unpegged in March 1919, its exchange value declined

eharply ae the government seemed                    bent    on inflation.            The    law of 31 December

1920,     however,       signaled    a shift       to deflationary            policy       in that    it required             the

repayment        of Bank    of France       advances       on an annual         basis,       and    imposed        a legal

limit     on the government’s           borrowing          from the Bank.            The exchange           rate      of the

franc     reflected       this    improvement        in fiscal     affaire,          rising    from       6.27 to 8.99

cente     over    the next       five quarters.

         The national        budget,       however,     posed     a special          problem       for the       franc’e

reputation.        The budget       was divided        into an ordinary              and a special           budget,         the

latter     detailing       reconstruction          expenses      that    were    expected          to be recoverable

from Germany        under    the Versailles           Treaty.     Doubte       concerning          Germany’s

readinese        to pay reparations          had an effect         on the exchange             value       of the       franc,

especially        after    hyperinflation          developed      there.       By December          1922,       the    franc

declined       to 5.25 cents        from    8.99     in April.     In 1923 the government                   was       unable

to repay       the Bank     of France       under    the terms      of the Law of 31 December                         1920,    in

reaction       to which     the    franc    fell to 3.49         cente    in March         1924.

         The     crieis    was defused       by the     imposition        of new taxee             that    month       and

negotiation        of foreign       loans    of $100 million            and    E4 million          against       a pledge

of gold     at the Bank          of France.     The credits        were       used    to support          the    franc,

which    rose     to 6.71    cente     during      the next      few weeke,          and   foreign        exchange

reserves       increased.        The new taxes       assured      that    the ordinary             budget       would    be

balanced,        but payments       under    the Dawes      Plan    that were          counted       on to finance

epecial     budget       expenditure        turned    out to fall         short.       The    failure       of a

government        debt    issue    in October       1925 brought         the franc         down     from    4.7 cents          in
                                                               20

September to 2.05 in July 1926. Only with                             the     appointment         of Raymond          Poincare

as premier       and    finance       minister,       who opposed          a capital       levy his predecessors

in office     had proposed,            was    financial        stability       restored.         The    franc    rebounded

to 3.95     cents      by the      end of the year.            The Bank       of Franc      then       pegged    the

exchange     rate      at that      level.      The de facto         stabilization          became       de jure       in June

1928.

          Interpretations           of the      French    franc      gyrations       have       emphasized       different

aspects     of the experience:               the    importance       of confidence          in the       ability       of

government       to honor       its debts,          fiscal     causes      related     to inadequate            taxes       or

excessive     spending,         the    failure       of short-term          interest       rates       on government

debt    to rise     as they        should     have,    disappointment           that      the    prewar       parity    of the

franc was     not restored,            political       infighting          between     left and right            that

unsettled     Frenchmen         and    foreigners        (Brown      I, 1940;       Makinen       and Woodwardr             1989;

Krugman,     1991;      Eichengreen          1992).    Rather       then    giving     pride      of place       to any one

of these     interpretations,              we are willing           to settle       for all of the above.

3.7. Sterling, 1931

         A succession         of    political        and economic          shocks    unhinged          sterling’s       link

to gold.     In the      first      half     of 1931,     a deficit         in the     fiscal      budget       resulted

from depression-increased                  outlays     on unemployment             insurance.          The    invisible

trade    balance       shrank      as interest        rates     on foreign         investments          fell,    and    income

from shipping          and   financial        services        declined      with    the    contraction          of foreign

trade.    Reserve       losses      starting        in May     1930 brought         gold    reserves          down    to under

E150 million,          a level      observers        regarded       as a critical          minimum.          In May    1931

the Austrian        banking        crisis    precipitated           capital     flight      and the          announcement

of a banking        holiday,        British        deposits     of E5 million          in Vienna         were    thereby

frozen.    The    next month          banking       difficulties         in Germany        made    E70 million          of
                                                          21

German     debts    to British       banks    uncollectible,           and at the     same time        German

investors       repatriated        their    London     funds.    The    closing     of Germany’s        largest

bank    in July     and the publication           of the Macmillan           Committee       Report     led to a

fall    in sterling        below    the gold     export    point       against     major    currencies.       Bank

rate    was raised       twice     in July    from 2.5% to 4.5% but not               changed       again    before

convertibility          was    suspended.

         On 1 Augustr          the May     Committee     forecast       large     budget    deficits       that    would

require     tough    political       decisions       to raise     taxes     and reduce       expenditures.             The

Labour    Government,          unable    to solve      the budget       problem,     resigned       on 23 August,

and was     replaced       by a multiparty        coalition.          Its attempt     on 10 September             to

achieve     budget      balance     was unsuccessful.           Though    New York     and Paris        provided

loans,    the    run on sterling           did not halt.        The    crowning     event    that    disturbed

investor     confidence         was disaffection         among    navy    personnel        over   pay cuts        that

the press       described       as a mutiny.     With     reserves       dwindling,        the Government

suspended       convertibility          on 19 September.

         One vein       of analysis        of the events        leading    up to Britain’s           departure

from gold       is that       devaluation     came    as a surprise,         and that       fundamentals          by

themselves       do not explain          investors’      devaluation       expectations,          requiring

invocation       also    of international        political        and economic        events      (Eichengreen

and Hsieh       1995).     It is hard       to believe     that       investors     who were      running     down

Britain’s       reserves       to the point     of exhaustion           did not     associate       that    loss with

the probability          of devaluation. 3 That           investors       were    influenced      by events

large    and small       as well     as by fundamentals           seems    to us uncontroversial.                 The




        3 Violations  of credibility   bands (bands within which uncovered   interest
          arbitrage prevails consistent with gold point arbitrage     efficiency)
           for the dollar/sterling   rate, estimated for the interwar period, begin
          after June 1931 (Officer, 1996),
                                                             22

other vein of analysis that emphasizes self-fulfilling balance-of-payments

speculative attacks does not fit the facts of sterling devaluation                                            in 1931.

3.8. The Dollar Crisis, February 1933

          From    the date        of Roosevelt’s       victory      at the polls          in November          1932,     it

was well       known     that     he and his advisers           were     considering        the possibility            of

taking     the    dollar    off the gold         standard.        Foreign       countries       were    not    in a

position       to attack        the dollar.      In 1932 they          had already        deposited       under

earmark     in New York          or moved     to their       own countries         all the gold          they    could

claim.     Fears    that    year     of a European       drain      had proved        unfounded.         The    United

States     held more       gold     at the end of 1932 than               at the beginning.             U.S.    gold,

moreover,        amounted       to 40% of total        world      gold    reserves;       the trade       balance        was

in surplus;,        and U.S.        foreign     investments        three    times     as great         as its gold

holdings       were.     merican      securities       held    by foreigners          amounted         to one-fifth           of

U.S.    foreign     investments.

          The danger,       if danger        there    was,    lay in possible          domestic         withdrawals           of

gold    or capital        flight.     Private     investors,        alarmed       by the threat          they

perceived        Roosevelt’s       gold     policy    represented,         began    exporting          gold.    Private

bankers     were    selling       dollars     short,    buying      sterling       with    the proceeds.           The

British     bought       the dollars        offered    for sterling,         and earmarked             a corresponding

amount     of gold.       The Federal        Reserve    staff      unfortunately          lacked       expertise       in

dealings       in foreign        exchange     that would       serve      to offset       the    speculation          that

was    under     way.    The enormous        issue    of Federal         Reserve    notes       as the    currency-

deposit     ratio       zoomed,    temporarily        reduced     the System’s         reserve         ratio    below       the

legally     required       40% of gold        to outstanding           notes.    Panic     at the New          York

Federal    Reserve        Bank    at the end of February               explains     its eagerness             to join

the demand        for a banking        holiday.
                                                             23

          Disconnecting          the dollar        from gold       may    have been        a stabilizing        influence

on the depression-racked                 U.S.     economy,    but    it was       in no way       an action        the

United     States       was    forced    to take,     unlike       the devaluations           that    followed

currency        crises    in other       countries.

3.9. Gold Bloc,           1935-36

          The currencies          of the Gold        Bloc    countries          (France,     Belgium,       Holland,

Italy,     Poland,       and Switzerland)           were    the only major          ones     still    freely

convertible        into gold          in 1935.     For them       adherence       to the gold        standard       itself

represented        an ever       higher    barrier     for domestic             policies     to surmount.          Their

difficulties        mounted       in face of competition                 from the depreciated           sterling

bloc , capital          flows    to the United        States,       exchange       controls       in many     countries,

and resistance           at home       to the deflationary           effects       of maintaining           their

parities        (Eichengreen,          1992).

          The    need    for fiscal       austerity        was undermined          by rearmament        expenditures.

Capital      flight      was one manifestation              of the erosion          of confidence           in the

ability      of the bloc         to sustain       their     parities.       Belgium,       heavily     dependent          on

foreign      trade,      was    the    first    to abandon        the bloc       in March     1935.    France       was    in

the   same      situation       as Belgium,       but tried        to expand       domestic       credit     while

remaining        firm    in its gold       commitment.        Holland       escaped       the pressures        that

Belgium      and France         experienced       because     its foreign          trade    was    mainly     with       its

colonies.        By 1936 the          condition     of the gold          bloc    had markedly        deteriorated.

Poland     imposed       exchange       controls.     France,       Holland,       and Switzerland           did    not,

and experienced           gold    losses.       In April     1936, the          Popular    Front     came    to power          in

France.      As previous         governments        had done,       it tried       to combine        reflation       and

defense      of its parity,            and failed.     In September             1936 France       devalued     after

negotiating        the Tripartite          Agreement        with    the British       and Americans           not to
                                                               24

engage       in competitive          devaluations.           The other       Gold    Bloc    countries       also

devalued          and joined       the Agreement         (Eichengreen,          1990).      Again,    when countries

found internal policies incompatible with external commitments,                                          they    finally

had to choose            between     them,       and the choice        favored       internal    stability.d

4. Post-World            War   II Currency         Crises

            We distinguish          the    crises    that     punctuated        the Bretton      Woods       pegged

exchange          rate   era   from those         that   followed      post-1973.        Under   Bretton        Woods,

each    member       country       declared       a par value        for its currency          in terms       of the

dollar       or gold.      It was     required       to intervene          to maintain        its exchange          rate

within       1% of its parity             with    the dollar.        Currency       crises    arose    when     domestic

economic          conditions     proved         incompatible        with   the chosen        parity.    The examples

of currency          crises     in the managed           float      period    after    Bretton       Woods    collapsed

were    cases       of failed       attempts       to peg exchange           rates.

                                          A. Bretton Woods

4.1. Sterling in Crisis, 1947-49

            Britain,      as was the        case with        other    European      belligerents,         emerged      from

World       War    II with     a massive         balance-of-payments           deficit       in gold    and dollars.

To ensure that she would ratify the Bretton Woods Articles and quickly restore

current account convertibility, the United States and Canada extended a $5

billion       loan.      Britain     restored       current      account      convertibility          on 11 July       1947.

The ensuing          run on sterling             depleted     the U.K. ‘s reserves            by $1 billion         within

a month.          Convertibility          was    suspended     on 20 August 1947.

        The return to the pre-World War II parity of S4.03 without accounting for




        4     Political factors, such as the ascendancy of a left-wing government
              and a politically dependent central bank, according to Simmons
              (1994), led governments in the interwar period to abandon their
              external commitments.

the change        in competitiveness             that    had occurred          since     created    the     condition6

for the crisis.           These     conditions      did not disappear.                 In the    summer     of 1949

confidence        in the official           exchange      rate of sterling             weakened     markedly,

setting     the    stage       for a speculative          attack.

         Sterling        was    an international          currency,          with    exchange     controls     to

protect its inconvertibility                     into dollars. Nonresident holders of

inconvertible sterling, however, had an incentive to get around British

exchange controls, for example, by selling sterling for dollars at a rate of

exchange that was lower than the official rate, then using the proceeds to buy

dollar goods that could be sold at a profit. The buyer could                                       purchase        sterling

goods    cheaply.        Speculating       on devaluation             was    a sure bet.        On 18 September,

sterling     was devalued          to $2.80.

4.2. Sterling in Crisis, 1967

         Internal and external objectives were on a collision                                    course     from    1964 on

in Britain.        Expansionary          monetary       and    fiscal       policies    to promote         employment

produced     inflation,          a deficit       in the current             account,    and declining

international         reserves.         Speculation       against       sterling       followed.     The Labour

Government        that    assumed       office    in October          1964 opposed       devaluation,         and

instead     adopted       a surcharge       on imports,             leaving    internal     policies        unchanged.

In November        a $4 billion          IMF and G-10          loan,    and    in July     1965    contractionary

fiscal     measures       and restrictions          on capital          outflow      temporarily       improved       the

external     situation,          but    in the    spring       and summer       of 1966,        sterling     was    again

under    pressure.        Reconciling       faster      growth        and improving       the balance         of

payments     was    evidently          not possible.          A seamen’s       strike    in May     and June        led to

a run on sterling.             Deflationary        monetary         policy     was   announced,      and a

compulsory        price    and    incomes    policy       was enacted.          Foreign     central       banks
                                                         26

provided loans this time. From May 1967 onwards                            confidence       in sterling           ebbed.

Talk   of a possible         British     devaluation       became     widespread          as unemployment              rose

and the balance         of payments       deteriorated.        An enormous          run on sterling           on 17

November     preceded       by one day devaluation            of the pound          to    $2.40.

4.3. French Franc in Crisis,               1968-69

          In May    1968,    student     riots    in France     touched       off     strikes       and    lockouts

throughout      the country.       The    settlement       raised     hourly    wage       rates     by    11%,

shortened the work week, and provoked a flight of capital into D-marks and

gold . France tightened price controls, restricted imports and some external

payments,     introduced       subsidies       for exports,         and    imposed       exchange     controls.

Credit     restrictions       replaced     these    measures        in September.          In November        a flight

from   francs      to D-marks    intensified,          and on 20 November             major    European       exchange

markets     shut down.

         Between     April    and November        France     lost    $2.9 billion          of its foreign

exchange     reserves.       France    cut public       spending,         increased       indirect        taxes,

imposed ceilings on corrunercialbank lending, and raised interest rates. Yet

these measures did not suffice to reduce the growing deficits in the French

current     account    during    the     first    two quarters        of 1969.       The    French        again

tightened     restrictions       on bank       credit,     raised     minimum       requirements           for hire

purchase,     and    in July    froze     funds    for public        investment.         TO resist         devaluation

France    incurred     short-term        debts    of $2.3 billion.           The drain        on French

reserves,     however,       continued.       On 10 August      French       resistance        ended.       The    franc

was devalued        by 11.11%.

4.4. U.S. Dollar in Crisis,               1960

         Successful     operation        of the    Bretton    Woods        system    depended       on foreign

central     banks    intervening       with    their   own currencies          against        the dollar          to
                                                               27

maintain     par values,           and the United          States     standing       ready    to buy or sell              gold

at $35 an ounce            in transactions          with    foreign      monetary      authorities.             The U.S.

balance     of payments           accordingly       was determined           largely    by the exchange

parities     other        countries     established.         Current        account    surpluses          of other

countries     that        added    to their     dollar      reserves        tended    to produce          a steadily

weakening     U.S.      balance       of payments       and growing          doubts    about       the    sustainability

of the U.S.       gold      convertibility          commitment.         A portent      of the troubled             future

of the     system    was      that    1960 was the first             year    in which       U.S.    gold    reserves

declined     below      the    level    of its total           liquid    liabilities         to all       foreign

holders     of assets         denominated       in dollars.

          A focu8    of     pressure on the U.S. dollar was the London gold market. In

March 1960, the price rose above $35 an ounce,                               as European       central          banks     and

private     investors         bought    gold    for dollars.          The    Bank of England             sold    gold     to

stabilize     the price,           but the U.S.        Treasury       initially       was    not willing          to

restore     the   Bank’s       holdings.       Hencer      when     a rise    in the price          of gold       occurred

in October,       the     Bank     did not     intervene.         On 27 October,        with       the price       reaching

$40 an ounce,        the Treasury            agreed    to sell gold          to the    Bank,       reserving       for the

Bank    the decision          on intervention          in the market.

         Kennedy’s        victory      in November         1960 triggered          concerns        that    it would

favor     internal      over      external     objectives,          given    his campaign          rhetoric       about

getting     the economy           to move     ahead.    Gold      losses     after    the election          were        seen    as

an expression        of a lack of confidence                 in the      administration’s            commitment           to

gold    convertibility            at the    fixed     price.      The response        of the       administration              was

to adopt     capital        controls,       to institute          measures     to improve          the balance           of


payments,     to alter         the monetary-fiscal             policy       mix,   to stem     conversion          of


outstanding       dollars         into gold,     and to enlist          the Federal          Reserve       in foreign
                                                             28

exchange       market    intervention.          The collapse         of the Bretton          Woods     system     that          we

describe       in the    currency        crisis    a decade        later    underscores       the    failure      of

these     stratagems.

         The dollar-based            international        monetary         system    was    fated    to succumb         to

expansionary          monetary     and fiscal       policies        the United       States    adopted        by the

middle     of the      1960s.     Other     countries     faced the         choice    of maintaining           exchange

rate    stability       at the cost         of a level       of inflation       the    United       States     was

imposing       on the rest        of the world,         or giving      up fixed       exchange       rates     for the

sake of their          own domestic        price    stability.

4.5. Bretton Wood’s Collapse, 1971-73

         Once    the French        franc    was devalued           in August    1969,       France     rapidly       moved

from    a $1.7 billion           deficit     on current       account      to a small        surplus     in 1970,           an

overall     balance-of-payments              surplus     of $2 billion         in that       year    and of $3.4

billion     in 1971.      Its official         reserves       rose    correspondingly.          Part     of this

change     was owing      to increased         U.S. monetary          growth    and a higher           U.S.    balance-

of-payments       deficit.

         Us.     expansionary         policy      fostered        a market    perception       that     the D-mark

was undervalued          in relation        to the dollar,           stimulating       a flow of funds           to

Germany.       A few days       before     the German      election        in October        1969,     the government

closed     the exchange         market,     and a day after           reopening       it, permitted           the D-mark

to float        The    spot   rate    against      the dollar        appreciated,          and on 26 October,               a

revaluat: on of 9.29% was announced.                    Although       there    was    a capital        outflow        in

the last quarter          of 1969,        by 1970 there       were     large    inflows       of foreign        funds,

and official          reserves     increased       substantially.          Domestic        inflation     in Germany

was thereby       eventually         worsened.

         In March       1971,     several    European      countries         requested       conversion       of their
                                                    29

dollar     regerves    into gold    to enable    them    to pay    for an increase         in their    IMF

quotas.     The payout    reduced    the U.S.    gold     stock to the lowest level since 1936.

A persistent dollar outflow thereafter accelerated in the first few days of

May 1971, overwhelming           foreign exchange markets. On 5 May seven European

countries closed their foreign exchange markets, and five others on several

continents withdrew their support for the dollar. Dealings in D-marks,

guilders, and Swiss francs were suspended. On 9 May both Germany and Holland

announced that their currencies would float, since they could not maintain

exchange rates within the established margins.

         The devaluation of the dollar vis-a-vis the D-mark as the result of the

float left unsolved the dollar’s exchange rate vis-a-vis the yen. Japan’s

capital controls were proof against the dollar flows that inundated European

foreign exchange markets but not against the large deficit in U.S. trade with

Japan. That bilateral trade imbalance was a provocation, over and above the

imbalance between U.S. gold reserves and outstanding dollar liabilities, for

the changes the United States introduced on 15 August 1971 to achieve a dollar

devaluation. The convertibility of the dollar was formally suspended, as was

the use of the swap network through which dollars could be exchanged with

central banks for other currencies.

         The effect was to oblige other countries to hold dollars or to trade

them for a price determined in the market and so to revalue their currencies.

Foreign exchange markets abroad, except in Japan, shut down. The Japanese

initial    attempt    to maintain     the pegged    rate    of the yen        compelled    them   to

purchase     $4 billion    in the two weeks       after    15 August.    The yen was then          freed

to float    upwards;     other   currencies     floated    when    exchange     markets    were   reopened

on 23 August.     Restoration       of a repegged       system    of exchange     rates,    however,
                                                              30

remained       the goal       of the United          States    and    its partners.

          After    much    negotiation,          a readjustment          of currency         parities       was    arranged

at a meeting        at the       Smithsonian         Institution       in Washington,             D.C.    on 17-18

December       1971.    Currencies       were     revalued         at varying       percentages,          with    the

proviso     that    2 1/4% margins            of fluctuation          above    and below          the    so-called

central     rates      were    permissible.          The   Smithsonian        agreement       specified          that    the

official       dollar     price    of gold       would     henceforth        be $38 an ounce,             implying       a

depreciation        of 7.9% of the gold               value    of the dollar          rather       than    an

appreciation        of the dollar            value    of other       currencies.        The dollar,         however,

remained       inconvertible.

         The    central       rates    established         at the Smithsonian            meeting         lacked

credibility,        as the participants               in the gold       and foreign          exchange       markets

revealed.       The London        free market         price    of gold       rose    with    few reversals.             Money

growth     and inflation          continued       to rise      in the       United    States,       and both       the

balance     of trade       and the      U.S. balance-of-payments                deficit       soared,       with    a

corresponding          surge    in dollar        holdings      of the major          European       countries       and

Japan.    Capital       controls       were    imposed      in Holland        and Japan,          and Germany

followed       suit.    On 10 February           1973 Japan        closed     its foreign          exchange       market

and suspended          support     of the dollar.           New    central     rates     were      set    in a hurried

round    of negotiations,             although       the   lira,     yen,    Canadian       dollar,       U.K.    and    Irish

pounds,     and Swiss         franc    all    floated.     Again,      the official          price       of gold    was

raised     (this time         to $42.22       an ounce),       leaving       unchanged       the gold       value       of

other    currencies.          The new central          rates      did not staunch           the    flow    of dollars

abroad,     and a further          crisis      erupted      in March        1973.    This    time       the major

industrial        countries       discontinued         pegging       their    exchange       rates       to the dollar.

                                            B. Managed Float Regime

4.6. European Economic Community Snake

          The notion       of a European       monetary          union    had been        the     subject       of

di~cussion       for year~.        Implementing       the    notion       had been        scheduled        for a start

in June     1971,    but    the    turbulence     in exchange            markets        during     the    collapse         of

the Bretton Woods           system     delayed    activation            of the     snake       until     April       1972.

The impetus for the initiative                 was dissatisfaction                 with       the effects        of the

weak dollar on European              currencies.       The D-mark          and the Swiss            franc       were      the

main   targets      of the capital          inflows.     European         exchange        rates     as a result            did

not reflect      country       fundamentals       but dollar            disturbances.           Germany     believed             the

revaluation      of its currency            occasioned      by the dollar’s               problems        had

contributed      to its low economic             growth.         The    snake     was    supposed        to provide          a

zone of stability.

         The technical         motivation      of the       snake was       to narrow           the margin           of

fluctuation      of EEC       currencies      below    the 2 1/4% margins                 set by the        Smithsonian

agreement     by a convergence           of economic         and monetary           policies        so that          exchange

parities     among     them    would    be fixed.

         Operationallyr           if an EEC currency         premium        over        its central        rate plus            the

discount     on the central          rate    of another      EEC currency               reached    2 1/4%        (half the

amount     permitted       by the Smithsonian          agreement,          which        was    4 1/2% between             floor

and ceiling      in relation         to the dollar,         but as much            as 9% in relation              to

another     EEC currency,         if one rose      from     floor        to ceiling           and the    other        fell

from   ceiling      to floor),       the weak     currency         was to be bought              either     by the

strong-currency         country.       the weak-currency               country,     or by both.          A monthly

settlement     was     stipulated,       so the    creditor            country     could      exchange      the weak

currency     acquired       for a desired        reserve     asset        and obtain          repayment         for its
                                                          32

short-term credit facility if it had lent its currency to the debtor. Debtors

were to make settlement in a prescribed mix of reserve assets.

          Six countries        (France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg, Holland)

originally joined the snake; three others joined in May 1972 but left in June

(U.K., Denmark,         Eire).      Denmark    rejoined        in October        1972.    Italy     left    in

December 1972. France left in January 1974, rejoined in June 1975, and left

again in March 1976. Sweden               and Norway,          non-EEC    countries,        joined       in May     1972.

Sweden     left    in August     1977.

         Many     changes    in exchange       rates    within     the    snake     were    made.     On four

occasiong       between     March    1973 and October           1978,    the D-mark        was    revalued        within

the   system.      The guilder       and the Norwegian krone each was revalued once.

Countries       other   than    Germany     devalued     in October        1976      The    Swedish        krona    was

subsequently        devalued     again,     as was the Danish            krone,     and the Norwegian              krone

several     times.

         The    feasibility      of the     snake was doubtful            in the absence           of consensus           by

the national        governments       to yield     to the union          direct     monetary        autonomy,       and

to seek     convergence        of economic       policies.       In December        1978 proposals           were

drawn    up for a replacement            of the    snake       by the European           Monetary     System       to

remedy    the perceived         shortcomings       of its forerunner.              In March       1979     it was

formally       established.

4.7. Chile’s Currency Crisis, 1982

         Chile     fixed    its exchange       rate    at 39 pesos        to the dollar           in June        1979   and

maintained        it unchanged      until     the peso was        devalued       by 18% in June            1982,

Pegging    the exchange         rate to the dollar           was a strategy          to lower        inflationary

expectations        and the     actual    rate    of inflation,          which    was     at an annual        rate      of

35% in 1979.
                                                             33

          If capital       inflows       do not complicate the strategy, for the nominal

anchor     approach     to succeed,          two assumptions must be true, one, that the anchor

country     has a firmly          established        low-inflation          record,       and     second,    that

adopting     the exchange          rate     link to the        anchor      country       is a firm        commitment.

The    strategy     would    then     be expected        to deliver         two objectives:             the exchange

rate    commitment      would      enforce     restraint          on the part       of the country’s              central

bank    in creating        money,     thereby      contributing           to the decline           in inflation

expectations,        and    it would        give   credibility        to the achievement                of an inflation

rate    for traded      goods      about     equal    to that       of the    anchor       country.

          The assumption          that     the anchor     country         had a low-inflation              policy    that

was    firmly   established          was    contrary     to fact      at the time          Chile       adopted     the

exchange     rate    link to the dollar.              U.S.     consumer      prices       had     risen    from    5% in

1976 to 6.6%        in 1977,       9.0%     in 1978,     and      12.7%    in 1979.       Producer        prices    rose      at

roughly     similar     rates.       The    1979 rate of price             rise    continued          in 1980,     followed

by declines       in 1981      and    1982.    This     U.S. price        history        was    one    set of

circumstances        affecting        Chile’s      experience        with    a nominal          anchor.     A second

set was the shift           to monetary        tightening          in late    1979 to combat              U.S.

inflation.      U.S.    long-term          government     interest        rates     in 1981-82          averaged     13.3%,

2 percentage        points     higher       than   in 1980.       A decline        in the exchange           value       of

the dollar      until      late    1979 was reversed              in 1980-82       by a 29% appreciation                 in

nominal     terms    and 28% appreciation               in real terms.            How    did these        fluctuations

in the    anchor     country       prices,     interest        rates,     and exchange           rates     affect    Chile?

         Tradable      goods      prices     in Chile     declined         in 1980-81,          as would     be expected

if its commitment           to a fixed        exchange       rate    had credibility.             Prices     of

nontradable       goods,     however,        rose,    in part       apparently          because       of a system        of

backward-looking           wage    indexation        that was       not abandoned          until       the peso     waB
                                                             34

devalued.       As we next         note,    monetary      expansion       apparently           also played       a part.

         As a result        of financial           liberalization,            and the     fixing    of the exchange

rate,    which     were    generally        applauded,       Chile      was the recipient           of a large

inflow     of short-term           capital,      with    real     interest      rates     rising     from     6.7%     in

1979 to 59.2%          in 1981 providing            a high      yield.        While    external     demand       for

Chilean     peso~      surged,      instead      of 39 pesos        to the dollar          at the       fixed    exchange

rate,    the    peso     price     of dollars       would    have      fallen     in 1980-81,       had the

authorities        not    intervened.        Keeping      the nominal          exchange     rate    from

appreciating          seemingly      benefited       exporters         and hurt       importers,       but    in real

terms    the    fixed     exchange       rate    hurt    exporters       and benefited           importers.         In 1982,

when    external       demand      for Chilean       pesos      faltered,       the peso       price    of dollars

would    have    increased,         had the authorities             not intervened.            Keeping       the nominal

exchange       rate    from depreciating,            seemingly         hurt    exporters       and benefited

importers,       but     in real terms          exporters       were    better     off than       importers.

         Monetary        consequences        of the      inflow     increased         the base     unless       fully

sterilized       by the central            bank.   The base       was two-thirds           higher      in 1980       than    in

1979,    fell    10% in 1981,           and more     than    doubled      in 1982.       While     Chilean

authorities       bought     foreign        currencies       (dollars)         to prevent       the peso        from

adjusting       to the     increase        in demand      for Chilean          assets,     foreign      exchange

balances       rose by a third           in 1980, barely          changed       in 1981,       before     falling       in

1982 below       their     initial       level     in 1979.      By not       fully    sterilizing       the     increase

in foreign       balances,        domestic       money    growth       spurted.       By permitting          domestic

credit    to rise more           than    foreign    balances        declined       in 1982,      domestic       money

growth     accelerated.

          Trying       to keep     the exchange          rate    from changing          meant    that,       when

tradable       goods     sectors     lost competitiveness,               because       their    prices       rose
                                                             35

relative       to foreign        goods     prices,    the    authorities        stuck    by their        commitment            to

the    nominal    anchor.        The trade       deficit     by 1981 was        10% of GDP.          Financing       the

current       account     deficit,       however,     as long as capital              inflows     continued,         posed

no problem       but terms        of trade       deteriorated        steadily.        When     capital    inflow~

ceased,       the authorities        sold       foreign     reserves       to settle     the current          account

deficit.       The banking        system,       meanwhile,        which    had borrowed         abroad    in dollars

and    lent    in pesos,     found       itself    in dire        distress.

         At the end of 1981 Chile                 was plunged        into recession.           Output     declined

sharply       from the middle        of 1981 to June              1982.    The unemployment           rate    rose       to

almost     30%, the trade          deficit       grew,    foreign     reserves fell,            and domestic         credit

rose.     Inflation       soared    once     again    and expectations           spread       that    the peso-dollar

rate would       not     last.    Capital       inflows     ended    not only        because     Chile    ceased         to be

an attractive          economy     for foreign        investors       but     also    because     the    steep      rise       in

U.S.    real    interest     rates       made    the United        States     a successful        competitor         for

capital       inflows.

         Devaluation        in 1982 ended          Chile’s       experiment      with    a nominal        anchor.         By

the end of 1982,           the peso       exchange       rate with        the dollar     was     73.43.      The

experiment       has been        assessed       as a case       of overvaluation         of the real          exchange

rate    that    was bound        to collapse,        and that making           inflation       the main       priority

of economic       strategy        is a mistake        (Dornbusch,         Goldfajn,      and Valdes,          1995) .

This    assessment       overlooks        dimensions        of the Chilean           experience      that     we stress.

         One dimension           relates     to the monetary          consequences           of an exchange          rate

target.       Chile    had a choice        between       limiting     the    supply     of pesos        to protect

internal       price    stability        or letting       the    supply     of pesos     grow     with    capital

inflows       to protect     the peso-dollar             exchange     rate.     It tried       to do both          and

failed.       The other     lesson       we draw     is that,       if a country        chooses      to adopt        a
                                                             36

nominal anchor, it would be wige to avoid an anchor                                 undergoing       wide      swings          in

monetary     growth.

4.8. Mexican Devaluations,               1976, 1982, 1994

A.1976.            Three    episodes     of devaluation             in Mexico       were    generated         in

different     macroeconomic           settings    that       were    similar       in terms       of their

incompatibility        with    the     fixed    exchange          rate    regime    that    prevailed.         We

describe     each    one    in turn.

          In 1972 a cyclical           recovery       began,       fueled    by expansionary            demand

policies.     Fiscal       deficits     rose    from    2.5%       of GNP    in 1971 to 10% in 1975,

financed     by borrowing       from the central              bank.       As a result       the    growth      rate       of

the monetary        base    accelerated        from    19.6%       in 1971 to 33.8%          in 1975.         From       1974

to 1976     foreign    debt    replaced        domestic       debt       as the main       source    of deficit

financing,     but the monetary           base    continued          to grow       strongly.       Inflation         rose

above   20% per annum         in 1973-74,        and private             investment     declined.

        At the nominal         exchange        rate    of 12.5 pesos          per dollar,         the    real       price       of

imports     declined       and they     surged    in dollar          value    while     the real        price       of

exports     rose    and they    stagnated.        Accordingly,             the deficit       in the      current

account    mounted     from    less than        ,$1 billion         in 1971 to $4.4 billion               in 1975,

about   5.5% of GNP.         Capital     flight       of approximately             $5.3 billion         was    a feature

of 1974-76.

        The Echeverria         administration           attributed          domestic       inflation      to higher

world   prices,      and the    slow growth           of exports         to world      recession,        justifying

continuing expansionary demand policies. Import controls were imposed, but the

exhaustion of foreign exchange reserves compelled the decision                                       on 31 August               to

allow   the peso      to float.       Inflation        rose to 27%.          In October       the peso        was

devalued    to 23 per dollar.            Mexico       then   entered        into negotiations            for medium-
                                                                37

term     financing       from the       IMF    (Buffie     1990).

B. 1982.              The Lopez       Portillo    administration,              in office       1977-82,    initially

supported        an austerity          program    to stabilize          the economy           in line with       IMF

target~.        In the    course       of 1977,       the estimate        of Mexico’s          proven    oil reserves

was    nearly     tripled       to    16 billion       barrels       compared       to the estimate        in 1975.

With    oil prices        at $31.25          per barrel        in 1980,    the      IMF program     was    set aside       in

favor     of an expansionary             policy       and weakened        restraints          on foreign    borrowing.

Once    more     demand     stimulus,         provided     by higher       public       sector    spending,      was

adopted,        but    combined       with    a more     flexible      exchange        rate    (crawling    at the     rate

of 9% per        annum),     and reduced         monetization          of the       fiscal     deficit    with   the

introduction           of government          bonds    (CETES).

          The    improvement          in the economy        1977-81       was bought          at the expense       of a

huge    increase        in public       sector    expenditures          that     was    not matched       by revenue

increases.        The    large       fiscal    deficits     were      matched       by balance     of payments

deficits.        Trade    liberalization          and real exchange              rate    appreciation       lowered       the

real    price     of imports,          leading    to rising          current     account      deficits.     In 1981

quotas     were       imposed    on many       consumer     and capital          goods    imports       but overall

import     volume       still    rose    by 15.2%.       Dollar       earnings       from petroleum        exports     rose

substantially,           1978-81,       but nonoil       exports       were    hampered       by real     exchange     rate

appreciation.

         The     increase       in current       account       deficits       was    financed     by growth      in

foreign     indebtedness             to some    $80-odd     billion       by 1981,       of which       50% to 83% was

used    to finance        capital       flight.       Public    sector     debt     was two      and a half      times

private     sector       debt,    mostly       in the    form of commercial              loans.    In 1981 debt

service     including       short-term          amortization         represented         an 80% claim       on current

account     income.
                                                             38

          By mid-1981       devaluation        of the peso          appeared     unavoidable,         but    no

reetraint        was exerted     on fiscal       expenditures,             and foreign     debt    continued         to

increase     at premiums        commercial       banks       had not previously           demanded.         A 40%

depreciation        of the peso        announced       on 17 February           1982 was      followed       by a 30%

wage    increase.     Fiscal     and monetary          expansion       continued,       and the consolidated

public     debt    rose to     17.6%    of GNP.       Massive capital flight was not halted by the

resort     to a dual       exchange     rate    system       in August.       On 1 Septefier          the banking

system     was    nationalized,        and comprehensive             exchange     controls      were    introduced.

Debt    service     by the public        and private          sectors      quickly     came    to a halt,          as did

net    foreign     lending.

         By the end of 1982 the Mexican                     economy    was    in a deep       contraction.          The

devaluation        sharply     increased       prices       of intermediate         imported      inputs.         Real

output     fell    and the     inflation       rate doubled.          Had the     foreign      debt    been       used    to

finance     productive       investment,        Mexico       would    not have      had to endure           the plight

it faced.        Instead    the debt     financed       capital       flight    and public        sector

consumption,        public     sector    investment          having    been    wasteful       (Buffie       1990).

C.1994.          The dominant     view     in a vast         literature       on the Mexican          peso    crisis       at

the end of 1994        is that     Mexico       was    an innocent         victim     of a speculative             attack

on the peso        by foreign     investors       frightened          by manifestations           of political

instability        in a basically        sound    economy.          From   1988 on Mexico certainly had

corrected many of the ruinous policies it favored that led to the 1982 debacle

and the subsequent period of stagnation. One feature of the economy                                          in 1993-94

that   had concerned         some observers           was    a growing       current    account       deficit       that

presaged     a need    to devalue        the peso.          Other    features    of the economy,             however,

also merited        concern.

         The condition        of the banks        at the very          least    was    problematical,          with       the
                                                              39

percent of nonperforming                 loans rising year by year                  from    1990 on. Foreign-

currency       denominated        loans      varied    from     18.5%      to 27.1%    of total        loans.      Mexican

firms    borrowed       from    local     banks     in dollara.           Borrowers in a country             with     a

sound    currency       do not choose          to replace          peso    liabilities       with    dollar

liabilities.          The Mexican        inflation      rate       declined    after       1988 but     not enough             to

close    the gap between             the Mexican       and U.S.       price    performance.          There    was     thus

more    than    one    indicator       that    the underpinnings             of a fixed       dollar/peso          exchange

rate were       ehaky.       Moreover,       had the Mexican          economy       been    in as good       a shape           as

those    who believe          that    it did not deserve             its fate       in late     1994,      it ought        to

have    survived       devaluation        without      the    jumps       in the    inflation       rate    and nominal

and real       interest       rates,     the collapse         of output,       and the       stupendous       rise        in

unemployment          that    it in fact experienced.                We next       review    the origins          of the

crisis.

         Monetary growth was highly                   erratic       from 1988 on. The           level      of Ml

quadrupled       from 25.3       billion       pesos    in 1989 to 96 billion                pesos     in 1991.      In

1990-92     average      growth       of Ml was more          than    100% per year.          The New       Peso,

introduced       in January          1993,    was equal       to 1,000       old pesos.       The growth          rate    of

Ml and M3 in 1993-94,                which    was   about     20% per annum, was hardly restrictive.

           During the 1980s and early 1990s Mexico brought the public deficit

under control and reduced outstanding debts. In 1982 domestic and external

public debt was 51% of GDP. BY 1992 the ratio was 27%. In 1992 the budget was

in balance. Fiscal easing in 1993-94, however, unbalanced the budget position

somewhat, but it was nevertheless among the best performers among OECD

countries.

        The government           until       1994 financed         its short-term           needs    with    Cetes,

Treasury       bills    of less than          one year maturity.            When     the    interest       rate    it had
                                                             40

to pay     on Cetea       rose    in 1994,       reflecting        the market’s          concern        over    fiscal

laxity,     as had occurred           in previous          decades,       the    government        shifted       to short-

term    dollar-indexed           Tesobonos       that    paid     a lower       interest     rate,       exposing          the

government       to interest         rate    and exchange          rate    risk.

          During      1982-88     average       annual     inflation        in Mexico       was    86% and per             capita

real GDP     contracted          1.9% per year.          The Salinas        government        that       took    office          in

December     1987 opted          for an ambitious           stabilization          program        that    would       deliver

structural       reforms        to free markets,           privatize       government-owned              enterprises,

open    Mexico     to trade,        balance      the budget,        and bring        down    inflation.          To achieve

the    latter    objective,         an incomes      policy        was given       a role     but the primary

mechanism       was    a nominal      anchor.

          On 1 March       1988 the government              fixed    the peso/dollar              exchange       rate       at

its 29 February           level     for the next         three     months       and then     extended          it until          the

end of the year.           In 1989 a crawling             peg of 1 new peso              per day was           introduced,

then    80 centavos        per day       in 1990,       40 per day        in 1991,       and 20 centavos              per    day

in 1992.     In November          1991    a system       of bands     was       announced,        the    lower       limit

depreciated        at the daily          rater    and the upper           limit    held     constant.          The

fluctuation        band    widened       from    1.1% to 15% by the end of 1994.                        From    early       1993

a narrower       band     was    established       for the day’s           trading       range     that    intervention

would    maintain.        The permitted          rate of depreciation              was    revised        in October          1992

to 40 centavos          per     day or around       4% annually,           but this       was not enough              to

offset    the    inflation        differential          between     Mexico       and the United           States       until

the end of 1993.           The Mexican          annual    inflation        rate was       then     10%.

         Over    the period        from     1988 on the trend             of the    real     exchange          rate    sharply

appreciated,          owing     to growing       capital     inflows.       The result        was       a widening

current     account       deficit     that      the capital        inflow       financed.     The       interest       rate
                                                             41

hikes     in the    United      States     in 1994,       however,     diminished          the    attraction           of

Mexico     and other      emerging        markets    as an outlet           for foreign          portfolio

investment.        In addition,         political        unrest     and the    assassination             of the

presidential        candidate      in March        1994    precipitated        capital          outflows       that     drove

the peso     close      to the bottom        of the       fluctuation        band,       signaling       the

vulnerability        of the exchange          rate.       Foreign     exchange       reserves       were       drawn        down

with    no remission       until     the end of the year.

           To defend      the peso        exchange       rate,     the central       bank       would    have    had to

tighten     monetary      policy     to convince          the market        that    it would       not devalue.              To

tighten,     however,      would     restrict       economic        growth    that       was    already       subpar,        and

would    exacerbate       problems        for the banks           sinking    under       a weight       of

nonperforming        loans.      The dilemma        of choosing        between       internal       and external

objectives       once    again    confronted        authorities        that    had made          a commitment          to a

fixed    exchange       rate.    On 20 December,           Mexico     devalued       the peso       by 15%, but that

did not stem        shifts      out of peso        assets,        and on 22 December             Mexico       freed     the

peso    to float     (OECD      1995;    Meigs     1996).

4.9. Crisis in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, 1992-93

         In the European Monetary System, Germany was the nominal anchor. Other

EMS countries pegged their currencies to the DM in order                                       to import       its low-

inflation       credibility.

         German    reunification           in 1990       is commonly        cited    as the external             event

that    had disruptive          effects     on the European           Monetary       System.       But       for that

event,     it is claimed,         the period        of exchange        rate    stability          that       began     in 1987

would    have    continued       until    European        monetary     union       was    attained.          We doubt        that

this    is a realistic          projection.        The    conflict     between       EMS       countries’       monetary

autonomy     and their       exchange       rate    commitments        would       not have been             absent,        even
                                                           42

had German reunification been accomplished without undesirable side effectO.

The conjunction of many forces ensured that the slightest shock that could

derail the path to monetary union would lead to severe stress on the system

(Eichengreen and Wyplosz, 1993). The forces                           included      the elimination         of

capital controls in 1989, the discouragement of adjustments in parities after

1987, the supposition of credible commitment by member countries to policies

consistent with fixed rates, and the unwarranted belief                                of unlimited

intervention         by the Bundesbank          in the event          of pressure      on a member to

realign.

          To contain the inflation generated by government budget deficits that

financed reunification, the Bundesbank adopted a restrictive policy. It made

no allowances for the blow to its domestic real economy                                or to the economies                  of

its European         partners     that    its interest         rate    hikes   inflicted.         High   German

interest       rates,    coupled     with    a weak     U.S.    dollar,      drew    capital      inflows     to

Germany.       Hence    the German       real   exchange       rate    appreciated.       For the existing

nominal     exchange      rate    arrangements        to be plausible,           other    EMS     countries        would

have    had to reduce       their     inflation       rates     below    the German       inflation       rate      or

realign     their      currencies.       The other      countries       were   reluctant        to deflate         or to

devalue,       but   in the end the market            enforced        devaluations.

         Evidence       of loss of competitiveness                of Spain,      Portugal,        the UK,     and

Italy,    and of Sweden          and Finland,        non-EMS      members,     from the      second      half      of

1991    indicated       to market     participants         that    a realignment         was predictable.               A

recession       that    began    in the first        quarter      of 1992 worsened          the    situation        of

these    countries.       There    were     thus   many    currencies      that     traders       had reason        to

believe     were     incorrectly      priced       in foreign      exchange      markets.

         The    Italian    lira was the         first     currency      exposed     to market       distrust        of
                                                             43

its parity. Italian foreign reserves began to decrease                                     in February 1992 and

losses became heavy in June, Lira bond prices then declined                                        in both       the

futures     and spot markets.           In July       the outflow             accelerated       when     Italy    imposed          a

wealth     tax on deposits          and the government              declined          responsibility        for the

foreign     liabilities       of a bankrupt           state       holding       company.       Moody’s     thereupon

downgraded        Italian    debt     from AAI to AA3.             On 28 August          the    lira was quoted              at

the bottom        of the currency          band.     A week       later,       to defend       its parity,        the     Bank

of Italy     raised       the discount        rate    to 15%.

         On 25 August        the    British     pound       was quoted          slightly       above     its ERM       floor,

but did     not recover       despite        heavy    intervention.             To signal       its commitment            to

defend     the    existing    parity,        on 3 September             the    Bank    of England        borrowed        $14.5

billion     equivalent       of DM from the market.

           The    next    currencies       to be sold off were                 the Finnish        markka    and the

Swedish     krona.       Finland    had been        forced    to devalue          by 12% in November              1991

owing    to the collapse           of its trade        with       the    former       Soviet    Union.     On 8

September        Finland,    having     exhausted       its reserves,             and unwilling           to defend          the

peg by raising           short-term     rates       above    the existing             level    of 14%,     floated       the

markka.     The depreciation           of the markka          by about          13% implied        that    there       was

also    a substantial        deviation        between       the pegged          rates    of other        ERM currencies

and market        evaluations,        with    fluctuation         bands       as much     as three        times    the       size

of ERM bands.

         Sweden,     unlike    Finland,        to counter          the attack          on the     krona,    raised       the

rate    charged     by the    central        bank    for overnight            bank     regerves     to 75%,       and

borrowed     DM to add to its reserves.                 Sterling          and    lira were        also    under    attack.

Because     home mortgages          bore     floating       rather      than     fixed    interest        rates     in

Britain,     the authorities           were    constrained          in their          response.     For the market,
                                                          44

this made the British commitment suspect. The Italians responded by

intervening on their own and with others,                        using    D-marks,    estimated           at 24

billion       in Frankfurt       and 60 million      in other       exchange       markets.        On 13

September,       Italy    capitulated,       devaluing      the    lira by 7% against              the    D-mark.       The

next    day the Bundesbank           for the     first time       in five years       decreased           two    key

interest       rates.

          Within   a day the        lira was     again    at the bottom       of its band,           and       so was

sterling.       That    day the Bank       of England      was thought       to have        lost    $15 billion          in

reserves.       Another    currency       that was under         pressure    was    the peseta           that    fell

below     its central      ERM rate.

         On    16 September,       the Bank      of England       raised    the minimum        lending          rate

from    10% to 12% and announced             a further         increase    to 15% which        was never          put

into effect.       Sterling       fell below      its ERM       floor,    and that    evening        it was

withdrawn       from the ERM,       temporarily      then,       indefinitely       on 19 September.              Italy

also withdrew          from the ERM       and the peseta         was devalued       by 5% within           the    ERM.

          Sweden   was    not yet    ready     to give up. The Swedish              central        bank    raised       its

marginal       lending    rate    to 500%.     On 20 September           all currencies        under       attack

that had       survived    were    near   their    ERM    floors.    The Bank       of England           restored       its

minimum       ending    rate to    10%, and lowered         it to 9% on 21 September.                    The    Bank    of

Ireland,       however,    raised    its overnight         rate    to 300%.

         Greece,       an EC country      that    had not      joined     the ERM,    also     suffered          an

attack     on the drachma         in September.      The Bank       of Greece       intervened           in the

market,       tightened    capital    controls,      and raised          the official       lending        rate       from

30% to 40%

         When    the    French    franc   came    under    attack    on 23 September,              both    the    Banque

de France       and the    Bundesbank       intervened      heavily.       That    attack    was     repulsed.
                                                               45

On 4 January           1993,    the    franc    was    again    near       its ERN     floor      but both     central

banks     firmly       stated    their    readiness        to defend          it.

          In November,          when    the krona       again       came    under     attack,       after    a few hours,

the Riksbank           ended    its resistance.           It floated         the krona        and    lowered    it8 key

interest        rate    to 12.5%.       The Norwegian          krone       was    allowed     to float       on 10

December.

          On 22 November          Spain       and Portugal          devalued        their    central     parities     by 6%.

The Bank        of Ireland       raised       its overnight          rate    to 100% between            26 November      and

2 December        to defend       the punt.          In early       January       the overnight         rate was     raised

again,     but on 30 January             the punt       was devalued             by 10%.

          The wave       of attacks       appeared       to subside          in the     first       months    of 1993.    On

13 May,     however,       the peseta          was    again    under       pressure,        and   for the third       time

since     the    1992 currency          attacks       began,    it was devalued,              this    time    by 5%. The

Portuguese        escudo       followed       suit.    There    was    another        interlude.        In mid-July,

however, the French franc was only a little above its ERM floor. The increase

in French        interest       rates    above       already    high German           ones    seems    to have

convinced       market     traders       that    France       was willing           to pay the price         to preserve

its link to the DM. This                 was    not,    however,       an unalloyed           triumph       for a fixed

rate.

         On 30 July all EM               currencies were at the bottom of their bands vis-a-

vis the D-mark. On 1 August the ERM was altered, making it closer to a free

float than a pegged but adjustable exchange rate system. The bands were

widened to 15% above and below the existing central parities. Only the DM and

guilder     exchange       rates       were    unaltered       (Buiter       et al.,        1996).

5. Lessons        from History

         Our survey of the historical episodes of currency crises in the past two
                                                           46

centuries suggests a number of lessons. First, currency crises occur when

internal economic           conditions       are   incompatible           with    the    external       conditions          Bet

for the currency.           Institutions         and the circumstances              in which        currency         crises

occurred       differed     widely      among    the countries          we have     surveyed.          What    was    common

across     all these       experiences       was this      basic     incompatibility.

          Second,    the crises         in the historical          cases     before       World    War    II always

occurred       within    the    context     of a commodity          standard.       Under    a commodity

standard       currency     crises      could    arise    for two reasons;              a government          following

unsound     financial       practices;       or banking         instability.        Crises       affecting        the

developed       countries       usually     occurred      on the outbreak           of war,       when    it became

apparent       to market       agents    that    the government          would     be driven       to suspend

convertibility          in order     to pursue         the war effort.           In peacetime          currency       crises

were    usually     associated       with    banking      instability.           These    were    usually       very

short-lived,        and the original            parity    was restored.           For developed          countries          the

commitment       to convertibility           before      World    War     II was paramount,             a norm       that

time    has since       eroded.

          The experience          of developing          peripheral        countries       was different.             They

suspended       convertibility          under    the pressure       of speculative           attack       consequent

upon    the market’s       realization          that    the governments           were   pursuing        lax financial

policies.

         Third,     in the post-World            War    II period       the Bretton       Woods        system    was

exposed     to currency         crises.     They   occurred       under     two    sets of circumstances                for

individual       countries.       Some    countries       followed       fiscal     and monetary          policies

incompatible        with   a commitment          to the peg.       Virtuous        countries,          however,       could

also    face   currency        crises    if competitive          trends    had changed           the    real    exchange

rate,    requiring       an adjustment          of the nominal          parity.     Although       Bretton       Woods
                                                              47

wag    designed      as an adjustable           pegged     system,         in practice,        countries         were

reluctant       to voluntarily        alter      their     parities         because    they     were    punished         by

adverse     capital      movements       even    if there          were    only    a hint    that    devaluation          or

revaluation       was    in the offing.          Consequently,             when    delayed     adjustment         finally

occurred,       it was traumatic.          Delay     was possible            because    of capital          controls,

but    in the    end capital       controls        could      not avert       an attack       on the peg that

either     set of circumstances            precipitated.

         Fourth,     Bretton      Woods    itself       was    subject       to a systemic          crisis.       The

unwillingness        of the United         States,       the reserve          center    country,        to conduct            its

affairs     in a noninflationary            manner,        and of the nonreserve                countries         to absorb

the dollar       spillovers       from    U.S. balance-of-payments                   deficits       doomed       the

system.

         Fifth,     the experience         of the       subsequent          snake    and ERM resonates             with

that   of Bretton        Woods.    Despite       more    elaborate          arrangements        than    existed         under

Bretton     Woods    to defend      parities       under       attack,       these    systems       also    succumbed.

A lesson     of the      1992-93    ERM currency           crises         is that    in today’s        world      of highly

mobile     capital      and deep     international            capital      markets,     it is possible             for

developed       countries     to obtain         whatever       resources          are required       to defend          their

parities.       However,     the price      of doing          so in the       form of astronomical                short-

term   interest      rates    is often      prohibitive,             and the market          is aware       of this

constraint.

         Sixth,     the recent      currency       crises          in Chile       and Mexico     represent         clear

examples     of inconsistency            between     domestic         priorities       and the demands             of

adherence       to their     parities.

         Seventh,       the theory       of self-fulfilling               speculative        attacks       may    have

intellectual        merit    but contributes            nothing       to our understanding              of real-world
                                                       48

events. In every crisis examined here, the fundamentals are more than adequate

to account for the actions of speculators.
