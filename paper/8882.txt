The Non-Optimality of Proposed Monetary Policy Rules Under
Timeless-Perspective Commitment

                                              ABSTRACT


        Several recent papers have usefully emphasized the inefficiency that arises from discretionary
monetary policymaking, relative to optimal policy from a “timeless perspective,” in macroeconomic
models with forward-looking private behavior. The inefficiency in question is in terms of average
outcomes of the conditional expectation of a policy objective that reflects the discounted present value
of current and future period losses (which involve squared deviations of inflation and output from
specified target levels). In the literature, most of the analysis has been conducted in an optimizing model
that features a Calvo-Rotemberg price adjustment equation that includes a “cost-push” shock term. This
literature suggests that policy, which keeps inflation equal to a negative multiple of the change in the
output gap, is optimal with respect to the criterion mentioned above—the unconditional expectation of
the policymaker’s objective function. Results reported here show, however, that this is not the case—that
an alternative policy rule, suggested by the approach of “policy design” rather than by “optimal control,”
delivers superior results.

        Several recent papers, some quite prominent,1 have usefully emphasized the

inefficiency that arises from discretionary monetary policymaking, relative to optimal policy

from a “timeless perspective,” in macroeconomic models with forward-looking private

behavior. The inefficiency in question is in terms of average outcomes of the conditional

expectation of a policy objective that reflects the discounted present value of current and

future period losses (which involve squared deviations of inflation and output from specified

target levels). “Forward-looking” in the statement above means that expectations of future

variables (e.g., inflation) appear in structural relations representing private behavior. In the

literature in question, most of the analysis has been conducted in an optimizing model that

includes a price adjustment equation of the Calvo-Rotemberg type, often referred to as a New

Keynesian Phillips Curve, that includes a “cost-push” shock term.

        Policy from a timeless perspective reflects a type of commitment, on the part of the

optimizing monetary policymaker, that avoids influences from the conditions that happen to

prevail at the date at which the posited type of policy behavior begins. It is therefore arguably

more credible than policy behavior that has the central bank planning to behave differently in

the policy’s initial period than in those to follow (as with ordinary commitment choices). It

has the feature of being time-consistent from its own perspective, although not from the

viewpoint of Kydland and Prescott (1977).2 The literature seems to suggest that policy

satisfying stated conditions—exemplified by (5) below—is optimal with respect to the

criterion mentioned above, the unconditional expectation of the policymaker’s objective

function. It has recently been shown by Jensen (2001a), however, that this is not the case—

 Among the more prominent papers are those of Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (1999), H. Jensen (1999), and
Woodford (1999a, 1999b, 2000, 2001). Other significant items include Dennis (2001), Gianonni (2001),
McCallum and Nelson (2000), Steinsson (2000), Svensson and Woodford (1999), Vestin (2000), and Walsh
(2001).

that an alternative policy rule, suggested by the approach of “policy design” rather than by

“optimal control,” delivers superior results.3 The magnitude of improvement is not large, for

realistic parameter values, but is distinctly non-zero. The purpose of the present note is to

provide a compact description and demonstration of this particular result of Jensen’s (2001a).

         Following Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (CGG, 1999), H. Jensen (1999), Woodford

(1999a, 1999b), and others, suppose that price adjustment behavior is given by

(1)      πt = βEtπt+1 + αyt + ut,                                                 α > 0, 0 < β < 1,

where πt is inflation, yt is the output gap, and ut is a stochastic shock term that is assumed to

be autoregressive of order one with AR parameter ρ and innovation variance σ2. By the

output gap we mean the fractional difference between realized output and the flexible-price

or natural-rate level of output.

         The policymaker’s objective at an arbitrary time t = 1 is to minimize

              ∞
(2)      E1   ∑
              t =1
                     βt-1 (πt2 + ω yt2),


where ω ≥ 0 reflects the relative importance of output-gap variability in policymaker

preferences.4 The macroeconomic model that we have in mind also includes an optimizing

IS-type relationship of the form

(3)      yt = Etyt+1 + b(Rt − Etπt+1) + vt,                                          b < 0,

where Rt is the central bank’s interest rate instrument and vt is a shock that pertains to

preferences, government spending, and the exogenous natural-rate value of output. But we

shall suppose, as in much of the literature under discussion, that the central bank (CB) can

 Policy design is the term used by Prescott (1977) for a procedure that involves search for optimal policy-rule
parameters after solving the model with a policy rule that includes all relevant state variables. The procedure
has been used by Taylor (1979), Rotemberg and Woodford (1999), and others.



                                                        2
directly control πt as an instrument—an assumption that is innocuous for the purposes of this

note (though not for all issues). Then relation (3) becomes irrelevant, and the policy problem

is to minimize (2) subject to the constraint in (1) for the current and all future periods.

         The optimality conditions proposed by CGG (1999, p. 1703) and Woodford (1999a,

p. 24; 1999b, pp. 305-6), followed by McCallum and Nelson (2000), may be written as

follows:5

(4a)     2 ω yt + α λ t = 0                                         t = 1, 2, …

(4b)     2 πt − λt + λt-1 = 0                                        t = 2, 3, …

(4c)     2 πt − λt = 0                                               t = 1.

Here it is arbitrarily assumed that the policy is being initiated (started up) in period t = 1. But

to adopt the timeless perspective, the CB ignores (4c) and applies (4b) in period 1 as well as

in 2, 3, …. Substituting out the Lagrangian multiplier yields

(5)      πt = −(ω/α)(yt − yt-1).

Thus the behavior of πt and yt is governed, under the proposed timeless perspective

commitment policy, by relations (1) and (5) for periods t = 1, 2, ….

         The minimum-state-variable (MSV) solution6 for this system is of the form

(6)      πt = φ11yt-1 + φ12 ut

(7)      yt = φ21yt-1 + φ22 ut,

and the coefficients can straightforwardly be found to equal φ11 = (ω/α)(1−δ), φ12 = (γ−βδ)-1,

φ21 = δ, and φ22 = −(α/ω)(γ−βδ)-1, where δ = [γ−(γ2 − 4β)0.5]/2β with γ = 1 + β + (α2/ω).7



4
  For notational simplicity, we assume zero to be the target values of inflation and the output gap.

  Here λt denotes the Lagrangian multiplier attached to constraint (1) for period t.

This solution agrees with those of CGG (1999) and Woodford (1999b, pp. 295, 307), and is

dynamically stable (so Eπt = 0 and Eyt =0).

           To summarize policy performance, CGG (1999), Woodford (1999a, 1999b), and

McCallum and Nelson (2000) report average values of the loss function (2), i.e., values of the

unconditional expectation of (2). Because of the law of iterated expectations, that expression

equals (2) with E replacing E1. Then taking E inside the summation operator, we find that

the result equals (1 − β)-1 times the unconditional expectation of the single-period loss,

E(πt2 + ω yt2). That equality is used here only for evaluation purposes, however; it is not

utilized in the derivation (which is not discussed here) of the proposed conditions (4). In the

cited papers, the values of the average loss criterion just described is reported for outcomes

with policy rule (5) and compared with values resulting when (5) is replaced with the optimal

discretionary policy condition, which is

(8)        πt = −(ω/α) yt ,

as shown by CGG (1999), Woodford (1999a, 1999b), or McCallum and Nelson (2000). In

all of their reported cases, the average loss with (5), henceforth denoted L(5), is smaller than

that obtained with rule (8).

           What Jensen (2001a) demonstrates, however, is that (5) does not yield the smallest

average loss, even if attention is restricted to rules (i.e., conditions for πt) including the same

variables as (5). Specifically, if policy is conducted according to

(9)        πt = −(ω/α)(yt − β yt-1),

then average values of (2) are smaller.8 Table 1 below reports some representative results for

L(5) and (analogously-defined) L(9) for various values of the parameters ω, β, and ρ, given


8
    Since writing this note, we have learned that a very recent paper by Blake (2001) also reports this result.


                                                           4
α = 0.02 and E(ut2) = (1−ρ2)-1σ2 = (0.005)2.9 Since our calibration implicitly assumes

quarter-year time periods, and outcomes are reported in fractional units, the value of 0.0625

for ω represents equal weights on πt2 and yt2 in the objective function. It is clear from the

numbers in Table 1 that policy rule (9) provides smaller losses than does (5) over a wide

range of parameter magnitudes. The difference is greater when β is smaller, of course, and

when ρ is large.

         A few words are needed concerning optimization conditional upon initial conditions.

It is widely recognized that condition (5) fails to minimize (2), given y0 and u1, if applied in t

= 1 as well as t = 2, 3, ….10 Jensen (2001a) points out that, in addition, (5) is not generally

optimal within the class of rules—conditions applied in all periods 1, 2, …—of the same

form. With specified values of y0 and u1, for example, one can find a rule including the same

variables as (5) that yields a lower value of (2) than does (5), with optimal coefficient values

that depend on the initial conditions. As an example, suppose that y0 = 0.03 and u1 = −0.01

with ω = 0.0625, ρ = 0.5 and β = 0.99. Then (5) yields a loss value for (2) of 0.008878

whereas the use of

(10)     πt = -2.617 yt +2.502 yt-1

results in a loss of 0.008658. 11 This example illustrates that (5) does not minimize (2) when

the same condition must be used in all periods, at least not in general. 12 13

  This last magnitude is of no importance; changing it would scale all the values in Table 1 up or down
proportionately.

   See, among others, Woodford (1999b), Svensson and Woodford (1999), King and Wolman (1999), and
Dennis (2001).
11
   Calculation of these values is discussed by Jensen (2001b). All reported results use the MSV solution.
12
   Condition (5) is optimal in this case if y0 = 0, but not otherwise.
13
   No table is provided since it would require extensive computation and a single example suffices to make the
point at issue.


                                                       5
       Overall, our point is not that there is anything conceptually wrong with the timeless

perspective type of policy making, in which the initial period policy reaction function is

constrained to be the same as in all succeeding periods, but that (5) is not the optimal

condition from this perspective, even if conditions (4) minimize (2). Jensen (2001a) argues

that the fashion in which optimality conditions (4) of the unconstrained problem are modified

to produce (5) does not give the optimality conditions for the constrained problem. Here our

objective is not to put forth any explanation, however, but merely to demonstrate the

superiority of rule (9) over the previously-utilized (5) from the perspective of the average

value of the loss function (2). We also point out the non-optimality of (5) with respect to

objective (2) on a conditional basis, when credible commitment requires that the same policy

rule be used in all periods including the one in which the policy regime is introduced.
