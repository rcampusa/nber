Adverse Selection and the Challenges to Stand-Alone Prescription Drug Insurance

JEL No.G22, I18

                                           ABSTRACT

This paper investigates a possible predictor of adverse selection problems in unsubsidized "stand-
alone" prescription drug insurance: the persistence of an individual's high spending over multiple
years. Using MEDSTAT claims data and data from the Medicare Survey of Current Beneficiaries,
we find that persistence is much higher for outpatient drug expenses than for other categories of
medical expenses. We then use these estimates to develop a simple and intuitive model of adverse
selection in competitive insurance markets and show that this high relative persistence makes it
unlikely that unsubsidized drug insurance can be offered for sale, even with premiums partially risk
adjusted, without a probable adverse selection death spiral. We show that this outcome can be
avoided if drug coverage is bundled with other coverage, and briefly discuss the need either for
comprehensive coverage or generous subsidies if adverse selection is to be avoided in private and
Medicare insurance markets.

Introduction


       Providing insurance coverage against expenditures for prescription drugs through

unsubsidized but sometimes regulated private insurance markets has proved to be difficult.

Medigap policies for elderly provide only limited coverage, and are not taken by many of those

over 65. Of those not covered by employer-paid plans, only a small fraction of seniors take a

Medigap policy that pays anything for drugs. For people under age 65, drug-only coverage is

virtually unavailable, and some managed care insurers are putting upper limits on the bundled

coverage they do offer. In this paper, we use novel methods applied to claims data to show that

adverse selection is an important cause of the absence of or limits to stand-alone drug coverage

for both populations.

       We further argue that private markets without substantial subsidies will not be able to

offer stand-alone drug coverage. This means, we will show, that such coverage is neither to be

expected nor desired for the under-65 population; the more integrated coverage that characterizes

managed care may therefore be more feasible than a return to the old “Blue” system in which

each type of provider fielded a separate type of insurance. We also show that Medicare policy

makers should likewise be cognizant of the chance of adverse selection for stand alone coverage.

If stand alone coverage is infeasible for the under-65 population, as we show, that analysis also

provides evidence that it is also likely (perhaps even more likely) to be infeasible for the over-65

population. Moreover, examination of adverse selection in the under-65 market is of interest in

its own right, both as a test of the general hypothesis that unsubsidized unbundled coverage is

infeasible, and as a warning that such coverage is neither to be encouraged nor expected.

       We then go further to develop a method to show what type of bundling and/or what types

and levels of subsidies would be needed to make voluntary drug coverage (public or private)
                                                                                                    2

viable. We illustrate these methods with data for both the under-65 and the Medicare

populations.



Adverse Selection in Concept and Application to Prescription Drugs



       A potential threat to the efficiency and even the feasibility of unsubsidized private market

insurance coverage for any expense is adverse selection. Adverse selection occurs when

potential insurance buyers are better able to predict their expected benefits from insurance than

are insurers, or when insurers are forbidden to charge higher premiums to those they expect to

claim higher benefits. Such special buyer knowledge, should it occur, can have many causes, but

adverse selection by new health insurance purchasers is surely more likely if there are health

conditions known to the buyer for which above-average expenditures will persist over time

(Crippen 2002).

       If the insurer is not as well informed as is the buyer about the existence of these

conditions, or is not permitted to charge higher premiums to those expected to have higher

expenses, a buyer with high and persistent expenditures in one period will be eager to obtain

generous insurance coverage of that type of expenditure for the next period at premiums that do

not fully reflect the higher expected benefits. Similarly, those with low expected expenses will

be less willing to pay insurance premiums that substantially exceed their expected claims.

       While insurers may ask applicants about prior period spending, it will be difficult for

them to enforce truthful revelation for prospective purchasers they have not previously insured

and for whom they have no prior claims data. Community rating rules may prevent them from

gathering or using that information. Since group insurance typically does not vary the premiums
                                                                                                      3

with risk across options, and since Medicare itself is likely to use a uniform premium for any

drug coverage option, in what follows we usually assume pure community rating. We do,

however, inquire whether using adjusted community rating (adjusting premiums for age and sex)

would make a difference, and find that it would not. In summary, adverse selection in the sale of

new coverage is likely to be a more serious problem, other things equal, for conditions and

medical product expenditures that persist over time than for conditions and product expenses

which are a “bolt from the blue” and generally resolve fairly quickly (by patient recovery or

death).

          Another vehicle used by buyers to engage in adverse selection when consumers can

choose among different health plans (in individual or group markets) is an ability to select the

details of coverage for various types of expenses. Most generally, it is easier for buyers to

engage in adverse selection if they can pick and choose amounts and types of coverage, rather

than take or leave a predetermined broad-based policy. If a person knows that he or she had high

previous period medical expenses on certain medical goods or services, adverse selection is

enhanced by the ability to choose coverage that only (or primarily) covers these costs.

          We therefore investigated the persistence over time of high levels of spending for a type

of medical care that is often a candidate for selective coverage: outpatient prescription drug

expense. The problem of adverse selection is thought to be especially acute in individually

chosen, unsubsidized, but regulated and partially community-rated Medigap drug coverage. The

failure of basic Medicare to cover outpatient drugs has meant that seniors with incomes above

the Medicaid limits seeking such coverage must do so largely in the currently-unsubsidized

private market, either in the form of supplementary Medigap coverage or a managed care plan

with such coverage. For the under-65 population, there is at present much less stand-alone drug
                                                                                                     4

coverage than in Medicare (probably for the reasons we identify), but the extent of coverage can

vary across the options available to employees in larger firms or to purchasers in the individual

market.

       While there are a number of sources of data for prescription drug benefits for both under-

65 and Medicare populations, because we wanted to investigate the effect of combining or

“bundling” drug coverage with other coverage, this study required information on a population’s

use of benefits for all covered medical services as well as for drugs. Because we wanted to

examine persistence over a reasonably long period of time, we wanted data that covered multiple

years. We therefore examined two sets of data: (1) a large sample of claims data for drugs and

other kinds of medical spending for a working age population and (2) data on Medicare

beneficiaries from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS). We also used a sub-

analysis of workers in the five years before Medicare eligibility at age 65, to show that the

problem of persistence in spending is worse for them than for younger adults because the extent

of and prevalence of persistent expenditures increases with age.

       The key issue in predicting the extent of adverse selection is the distribution of expected

expenses in a population charged a uniform insurance premium. We propose a simple method to

estimate this distribution, and to use this estimate along with an assumption about the strength of

risk aversion to see how likely it is that adverse selection will emerge.

       Our research differs from that presently available in several ways. There have been some

studies of the persistence of drug spending from one year to the following year only (Ettner

1997; Long 1994; van Vliet 1992; Wouters, 1991, Coulson and Stuart, 1992), but we follow

spending over periods of three to five years. There have been some studies that looked at long

term persistence for total medical care spending (Eichner et al., 1998), but none that explored the
                                                                                                     5

category of drug spending. There have also been some studies that looked at adverse selection

(and moral hazard) in the Medigap market as a whole (Wolfe and Goddeeris, 1991). They used

sophisticated (but rather fragile) econometric methods, to determine adverse selection and

separate it from moral hazard. They also did not look at drug spending and drug coverage

specifically. In contrast, we use a different method based on direct estimation of the distribution

of risks to judge the likelihood of adverse selection, and do apply that method to drug coverage

as well as comprehensive coverage. The recent study by Atherly (2002) is closest to ours in

looking at adverse selection into Medigap drug coverage, but it does not consider more

comprehensive drug coverage or stand-alone drug coverage.



Methods



       We first explore the relative importance of persistence in prescription drug expenditures

compared to other expenditures. To show the impact of persistence and selective coverage on

adverse selection, we then take the analysis two steps further. In the first step, we simulate the

equilibrium premiums in insurance markets for drug coverage alone, and for comprehensive (all

medical services) coverage. We show that adverse selection under community rating or with

some risk rating is much worse in the former case than in the latter, in two senses. First, the ratio

of the market equilibrium premium to the premium that would have prevailed if all (risk averse)

people bought coverage is higher for unsubsidized stand-alone drug insurance than for

comprehensive coverage: because of the widely skewed distribution of expected expenses, low

risk people would need to pay proportionately much more than their average expenses. Even

fairly risk averse people at the median risk level would be unlikely to be willing to pay the
                                                                                                  6

premiums insurers must charge to cover their costs. Second, the risk premium is smaller for

stand-alone drug coverage than for comprehensive coverage, precisely because drug expenses

are so predictable. Indeed, for many plausible values of consumer risk premia and some

plausible assumptions about insurer premium rating, we show that it is impossible to offer stand-

alone drug insurance at premiums that will cover its costs; there is a death spiral for unsubsidized

insurance.

       In the second step, we illustrate the level of subsidies that would be needed to make

stand-alone coverage viable. We then offer some observations on the policy tradeoffs, for both

Medicare and the private sector, between subsidies and “bundling” of coverage.

       Our initial analysis is based on claims data provided by the MEDSTAT Group for a large

sample of workers and adult dependents with comprehensive insurance that covered prescription

drugs over a five-year-period from 1994 to 1998 inclusive. We use this data set to develop

estimates of adverse selection in unsubsidized insurance for the under-65 population; the large

size of this data base allows us to examine the impact of several variants of the basic model. We

then use the validated basic model to analyze adverse selection in the smaller MCBS data set.

The high consistency of results across both data sets reinforces our confidence in the results.



Data and Descriptive Statistics: MEDSTAT under-65 data



       We followed the MEDSTAT claims and benefits expenditure experience of those persons

who retained coverage over the entire period. (We also looked at those who were in the database

for shorter periods of time, but their experience is not described here.) We do not know the

details of each person’s coverage but the plans are known to be similar in terms of coverage.
                                                                                                     7

Our results could be biased if people who remained with these plans over a five-year period were

those with unusually high drug expenses. However, since the coverage for this population is

employment-based coverage chosen by and for a group of workers, not an individual worker, and

since, as noted, stand-alone drug coverage is not generally available in groups, we think the bias

should be small. We did not include data on people who died. But the data still provides valid

measures from the viewpoint of the surviving population which might purchase insurance.

       Following Eichner, et al. (1998), we first describe persistence by asking what happened

over time to the (relative) expenditure levels for various categories of expenditures of those who

had unusually high expenses in the first period (1994). We characterize high spenders in 1994 in

two ways—as being in the top quintile of 1994 expenses, and as spending more than $5000.

(Those with zero expenditures are included in the population.)

       There were 140,981 persons between the ages of 22 and 64 in 1998 who had continuous

medical and pharmacy coverage for the period 1994-1998.2 As shown in Table 1, of those in the

top quintile of total spending in 1994, only 46 percent remained in that quintile by 1998. The

largest decline occurred in the first year, with a more gradual erosion later.

       Table 1 also shows the percentages remaining in the top quintile for drug expenditures

only and for total expenditures minus drug expenditures. By this measure, persistence is

definitely higher for drug expenditures; 60% remained in the top drug spending quintile in 1998,

while only 40 percent remained in the top quintile for expenditures other than drugs.

       Table 2 shows the percent of those with expenses above $5000 who also had expenses

above that level in the next year (a measure used by Eichner, et al. (1998)). Persistence tends to

rise with age, and our figures are very close to those in the Eichner study.
                                                                                                      8

       We next calculated, for each of the expenditure categories, the ratio of the average

expenditure in each year of those who were in the top quintile in 1994 to the average expenditure

for the entire population in that year. The higher this number, the more likely is adverse

selection. As shown in Table 3, the ratio between the average or expected expenses of high

spenders and the community (average) rate is virtually identical in the initial year (1994) for the

two categories of spending but, in all subsequent years, is considerably higher for drug spending

only than for total spending. This indicates that, in any single time period, drug expenditures

display about the same amount of skewedness as other medical expenditures. The major

difference is that, in subsequent periods, those with unusually high drug expenses are much more

likely to repeat that high spending than those initially with high spending in other categories.

The level of drug expected expenses is much more predictable for an individual than is the level

of other expenses.



Potential Adverse Selection in the MEDSTAT Data



       To determine the potential seriousness of adverse selection for different types or

combinations of types, we and whether it might be serious enough to cause a “death spiral,” we

used a simulation model. Under the assumption that the person must either buy the indicated

coverage or none at all, we assume various levels of risk aversion and estimate what proportion

of consumers will continue to buy coverage, and what the average expense of those willing to

buy will be. For the present, we also ignore moral hazard, and assume the level of expense that

insurance will cover is the same as the expense the person who declines coverage would pay out-

of-pocket.
                                                                                                      9

       We approach this problem in two ways, which we label “statistical” and “economic.” In

both cases we focus on predicting 1998 expenses. The methods differ in the technique used to

estimate the expected expense for each person. In the statistical (or actuarial) approach, people

are classified into cells based on age, gender, and prior spending. The cell mean expense in 1997

is used as an estimate of expected expense in 1998; this approach only explores persistence over

a two year period. In the economic approach, in contrast, a regression relating expenses in 1998

to age, gender, and expense in the previous four years is used to generate expected expense in the

last year both for drug spending and for spending on other types of inpatient and outpatient

medical care.3

       This expected expense (estimated under either method) compared to actual expense

generates an estimate of the variance of expenses, which is combined with an assumed uniform

risk aversion coefficient to generate a value for the risk premium (Phelps 2003). The same

approach to estimating the risk premium is used in both the statistical and economics methods;

the methods differ in how they generate estimates of the variance in spending for individuals.

Note that the more predictable the expense, the lower the variance and therefore the lower the

buyer risk premium (and the more likely adverse selection, other things equal). Adding the risk

premium to the expected expense yields a “reservation price” for full insurance coverage for a

given type of expense for each person. If the reservation price for a person at a given risk level

is less than the insurance premium that would be charged, we assume that the person declines

coverage. (Allowing the risk aversion coefficient to vary across individuals (for a given value of

the variance of spending) would not alter the results as long as it is not correlated with expected

expense or variance.)
                                                                                                   10

       The key step then is to determine, for a given “policy” (described by full coverage of the

batch of covered expenses: all expenses; all expenses less drug spending; drug spending only)

whether there is a stable equilibrium or whether there is a “spiral” that drives some or all

potential insureds at a given risk level out of the market. That is, we ask what proportion of the

initial population would be willing to pay the premium a (hypothetical actuarially fair) insurer

would have to charge to cover their expenses.4

       We consider full coverage insurance without patient cost sharing, and initially ignore

moral hazard. We also ignore insurer administrative costs and initially assume that the insurance

premium must be strictly community rated but sufficient to cover benefits costs, so that the

premium charged for a policy offered to a given set of people is the average expected expense

for people in that set. Offering that policy at that premium is then a potential equilibrium if each

person in the set has a reservation price for insurance that equals or exceeds the insurance

premium. For example, one could begin with the question of whether the community rated

premium is below the reservation price of the people in the lowest percentile of expected

expenses in the set. If the reservation price falls short of the premium for some of the lower risk

percentiles, we then delete those persons from the data set, recompute the breakeven premium,

and check to see if it is below the reservation price of the lowest risk percentile remaining.

Finally, as mentioned above, we assume pure community rating unless explicitly noted

otherwise.



A Simple “Statistical” Model
                                                                                                   11

       We wish to illustrate how adverse selection is related to the degree of persistence of

spending over time and the relative importance of that influence on expected expense. We begin

with a simple benchmark model that gives maximum influence to previous period spending.

       We first classify the 141,000 observations on adults by age and gender into 18 cells and,

within each age-gender cell, by deciles of 1997 spending. Using the population represented by

all of the observations that fell in a decile in 1997, we calculate the mean 1998 expense for that

population. We then assume, for each decile age-gender cell, that this quantity is the estimate of

expected expense for everyone in the cell.5 (We have also estimated models with disaggregation

into unit percentiles with similar results.) That is we assume that consumers used this realized

mean as their estimate of expenses they expect in 1998 (To the extent that individual consumers

use more information than we have assumed, adverse selection will be even worse.) We also

assume that the variance of within-cell spending about the cell mean provides an estimate (used

by consumers in that cell) of the “expected variance” of spending for individuals in each cell.

       To calculate the risk premium, we must make an assumption about risk aversion. We

use various assumed values for the “coefficient of risk aversion” (Phelps 2003). If, for example,

we use a coefficient of risk aversion of 0.0002, we calculate the risk premium RP according to

the formula:



RP = 0.5 (0.0002)(variance of spending).



We then define the reservation price P by: P=RP + (expected expenses). 6
                                                                                                   12

       If all persons were expected to purchase insurance, the 1998 competitive (breakeven)

community-rated premium would be the mean of 1998 benefits B. (Other administrative costs

and insurer profit are ignored here.) That premium would only be a competitive equilibrium

price if every person had a higher reservation price than the premium. If that were the case, all

would buy insurance, and average expenses for insured persons would turn out to be just covered

by the insurer’s premium, which equals that population average expense.

       Suppose, however, that P for the lowest risk decile is less than B. All of the risks in that

decile will decline coverage, and an insurer would anticipate experiencing expenses that are the

mean of expenses for persons in the other nine deciles, an amount larger than B. We then

determine whether P for the second lowest decile is higher or lower than this new mean. If not,

the premium will have to increase further, and the process continues until we reach a decile at

which the value of P for that decile is greater than the mean expense or premium for the

remaining population of purchasers. If the only group for which this is true is the highest decile

of 1997 expenses, we can say that there has been a “death spiral” in which all but the highest

risks have been driven from the market.

       Table 4 shows the simulation results from this process. (Note that, because the table

shows the result of a simulation, not an estimation, there are no goodness of fit or other statistical

measures.). The numbers in the table indicate the decile of spending above which insurance

would be purchased in equilibrium for a range of plausible values for risk aversion.7 For

example, if r = 0.0002, the equilibrium for total spending occurs in the seventh decile. This

means that somewhat more than half of the population (those in deciles 1 to 6) would not buy

insurance to cover all medical care costs because the premium exceeds their reservation prices,

but a sizeable minority would be willing to purchase. In contrast, according to this method the
                                                                                                  13

equilibrium premium for drug-only coverage occurs in the tenth (highest) decile. This means

that only the very highest risks (if anyone) would buy drug coverage. Altering the assumed

degree of risk aversion affects the proportion of the population which would buy comprehensive

coverage, but there is no plausible level of risk aversion at which most people buy stand-alone

drug coverage.



An Economic Model



       The alternative estimation approach begins with a regression of 1998 expenses on a

constant term and expenses in the previous four years, controlling (with binary variables) for age

and gender. The regression equation is:



            4                 n
DRUGEXP = ∑ α ik DRUGEXP    + ∑ AGEGENDERDUM
       it               t−k                  j
          k =1                j



where DRUGEXPit is the drug expense of a person i in period t, and AGEGENDERDUMj is a

binary variable for whether the person is in the jth of n different age-gender cells.

       We used a linear functional form based on previous work that showed a linear form to be

a good predictor of expected expenses (Pauly and Herring, 1999) and preliminary analysis of the

data that confirmed this result for this data. Table 5 presents the variables used and some

statistics from these regressions. As expected, the adjusted R squared is much higher for the

drug only regression (0.6) compared to the other two regressions (0.19 and 0.13); drug expenses

are much more predictable. (Coefficients for the 17 binary age-sex variables are not shown.)
                                                                                                 14

Also, the coefficients on previous period spending are larger and more precisely estimated for

drug only spending than for the other two measures of spending. While current period drug

spending is largely determined by drug spending in the immediate past period, current period

spending on other types of medical care depends strongly on spending over several years in the

recent past.

       We next calculate the standard error of the prediction from the regression, and use this as

an estimate of the variance of expenses for each individual. For various values of risk aversion,

we then calculate the (proportional) risk premium. For example, for total expenses and r =

0.0001, the proportional risk premium is 0.745. This implies that, rather than go without

insurance, the person would be willing to pay a premium 1.745 times as high as expected

expense (equivalent to a maximum loading as a percentage of premium of 43%). In contrast, the

proportional risk premium for drug-only coverage is much lower, at 0.054. Severe adverse

selection occurs in drug-only coverage because of the combination of high predictability of drug

spending and consequent low willingness to pay much more than expected expenses.

       We apply the same proportional risk premium to each person’s expected expenses to

generate an estimate of the reservation price. We then arrange individuals in order based on

expected expenses and follow the same procedure as in the previous case.

       Table 6 shows the results in terms of the percentile of the distribution of expected

expenses at which people buy coverage, under the assumption of pure community rating. The

results are striking: despite some adverse selection, comprehensive total coverage can be sold to

much of the population if people are moderately risk averse; there will not be a serious “spiral.”

But even at the highest level of risk aversion, very few buy stand-alone drug coverage. With the

lowest value of risk aversion (r = 0.0001) there is also a fairly severe problem of adverse
                                                                                                   15

selection even with more comprehensive coverage. With higher levels of risk aversion, however,

death spirals do not occur for more comprehensive coverage, and 70 to 99 percent or more of the

population would choose in equilibrium to obtain this insurance rather than go without. The

proportion of lower risks which drops out is, of course, higher if drug expenses are included in

the comprehensive coverage than if they are left uncovered.

       We investigated what would happen if, instead of pure community rating, insurers were

able or permitted to use modified community rating in which premiums varied by purchaser age

and gender (which are easy to determine), but not by prior-period medical care spending. We

assume that premiums are set equal to average benefits in gender-five-year age cells. (Even our

large data set does not allow precise estimates of spending for single-year-age cells.) As one

would expect, Table 7 shows that permitting some risk rating reduces the predicted amount of

adverse selection and leads to a larger proportion of the population buying coverage. (In this

model, high risks never find premiums to be “unaffordable,” since there is no moral hazard and

no income effects on the risk premium.) However, even with modified community rating, stand-

alone drug coverage cannot be profitably marketed; there are still death spirals under all

assumptions about risk aversion.

       What happens to these estimates if we add the possibility that the expenses consumers

will make without insurance may be less than those they make when they have coverage? That

is, what happens if we take account of moral hazard, which seems to characterize outpatient drug

spending (Newhouse, et al. 1993; Hillman, et al. 1999)? If some of the expenses made by

insured persons are caused by moral hazard, and therefore have values to consumers that are less

than their costs, insurance coverage will be less attractive than in the no-moral-hazard case

(Pauly 1971). More people will decline coverage; and adverse selection will be worse.
                                                                                                    16

       We simulate the effect of moral hazard by assuming that 20 percent of insured drug

spending is attributable to moral hazard.8 Under conventional economic assumptions, the value

of this additional spending will be half of its cost;9 the effect of moral hazard therefore is to

reduce the total value of drug insurance by 10 percent. As would be expected, the combination

of moral hazard and adverse selection reduces the proportion estimated to buy comprehensive

coverage even further, by about 10 percent. As before, almost no one buys stand alone drug

insurance.

       Finally, we specifically examine the MEDSTAT experience of the age group closest to

Medicare: those aged 55 to 59 in 1994 (who were 60 to 64 at the end of the period). As already

noted in Table 3, the year-to-year correlation of spending is highest in the oldest age group. (The

expense prediction regression for this subgroup (not shown) is estimated from data for this

subgroup only.) Table 8 shows that, as before, adverse selection prevents the purchase in market

equilibrium of drug-only coverage. Compared to Table 6, the market share of coverage that

bundles drug spending with other medical expenses (total expenses) is smaller for this age group

than for the overall population at low values of risk aversion, but is higher at higher values of

risk aversion.

       These simulation-based estimates of the proportion of the population remaining in the

market are obviously not definitive, but they do strongly suggest that, for reasonable assumptions

about parameter values, it would be very difficult for a market to offer unsubsidized stand-alone

drug coverage, even in the under-65 market. Of course, the presence of a substantial tax subsidy

coupled with offering of group insurance coverage may make such a policy feasible in the

employment-based group insurance market. Even here, there would likely be problems if stand-

alone insurance were offered in a multiple-choice setting. What is most important in this
                                                                                                     17

analysis, however, is the comparison of market equilibria between all-inclusive coverage and

drug only coverage. Drug-only coverage causes much more severe adverse selection even if it

does not go into a total death spiral. Based on these findings, it should then be unsurprising that

drug-only coverage is rare among the non-elderly. Not only that, but in multiple choice

employment settings, it appears to be relatively rare for an employer to offer a choice among

plans that do and do not offer drug coverage. While offerings vary in other dimensions,

employers tend to choose either all plans with drug benefits, or no plans with drug benefits.



Medicare Drug Spending



       We assembled a three-year panel (1997-99) of Medicare beneficiaries from the MCBS.

Persons with incomes so low they were on or were eligible for Medicaid were excluded; the

Medicare population we study is the one that might be expected to be potential purchasers of

voluntary insurance. The number of observations is 2945 in each year. We regressed 1999

spending for each person on spending in the prior two years along with additional binary

variables (age and gender). (Regression results available from the authors) As before, the

explanatory power of prior periods’ spending is much greater for drug spending than for total

spending ( R 2 = 0.34 for drug spending and 0.18 for total spending), and there is a statistically

significant effect of prior years’ spending on total spending.

       We then used the coefficients and statistics from this regression to determine the probable

extent of adverse selection. Table 9 shows (using the same methods as earlier) that stand-alone

drug spending is generally infeasible for the Medicare population, even at breakeven premiums.

However, bundled coverage could induce voluntary purchasing if risk aversion is moderate.
                                                                                                 18




Needed Medicare Subsidy



       Ignoring moral hazard and the possibility of risk rating, we estimated the subsidy to

stand-alone drug coverage needed to get 80 percent of the Medicare population to voluntarily

buy such coverage, if their only other alternative was no coverage. (This calculation does not

take account of the availability of coverage through Medicaid or employer programs; it is

intended to be illustrative of the orders of magnitudes involved.) We do this by setting the

subsidy equal to the difference between the willingness to pay of the group at the 80th percentile

and the breakeven premium for the 80 percent highest risks. Table 10 shows that the estimated

subsidy is large as a percentage of the premium for this group. Adding the administrative loading

costs would doubtless raise the absolute and relative subsidies needed.



Conclusion



       This analysis leads us to strongly suspect that drug-only coverage cannot be sold in

competitive insurance markets at premiums that cover its cost. Even for middle class people, its

sale would require a substantial subsidy.

       These results are also very germane to discussions of publicly funded reinsurance of large

medical expenses that provoke adverse selection (and intrusive underwriting screening to avoid

adverse selection) in private insurance (Swartz 2002). The results imply that this problem is

likely to be especially severe for drug expenses, even more so than for larger expenses associated

with other types of medical care which display less persistence over time. One might therefore
                                                                                                   19

conclude that reinsurance that would provide the most appropriate incentives and relief to

insurers would take into account both the amount and the persistence of large claims.

       Another main result is that all-inclusive insurance policies will be less subject to adverse

selection than drug only coverage for the same population. Having said this, however, we cannot

conclude that unregulated competitive markets will necessarily be able to furnish such coverage.

People in the lowest ranks of expected drug spending could have higher expected utility from

coverage that excludes drugs than from coverage that includes it. That is, coverage that excludes

drugs may drive out all-inclusive coverage (that, of course, includes drugs). As long as it is

permitted to sell such coverage, and ignoring other economies or jointness advantages of

comprehensive coverage, we conclude that “drug excluding” coverage would tend to drive out

“drug including” coverage. However, it is instructive that, even in unregulated under-65

markets, the phenomenon of “drug excluding” coverage is now rather uncommon. In any case,

unsubsidized drug-only coverage that would supplement a policy that covers other expenses

would barely survive, even if cost offsets are assumed to be zero.

       Are there devices insurers could incorporate into their policies to mitigate the effects of

adverse selection? One simple solution would be to limit the frequency with which people are

permitted to change coverage, but it is very difficult to lock low risks into policies with such

provisions. Another, more useful method is to incorporate guaranteed renewability at

nondiscriminatory premiums as a required policy provision. This device, if properly used, can

retain the low risks in the pool and greatly diminish the opportunities for adverse selection

(Pauly 2003, Herring and Pauly 2003).

       Current discussions of drug coverage for the Medicare population often envision stand-

alone but fairly generously subsidized community-rated coverage for much of the population.
                                                                                                20

The adverse selection we have identified will be a challenge that must be taken into account, but

one that those subsidies (in the short run) and integrated coverage (in the long run) may help to

overcome.10 However, our results suggest that the subsidy will need to be very generous indeed.

One long-term policy choice is between generous subsidies to stand-alone coverage and less

heavily subsidized but more carefully designed comprehensive insurance. Another policy choice

(for a given public budget) is between a heavily subsidized policy with high deductibles and low

adverse selection and more generous coverage with more beneficiary payment of premiums but

more adverse selection. How much subsidy is needed and how much redesign would help are

questions which should definitely be investigated further.

    Since the youngest members of this cohort were 18 in 1994, this represents all adult workers

and dependents who remained under age 65 in the period.



3
    The statistical approach takes into account any differences across cells in the extent to which

persistence might itself vary with age or gender. The simple regression model in the economic

approach does not allow for such interaction effects, based on preliminary analysis which found

them to be small. Note that this approach assumes that people only use their prior spending to

predict their expenses next period. If they have additional information (e.g., I know that this will

be the year I plan to get my bum knee fixed but insurers do not), adverse selection will be worse

than what is estimated here.



4
    We therefore use only the Medstat claims data and estimate breakeven premiums based on the

claims data. We do not use direct measures of premiums actually paid for coverage of those

claims.



5
    We assume that both insurers and insureds have the same average estimate. While some cells

are small so that the observed sample mean might not be a precise estimate of the population
                                                                                                    35



mean for people with those characteristics, that imprecision will only apply to a small fraction of

the total population.

    For an explanation of this method, see Phelps (2003), Chapter 10 and especially Appendix A.

    Phelps (2003) labels 0.0003 a “moderately high” value of risk aversion, but Pauly and Herring

(2000) found it necessary to use a higher level (0.00095) to generate realistic results in a

simulation of adverse selection for comprehensive group insurance. A level of 0.0003 would

imply that a person would, in Phelps’ example, be willing to buy insurance as long as a premium

were no more than 26 percent greater than expected benefits.



8
    This value is chosen to be consistent with the -0.2 demand elasticity reported by the RAND

Health Insurance Experiment. See Keeler, et al., 1988.



9
    The assumptions here are that the demand curve is approximately linear over the relevant range

and that there are no important income effects on the demand for medical care.



10
     One offset is that greater predictability of drug spending should make it easier in principle to

risk adjust payments to insurers. The insurer used by someone with high current period expenses

will receive a larger payment than the insurer used by someone with low current period

incentives. This diminishes insurer incentives to cream skim, but it does not diminish the

incentive to the high spender to choose the more generous plan.
