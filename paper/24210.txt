                                         ABSTRACT

The prescription drug component of the Consumer Price Index (CPI measures recent and past
drug price changes, and provides the basis for projecting future price trends and health care
expenditures. However, there are concerns about the adequacy of the price data because of recent
changes in the structure of the market for prescription drugs. We compare the prescription drug
data of the CPI with a large alternative data set from the IQVIA Institute for Human Data
Science. We analyze the overall consistency if the data from the two sources, and examine the
influence of the large shift from brand to generic drug sales and the increased reliance on third
party insurance plans that are excluded from the CPI sampling frame.

        The prescription drug components of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Producer
Price Index (PPI) measure recent and historical drug price inflation, and provide the basis for
projecting future price trends and health care expenditures.            They also serve as important inputs
in the construction of the National Health Accounts. However, there are concerns about the
adequacy of these price indexes in light of recent changes in the structure of the market for
prescription drugs. To begin with, there has been a large growth in the reliance on generics as
Medicare Part D and private insurance have increased the financial incentives to adopt generics.
In 2016, it was estimated that unbranded generics accounted for 85 percent of drug prescriptions,
compared with 50 percent in 2005. 4 With an unprecedented number of major drugs coming off
patent in recent years, mismeasurement in the timing and the extent of the transition to generics
could have large consequences.
        Furthermore, the BLS’s ability to obtain price quotes for the CPI program has been
affected by the shift to prescription drug insurance coverage by public and private third-party
payers (TPPs). These electronic transactions require information on the identity of the TPP, the
beneficiary’s identification number, and specific provisions of the benefit plan, such the
copayment rate, information that the pharmacy cannot provide to BLS field staff. As a result,
BLS must rely disproportionately on cash transactions that comprise only about seven percent of
the retail market, raising concerns about the extent to which they are representative of the overall
drug market. 5
        This paper describes an exercise in which we compare the measures of prescription drug
prices reported in the CPI and PPI programs with indexes computed from an alternative set of
price data compiled by the IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science (IQVIA). There are some
fundamental differences in that the CPI aims to measure only the out-of-pocket costs to
consumers and the BLS does not have full access to retail transactions that are embedded in
prescription drug plans. The analysis is thereby limited to a comparison with the cash
transactions of the IQVIA data. The PPI is restricted to drugs produced within the United States,

5A recent overview of the major issues involved in the construction of price indexes for pharmaceuticals is provided
by Aizcorbe and Nestoriak (2012). See also Berndt and others (2000). A discussion of the evolution of the drug
market in response to passage of the 1984 Waxman-Hatch Act is available in Berndt and Aitkin (2011).

excluding imports from both other countries and Puerto Rico, a distinction that is not identified
in the IQVIA data. Thus, the analysis is largely limited to a comparison of the CPI data with that
of IQVIA.
           This paper begins with a description of the basic methodology that is used by the BLS in
the construction of the CPI and PPI price indexes. It is followed by an explanation of the
prescription drug data from IQVIA. The focus of our exercise is on a comparison of the monthly
data from the files of the CPI with corresponding data from IQVIA covering a 5-year period of
2009 to 2013. We construct parallel price indexes from the BLS and IQVIA data for the
aggregate of all prescription drugs and for a set of subcomponents. In the aggregate, we find the
increase in the IQVIA index substantially exceeds that of the CPI, and the difference remains
when the comparison is restricted to a matched set of prescription drugs. In the analysis of the
component indexes, we find that the discrepancy between the IQVIA and CPI is heavily
concentrated in two therapeutic categories of cardiovascular-renal and skin/mucous membranes.
The differences are surprising because the two data sets appear to contain a similar distribution
of drug sales.


CPI for Prescription Drugs
           Prescription drugs accounted for 10 percent of U.S. national health expenditures in 2015.
However, the portion of those costs that are paid directly and recorded as direct out-of-pocket
costs to consumers has fallen dramatically, from 82 percent in 1970 and 28 percent in 2000 to 14
percent in 2015. 6 Health insurance now accounts for about 85 percent of the payments, and since
the introduction of the Medicare Part D in 2006, the private insurance share has fallen to about
40 percent. All the same, the relative importance of prescription drugs has continued to rise in
the CPI, from 0.86 percent in December of 2000 to 1.38 percent in December of 2015.
           In most respects, the calculation of the price index for prescription drugs follows a
standard procedure used for all goods and services in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). This
paper begins with a very brief outline of the most relevant portions of the process used in the
construction of the CPI before reporting on the specifics of the analysis of drug prices. 7

       Overall CPI Methodology. The CPI is calculated in two stages. The first stage involves
the computation of 8,018 basic indexes for 38 individual urban or metropolitan areas of the
United States and 211 product categories. The weights for the first stage are derived from the
construction of local outlet-based sampling frames by item and area. The weights for the second
stage are derived from biennial updates of the Consumer Expenditure Survey. Prescription Drugs
is one of the 211 product categories (item strata) and is the lowest level at which a published
index is computed; i.e., therapeutic class-specific CPIs are not computed or published by the
BLS.
       Price information is gathered within a larger number of 87 geographical areas called
primary sampling units (PSUs). In addition, the 211 product categories are expanded to 305
entry-level items (ELIs) which are the ultimate sampling units. BLS conducts household point-
of-purchase (POPS) telephone surveys in the PSUs to develop a sample list of outlets within
which specific ELIs will be priced for inclusion in the CPI. The selection of specific items within
an outlet-ELI combination is based on a probability-proportionate-to-sales sampling procedure
using sales of the items within the outlet. Once selected, individual items are repriced on a
monthly or bimonthly basis. Approximately a quarter of the items and outlets within each sample
PSU are rotated out each year. BLS field representatives visit about 26,400 outlets each month
and collect prices on 85,000 items. Items whose prices are most volatile, such as food at home,
energy, and telephone services, are collected on a monthly basis. In addition, all survey items in
New York, Chicago and Los Angeles are priced monthly. All other items in other PSUs are
priced bimonthly, spread equally across even and odd-numbered months.
       The processing of the monthly price data involves the calculation of a price relative for
each of the basic indexes. Prior to 1999, the construction of the price relatives utilized a
Laspeyres index formula (that is a ratio of a weighted arithmetic mean of prices in the current
period to the same average of prices in the prior period, using fixed quantity weights). In 1999,
the calculation of the price relatives for most basic indexes was converted to a geometric mean
formula using fixed expenditure shares as weights, implying that consumers will alter their
purchases to offset a portion of the price increase, albeit only within a narrow item-area category.




                                                  4
           Prescription Drugs. The prescription drug index is a first-stage basic index within the
CPI, and its calculation follows the standard process of first conducting a telephone POP survey
within each PSU to construct a panel of retail pharmacies and their share of consumer
prescription purchases. The sampling frame of potential outlets includes stand-alone pharmacies,
those associated with grocery stores and other retail establishments, and internet-based
pharmacies. 8 Individual outlets rotate out of the sample on a four-year replacement cycle.
Second, a sampling frame is constructed within each outlet, based on the revenue obtained from
the last 20 prescriptions dispensed at the outlet. The probability of a specific drug’s selection is
thus proportionate to its share of total revenues generated by the last 20 prescriptions reflecting
both its relative frequency of being prescribed and its cost per prescription. Typically, 4-6
prescriptions are selected for sampling within each outlet.
           The calculation of the prescription drug price index is similar to that of other components
of the CPI in using geometric weights derived from the initial area surveys. The weight of
prescription drugs in the overall CPI is based on the Consumer Expenditures Survey of
households, and the survey plays a small role in the construction of the basic prescription drug
index through the aggregation across areas. New drugs are introduced into the index as part of
the regular rotation of outlets and the selection of the item-sampling frame for the outlet. No
effort is made to measure the quality-adjusted price of the new drug; thus, its price change in the
introductory month is implicitly equivalent to the average change for other prescription drugs
within the PSU. Effectively, the difference in the price of new and incumbent goods is assumed
to be a measure of the market’s valuation of the quality differences in the goods, and it is linked
out of the index.
           Generics. The CPI, however, does incorporate a special adjustment at the time that a
brand name drug loses it exclusivity and faces new competition with the introduction of new
generic drugs that are frequently offered with deep discounts. 9 A generic drug is
a pharmaceutical drug that is equivalent to a brand-name product in dosage, strength, route of
administration, quality, performance, and intended use. Most commonly, a generic is judged to


8 The CPI includes vaccines and biologics, but it excludes the costs of administering a vaccine. Prescription drugs

that are administered in a hospital setting and billed by the hospital as a component part of a larger service are not
included in the prescription drug index, but are included as part of the price index for hospital services.
9   Exclusivity is distinct from a patent as they are granted under different authorities and may not run concurrently.

                                                             5
be comparable to the branded version if both are based on the same molecule, strength and
formulation.
        The introduction of generics drugs creates a significant problem for the CPI because the
first appearance of a generic would normally be treated as a new good, and under the standard
practice there would be no price change in the introductory month (Griliches and Cockburn,
1994). 10 Yet, nearly all of the change in the price of a molecule occurs with the first appearance
of the generic. The price of the brand often stays the same or actually increases after it loses its
exclusivity--the producer of the branded drug frequently introduces its own generic rather than
reduce the price of the branded version with strong consumer recognition. Hence, were the
standard procedure of the CPI to be applied, nearly all of the price change involved in the
transition to the generic would be linked out in the computation of the index. In addition, there is
a rapid rise in the generic’s penetration of the market that is not captured after its introduction
into the sample.
        Within the prescription drug series of the CPI, the introduction of a new generic quote is
handled by linking the new generic to the old brand with a special code that declares the two
series to be comparable. Hence, in the introductory month, the new generic has a price change
equal to the difference between the prior value of the branded and the new generic.
        The Washington BLS office keeps track of drugs going off patent and sends a message,
roughly six months after patent expiration, to the field agents outlining the procedure to check
for the introduction of a generic. The agents ascertain if a generic has been introduced at the
outlet; and, if so, the shares of generic and branded prescriptions in the prior three months are
used to compute relative weights. The six-month delay is designed to give the newer generics an
opportunity to build market share. The relative weights are used in a proportionate random draw
to give the generic versions a one-time chance for inclusion in future months. The choice
between the new generic and the branded version is done once and remains the same for the
remainder of the life of the quote.

complexity of issues associated with the introduction of a new drug.

           PPI for Prescription Drugs
           The PPI measures the change over time in the prices received by domestic producers of
goods and services. 11 The PPI derives its weighting mostly from the value of shipments as
reported in the Census Bureau’s 5-year economic census. 12 The PPI includes sales to
wholesalers, or directly to retailers, long-term care facilities, hospitals, and other outlets. This
contrasts with the pharmaceutical component of CPI that measures price change from the
perspective of consumers. Pharmaceutical preparations have their own commodity class (0638),
and are disaggregated further into eight therapeutic classes, providing more published detail than
the CPI.
           Following Census classification, the PPI has the manufacturing of active pharmaceutical
ingredients fall under NAICS 325411 Medicinal and Botanical Manufacturing, while the
manufacturing of the final dosage form of small molecules (discussed above) falls under NAICS
325412 Pharmaceutical Preparations Manufacturing. Large molecule biologics such as vaccines,
toxoids, and culture media of plant of animal origin are classified in NAICS 325414 Biological
Product (except Diagnostic) Manufacturing. To the extent that injectable vaccines and biologics
are administered in outpatient clinics and physicians’ offices, but are not dispensed at retail, the
set of transactions captured by the various BLS PPIs and the IQVIA Institute for Human Data
Science data (discussed in further detail below) do not fully overlap, making comparisons
between the BLS PPIs and IQVIA data problematic. Hence, in this research we focus most of
our attention on comparison of the CPI with the IQVIA data.
           Within the PPI, surveyed products are selected with a probability-based sampling frame
of firms that participate in the Unemployment Insurance system. Surveyed firms are asked to
report actual transaction prices largely on a monthly basis by internet or mail. The price indexes
are computed with a Laspeyres formula. Individual reporting firms’ revenues are used to weight




11 Importantly, the PPI excludes pharmaceuticals produced in Puerto Rico from its definition of domestic production
despite the island’s role as a primary production location of U.S. drug companies. The value added of
pharmaceuticals in Puerto Rico is equal to about 17 percent of the domestic production. Unfortunately, Puerto Rico
is also excluded from the Import Indexes where it is treated as part of the United States. Pharmaceuticals
manufactured and exported from Puerto Rico are included in the International Price Program (IPP) index for
exports.
12   The latest available economic census data is for 2012.

                                                              7
the indexes at the lowest level. At the aggregate level, the indexes are combined using the
product-line data of the economic censuses.
           The procedures for pharmaceuticals deviate from this standard procedure by
incorporating an annual update of the commodity sample based on information in the Food and
Drug Agency’s (FDA) Orange Book. For those new drugs that are judged to be therapeutically
equivalent to an existing drug, the weight of preexisting drug is split between the old and new
version based on relative sales revenue. The new generic is linked into the price index in a
fashion that includes any price difference between a branded drug and its generic equivalent. 13
Hence, the PPI incorporates the price change between a branded drug and the first generic in a
procedure with a similar outcome to that of the CPI.




IQVIA Data
           The IQVIA National Prescription Audit data base tracks prescriptions dispensed at a
nationally representative sample of retail, mail order and long-term care pharmacies and is
projected to an estimate of total national prescriptions dispensed through these pharmacies on a
monthly basis. We limit our analysis to prescriptions dispensed at retail pharmacies, and focus
on the 250 most prescribed molecules (measured by number of prescriptions dispensed during
May 2013). Individual records represent national totals and distinguish the month, the national
drug code (NDC), age group of the patient, and payment type. The distribution by payment type
differentiates among Medicaid, Medicare, commercial or other third party payer, and cash. Age
refers to the age of the patient to whom the prescription was dispensed, and only identifies those
patients as over or under age 65 for about 80 percent of the sample. The data cover the period
from March of 2009 to October 2013. . In subsequent analysis, we refer to the data file as IQVIA
data. It includes about 7.5 million records and provides a more complete coverage of retail drug
transactions than the CPI file. The prescription price is computed as revenue divided by the
quantity for each record.
           These IQVIA data reflect the perspective of the retail pharmacy, and prices measured at
this point in the distribution chain correspond closely to the retail prices that the U.S. Bureau of


13   The methodology is discussed in Bureau of Labor Statistics (2011), and Kelly (1997).

                                                           8
Labor Statistics attempts to measure in constructing its monthly CPI Index for Prescription
Drugs. The total revenue received by the dispensing pharmacies is the sum of the customer’s
copayment or coinsurance contribution and the amount (if any) reimbursed to the dispensing
pharmacy by the third party payers – Medicare Part D insurer, Medicaid, or commercial or other
third party payer. This pharmacy price therefore includes reimbursement for the final dosage
form of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, a dispensing fee, and any customer copayment or
coinsurance contribution. If the customer presents the pharmacy with a coupon, the value of that
coupon is attributed to the patient copayment or coinsurance contribution; how well the IQVIA is
able to capture coupon transactions is not publicly known. For our purposes, however, it is
important to note that this pharmacy price already includes margins realized by wholesalers,
pharmacies and any other distributors, and is therefore generally larger than the price (net of
rebates and discounts) received by the brand and generic manufacturers. These rebates and
discounts can be substantial, in some cases larger than the amount that consumers actually pay.


Data Analysis
       The BLS maintains a data archive of the individual monthly quotes of the CPI. We have
extracted data for all of the prescription drug quotes of the CPI covering the months of 2009:3-
2013:10, a period that aligns with that of the data file provided by IQVIA. The CPI file is quite
large, averaging about 952 price quotes per month, and it includes a monthly average of 245
distinct molecules (overall, there are about 420 molecules, but less in a specific month). In some
earlier work, BLS researchers found a match of about 85% of the CPI file with the top 250
molecules by total prescriptions (TRX) as supplied by IQVIA. We also have a considerable
number of characteristics for each price quote, but for our current purposes we can focus on a
few. The BLS staff did some work to clean up the recorded NDCs in a match to the official
codes of the FDA, but the NDC is not integral to the CPI index work. Instead, three key
measures of the outlet code id, quote number, and the version number, are sufficient to identify
each of our quote series in a given month. Changes in any of these three characteristics normally
reflects termination of the old quote series and introduction of a new series. Quotes are collected
on either a monthly or a bimonthly basis. The file appears to be quite clean with respect to the
price quote and the key identifiers in the sense that recorded values seem very consistent from



                                                 9
month to month. Other characteristics are recorded in a more variable fashion that would require
some editing to make them reliable.
        The CPI data file also contains information from the National Drug Code Directory on
the 2-digit code used to group drugs into 20 major therapeutic classes. We use those categories to
provide some disaggregation of the data, computing separate price indexes for each class. The
class names and the distribution of IQVIA revenues and CPI quotes by class are shown in Table
1. A total of more than 250 molecules is reported because different NDC’s with the same
molecule designation may be assigned to different classes if they may have different primary
treatment applications. The distribution of the IQVIA data across the CDC classes by reported
cash revenue is shown in column 5 and the distribution of CPI price quotes is shown in column
6. The distribution across the therapeutic classes is very similar between the CPI and IQVIA
files, suggesting a high degree of similarity in the structures of the two data sets. The correlation
coefficient between the two distributions is 0.93. Column 7 displays the distribution of CPI
quotes when the sample is restricted to those NDCs that appear in both the CPI and IQVIA files.
        A differing dimension of the CPI and IQVIA files is highlighted by noting that the
IQVIA file contains 43,493 unique NDCs. Many of these codes represent the same basic
product, but differ due to variation in strength and size of the prescription. The CPI file in
contrast contains only 2,434 unique NDCs, and we are able to match 1,582 (65%) of those
entries with NDCs in the IQVIA file. It is possible that some of the CPI products are not present
in the IQVIA because the latter is limited to the top 250 molecules, but we expect a significant
portion fail to match because the entry of the NDC in the CPI file is incorrect. 14


Aggregate Indexes
        As an initial point of comparison, the published CPI, PPI, and constructed measures from
the IQVIA data file are shown in Figure 1 for the period of 2009:3 to 2013:10. All the CPI
indexes are computed with a BLS program, the research database calculator, which duplicates
the methodology of the official indexes, but with different sample inputs. The IQVIA indexes are
computed as monthly chain-linked Laspeyres indexes. The price measures of the IQVIA data are
computed values based on the ratio of national sales for each data record divided by the number

14The NDC is recorded in the CPI file as a text value and some values contain alphabetic characters, which are not
part of the NDC system. We tried to correct for those obvious errors in the recorded NDC codes.

                                                        10
of prescriptions. With access to monthly sales data, the IQVIA indexes incorporate a more
current weighting structure than that of the CPI indexes for which the estimated weights change
with the rotation of the sample.
       Several alternative indexes are constructed from the IQVIA data file: (1) using all of the
available data series, (2) an index restricted to those NDCs that are present in the CPI file, and
(3) an index that further restricts the IQVIA data to NDCs that are present in the CPI and to cash
transactions. We expect the third version of the IQVIA price index to be closest to the matched
version of the CPI.
       We also adjusted the IQVIA data for the introduction of generics in a fashion similar to
that used in the CPI. IQVIA supplied us with a data file that identified branded and generic
prescription drugs by their NDCs, and their date of introduction. In addition, the file provided a
unique code for the combined molecule of each drug and an indication of whether an original
brand drug had been used as the reference listed drug (RLD) for a generic in the FDA Orange
Book. Thus, by grouping drugs with common combined molecules, we could identify a probable
parent RLD for each generic. We identified the introduction of 44 generics in the five years
covered by the IQVIA file when the potential NDCs were limited to drugs that were part of the
CPI file, and we replaced the price of the generic in its first month with the price of the
corresponding branded drug. Thus, the implied price change associated with the shift from the
brand to the generic was measured by the price change between the first and second month of the
generic’s introduction.
       The top panel of Figure 1 displays the published indexes of the CPI, PPI, and the third
definition of the index from IQVIA. In addition, we report a matched CPI-based index that is
restricted to those NDCs that are in both the CPI and IQVIA data files. The CPI shows the
slowest rate of increase (an annual average of 3.1%), the PPI rises at an intermediate rate (5.1%
per year), and the IQVIA measure increases the fastest (7.1 % per year).
       The alternative indexes constructed from the IQVIA data set are shown in the lower
panel. The use of all the data in the file actually produces the lowest rate of change, with a
pronounced large decline (4.5%) in October of 2012, but that can be traced to one drug that has a




                                                 11
large weight and is not included in the CPI. 15 However, the two indexes that are restricted to
NDCs in the CPI, but differ in the additional limitation to cash transactions, have very similar
rates of change (annual average increases of 7.6 % and 7.1%). This latter result is surprising in
light of the concern that the coverage of the CPI is declining over time as a growing portion of
prescription drugs are paid through payment plans. In the IQVIA data file two-thirds of the
series by revenue are present in the CPI but cash transactions account for only 4.6 percent of the
revenue in the broad measure and a slightly lower 4.2 share for the data set that is restricted to
NDCs that are included in the CPI file. However, both series show parallel patterns of decline in
the cash share (Figure 2). In addition, the share of transactions that are paid in cash has a
pronounced spike in the IQVIA data at the beginning of each year that is probably due to a
growing reliance on high-deductible insurance plans, whereby consumers pay a cash price until
they reach a deductible threshold and third party insurance kicks in.
        We constructed a final alternative price index for the IQVIA file that incorporated a
Törnqvist weighting scheme using an average of the expenditure shares of the current and prior
month. The index incorporates substitution effects that occur within the monthly interval. It was
applied to the version of the IQVIA data limited to cash transactions. Because the Laspeyres
index is already computed on a monthly basis with weights from the prior month, the Törnqvist
weighting may not have an effect, but it is a more up-to-date representation of the weights.
Surprisingly, the Törnqvist index rose slightly more rapidly than the Laspeyres version.


Disaggregated Price Indexes
        We can explore the differences between the IQVIA and CPI datasets in greater detail by
constructing indexes for each of the CDC drug classes shown in Table 1. Some of the drug
classes have very few entries. Hence, we introduced an additional requirement that the sub-class
of the CPI sample include a minimum of one percent of the quotes in the total CPI. That yields
12 sub-classes for which we constructed various alternative price indexes. The 12 categories are
identified with an asterisk in column 1 of Table 1. The various panels of Figure 3 display those
comparisons. The solid line represents the index from the CPI file that is restricted to those


15  We can trace that sharp change to a fall in the price of Asmanex Ttwisthaler, a single drug, but with seven NDCs.
It is not surveyed in the CPI. We do not know the reason for the change, but it does not appear to have had a change
in patent status.

                                                         12
NDCs that are common to the CPI and the IQVIA samples. Two alternatives are drawn from the
IQVIA data file and correspond first to NDCs that matched with those in the CPI ( CPI NDCs,
CPI CDCs), and a second set of indexes based on further limiting the index to cash sales ( CPI
NDCs, CPI CDCs, Cash).
        Over the full five-year period, the discrepancy between the CPI-based indexes and the
cash-based series from IQVIA cumulates to an average of 10 percent in the last month (October,
2013) of the sample, but the differences are very large for 05-Cardiovascular-renal (59%) and
12-Skin/Mucous Membranes (37%). If those two classes are excluded, the average discrepancy
falls to 3 percent. The cardiovascular-renal class was among the largest at 17 percent of total
revenue, whereas skin/mucous membranes was the smallest.
        Second, as with the aggregate index, the disaggregated categories tend to have a larger
degree of price increase in the IQVIA data file than in that of the CPI. The increase in the IQVIA
indexes exceeds that of the CPI in eight of the 12 categories where we judged the sample to be of
sufficient size to yield reliable results.
        The third striking feature of the data is the close correspondence between the IQVIA
price index for all drug transactions in the class and those that are limited to cash. While that
pattern was evident in the aggregate indexes, it continues to hold to a surprising extent in the
disaggregated indexes. As a result, the restriction to cash sales has less influence on the indexes
that we anticipated.


Conclusion
        In this paper, we have used a large alternative data set obtained from IQVIA. to construct
a benchmark comparison of the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ CPI for prescription drugs. We use a
methodology close to that of the CPI over a 5-year period and compare the indexes from the two
sources. We find that the IQVIA data indicate a more rapid rate of price increase than reported in
the CPI for the aggregate of all prescription drugs. In an effort to identify the sources of the
difference, we disaggregated the data into 20 therapeutic classes and found that the CPI and
IQVIA data sets contain very similar distributions of drugs as measured by the volume of price
quotes (CPI) and revenues (IQVIA). We computed price indexes for 12 drug classes for which
the samples appeared to be large enough to yield meaningful results. Two of those classes,
cardiovascular-renal and skin/mucous membranes were the dominant sources of the

                                                  13
discrepancies, but we could detect no obvious reason for the differences. Furthermore, the
increases in the IQVIA indexes exceeded those of the CPI in eight of the twelve classes.
        We constructed several additional price indexes to explore further the influence of
alternative selection criteria. Inclusion of all payment transactions in the IQVIA file, and not just
the cash transactions available to the CPI, had a relatively minor effect. Finally, we experimented
with a Törnqvist version of the monthly-chained index for the IQVIA data sample. The result
tended to widen the gap between the IQVIA and CPI data sets.
       We are left with some puzzlement about explanations for the differences between the
indexes constructed from IQVIA and CPI data sets because the IQVIA-based indexes show a
general pattern of larger price increases. In some respects, the methodologies used to construct
the two data files are quite different. The weighting of specific drugs in the CPI is the result of a
series of probabilities that a specific retail outlet within a region will be included in the sample
together with a probability-based selection among its most commonly dispensed drugs. In
contrast, the IQVIA measures reflect a more direct construction of the price indexes from the
basic national sample of prescription drug transactions. However, it is not evident that the
differences in the construction of the two data sets would explain the observed differences in
price index trends.

Note: Panel A displays the published price indexes of the CPI and PPI for pharmaceuticals, an index
constructed from the IQVIA file that restricts the index to NDCs that are included in the CPI and
represent cash transactions, and a CPI-based index that is limited to those quotes whose NDCs matched
with the IQVIA data file. Panel B shows the CPI and four alternative index from the IQVIA file that
include all NDCs, NDCs that are included in the CPI file, those included in the CPI and restricted to cash
transactions, and a Törnqvist version of the cash index.
