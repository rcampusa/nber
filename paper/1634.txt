                Small Countries in Monetary Unions:
                         A Two—Tier Model



                              ABSTRACT




      In a previous analysis of the West African Monetary Union, Macedo

 (1985a), size is taken to be a major structural characteristic of a

country in the sense that large countries are not affected by disturbances

   originating in small countries but small countries are affected by

large countries' domestic disturbances. In this paper, we generalize

some of the results and present the structure of the model in more

detail.

     Using a four-country, two-tier macroeconomic model, it is shown that

the pseudo-exchange rate union of the two small countries with the large

partner has no effect on their real exchange rates but affects their

price levels, whereas a full monetary union requires in principle a

transfer from the large partner in the anion. The allocation of this

transfer between the two small countries by their common central bank

will have real effects when the allocation rule differs from the

steady-state monetary distribution.

I.   Introduction



     In connection with the celebrated controversy about the relative

desirability of fixed and flexible exchange rates, a considerable analyt-

ic literature on monetary unions has emerged. It was surveyed ten years

ago by Tower and Willet (1976). Since then, there have been contribu-

tions by Allen and Kenen (1980), Aoki (1983a and b), Marston (1984a and

1985), Melitz (1984), Huizinga (1984) and others.

     According to this literature, the key factors on which the impact of

a union depends are, first, the sources and types of economic disturbanc-

es giving rise to exchange rate fluctuations, second, the trade patterns

of the country joining the union, and, third, wage and price behavior at

home and abroad. The conditions under which a fixed exchange rate regime

is superior to floating according to some social welfare criterion

usually involve a complicated weighting of these key factors, making

generalizations difficult.

     The relative size of the partners is generally reflected in the

source and types of disturbances as well as in the trade pattern. In our

analysis of the West African Monetary Union, Macedo (1985a), though, size

is the major structural characteristic of a country. Specifically, large

countries are not affected by disturbances originating in small countries

but small countries are affected by large countries's domestic distur-

bances. In this paper, we generalize some of the results and present the

structure of the model in more detail.

     It relies on standard aggregate demand and aggregate supply rela-

tionships, with trade and capital movements linking national economies.

Account is taken of the unequal size of the potential partners by
                                    -4-


modelling   two pairs of identical economies, large and small. These are

two identical large economies whose bilateral exchange rate floats freely

and two identical small economies who decide on whether they will float

or fix their exchange rate with one of the large countries. In so doing,

they also allow the union-wide central bank to decide on monetary

allocations.

     Due to the difference in size between the partners in the union,

only the distribution of money between the two small countries is

endogenously determined. Even there, it can be modified by the alloca-

tion of a monetary transfer from the large partner. In the terminology

of Corden (1972), there is a pseudo-exchange rate union between one of

the large countries and the small countries but full monetary integration

between the two small countries.

     Each national economy is highly stylized, and the focus of the model

is on the interaction of the members of the monetary union, two small

countries labelled country one and country two, who take as given the

member of the pseudo-exchange rate union, labelled country star and the

country outside the union, labelled country double-star. The model is

recursive because the small-country tier is irrelevant to the

large-country tier. The results can therefore be extended to three or

more tiers.

     The national economies are described by conventional aggregate

relationships. Demand for domestic output (the IS curve) is a function

of foreign outputs, relative prices or the real exchange rate, and the

real interest rate and it can also be changed by an exogenous demand

disturbance. Demand for real balances (the LN curve) is a function of

domestic output and the nominal interest rate, as a measure of the return
                                    -5-


differential.   By eliminating the nominal interest rate, we obtain an

aggregate demand curve which relates domestic output to the real exchange

rate, to foreign output and to the exogenous demand and monetary distur-

bances. A real depreciation increases the demand for domestic output

along conventional foreign trade multiplier lines.

     The supply of domestic output is derived from labor market equilib-

rium, where the supply of labor by workers responds to the wage deflated

by a consumer price index and the demand for labor by firms responds to

the wage deflated by price of the domestic good. Eliminating the nominal

wage, we obtain an aggregate supply curve relating domestic output to the

real exchange rate and an exogenous supply disturbance, which can be

interpreted as an increase in productivity. A real depreciation lowers

the supply of domestic output because it raises the product wage. Prices

change as a proportion of the difference between demand for and supply of

domestic output, so that a Phillips curve allowing for real wage rigidity

is featured.

     The model is closed by the assumption that domestic and foreign

assets are perfect substitutes, so that interest rates are equalized in

the steady-state. This determines recursively the real exchange rate and

the price of domestic output, in terms of the exogenous real and monetary

disturbances respectively. Then, under flexible exchange rates, the

nominal exchange rate is given by monetary disturbances, whereas, under

fixed rates, the nominal money stock is determined endogenously.

    Size does not affect the interest-rate elasticities of money demand

and aggregate demand, which are common to all four countries, and the

other parameters are identical between the pairs of large and small

countries. These assumptions are not essential for the results, but an
                                    -6-




 analytical- solution does require some symmetry between economic

 structures.

      The model is used to assess the effect of fixing the bilateral

 exchange rates of the two small countries with one of the large coun-

 tries. Under price flexibility, the exchange rate regime has no effect

on the real exchange rate, since the effect on the nominal exchange rate

and the price level offset each other. Nevertheless, a monetary union

between one of the large countries and the two small countries may

require a transfer from the large partner, which offsets internal and

external disturbances. To that extent, the union allows the small

countries' central bank to enforce an asymmetric monetary allocation

rule. Then prices will not be adjusted to the nominal exchange rate and

the real exchange rate will also have to change as a consequence of the

price rigidity.

      We write here the model with variables expressed as logarithmic

deviations from the stationary state, leaving the derivation and inter-

pretation of the parameters to Appendix 1. We also set to zero the rate

of change in prices and exchange rates. This can be interpreted as the

stationary state of a model with perfect foresight on these variables.

The dynamic version of the model is solved in Appendix 2, where its

stability is also discussed. Finally, we present the large country tier

in terms of average sums and differences of variables and exogenous

disturbances, as done by Aoki (1981). The more conventional presentation

can also be seen in Appendix 2. Thus, a variable x., j = 1, 2 will be

expressed as


(1)     =         -
            (x1       x2)/2
                                                    —7—




 (2)    xS    (     +
                        x2)/2

        It is obvious that:


 (3) x1xs +xd

 (4) x2=xs -x d

 II. Flexible Exchange Rates


        The log-linear model consists of the equations listed in Table 1.

The variables and parameters are defined in Table 2. We solve the large

country tier first.

        Equations (5)-(1O) in Table 1 show that monetary disturbances have

no effect on the real exchange rate, whereas they have one-to-one effects

on the price level, as can be seen from equation (11). Indeed, the real

exchange rate is given by a composite real disturbance which involves the

difference between relative demand and supply shocks in the two large

countries. The supply disturbance enters with a multiplier effect, given

by V:


(16)         0* =   _i [* - (1        +   v)   *ud]


where        Na+k(1+v)
       While relative real disturbances are channeled through the real

exchange rate, global real disturbances are channeled through the real (

nominal) interest rates, which are equal in both countries in the sta-
tionary state:


(17)         i* =   ** =        [*u   -
                                          (1   -

        Note the dampened effect of a global supply disturbance on the

interest rate, in contrast with the magnified effect of a relative supply

disturbance on the real exchange rate. A positive supply shock in the

starred country raises output and therefore requires a depreciated real

exchange rate and (if v <      1) a lower interest rate to raise domestic and
foreign demand for the starred country's output. A proportional increase

in the relative demand for and supply of output in both countries (suA =

*ud) still depreciates the real exchange rate by v/N but now raises the

interest rate by v/b.

        Given (16), we obtain y* and y** from (8) and (9). Given (17) and

real outputs, we get their price from (11). Finally, we obtain the

nominal exchange rate from the definition of the real exchange rate and

the solution for the prices of domestic output. It is useful to write

those in terms of composite disturbances:


(18)         11±1+i*..*s
where
            du          a
                     'u +*ud



       Note that y* =      + *u5 and y**     ..1 +   u5,   so that we get the LN

curve immediately. Also, the effect of a global supply shock is magni-

fied on the price level because, aside from the interest rate effect,

given by (1 -    v)c/b,   there is a distinct one-to-one effect. In (18) this

effect is made up of a global part (*u) and a relative part (*u). The

latter is included in the composite relative real disturbance 1i, which

enters negatively for p* and positively for p**. If the multiplier term

included in N were zero, this would become a weighted average of demand

and supply disturbances. The demand disturbance is weighted by the

supply elasticity (ku/N) and the supply disturbance is weighted by the
                                      -11-




demand elásticity (a/N). Therefore if output is demand-determined (k =

0) and there are no supply shocks (u =       0),   this composite disturbance

vanishes. If, in addition, there are no global shocks (*u =              0),    the

interest rate effect also vanishes and prices are proportional to mone-

tary expansion. Of course, the interest rate effect always cancels in

the expression for relative prices:


(19)        p*p**=2*u1_2
        Let us now consider the effect of the disturbances in turn. Mone-

tary disturbances have no effect on the real exchange rate and offsetting

one-to-one effects on the nominal exchange rate and on the own price

level as can be seen from (18). Negativelycorrelated real disturbances

(such that *u =     u* and *u = 0,   i = A, it) leave interest rates unchanged

(i* =       = 0).   The effect on the price level is given by the first term

in (18). For example, relative demand expansion in country star appreci-

ates the real exchange rate by 1/N, raises the home price level by ku/N,

lowers the foreign price level by the same amount and leads to a nominal

appreciation of 2k/N. Unless the supply elasticity is very small,

therefore, there will be a magnification of the effect on the real

exchange rate. Note that when k =
                                       u = 0,   j =   *,    the price level is

independent of real disturbances, and the real money stock u - p3 is

fixed.

       Positively correlated real disturbances (such that *u =           u'    and

= 0, i = A, it, m) leave exchange rates unchanged (0* =      e   = 0).        The

effect on the price level is given by the second term in (18). The

effect of a demand shock differs from the effect of a supply shock by a

factor of 1 - V + b/c.
                                        -12-


        Comirig to the small countries' model, the interest rate is still

given by (17) but the real exchange rate now reflects two factors in

addition to the relative real disturbances featured in (16) for the real

exchange rate of the two large countries. These are the choice of the

numeraire and the nature of the trade patterns between the domestic

economy and the two large countries. We write the solution as:



(20)




and          u' =   u.   -   *u                   i =   A,

        The first term measures the relative sensitivity of the domestic

economy.to the two large countries in terms of the demand elasticities

(a* and a**) and the share of foreign goods in the consumer price index

(a and a). We will return to it below. The second terni (in square

brackets) captures the effect of trade patterns. If the trade multipli-

ers with the two large countries are the same (v*            v**), relative real

disturbances there have no effect. Global supply disturbances in the two

large countries still have an effect, however, as long as the small

country trade multiplier (2v*) differs from the large countries trade

multiplier (v). Thus, If v/2 >    v*,    a favorable supply disturbance in the

large countries will lead to a real depreciation in the small countries

and conversely. When trade patterns are strongly symmetric (v/2            v* =

v**),   this term drops out. The effect of relative real disturbances

featured in (16) above is captured by the third term in (20), where the

cyclical position of the domestic economy is measured relative to the
                                                  -13-




world average. For example, if domestic demand increases by more (UA >

         the real exchange rate depreciates.

        The real effective exchange rate of the small country can be defined

as a weighted average using the shares in the consumer price index as

weights:


(21)                    (e*+p*p)+(1 -) (e**+p**_p)
                  =   0 -        0*

where      =
               a/(1 -       a)

        Using (21) in (20) we get



(22)           Eo.![A*o*+uvd+d)
where          A* =   (a*a.      -
                                      a**a*)J(l   -
                                                      ci)


       Note that the choice of the nuineraire continues to play a role

unless the trade elasticities are proportional to the weights in the

consumer price index, i.e. unless =                         or   =   0.   This case, emphasized

by Marston (1984a) in the context of his model, may be called the case of

"balanced sensitivities". It is a useful benchmark, but (22) shows

clearly that the real exchange rate between the two large countries will

have a positive effect on the small countries' real effective exchange

rate is trade with the partner country is relatively more sensitive than

reflected on the share of partner countries' goods in the consumer price

index. Conversely, if the share is large relative to the trade elastici-

ties, a real depreciation of the starred countries' currency will imply a

real appreciation of the small country's currency.
                                     -14-




        Another way to look at this effect is in terms of "optimal weights".

Then (20) shows that the weighted sum of demand and supply elasticities

with each trading partner, , should be used to offset the effect of the

choice of the numeraire. With these weights, and in the absence of

asymmetries between the two partners (U" =     0),   the real effective

exchange rate is solely a function of the cyclical position of the small

country relative to the rest of the world.

        The price of domestic output is again obtained from the supply

equation, (10) in Table 1, and money-market equilibrium, equation (11) in

Table 1. Leaving the separate effect of the interest rate as given from

(17) above and using (20), we get:



(23)



where       x   = h(1   -
                            a)/H

                d      d
and         U XuA+(l-X)u
       The weighted average of domestic demand and supply disturbances

(relative to foreign global disturbances), denoted by I,            is   now a proper

one since, for the small open economy, we neglect the multiplier effect

with repercussion present in 1i.    In   fact, when A* = 0 and U" =        0,   we get

an expression for y of the same form as above, y =      11d   +   *u5,   except for

the role of foreign global disturbances.

       Using (18), the difference between the domestic price and the price

in the double starred country can be written as:



(24)        p_p
                                             —15—




        Addirig (20)   and (24), we obtain the nominal exchange rate with the

numeraire. Using triangular arbitrage, we obtain the exchange rate with

the starred country. These can be written respectively as:



(25)         e**u_u**+O +(A*6*÷Uv)_1jud

(26)         e*u_u_ (1 _)O*+(A*O*÷uv)÷1_ud
where                         1



              d
and          U


        Note that the direction of the effect of supply shocks depends on

demand elasticities. If a* +           a**   <   1, then   > 1   and the effect will be

negative on the composite disturbance ud.

        As mentioned, when sensitivities are balanced (A* =            0),   the real

effective exchange rate of the domestic country is given by a c-weighted

average. The same is of course true for the nominal effective exchange

rate. In general, using (19), we can write the nominal effective ex-

change rate and the effective relative price ratio respectively as:



(27)        E*+(A.Ok+UV) - (l_2)1_Ud
(28)
            Ep=um_*u+X(A*O*+UV)_(1_2)_1d

where             =    u*   + (1 -   ) u**
       When trade patterns are strongly symmetric, U" = 0 and A*                0 and in

addition     =        the expressions simplify considerably. In particular,
        U5 and the effective exchange rate in (27) becomes:
                                           -16-




(29)            = ud -


where        ud u -          as before.


        To sum up the results of the three-country model under flexible

exchange rates, we see that, with complete syimnetry, disturbances enter

as differences between the domestic and average foreign value, which we

have denoted as u, i = A,       it,   m.   This is due to the neglect of foreign

repercussions for the small open economy. Monetary disturbances have

one-to-one effects on nominal variables and zero effects on real vari-

ables. Real disturbances have less than one-to-one effects on the price

level (the smaller the lower the supply elasticity relative to the demand

elasticity, as captured by x) but the effect on the real exchange rate

depends on the size of both, as captured by H. The effect of demand

disturbances on the nominal exchange rate will be more than one-to-one if

elasticities are low (,      > 1),    in which case a favorable supply shock will

involve a depreciation.


III. Two-tier Monetary Unions


1.     A two-countiy union


        If the domestic economy enters into an exchange-rate union with the

starred country so that e* = 0 (taking an initial value of unity), then

e** =   e.   In this case, the foreign model determines the exchange rate

and the prices of foreign outputs but the domestic money stock adjusts to

keep real money balances at the level required by domestic and foreign

real disturbances.

       The irrelevance of the exchange rate union for real variables

reflects the classical dichotomy between the real and monetary sides of
                                     -17-




the economy. Either a small country lets the exchange rate float and

determines its money stock or it fixes the exchange rate, and the money

stock becomes endogenous. We can thus write:



(30)'       e_e**=_p=m_u
where         is the price level under the union

and         m is the (endogenous) money stock under the union.

       According to (30), if the fixed exchange rate e is lower than the

one prevailing before the agreement, the money stock and the price of

domestic output will fall by the same amount (relative to their previous

values) under flexible exchange rates. The fall in the money stock is

brought about by a capital outflow which would increase in magnitude if

the government attempted to increase the supply of domestic assets to the

public. As long as real output does not change, the real money stock

remains fixed and the fall in money balances is transmited to prices.

Only by increasing demand for real output could the government enforce a

different nominal income. Alternatively, as we will see, the loss in

reserves could be offset by a transfer from abroad.

       To obtain the small country's money stock under the union, set the

left-hand-side of (26) equal to zero and solve for m:


(31)        mu*+ (1- C)O*_ (A*e*+U") _1i+ud

       Substituting for 0* so as to show the nominal exchange rate, we get:


(32)       m =      + (1 -   )e - (A*0*   +   U") + (1   -
                                                             2)   ÷
                                                -18-




        This is nothing but the definition of the nominal effective exchange

rate in (27) solved for the money stock. In fact, we can write the

simplified equilibrium condition in (29) in this regime as:


(33)
               s E".'
             m="u+  e+Ud
where        E = (1      -
                                 C)e, the effective exchange rate under the union.


        The two countries which have formed the exchange-rate union have to

agree on how to defend their common parity with the double-starred

country. The union-wide money stock is still exogenous and, together

with the money stock of the double-starred country, it determines the

flexible exchange rate between the two large countries. Any exogenous

increase in the union-wide money stock is endogenously allocated between

the two partners on the basis of their steady-state shares:


(34)            +   (1       -
                                 q*)m* =   t*
where       t* is an exogenous increase in the union-wide money stock

and         rj* is the share of the small country's money stock.



       The domestic economy being small relative to its partner means we

can make q* =   0, so that the money stock of the starred country is still
                         =
exogenous, m*
                                 U.
2.     A monetary union of two small countries


       Suppose now that there are two, rather than one, small countries

which peg their exchange rates to one of the large countries and pooi
                                                  —19—



their res&rves together. We assume that the total money stock of these

two countries --       which we now refer to as the union-wide money stock --
is    small relative to the money stock of the large country. Since the two

small countries are of similar size, however, we need to track the money

between them. In that case, the mechanisms of monetary allocation within

the exchange rate union may have real effects in the two small countries.

        We still neglect the trade multiplier as well as the role of rela-

tive prices in determining the pattern of trade between the two small

countries. Links are exclusively monetary.

        Like (34), a monetary union between the two small countries involves

an allocation of their money stocks. Unlike then, though, the two

countries are of similar size and both money stocks are endogenous:


(35)
             rni1+(1-q)m2=t

where        t is an exogenous increase in the union-wide money stock.

and          fl is the share of country one's money stock.


        Since the two small countries fix their bilateral exchange rate, we

can equate their effective exchange rates so that, making Ee = Ee        in

(28):


(36)        m1 =   t+    (1   -
                                  q)(U1     -
                                                U2)


(37)        m2
                   t -   (U1      -   U2)


(38) Et*
where U3u+(l-)u                                              j1,2
                   =          + (1    -   )*
                                    -20-



and         U' = q U1 + (1 - q)U2


       Given the unchanged real exchange rates, equations (36) through (38)

are the solution of the exchange-rate union between two small countries.

If t     0, the money stocks are unchanged when demand and supply distur-

bances are perfectly correlated (U1 =   U2).   In that case, from (38), the

effective exchange rate appreciates by U = U1.

       Clearly, when the two countries are identical in steady state and q

=      we can express the solutions in terms of differences and sums of the

relative domestic disturbances. In particular U = (U      + U   )/2, so that

U - *U5    is simply a -weighted average of the difference in global

disturbances in small and large countries.


3. A three-country exchange-rate union


       The effect of fixing the exchange rate with country star can now be

seen from (38). In that case, the effective exchange rate is fixed by

the monetary arrangement and some other variable has to adjust. Solving

(38) for the required increase in the small-countries union money stock,

denoted by , we get:


(39)



              =Ufl_*U+(l_)e*_i+u


       The first equation in (39) shows the nominal effective exchange rate
                                                   -21-




under the union, whereas the second substitutes for the floating exchange

rate to express the determinants of the required transfer by the large

partner.

        The difference in small countries composite global disturbances IJJ

(weighted by q) and the large countries is captured by the first two

terms in (39). For example, the effect of demand expansion is positive

                                         -
and given by {[q u + (1                      q) u} -   (u + ur)/2}.   The supply effect

hinges again on whether                      1. The next two terms capture relative real

disturbances in the large countries. The effect of relative demand

expansion in the partner (*u > 0) is negative and given by (1 -                    +

k)/N whereas    the supply effect is ambiguous. It will also be negative

if a > (1 +   v)(1   -
                          ),    that is if the trade is biased toward the partner

country ( = 1).          The last term captures monetary expansion in the

partner country and it has the one-to-one positive effect expected from

(31). Even if all foreign variables are at their stationary-state

values, the required transfer will be positive if there is fiscal expan-

sion in either one of the small countries. Conversely, any transfer in

these conditions will require fiscal expansion iI given by:


(40)             + (1 -        ri)           =


where       u = 0,   j = 1,          2



and         all foreign variables are zero.


       In (40), it is assumed that the transfer has no negative effect on

the money stock of country star because of the size difference (rp = 0).

       Therefore, as long as the distribution of money among the small

partners is done according to (35), there is no induced change in real
                                        -22-




variables. The situation changes with the establishment of a common

central bank or in the presence of a nominal rigidity.

        Taking the latter point first, if the price of domestic output is

fixed, changes in the real exchange rate are transmitted to the nominal

exchange rate, which must be flexible. When both the nominal exchange

rate and the price of domestic output are fixed, then, the government

must use fiscal policy to offset the effects of real disturbances. In

particular, if the domestic country pegs its exchange rate and prices do

not adjust, the real exchange rate will have to change accordingly. The

monetary union has a real effect due to the combination of the price

rigidity and the change in monetary regime. If, at a price given by p

the real exchange rate is 0 and the price does not change after joining

the union, the difference in real exchange rates equals the difference in

nominal rates, so that, from (30), dropping j subscripts, we get:


(41)
             oT_o=_pT
        The difference between the price prevailing in the neutral situation

and the rigid situation can be decomposed further into the difference in

real outputs and in money stocks. The latter, in turn, can derive from

an increase in the foreign money stock. Assuming that 8 = 0 under the

"neutral" union (i.e. UA =        =   0),
                             u,             we get:


(42)
            PPT=m-Y+YT
                 iT -
                -—u
                 HA -um
where            mT is given by (33) with             =   and *u5
                                                                    Urn
                                    -23-


       A demnd expansion u, perhaps in the form of fiscal expansion,

appreciates the real exchange rate by 1/H, whereas a monetary transfer

from abroad has a one-to-one effect.

       When account is taken of the induced real appreciation, the demand

expansion increases output by x <   1.   Given monetary policy, this expan-

sion would reduce prices by the same amount it expands output, so that

the nominal appreciation would be given by x      1/H =   . Ruling   out the

exchange rate change and the fall in prices requires an increase in the

money stock by the same factor , which will be less than one if the

trade elasticities are high enough. The real appreciation is accompanied

by a rise in prices in the amount 1/H. To keep the nominal exchange rate

constant, demand expansion must therefore be consistent with the increase

in the money stock or UA =          Of the equivalent rise in nominal

income, a proportion xI goes to real output expansion and the remainder

(1 -        goes to the rise in prices and fall in the real exchange rate.

       In sum, the effects of a fixed exchange rate regime are confined to

nominal variables unless there is a price rigidity, an induced demand for

domestic output, as a consequence of fiscal expansion, or a transfer from

abroad. The latter possibility becomes quite relevant when there is a

common central bank for involving the two small countries.

4. A monetary allocation rule


       Consider now that the required transfer is allocated by the union's

central bank based on an administrative rule given by:



(43)
                                               -24-


where       is the money stock of country one under the ui-rule.

        Under this rule, the money stock of country two becomes:


               1-w
(44)
             21_
        Contrasting (43) with (36), it is clear that these two money stocks

will not be the same, so that prices will also differ in the two situa-

tions. Given that the nominal exchange rate is tied by the monetary

arrangement, the real exchange rates and hence real outputs will also be

different. Denoting the real exchange rate of country one under the
                             T
ui-rule for the transfer by 81, we have:


             T
(45)
             01 -01m1 -—              t
             T                   1-ui
(46)        e2-o2=m2_-- t

       Using (36), (37) and (39), we get:



(47)
            0'
                       =
                           ()z       + (1 - w) U1 -
                                                          w(1j11)
                                                                    U2


(48)        0 - 02     =   - (9)z + w U1 -             (1 - w) j-j U2

where       z =   US   + (1 -    a)0*      -   +   u*.



       Several features of (47) and (48) deserve notice. If q = w, the gap

in the real exchange rates is entirely determined by the relative cycli-

cal positions of the two small countries, weighted by their monetary

shares in stationary state. If those are equal (q =                      we get:


                       =                   = (U1   -
(49)        0 -   01       -(0   -
                                     02)
                                      -25-


       If   th? whole transfer goes to the home country (w =   1),   domestic

disturbances have no effect on the gap. When w = 0, on the other hand,

the same happens to partner country disturbances:



(50)         0 -     = - (1)(z   + U2)   if w   1




(51)         01-01=z+U ifw0
       The effect of foreign disturbances can be easily analyzed. It is

also possible to combine the monetary rule with a price rigidity.


V. Conclusion



       The implications of the two-tier model described in this paper

roughly confirm the importance of the factors traditionally mentioned in

the literature in monetary unions. Their impact hinges on the type of

disturbance shocking the macroeconomic equilibrium, the trade pattern of

the various countries and wage and price behavior. Except for the

special Keynesian case mentioned at the end of Appendix 1, no emphasis

was placed here on the latter factor. The impact of the other two,

particularly of the first, was extensively analyzed.

       We now list the major results, mentioning the relevant parameters

for ease of reference. We begin with the dynamic stability of the large

countries block, discussed in Appendix 2. The condition for the two

economies to reach the stationary state under perfect foresight, given

initial conditions, are that the share of domestic goods in consumption

be greater than the share of foreign goods ( <        and that there be some

sluggishness in price adjustment. The latter requirement ensures

saddle-point stability under perfect foresight insofar as it
                                    -26-




compensate the instability of price and exchange-rate expectations

 (whose strength is c and b respectively) by a trade-off between price

inflation and the output gap (whose slope is y). The condition is yc < 1.

       Looking at the long-run solution of the model, the real and nominal

exchange rate between the two large countries (0* and e respectively) as

well as the price level (p**, the price of the numeraire currency country

was chosen) in one of them are simultaneously determined. They are

expressed in terms of relative demand supply, and monetary disturbances

in both countries. Thus, if the disturbances are perfectly correlated

(u =   ur = uA etc.), the nominal and real exchange rates remain at. their
long-run equilibrium values and the price level increases (less than

proportionately) with demand expansion and decreases (more than propor-

tionately) with a productivity improvement.

     The same result holds for the difference between the price level of

the small domestic economy under flexible exchange rates and under the

monetary union. For example, demand expansion will be more inflationary

under flexible exchange rates if foreign demand disturbances are perfect-

ly correlated and conversely.

     The effect of domestic real disturbances is always more inflationary

under the monetary union when the trade-elasticities are large (the

composite domestic disturbance term is a weighted average when    <   1).
     The model of the pseudo-exchange rate union relies on the automatic

adjustment of the balance of payments of the partner to solve for the

real exchange rate or the price level of the partner countries. The

money stock of the domestic economy becomes an endogenous rather than a

policy variable. This is the classic counterpart to making the exchange
                                    -27-




rate between the partners a policy variable, which is precisely fixed by

monetary partners intervention.

       In a full monetary union, however, the monetary allocation between

member states becomes endogenous. In that case, the union may change the

real exchange rate of the countries tied by the monetary rule. If

steady-state shares are given by q, then the rule is denoted by the share

of money, w/q allocated to country one. Then monetary expansion in the

large country in the pseudo-exchange rate union (u* >       0) will increase
the real exchange rate gap (and thus depreciate the real rate of the

domestic economy) if the monetary allocation rule is less than the

"natural distribution't given by w =   r.   If w >   q, on the other hand, the
real rate of country one will depreciate and the real rate of country two

will appreciate. When the natural distribution is maintained, demand

expansion in the two large countries has no effect on the real rate gap

in the two small countries.

       The focus of the analysis was on the allocation of a given transfer

between the two small countries, because -- as shown in Macedo (1985a) —-

this   is an important feature in the recent experience of the West African

Monetary Union. Nevertheless, the transfer mechanism is likely to be

present whenever small countries peg their exchange rates with large

ones. By emphasizing the size difference, the model presented in this

paper was able to handle a 3-country exchange rate union with a central

bank between two of its members. An analysis of the strategic interac-

tion between the members of the union is a natural application of this

set-up.

                                   APPENDIX   I




                       DERIVATION OF A LOG LINEAR MODEL



        This appendix derives the log-linear model used in the text for one

small country. It can easily be adapted to the large countries. The

supply side is an extension of the three-country model in Marston (1984a)

which introduces domestic supply disturbances and an endogenous labour

supply. The wage contract set-up is left out. Supply disturbances are

featured in the two-country model of Marston (1984b). The demand side is

adapted from Macedo (1983).



1. Supply



        Consider a Cobb-Douglas technology for domestic output, subject to a

random productivity disturbance. For a given stock of capital, set to

one by choice of units, we have



(1)         Y =



where       Y is domestic output

            L is employment

               is a supply disturbance

            A is the share of labor (a constant)



By marginal productivity pricing, we have:
                                       -29-


(2)
where          W is the wage rate

               P is the price of domestic output



        Substituting for Y in (2), we get labor demand as a function of the

real product wage and the disturbance term:



(3)           Ld =



        We   assume that the supply of is a function of the wage measured in

terms of the consumer price index, defined as a geometric average of the

domestic currency prices of the goods produced in the three countries:



(4)           c =       (P*E*)' (PkE**)a


where         P*(P**) is the foreign currency price the good produced in the

              partner (non-partner) country;

              E*(E) is the price of the partner's (non-partner's) currency

              in units of domestic currency;

and



      The price of the partner's currency in terms of the non-partner's is

determined by triangular arbitrage:

(5)           E =   E**/E*


      Using the definition of the two relevant real exchange rates, we

have another expression for P:
                                            -30-


(6)        -Pc
                 =   (1 -

where            =   P**E/P*


and        0 =    P**E**/P


     According to (6), proportional changes in pC and P require that the

real exchange rate efffects offset each other or 0* = 0(1
                                                            -
                                                                   If the    '.
domestic real exchange rate depreciates, the real exchange rate of the

partner will have to depreciate by a smaller amount. The larger the bias

in trade toward the partner, measured by c&,../(l -           a),   the smaller this

dampening effect.

      We are now in a position to express labor supply as a positive

function of the real wage, with elasticity n:



(7)        LS = N      (W,pc)n



Using (6) in (7) we get



(8)        LS = N      [(w/P)e*e1 - a)1n


      In equilibrium, demand for labor equals supply of labor except for a

frictional unemployment pool. Equating (8) to (3), we obtain the equi-

librium product wage as a function of the terms of trade. Denoting

logarithmic deviations by lower case letters we get:



(9)        [1+n(1-X)](w -      p)   =   -n(1-X)[a0*   -
                                                          (1-a)0]   ÷
                                                 -31-




        Using(2) to substitute for L in (1), we get aggregate supply as a

function of the product wage, which, upon substitution from (9), yields:



(10)
                y=_h(1_)8+haG*+u

where
                  An
                h=l+(lx)
and             u =   [ix - 1+n(1-A)      '1it




2.     Demand



        The. demand side is obtained from the open-economy income identity

which defines aggregate demand:



                                                             E'P'
(11)         Y A(Y, R, 13A + Xi(Yi, E'P1) -                         M'(Y, E1Pi)



where       A =   C   +   I   + G is real absorption

            X1 (H1) are exports (imports) to (from) country i, i =                *, **
            R is real interest rate

            UA is a demand disturbance



       In (11) the trade balance is expressed in units of the domestic good

and the effects of foreign (domestic) income on exports (imports) are to

be interpreted in common units, not made explicit to avoid cluttering.

To linearize (11), log differentiate, denote again logarithmic deviations

by lower case letters and define r                 dR, to obtain:

 1.    The two large countries


       The large countries model, whose stationary-state version is solved

in the text, consists of the following set of equations, where variables

are defined as logarithmic deviations from their steady-state level and

precise definitions were given in Appendix 1:



(1)

                                                            IS equations

(8)         0* = e ÷ p** -        p*                        real exchange rate

(9)         r3 =   i3   -
                            p    j   =   *, **              real   interest rate

(10)       p* =    p*   +                                   consumer price indexes

(11)       p** p** -
       The model includes five differential equations, respectively the

two IS curves, the two price adjustment rules and interest parity. The

state of the system is described by the real and nominal exchange rates

and the price of the output of the double-starred country, O, e and p**

respectively. To reduce the system to three differential equations, we

first eliminate the interest rates by using (9) to eliminate the real

rates and then using (3) and (4) to eliminate the nominal rates:

            _be*_bp*+(1+)y*_v*_ae*+p*=u +(1+b)u*
(12)

           be*bp**+       (1÷)y*_vy*+ae*+p**ur+(l+)u*
       Using (3) and (4) again to substitute for nominal interest rates in

(7), we get:

(13)        c=y*_y**+p*_p**_u+u*
       Using the difference of the two equations in (5) and (6) to elimi-

nate the difference in outputs from (10), we have:


(14)        _i*+(!_c)(1+2k)8*_e_u*+u**+u* _u**
       Similarly, we use (5) and (6) to eliminate outputs from (12). For

the starred country we get:



(15)        _b*- [(i÷) -b]                      [a+(1++v)k]*+p*
           u-
       Finally, we eliminate p* and p using the definition of the real

exchange rate in (8). The system can then be written as:

where c = 1 + 4)(1 -      cy)
        N = a + (1 +     v)k
and 4)b/c


       To write (16) more compactly, we define matrices and vectors as

follows:




(17)        j;* + D* x =            Zu

where       x* =   (0*   p** e)'



       We now solve the homogeneous system, in order to ascertain its

dynamic properties. Inverting J.,. in (17), and multiplying its inverse by

minus D*, we obtain the system in the form:
                                               -36-


(18)               = A*X*

where        A. =



        Since a12 =     =    0 in A, the characteristic equation only involves
                    a32
seven of the nine coefficients and can be written as:



(19)         (a1 +           - a2X   -         =   0
                                         a3)


                         3
where        a1 =




             a2 —
                   —   y2k(+v)-by3(1-2)
                        (-v)(4+v-2cy)c


             a3 = 2Ny3



and          X is an eigenvalue of A,...




We therefore have the solutions:



             A =
                   -a1
(20)



             2Aa2±J a+4a3

       The signs of a1 and a2 are ambiguous. They basically depend on

whether yc         1. A preference for domestic goods is usually assumed, so

that          (the "transfer condition"). Not surprisingly, a crucial
parameter is the speed of price adjustment. Recalling that c would be
                                           -37-




one if the interest elasticity were equal to the level of the nominal

interest rate (say 15%), then yc <          1, a low speed of adjustment, implies
1' > 1 >    v   (v is given by the marginal propensity to import divided by the

sum    of   the marginal propensities to import and not to spend). This means

not only that a1 > 0 so that we have one negative eigenvalue, but also

that the other two roots alternate in sign because a3 is unambiguously

positive. Therefore, when prices adjust slowly, the system has two

directions of stability and one direction of instability, given by the

nominal exchange rate. When prices adjust fast, on the other hand, the

real exchange rate also has a positive eigenvalue and the system has two

directions of instability, associated with the two jump variables. In

the limiting case where prices adjust infinitely fast to excess demand

for goods (y - co), all three state variables are forward looking. Then

dynamics come solely from expectations and we have:



                *        b(1-)        -b          -b

                         b            -b           0

                         0             0          -c



Performing the same operation as before, we obtain the eigenvalues of the

new A matrix as



                    = 2N/b(1 -   2)
(21)
                    =    = 1/c
                                       -38-


        The fact that    =    is   a reflection of the recursive nature of the

new system, evident from the structure of J,.. The important point,

though, is that the three eigenvalues are positive unless the "transfer

condition"      <   does not hold, in which case          < 0. Note that this

condition was not crucial in the previous analysis because of the irrele-

vance of the sign of a2.

        The structure of the two large economies simplifies considerably

when the price of their domestic output is assumed to be fixed at some

identical level (y = 0 and p* =     p**   =   u*).   This reduces the model in

(16) to one differential equation in the nominal (and real) exchange

rate. Since the remaining aggregate demand and supply equations cannot

be solved uniquely for outputs in the two countries, we concentrate on

the case where output is demand-determined so that we do not use (5) and

(6). The case where output is supply-determined could be handled by

neglecting (1) and (2).

        The neglect of supply side effects makes the model in (1)-(11) a

conventional Keynesian model with perfect foresight and (16) reduces to:



(22)
                                              *d *d
             c[1+4(1_2)]e+2ae=2(um_uA)

                  *    **
                 U. - U.
                  1    1
where       u. =               1    m, A
             1       2



        Consider now that aggregate demand and monetary policy in the large

countries fluctuate according to:



(23)           =
                                           -39—



where      j =   *,     i    = A, m


       Then the non-homogenous system (22) and (23) will have one positive

root associated with the jump variable e and one negative root associated

with the composite forcing variable describing the relative cyclical

position of the two countries. The equilibrium solution where e = 0 and

   = 0 will be a saddlepoint. Along the stable path, we will have:


(24)        e = {2a +   c[1   + 4(1 -     2)J}_1   2(*ud -   *d)
       Note that the size of the effect of a particular disturbance is

smaller the larger the speed of adjustment i and the preference for

domestic goods (the smaller ). The stationary solution when disturbanc-

es are permanent is obtained by making t           = 0 in (24). This special case
is worked out in Macedo (1985b).

       To take a particular solution to (17) given by x* =             0,   we solve for

the stationary state of the endogenous variables, x, in terms of the

exogenous disturbances. We rewrite here in compact form the system

solved in the text:

2.     The two small economies


       We present here the model of what we will call the domestic economy.

It is easy to modify it for the other (identical) small country, as was

shown in the text:

       The model is solved differently depending on whether there is a

floating regime, with one exchange rate, e**, endogenous,or whether there

is a fixing of one bilateral rate, with the domestic money stock, in,

change rate case, by reducing it to two dynamic equations, one for the

real exchange rate and the other for the domestic price level since the

respective nominal exchange rate can be obtained by (31). Using a

notation consistent with (16), the two supplementary equations can be

                                         =

   and H*               +   4ha. +   (v*_v**)k

        It is clear from (34) that the system is to be solved in terms of

the foreign variables, exogenous to the domestic economy. In fact, in

obvious notation, it can be written as



(35)           J.x+Jx=D.x*+Dx+Zu*+Zu
       The similarity of (36) and (17) is apparent. Note also that H is

the three-country equivalent of N. The share of the supply effect, X, is

the small country equivalent of k. It will be of use below.

       We proceed to analyze the homogenous solution. We set x* (and thus

       and u to zero so that we only have to compute J1D in order to solve

the characteristic equation. In this two-by-two case, it is sufficient

to compute the determinant and the trace of that matrix. The sign of the
                                            >
determinant     depends again on whether cy < 1:



(37)           Det (f1D) =    -yH/c'(l   -   a + act)
                                        -43-


                                                a   +a —Hcy             1

where       J—1 D =(1+4)

Recalling that 4' > 0 when cy < 1, we see that, if prices do not adjust

too fast, Det < 0 and the two roots will be of opposite sign. The

negative root will be larger in absolute value if the trace is negative.

Under the same condition about y, this requires that the ratio of the

trade elasticities to the average of 4)             (the   ratio of the interest elas-

ticities), and h (the aggregate supply elasticity), weighted by a, be

small enough, or

                a*+a**   <      CY
            a4)+(1-a)h         1-cy


If cy >   1, the trace is of course positive. In fact, when y is infinite
the determinant is equal to H/abc and the system is again unstable. The

matrix J becomes then



                          -   a)b       -b

            j
                   [      -c                c



       Now we know from above that x* = A.L.x* when all exogenous variables

are at their steady-state levels (so that u remains at zero). We there-

fore rewrite (36) as



            x=J1Dx+Mx*

where       M =   -J1 [JJ1D* -        D].
                                                      -44-




         If the dynamics of x are sufficiently stable, then, the system in

(39) can be stable even if the homogenous system is not. But the solu-

tion for the dynamics of x* in terms of the exogenous variables would

have to be substituted for before we make some assumption about their

dynamics. For example, if each disturbance is given by (23) above, then,

for sufficiently low speeds of adjustment, a stable (or saddlepoint-

stable) solution to the system will exist, even if y were infinite.

         We now concentrate on a particular solution to (36) given by x* = x
=   0:
(40)          x =   -D1   (Bu* +           Zu)


 where B =        [DJ.D'Z*    +              =


                                                             -N+4ha            -N+4Iha


         4[2Nv*_H*(1+v)]                         [2Nv**+H*(1+v)]         0      0




         N(l-v)+4(1÷v)hc&,                       N(l-v)-4,(l+v)ha*       0      0




         Under the assumption that the domestic economy is small relative to

country star (y* =        0),     ,
                                       we solve the system in (34) —     which collapses
into a single equation -               for   the new exchange rate between the domestic

country and the double starred country, 0:



(41)          1   {-[(i-a     cy)_v]ê*+(_v*_ v)÷(-                    v*)+(by_l)}

        The h?mogenous solution to (41) is simply:



(42)           Ô =             e
                       bay-i

        If bay >       1, the root is positive and the system is unstable with the
proviso discussed in connection with (39) above.

        Again we concentrate on the particular solution obtained by setting

      = Ô =   0.   Under fixed rates, the B matrix in (40) becomes a vector,

which we denote as .                Setting   up domestic disturbances to zero, we

obtain:

        Consider a country          exactly    identical to the domestic economy de-

scribed. above and index both of these small countries by 1 and 2. If

the links between the two small countries are negligible, we have instead

of the right-hand-side of (35):
