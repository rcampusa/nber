Many laws create important rights for today's employees, but the availability of legal representation

for employees seeking to enforce those rights is uncertain. The goal of the present paper, part of the

Emerging Labor Market Institutions for the 21st Century Project at the National Bureau of

Economic Research, is to examine some of the distinctive public-interest legal organizations that

exist to help to enforce the employment laws. The chapter focuses on two broad categories of such

organizations: "national issue organizations," which are organizations that focus on one or more

broad-based issues and are funded predominantly by private donations; and legal services

organizations, which serve exclusively low-income individuals and are funded primarily by the

government.

Introduction

       Today’s American legal system affords a significant array of protections to employees.

Although most workers in this country do not enjoy a general right to be dismissed only for

cause−a right characteristic of many European countries (Issacharoff 1996:1806-07) and now of

one American state, Montana (Mont. Code Ann. secs. 39-2-901 to 39-2-915)–they benefit from a

host of specific prohibitions on arbitrary or inappropriate behavior by employers. Examples

include prohibitions on discriminatory behavior (on the basis of race, sex, religion, national

origin, age, or disability) and on behavior that interferes with other personal rights of employees.

Employers are also under certain affirmative obligations to employees, including the obligation

to provide a safe workplace and the obligation (indirectly, through experience-rated insurance

premiums) to fund unemployment benefits for employees who are out of work.1

       There is, however, a critical and oft-emphasized distinction between the law “on the

books” and the law “in action,” as the Legal Realist movement famously taught long ago (Pound

1910). What ultimately matters for many, if not most, purposes is how the law actually operates,

not what protections it ostensibly provides. The law “in action” includes not only how courts

apply the law as written (the original emphasis of the Realists) but also how well the law is

enforced by the institutions and parties affected by it (Llewellyn 1930:435 n.3).

       The distinction between law “on the books” and law “in action” is clearly important in

the employment law context, where employees are ordinarily not in a strong position to enforce

their rights. Indeed, Roscoe Pound (1910:35), the father of “on the books”-“in action”

distinction, wrote almost a century ago that “our copious labor legislation for the most part fails

of effect because of defective administration.” The significant decline in union membership in

recent decades, from its high in the middle of the twentieth century, can only have exacerbated

the problem.

       The goal of the present chapter is to examine some of the distinctive public-interest legal

organizations that exist to help to enforce the employment laws. The chapter focuses on two

broad categories of such organizations: “national issue organizations” (for instance, the NAACP

Legal Defense and Education Fund), which are defined here as organizations that focus on one or

more broad-based issues and are funded predominantly by private donations; and legal services

organizations, which serve exclusively low-income individuals and are funded primarily by the

government. The focus, as just indicated, is on “enforcement” (or “implementation”) of existing

laws, not “enactment” of new laws, to use the dichotomy drawn by David Weil (2001:[draft at

3]) in his contribution to this volume.

       Many different mechanisms exist for “enforcing” the employment laws.                    The

mechanisms include, most obviously, providing conventional legal representation to employees

whose rights may have been violated, but they also include providing information to workers

about what rights the law gives them, facilitating the enforcement of these rights through means

other than filing lawsuits, and providing research and support assistance to attorneys providing




                                                                                                 2
direct representation to clients. There are a number of examples of entities providing these latter

sorts of services; the Workplace Project of Long Island, for instance, offers informational

courses for workers (Trubek 1998:806) and facilitates enforcement of employment laws through

means other than litigation (Gordon 1995:430-37), and the Migrant Legal Action Program offers

research and support assistance to attorneys who provide direct representation to migrant

workers.2 Many legal web sites also offer employment law information to workers.3 For reasons

of scope, however, this chapter focuses on the more conventional activity of direct legal

representation of employee interests.

       It is interesting to note in this connection that Charles Tilly and other theorists of social

movement apparently have not viewed such litigation or representation activity as a central

component of social movement, since it is not necessarily “outsider” behavior. I agree, by

contrast, with Paul Burstein (1991:1203-05, 1222), who, after making this observation about

Tilly and other theorists, argues that litigation is an important element of social movement. This

importance justifies the emphasis I give it here.

       Section 1 below lays the groundwork for the examination of the role of public-interest

legal organizations in representing employees by describing why the usual mechanism for

protecting legal rights–retention of a private lawyer by the aggrieved party–is of limited

effectiveness in the employment context. Section 2 overviews some of the key features of

national issue organizations and legal services centers (the organizations on which this chapter

focuses). Section 3 provides institutional detail on how the two types of organizations are

funded. Finally, section 4 develops the chapter’s primary analytic point, which is the way in

which funding sources exert a significant and often problematic influence on the sort of

employment law litigation in which an organization engages–a species of the general point about

the influence of funding sources on public-interest legal organizations (Komesar and Weisbrod

1978:96-97).    As discussed below, national issue organizations, funded largely through

donations, do primarily high-level, high-impact work in areas with a significant public profile,

such as discrimination; by contrast, legal services centers, supported by the government, work

primarily at low levels and in areas, such as unemployment benefits, that lack the public profile

of areas such as discrimination. This distinction between the two types of organizations is not

absolute (there are some exceptions), and also there are other types of public-interest legal

organizations that do some work in the employment arena, but still the overall pattern of activity

seems to be what the distinction between national issue organizations and legal services centers

suggests.

       As a result of this pattern of activity, neither national issue or organizations nor legal

services centers succeeds very well in meeting the full set of needs of employees for enforcement

of the employment laws. For both types of organizations, a very important component of the

organizational objective function is attracting or maintaining funding from either large private

donors (such as foundations) or the government, and this focus on receiving such forms of

funding detracts from the organizations’ ability to serve the full range of their constituencies’




                                                                                                4
needs (see also Weil 2001:[draft at 17-18]). My conclusion here complements Weil’s suggestion

that reliance on either unions or small individual donors with a personal connection to the issues

in question (see also Hersch 2001:[draft at 1, 28]) provides “better alignment between the

objectives of the groups and those of the workers they intend to assist” (Weil 2001:[draft at 18-

19]).

        A final terminological point is important here. Lawyers commonly distinguish between

“employment law” and “labor law,” where the former is the body of (largely substantive) rules

protecting workers regardless of union status, while the latter is the body of (often procedural)

rules governing the formation and conduct of unions and their relationships with employers.

This chapter follows that terminological distinction; thus its focus on organizations involved in

enforcing “the employment laws” means a focus on organizations that work on employment law,

not labor law, issues.



1.      The limited efficacy of private legal representation in the employment law context

        In most of the economy, the primary institution that operates to protect parties’ legal

rights is the private bar; an aggrieved party retains (and pays for) a lawyer who works to

vindicate the client’s rights. Perhaps not surprisingly, this approach seems to work less well in

the employment context than in many other contexts. This is so for several reasons.

        First, individual employees will quite often lack the funds to hire a lawyer on an hourly

basis, the usual arrangement for large commercial clients. In this respect the problem is parallel

to the one that arises in the personal injury context, where individual victims often cannot afford

to hire lawyers on an hourly basis while defendant-corporations can.




                                                                                                 5
       In the personal injury context the solution is representation of victims on a contingent-fee

basis, where the lawyer is compensated by receipt of a share of any winnings garnered by the

accident victim. But employees generally do not have as great an opportunity to hire lawyers on

a contingent fee basis as do victims of personal injuries. The reason is that employees’ damages

are ordinarily far lower than those of personal injury victims. It is true that some employment

law claims sound in tort (like personal injury claims) and thus can produce verdicts for millions

of dollars; in Wilson v. Monarch, 939 F.2d 1138 (5th Cir. 1991), for instance, an employee

netted a $3.1 million verdict on a tort claim for emotional distress. However, a large number of

employment claims–most prominently, discrimination claims brought under federal law–do not

fall into this potential-seven-figure-verdict category. Until 1991, employees in such cases were

limited to “equitable” relief (reinstatement together with limited amounts of lost wages) (see, for

example, Selmi 1998:1427-28), and even now monetary relief beyond what was available under

the old regime is capped at amounts ranging from $50,000 to $300,000 depending on the size of

the offending employer (see 42 U.S.C. sec. 1981a(b)(3)). (State claims, however, are not subject

to these caps.) Also consistent with the idea that limited damages pose a barrier to private

representation in the employment area is the fact that age discrimination plaintiffs are generally

viewed as having the easiest time finding legal representation, and their damages are generally

higher than those of other employment discrimination plaintiffs (Rutherglen 1995:505-09).

       A further dimension of the problem of relying exclusively on privately-hired attorneys to

bring employment law claims is that the potential damages of the employee will frequently be

highly correlated with the employee’s earnings. Thus employees who earn low to modest

wages–and thus are particularly unable to hire hourly-fee attorneys–will also tend to be

particularly unattractive to contingent-fee practitioners.




                                                                                                 6
       A third reason for the limited efficacy of privately retained counsel in the employment

law context is that, while some employment laws do provide for the recovery of attorney fees,

that right is limited in important respects and often does not provide private attorneys with

sufficient compensation to ensure that taking an employment case is worthwhile. To begin, it is

primarily antidiscrimination laws, as distinguished from other employment laws, that provide for

the recovery of attorney fees at all; other sorts of laws may not contain such provisions.4

Moreover, even those laws that do authorize the recovery of attorney fees authorize recovery

only if the employee is the prevailing party in the case.5 In addition, if a party prevails but only

to a limited extent, attorney fees are accordingly limited.6 A final, and critical, point is that even

if fees are recoverable, there is no upward adjustment to account for the risk that the employee’s

attorney would end up not prevailing.7 The lack of an upward adjustment means that on an

expected basis attorney fee awards under the employment law statutes that permit them at all are

systematically undercompensatory relative to the attorney’s performance of work on a regular

hourly-fee basis.



4
    Examples of laws that authorize the recovery of attorney fees under certain circumstances
include Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, see 42 U.S.C. sec. 2000e-5(k), and the
Americans with Disabilities Act, see 42 U.S.C. sec. 12205.
5
    See, for example, 42 U.S.C. sec. 2000e-5(k) (Title VII attorney fee provision); 42 U.S.C. sec.
12205 (disability discrimination attorney fee provision).
6
    See Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103, 114-16 (1992). Farrar involved an action under 42
U.S.C. sec. 1983 outside of the employment law context. However, the Supreme Court has
made clear that its interpretations of fee-shifting provisions apply to such provisions in general,
including those in employment statutes. See, for example, Buckhannon Board and Care Home,
Inc. v. West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources, 121 S.Ct. 1835, 1839 n.4
(2001). Numerous courts of appeals have applied Farrar to the fee-shifting provisions under
employment statutes. See, for example, Pino v. Locascio, 101 F.3d 235, 237-39 (2d Cir. 1996);
Brandau v. State of Kansas, 168 F.3d 1179, 1181-83 (10th Cir. 1999).
7
    See City of Burlington v. Dague, 505 U.S. 557, 562-67 (1992). City of Burlington involved a
statute permitting attorney fees in environmental cases, but the Court made clear that its
reasoning applied to other fee-shifting provisions–including those in employment statutes–as
well. See id. at 561-62.


                                                                                                    7
       For all of these reasons, the “ordinary” approach of privately-retained legal counsel is a

very incomplete strategy for the enforcement of the employment laws.             As Lewis Maltby

(1998:56) has written, “The economic hurdles facing an employee who seeks justice in court are

staggering.” An intriguing question, not addressed here because it would go too far afield from

the central topic of this chapter, is why “prepaid legal services” (programs under which

individuals make advance payments, in the nature of insurance premiums, for future legal

services) have had relatively little effect in achieving legal representation for employees.

       The point here is of course not that representation by privately-retained counsel in

employment law matters is never available. One institution of particular importance in providing

such representation is the “private public interest law firm.” Firms in this category are private

law firms that are supported by ordinary legal fees but that may represent certain clients for

reduced fees based on the client’s level of need. As Louise Trubek (1996:436) writes, “Social

justice law firms serve diverse social classes by using sliding-scale fee schedules based on

income . . . .” In the employment law context, the paying clients may be unions and the

subsidized clients may be individual employees. In addition, class action suits brought by

private counsel may play a role in vindicating employees’ rights in some contexts.

       Nonetheless, notwithstanding the existence of a role for private counsel on the employee

side, it remains the case that alternative institutional arrangements, and in particular the public-

interest legal organizations discussed in this chapter, have an important role to play in the

enforcement of the employment laws. In addition to the points about retention of private counsel

described above, there is the overarching fact that, as described by Weil (2001:[draft at 9-10]) in

this volume and also by Burton Weisbrod (1978:20-21), enforcing many aspects of employment




                                                                                                  8
(or other laws) involves a significant public good component–a fact that suggests the need to rely

at least in part on various sorts of public entities for enforcement.

       An obvious question to ask in light of the comment just made concerns the potential role

of the government in the enforcement of the employment laws. Often, of course, the government

has a role to play when the private market fails to provide a particular good or service. However,

for a variety of reasons that have been explored in the existing literature, the government is

limited in its ability to provide direct legal representation for employees, both as a matter of

theory and as an empirical matter (Handler 1978b:259-68; Selmi 1998:1427-38, 1447-49). Thus,

there remains an important role for the public-interest legal organizations discussed in this

chapter to play.

       Along with the government, unions are an institution that obviously can help to overcome

public-good-type problems. Consistent with this suggestion, union counsel can and do play a

role in enforcing the employment laws in addition to their work in labor law arenas. Examples

of such union counsel include the AFL-CIO General Counsel’s Office and the legal counsel of

the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), each of which

has been involved in a number of important employment law cases.8 Professor Catherine Fisk

goes so far as to describe union initiatives in the employment law area as “major efforts to

enforce employment law in nonunion workplaces” (Fisk 2001). The role of such union counsel

thus complements the role of the public-interest legal organizations emphasized here.



2.        National issue organizations and legal services centers–in general

          The present section describes two leading types of public-interest legal organizations

involved in the employment law area. The first is national issue organizations; as noted above,

these are national entities that focus on a particular set of issues or topics (related at least in part

to employment law) and are funded largely or exclusively by sources other than the government.

The second is legal services centers; these provide legal representation to low-income individuals

at government expense. The present section presents introductory information on the two types

of organizations, and the following section discusses in more detail how the organizations are

funded. The goal of these two sections together is to paint a descriptive picture of the two types

of organizations, similar in spirit to–but with different emphases than–the portrait offered of

public interest legal organizations in general (not with specific reference to the employment law

area) offered more than twenty years ago by Joel Handler, Betsy Ginsberg and Arthur Snow

(1978).

          This section relies heavily on Internet presence to describe and identify organizations. In

this respect it differs from earlier work (for instance, O’Connor and Epstein 1989; Sturm 1993b),

which relied significantly on mass-mailed surveys to gather information. The advantage of

relying on the Internet is the likely greater accuracy, on average, of information as compared to

what is reported by a particular individual in response to a survey. The obvious limit of the

present methodology, of course, is that entities with an Internet presence will receive

disproportionate coverage.




                                                                                                     10
a.     National issue organizations

       Table 1 provides a list of entities that qualify as national issue organizations according to

the above definition. Note that an organization need not be exclusively devoted to employment

law issues to meet the definition; indeed, most of the entities listed divide their time between

employment and other issues, including housing, education, and consumer rights.                 An

organization also need not be exclusively devoted to litigation, as opposed to other forms of

public advocacy, to meet the definition. As long as litigation–meaning representation of clients

in lawsuits, negotiating settlements, filing amicus briefs, and so forth–is an important component

of the entity’s activity, the entity qualifies as a national issue organization.9 As already noted,

funding information is presented in section 3 below.




9
    One example of a national entity that works on employment law issues but does not engage
in any litigation is the Pension Rights Center, which is active in public advocacy in the media
and in testifying before Congress but provides referrals for individuals seeking legal
representation. See http://www.aoa.dhhs.gov/aoa/dir/210.html (visited 7/11/00) (listing attorney

       The organizations in Table 1 vary significantly in the proportion of their time devoted to

employment law issues, both as a fraction of the organization’s overall activity and in absolute

terms. In terms of the fraction of an organization’s overall activity, the National Employment

Law Project is exclusively devoted to employment law issues, while a relatively small proportion

of the overall activities of the Bazelon Center appears to involve such issues. (Note that, as

discussed more fully in section 4 below, the National Employment Law Project was previously a

government-funded “support center” for local legal services centers.) Similarly, in terms of the

absolute level of employment law work, the activities of the NAACP Legal Defense and

Education Fund, with close to two dozen staff attorneys,30 are surely substantially greater in

magnitude than those of the Equal Rights Advocates, with four staff attorneys.31 If, however,

employment law involvement is relatively rare or quite sporadic, then I do not include the

organization in Table 1.32

       Omitted from Table 1 are organizations that do not have staffs of their own lawyers but

rather provide coordinating services to their attorney membership, which engages in employment

law litigation. These organizations are not providing direct client representation as I conceive of

    For instance, Table 1 does not include People for the American Way; PFAW has been
involved in employment law litigation on a few occasions, but such litigation does not appear to
be a regular staple of its activity. See http://www.pfaw.org/courts/priorcases.shtml (visited
7/7/00) (describing PFAW’s involvement in the Supreme Court litigation in Oncale v.
Sundowner         and        Piscataway          School         District       v.       Taxman);
http://www.pfaw.org/courts/docket.shtml (visited 7/7/00) (current docket of cases in which
PFAW is involved, none of which are employment cases). Similarly, the National Center for
Lesbian Rights focuses on a range of discrimination and civil rights issues but does not appear to
work on employment law matters and thus is not listed in Table 1.                             See
http://www.nclrights.org/cases.html (visited 7/10/00) (current docket of cases in which NCLR is

Justice. See http://www.tlpj.org/tlpjf/caseup.htm (visited 7/11/00) (summary of current cases,
none of which are employment cases).


                                                                                                14
it. The most prominent example of such an organization in the employment area is the National

Employment Lawyers Association, which coordinates amicus-brief-writing activities by its

members but does not employ the attorneys who write the briefs.33

       As discussed in section 4 below, in addition to the organizations listed in Table 1 there

are entities that look similar to these organizations but seem to predominantly (although not

necessarily exclusively) operate on a more regional or local level; examples (all listed in Table 3

below) include the Asian Pacific American Legal Center of Southern California, the Center for

Law in the Public Interest, the Employment Law Center of the Legal Aid Society of San

Francisco, Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders, the Northwest Women’s Law Center, Public

Advocates, Inc., and the Public Justice Center.



b.     Legal services centers

       A second leading type of public-interest legal organization involved in the enforcement

of the employment laws is legal services centers. These centers arose in the 1960s as part of the

federal government’s War on Poverty (Bellow 1980:337-38). Since 1974 the centers have been

administered through the Legal Services Corporation, an arm of the federal government that

makes grants of funds to local centers around the country.34

       Legal services centers provide legal representation free of charge across a range of areas

to low-income clients who cannot afford ordinary private lawyers.35 The eligibility cutoff

established at the federal level is at 125% of the federal poverty guidelines, and local centers

33

Employee Advocate, Spring 2000, at 6, 10 (describing amicus brief activity of NELA attorneys).

    See http://www.lsc.gov/welcome/wel_who.htm (visited 7/14/00) (general description of the
Legal Services Corporation).

                                                                                                15
may, if they choose, limit their services to persons even closer to the poverty line (Spar 1996:2).

As examples of the income cutoff levels, Alaska Legal Services sets the cutoff for a family of

three at $21,700, while Gulfcoast Legal Services of Florida sets it at $17,063.36 As a result of the

cutoffs, legal services centers cover only a distinct subset of the population of individuals who

may be unable to retain a private lawyer for representation on an employment law matter. As

Justice Denise Johnson of the Vermont Supreme Court has noted, “It is not just the poor who

cannot afford justice in today’s society.      Courts across the country have experienced an

explosion in pro se litigation” (where the client is not represented by an attorney), “and many

people representing themselves are of modest income levels and would not be eligible for

publicly funded legal services” (Johnson 1998:480-81).

       Legal services centers perform limited work in the employment law area (Gordon

1995:422); indeed, many potential clients may be entirely unaware of their ability to get help

with employment law matters from legal services entities. The Legal Services Corporation

compiles aggregate statistics on the types of cases handled by legal services centers.

Nationwide, income maintenance claims, which include claims for unemployment benefits as

well as other types of public benefits,37 comprise about a sixth of the overall caseload of legal

services centers.38 Other employment cases are a few percent of the overall caseload.39

       A few of the local legal services centers provide detailed quantitative breakdowns of their

activities by subject matter. Atlanta Legal Aid, for example, reports an annual caseload for 1997

of 11,552 total cases, of which 241 involved unemployment benefits, 74 involved discrimination

claims, and 185 involved other employment claims.40 The Maryland Legal Aid Bureau reports

an annual caseload for 1998 of 33,048 total cases, of which 2,256 (7%) involved income

maintenance and 743 (2%) involved employment matters other than unemployment benefits

claims.41 The Legal Aid Society of Nebraska reports a 1997 annual caseload of 4,762 cases, of

which 286 involved income maintenance and 19 involved employment matters other than

unemployment benefits claims.42       Many other centers, however, do not even have an

“employment” category apart from the income maintenance category.43



3.     Funding of national issue organizations and legal services centers

       The previous section described national issue organizations and legal services centers

involved in employment law representation. This section examines the manner in which these

organizations are funded.



a.     National issue organizations

       As already noted, and as discussed more fully below, legal services centers get a

substantial amount of funding from the government. National issue organizations, by contrast,

                                                                                               17
typically get little or no government funding. Neither the NAACP Legal Defense and Education

Fund nor the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, for example, appears to have gotten

any government support in 1998, according to their annual reports for that year; the NOW Legal

Defense and Education Fund received a government grant for $394,682, approximately 10% of

its total revenue.44 Some national issue organizations, such as the American Civil Liberties

Union, categorically refuse to accept any government funding on principle;45 presumably these

organizations fear that such funding would comprise their ability to bring aggressive, broad-

based challenges, particularly when those challenges involve the government in any way. The

history of legal services funding, discussed in section 4 below, provides a good deal of support

for these concerns about the consequences of accepting government funding.

       The primary sources of funding for national issue organizations are generally individual

contributions and foundation grants; other sources include attorneys’ fees and donation of private

attorneys’ time.46 Often contributions by the government or by corporations are grouped with

foundation grants in the reporting of financial information,47 so the category of foundation

support as discussed here includes those additional sources of funding. As noted above, however,

government funding appears limited, and the same is generally true of corporate contributions, to

the extent one can tell from the information that is publicly reported.48

       Across the two major categories of funding for national issue organizations–individual

contributions and contributions from foundations–the organizations vary considerably in the

proportion of funding that comes from each source. For example, according to figures from

annual reports, in 1998 the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund got 33% of its

funding from individual contributors, and 47% from foundations, while the Lambda Legal

Defense and Education Fund got 69% of its funding from individual contributors and only 8%

from foundations.49 (It should be noted that such differences conceivably could result from

variations in how organizations categorize different contributions. Unfortunately, none of the

national issue organizations’ annual reports provide a great deal of detail about how they

compute the various figures. On the other hand, the fact that the organizations’ financial reports

are audited presumably suggests at least some commonality of practice across them. Still, this

caveat should be borne in mind in interpreting the figures given here.)

       An interesting normative dimension of the differences in sources of funds is that some

types of national issue organizations may have greater access to foundation funds than others. A

striking feature of data I compiled for four national issue organizations–the NOW Legal Defense

and Education Fund, the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, the Mexican American


and Education Fund, at 25-26 (listing “institutional donors,” which include both foundations and
corporations).
48
   For instance, the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund currently groups contributions
from foundations and corporations in a single category, but until 1996 it separated them out. In
1996 corporate contributions were $61,350, compared to $1,281,298 from foundations and
government. See 1996 Annual Report, NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, at 17.
49
   See 1998-99 Annual Report, Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund, at 24;
1998 Annual Report, Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, at 31.


                                                                                               19
Legal Defense and Education Fund, and the National Partnership for Women and Families–over

a several-year period is that, as already suggested above, the Lambda Legal Defense and

Education Fund gets far less of its funding from foundations than any of the other national issue

organizations just mentioned.      Foundations may be more likely to contribute to more

“conventional” civil rights organizations than to organizations such as Lambda’s. (Lambda’s

central focus is facilitating and protecting civil rights for lesbians, gay men, and bisexual

individuals.) The funding pattern described here is consistent with Felix Lopez’s observation

about the difficulty of attracting foundation support for representation in employment law

matters of ex-offenders, people in recovery, and people with AIDS (Lopez 1998:453).



b.     Legal services organizations

       The fundamental contrast between national issue organizations and legal services centers

in terms of their funding is that while the former get little to no government funding, the latter

get a substantial (albeit decreasing) fraction of their funding from government sources. The

following analysis presents more detailed information on the funding of legal services centers

and how it differs from the funding of national issue organizations.

       Table 2 shows both the absolute dollar amounts and the percentage of funding for legal

services centers from a range of sources for the years 1980 to 1998. The second column of the

table gives the amount of funding from the Legal Services Corporation;50 the third column gives

the amount of funding from other federal government sources (for instance, social services




50
    Actually this figure is approximate, since the dollar amount in the second column of Table 2
is the congressional appropriation to the Legal Services Corporation; most, but not all, of this
amount ultimately flows to legal services centers in the form of grants.


                                                                                               20
grants);51 the fourth column gives the amount of funding from state and local government

sources; the fifth column gives the amount of funding from IOLTA, or Interest on Lawyers Trust

Accounts;52 and the sixth column gives the amount of funding from other sources. The nature of

these “other sources,” to the extent it can be discerned from publicly available information, is

discussed later in this section.

         The percentage figures in Table 2 make clear that the percentage of funding for legal

services centers that comes from a government source of one type or another is very large–just

under 75% in 1998, and 98% in 1980. The composition of the government support has changed

somewhat over time, however; the role of state and local governments has grown, while the role

of the federal government has shrunk (from 97% of total funds in 1980 to 58% of total funds in

1998).

       In terms of nongovernmental funding, the Legal Services Corporation data reported in

Table 2 distinguishes between IOLTA funds and funds from other private sources. In fact,

IOLTA funds may bear important similarities to government funds in terms of the pressures and

restrictions (detailed more fully in section 4 below) that accompany the funding. Entities that

receive Legal Services Corporation funds are forbidden, for example, to bring class action

lawsuits or to engage in “legislative advocacy” (lobbying activity) (Udell 1998a:338); some state

laws impose similar restrictions on the use of IOLTA funds (Udell 1998b:908 n.42). Also of

interest for present purposes, at least one state, Washington, prohibits the use of IOLTA funds

for bringing employment discrimination suits (Udell 1998b:908 n.42). (It should also be noted

that the legal status of IOLTA funds remains up in the air after a 1998 Supreme Court decision

involving a federal constitutional challenge to the collection of such funds (Resnick and Bazelon

1998:299).)

       The remaining funding category for legal services centers reflected in the Legal Services

Corporation data is funding from “other” sources.53 The 1997 Annual Report of the Corporation

shows a breakdown of this category between private grants ($20,747,857) and sources other than

private grants ($42,862,053).54 Information from local legal services centers provides some

further detail about the sources of this set of funds. Often the funds come from state bar

foundations that wish to support the provision of legal services to low-income citizens.55 Other

foundations, as well as private individuals, may contribute as well, although in these instances

the fraction of support provided by such actors, as compared to government sources, is far

smaller than in the case of national issue organizations.56 United Way campaigns are also

another frequent source of funding.57

        It should be noted in conclusion that entities that receive funds from the Legal Services

Corporation are currently prohibited from collecting attorneys’ fees from opposing parties (Udell

1998a:338). Thus, while some employment laws provide for the recovery of attorneys’ fees from

employers under certain circumstances (as described more fully in section 1 above), entities that

receive funds from the Legal Services Corporation are not presently eligible for this source of

private funding. By contrast, as noted above, recovery of attorneys’ fees can be a meaningful

source of funding for national issue organizations.58 The Supreme Court recently struck down a

different aspect of Congress’s limitations on the activities of entities that receive corporation

funds (see Legal Services Corporations v. Velazquez, 121 S. Ct. 1043 (2001)), but the case did

not involve the restriction on recovery of attorney’s fees or any of the other restrictions discussed

in this chapter.

4.     The relationship between funding sources and the nature of legal work performed
       by national issue organizations and legal services centers

       The previous two sections described national issue organizations and legal services

centers and their respective sources of funding.      This section looks more closely at the

relationship between funding sources and the nature of employment law representation provided

by each type of entity.

       The basic thesis advanced here is that the different funding sources of national issue

organizations and legal services centers produce systematic differences in the nature of the

employment law work they perform. In particular, national issue organizations, which depend

for support largely on private donations from individuals and foundations, tend to focus on high-

profile, publicly-charged issues such as discrimination and tend to work on a few important or

influential cases rather than a large number of more day-to-day claims; legal services centers,

which depend for support largely on government sources, focus heavily on less controversial

topics such as unemployment benefits and tend to work on many routine cases rather than a few

attention-getting ones. The distinction is not hard and fast (and some counterexamples are

discussed below, including the legal services “support centers” that used to play an important

role), but it does capture a general difference between the two types of entities. Moreover, the

distinction is an unsurprising consequence of the sorts of incentives created by the distinctive

patterns of funding for the two types of entities.

       As a result of the link between funding sources and activities, neither national issue

organizations nor legal services centers succeed very well in meeting the full set of employees’

needs for legal representation.       The objective function of these organizations is tilted




                                                                                              25
(understandably) toward maintaining the funding they need, and the natural result of this

dependence is distortion in the activities that they perform.



a.     The relationship between funding and the subject matter of legal work

i.     Subject matter of work by national issue organizations and legal services centers

       Even the brief descriptions in section 2 above suggest important differences in the subject

matter of the employment law work on which national issue organizations and legal services

centers focus. National issue organizations are disproportionately devoted to issues involving

discrimination; fourteen of the nineteen organizations listed in Table 1 are exclusively or

virtually exclusively devoted to discrimination issues (as their titles suggest), and an additional

two organizations, the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and the National

Partnership for Women and Families, give heavy emphasis to such issues. Furthermore, the

American Civil Liberties Union devotes a substantial amount of attention to discrimination

issues; it also focuses heavily on other similarly high-profile civil liberties issues. The only

national issue organizations that do not devote most of their energies to discrimination or other

high-profile civil liberties issues are the Guild Law Center for Economic and Social Justice,

which focuses on plant closings, and the National Employment Law Project, which works on a

range of employment law topics including unemployment, benefits, wrongful discharge and

discrimination.59 It also bears noting that the Guild Law Center, while national, is tiny, with only



59
    See notes 18 and 24 above (describing the Guild Law Center and the National Employment
Law Project). Other national entities that, like these two, focus on the plight of low-income
individuals, and that thus might be more likely to be concerned with more mundane legal topics
than the rest of the national issue organizations, include the National Center on Poverty Law and
the Center for Law and Social Policy, but neither of these entities at present appears active in the
employment law area, although the Center for Law and Social Policy apparently was in the past.

three lawyers on its staff.60 The National Employment Law Project, however, is a key national

player that has litigated major cases and submitted Supreme Court amicus briefs on employment

law issues that have lower public profiles than discrimination claims; the Project is thus the

major exception to the general pattern described in this chapter.61

       By contrast, legal services centers focus heavily within the employment area on

unemployment benefits claims, as noted in section 2 above. Indeed, help in getting clients

unemployment benefits that have been denied to them is a service that is routinely provided by

most legal services centers.62 In contrast, wage claims and discrimination claims, while handled

by some centers, are very far from universal in their coverage. For wage claims, the centers most

likely to handle them seem to be those that focus on serving migrant workers and seasonal

farmworkers.63 Discrimination claims are handled by such centers as Gulfcoast Legal Services,

Inc. (which, in a fairly unusual practice, explicitly lists discrimination as one of its “priorities”),

Northern Virginia, and the Knoxville Legal Aid Society.64 Other centers, by contrast, seem to

focus exclusively or almost exclusively on unemployment benefit claims in their work in the

employment area. At Legal Services of Eastern Missouri, for example, “[e]mployment cases

usually involve the loss or denial of unemployment benefits.”65 And at the Legal Services

Agency of Western Carolina, while unemployment benefits claims are “routinely accepted for

representation,” other “employment problems” are “routinely rejected for representation.”66

Some centers explicitly provide that discrimination claims are not handled.67

        Sometimes only new resources allow a center to branch out and handle additional types

of employment law claims. For instance, the New Orleans Legal Assistance Corporation reports

in its 1998 Annual Report of handling wage and discrimination claims for the first time in twenty

years due to the assistance of a Skadden Fellow (a recent elite law school graduate whose salary

is paid by the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom).68

        Thus, legal services centers focus on unemployment benefits claims and typically handle

areas such as discrimination only sporadically, if at all. In this connection, it is interesting to note

that, as mentioned briefly above, the National Employment Law Project, the only national issue

organization to devote attention to the unemployment area, also used to be funded by the Legal

Services Corporation69 and in fact served as a national legal services “support center,” authoring

publications to assist local legal services centers on employment law matters (see, for instance,

National Employment Law Project 1975). Legal services support centers are discussed more

fully below.



ii.    The role of funding

       The subject matter differences between national issue organizations and legal service

centers seem unsurprising in light of their different funding sources. If an entity wishes to raise

significant amounts of money from foundations and particularly private individuals, the entity is

likely to have far more success if the entity’s issues are high-profile and publicly visible. As

Karen Paget (1990:123) notes, appeals to private individuals in particular need to be “as sharply

ideological and urgent as possible.” Joni Hersch (2001:[draft at 12]) observes that “[t]he need to

generate media coverage in some cases may lead organizations to sacrifice substantive

achievements for more newsworthy events that will generate greater visibility.” A plea for funds

to help fight discrimination in the workplace seems likely to attract far more foundation, and

particularly far more individual, support than a plea for funds to ensure the integrity of the

unemployment benefits system.

       At the same time, government funders may be more hesitant to fund relatively

controversial types of legal claims than relatively mundane types, such as claims for

unemployment benefits.       An illustration here is the fact that, as noted above, the state of

Washington has a law prohibiting the use of IOLTA funds (similar in certain respects to

government funds) for bringing employment discrimination claims (Udell, 1998b:908 n.42).

Alan Houseman, Director of the Center for Law and Social Policy, offers a similar argument in

response to the idea that government funds for legal services should have flowed to entities like

the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund rather than to the sorts of entities that received

them; he says that had entities similar to the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund applied

for funds, “they would have sought funds for national civil rights and constitutional rights

litigation,” and “[f]unding such entities for civil rights and constitutional litigation would have

created a political fight” (Houseman 1995:1681).

        A further point related to funding sources and the subject matter of legal work is that the

congressional prohibition on recovery of attorneys’ fees by any entity receiving any Legal

Services Corporation funds, noted above, makes employment discrimination cases even less

attractive for such entities.

        In all, then, there are important subject matter differences between the work of national

issue organizations and that of legal services centers, and these differences seem to mesh up with

the differences in funding sources.



b.      The relationship between funding and the nature or type of legal work

        If the differences in subject matter were the only salient differences between national

issue organizations and legal services centers, then there might be relatively little cause for

interest or concern. For if national issue organizations raised money largely from private donors

and then worked on high-profile issues, while legal services centers got funded largely by the

government and then worked on more mundane issues, but both types of legal issues were fully

covered, it might not matter that there were differences between national issue organizations and

legal services centers. The difficulty, however, is that, as detailed in this subsection, the two




                                                                                                30
types of legal issues are generally not being covered in the same way. Instead, the nature or type

of work is quite different across national issue organizations and legal services centers, and again

the difference traces directly to the difference in funding sources.



i.     Nature or type of work by national issue organizations and legal services centers

       By and large, national issue organizations and legal services centers pursue cases at very

different levels of the judicial system and have very different goals in their legal representation.

A brief introductory point is in order here: Although this section will often use the term

“impact” to refer to the sort of representation in which national issue organizations engage, it

does so without meaning to embrace in an uncritical fashion the oft-drawn distinction between

“impact” or “law reform” work, on the one hand, and individual client representation, on the

other (Handler 1978a:26-27). Marc Feldman (1995:1537-38) nicely recaps the distinction:

       Service cases, undertaken for individual clients, . . . respond to the immediate
       problems of specific clients who present themselves at a program’s offices
       seeking assistance. . . . Impact cases, on the other hand, are viewed as significant
       and special. These rare cases seek to advance the interests of a number of . . .
       persons by ‘reforming’ some widespread practice or abuse.

       However, the distinction between impact work and client service work is problematic on

a number of grounds, perhaps particularly when used normatively to suggest the superiority of

impact work (Trubek 1995:1133-34; White 1987-88:535-38). But for my descriptive purposes it

is useful to distinguish in a rough way between work done to affect large numbers of individuals

and work focused on meeting the individual needs of a particular client. Yet a third category is

“implementation” work, or ensuring that legal victories in the courts are translated into real

results “on the ground” (Sturm 1993a:727). But this category is probably less pressing in the




                                                                                                 31
employment area than in the area of prison and other institutional reform work–the area in which

the implementation model is often discussed (see, for instance, Sturm 1993b:10, 15-16, 33-37).

        National issue organizations typically focus their energies on a small number of impact-

type cases, often at the appellate level of the judicial system. This emphasis is illustrated most

starkly in the way in which these organizations explicitly discourage any impression that they are

a resource for representing everyday claimants; for example, the web site for the Western

Regional Office of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund contains this stern statement:

                The [office] handles civil rights impact litigation. It does not offer direct
        services or legal advice. . . . [It] takes cases that it feels will have a significant
        impact on a large community of people. Often these are class action cases. . . .
                Attorneys are not available to speak with people in person or on the phone
        to offer legal advice. [The office] is able to accept requests for assistance only in
        writing. [The office] is unable to handle most of the cases that people bring to its
        attention. . . . It usually takes 30-45 days to receive a response.70

Other national issue organizations, such as Equal Rights Advocates, do accept phone calls from

individuals seeking legal advice, but even there the organization will provide legal representation

(as distinguished from information or referral to another lawyer) only in “compelling, precedent-

setting cases.”71

        By contrast, the primary emphasis for legal services centers is on serving large numbers

of clients.   The lead-off message of the Legal Services Corporation’s President, Douglas

Eakeley, in the Corporation’s 1997 Annual Report, for example, is that the Corporation’s “269

programs served some 2 million clients in 1997, closing 1.5 million cases, an increase over

1996.”72 Eakeley goes on to praise the fact that “[m]any programs . . . increased their efficiency

by adopting advanced telephone intake systems that facilitated access to their services over a

large geographical area.”73 As Gary Bellow (1980:340) wrote two decades ago, speaking of

legal services, there is “an almost exclusive focus, publicly and administratively, on ‘access’ and

how it is to be realized”; “graphs and tables” supplant “examples of practices changed and

wrongs righted.” While the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund brags in its annual

report that it “has been involved in more cases before the U.S. Supreme Court than any

organization except the U.S. Department of Justice,74 the claim to fame of the New Orleans

Legal Assistance Corporation is that “[i]n 1998, [it] completed work on 6058 cases affecting

19,264 persons in total” with “completed cases averag[ing] about 300 per attorney.”75 In sharp

contrast to the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund’s emphasis on its role in the highest

court in America, Danny Greenberg describes a legal services colleague who famously

proclaimed that he (or she) had “the power to drag [an adversary] through the lowest courts in

America.”76 It is hard to imagine a more striking difference in emphasis between the two types

of organizations.

       The difference is not, of course, absolute. While it is clear that “there is relatively little

impact work compared to service actually being done” by legal services centers (Bellow and

Charn 1995:1645), it is also clear that at least a few centers do work on impact litigation. More

likely than local centers to be involved with such litigation have been national or state-level

“support centers” (previously called “backup centers”), which work together with local centers

(Dooley and Houseman 1984:ch. I, p. 12; ch II, pp. 12-14; ch. III, p. 49). Although the role of these

support centers has been greatly cut back in recent years (Houseman 1998:370), at least some of

the centers appear to remain active, perhaps relying on alternative funding sources. (The support

centers were previously funded at least in part by Legal Services Corporation funds (Spar

1996:2).) For instance, the Ohio State Legal Services Association State Support Center provides

assistance, including direct representation of clients or co-counsel representation (presumably

with the local center), to the eighteen local centers in Ohio and lists as one of its areas of

coverage employment law, and in particular unemployment benefits.77 It may be that this sort of

entity is more inclined than the local centers to take on unemployment benefits cases at higher

levels of the judicial system.

       Also in Ohio is ABLE, whose self-professed focus is “impact work.”78 True to this

characterization, ABLE has brought a number of fairly high-profile discrimination suits in the

employment area, including suits against government actors.79 These are cases similar to those

brought by national issue organizations. But does ABLE bring impact suits in more mundane

areas such as unemployment benefits? Not in the particular area of unemployment benefits; the

cases it mentions in that area are highly fact-specific and narrow, in stark contrast to the

discrimination cases noted just above.80 But ABLE does mention a Fair Labor Standards Act

case involving overtime that “could have an impact on the rest of the [landscape services]

industry in eastern Ohio.”81 It also mentions a class action under the Fair Labor Standards Act,

but this case had to be transferred to a non-legal-services attorney after the imposition of

congressional restrictions that prohibited centers receiving Legal Services Corporation funds

from representing parties in class actions.82 Thus ABLE appears to do some work (probably less

in recent years as the congressional restrictions have grown) of an impact nature in areas of

employment law not emphasized by national issue organizations, such as the Fair Labor

Standards Act; like the National Employment Law Project, discussed above, it is an exception to

the general pattern of behavior and funding of public-interest legal organizations.

       A number of other legal services centers have traditionally (although perhaps less so in

recent years assuming they continue to receive Legal Services Corporation funds) engaged in

some impact work, including in the employment law area. For instance, Community Legal

Services of Philadelphia litigated a major employment discrimination case in the 1970s (Carr and

Hirschel 1998:320 n.3).

       Nonetheless, it seems clear that impact work is not a staple of most legal services entities.

This is particularly true for the local centers (as distinguished from the support centers, which,

again, have been cut back in recent years). As Gary Bellow and Jeanne Charn (1995:1647)

wrote fairly recently, “Many programs have abandoned any systematically oriented activities,

treating the collective problems that plague the populations they serve as beyond their

responsibility and competence.” Feldman (1995:1535, 1539) is similar. “Service work,” he

related phenomenon is the spinning off of part of a legal services center into a new entity       to
handle the cases barred by the congressional restrictions; this is discussed further at the end   of
section 4.


                                                                                                  35
says, rather than impact or law reform work, “constitutes the bulk of” legal services centers’

effort. He continues: “Currently, a [legal services] program spends the vast majority of its legal

resources on cases in which the horizon of ambition is defined, even at its maximum, by the

individual client. The goal of the legal work is . . . service to individual clients.” Moreover, the

congressional restrictions on Legal Services Corporation funds increase the degree to which this

focus on individual client service exists, since, by banning class actions by entities that receive

any financial support from the Legal Services Corporation (Udell 1998a:338), they cut off a

significant avenue through which impact work may get done.

       One response to the foregoing discussion is that perhaps there is relatively little large-

scale, impact-type work to be done in less high-profile areas of employment law such as

unemployment benefits; thus, the argument would run, we see little of such work because there

is simply little potential for it. (By contrast, it is clear that there is a large amount of service

work for individual clients in high-profile areas such as discrimination.) The point about large-

scale work in less high-profile areas of employment law seems hard to address in a definitive

way, but the conjecture nonetheless seems wrong. Procedures relating to employment benefits,

for instance, can be and occasionally have been challenged on due process grounds in major

class actions (see, for example, White v. Evans, 324 Md. 321 (1991)); it is not at all clear why–

apart from the lack of adequate sources of legal representation–these actions should not be more

common.     Similarly, reemployment participation requirements for unemployment benefits

(Emsellem and Halas 1995-96:298) may raise general legal issues that could benefit from

impact-type litigation. Thus, there seem to be plausible areas of impact work that are not being

well covered by existing public-interest legal organizations.




                                                                                                 36
ii.    The role of funding

       Once again, funding sources provide a clear explanation for the difference in the

activities of national issue organizations and legal services centers.        For national issue

organizations, which, as noted, get most of their funds from private donations, it seems quite

logical that raising money for high-impact work is easier than raising money to represent a large

number of individuals in everyday, run-of-the-mill cases. Recall in this connection the NAACP

Legal Defense and Education Fund’s proud reference in its annual report to its dominant role in

Supreme Court litigation. As Neil Komesar and Burton Weisbrod (1978:97) have suggested,

“the incentives provided by funding decisions” push toward “sexy” or “test” cases rather than

“efforts to enforce previous . . . case determinations.”

       By contrast, the history of legal services centers makes painfully clear the quite different

pressures that come with government funding. There is some dispute about how much impact

work got done in the early days of legal services. Feldman (1995:1579-81) contends that impact

work never figured importantly in the mission of legal services, while Fox (1998:305),

Houseman (1995:1669, 1677-78, 1685-86), Johnson (1974:192-94), and Handler, Ginsberg and

Snow (1978:45-46), all suggest that legal services in its founding years devoted meaningful

focus to the impact model. However, what is clear is that at least a substantial fraction of

centers, even early on in time, focused on representing a large number of individual clients rather

than on bringing high-impact cases (Bellow 1980:338). This may have been in part because the

centers adopted the existing model of “legal aid” societies, which had a similar focus (Feldman

1995:1562).83     Some authors also link the predominant focus on day-to-day, routine




83
    Prior to the availability of federal government funding for legal services, the needs of low-
income clients were met by private legal aid societies supported by charitable contributions and


                                                                                                37
representation to legal services’ dependence on the support of the organized bar, which may have

been threatened by a more aggressive embrace of impact work by legal services centers

(Feldman 1995:1578), although other authors (Bellow and Charn 1995:1644) take a contrasting

view.

        But it seems clear that an important influence in the focus of legal services centers on

individual client service was their dependence on government funding, for whenever these

centers went beyond the client service model they seemed to encounter controversy. Johnson

(1974:193) describes some early incidents in the history. By 1975 Congress had acted to restrict

legal services centers from participating in school desegregation litigation (a classic form of

impact litigation) (Parker 1994:1211 n.323). Similarly, welfare policy was one of the areas in

which legal services lawyers were most active in doing impact work, but again this led quickly to

controversy (Melnick 1994:75, 80-82). Houseman (1995:1687) succinctly summarizes some of

the key episodes:

        [T]he [legal services] program has been beset with the congressional and
        executive interference from the outset. It began in 1967 with the effort by Senator
        Murphy to ban suits against the government, and it continued throughout the
        history of the program: vetoes by governors over controversial programs; efforts
        to dismantle the program, first by Howard Phillips in 1973 and then again by
        President Reagan and his initial board of appointees in 1981-1984; and
        congressional restrictions on . . . what kind of advocacy was permitted . . . .”

The legal services program found itself in “deep political trouble” shortly after its founding, and

this trouble culminated in the removal of legal services from the “politics” of the Office of

Economic Opportunity, the center of the War on Poverty, and its instatement in the separate

Legal Services Corporation in the 1970s (Bellow 1980:340).




some municipal funding, as well as by individual lawyers on a voluntary basis (Bellow
1980:337).


                                                                                                38
        With the creation of the Corporation came, as Bellow (1980:340) has noted, “an almost

exclusive focus, publicly and administratively, on ‘access’ and how it is to be realized.” “The

immediate goal now [was] . . . ‘minimum access’–defined as 2 lawyers per 10,000 poor people in

the United States . . . .”

        As Houseman describes, however, the 1970s reform did not ultimately quell controversy

over the legal services program. Following the changes he notes, Congress in the mid-1990s

ordered a major restructuring of the program. Substantial new restrictions were imposed on all

entities receiving Legal Services Corporation Funds (Udell 1998a:337). Prompting these reforms

was the sense “the program was founded for the purpose of handling the routine, day-to-day

problems of poor people and that what had evolved was major impact litigation, which had

politicized the entire program” (Forger 1998:335). As the Legal Services Corporation reported

in its 1996 Annual Report:

        Congress determined that federally funded programs should focus on individual
        cases, while efforts to address the broader problems of the client community
        should be left to entities that do not receive federal funds. Certain kinds of
        advocacy that have always been recognized as important tools for attorneys to
        employ on behalf of their clients, such as class actions and most legislative
        advocacy, would no longer be permitted for legal service attorneys, even if non-
        federal funds were used for the purpose.84

The House Budget Committee was more direct: “Too often, . . . lawyers funded through federal

LSC grants have focused on political causes and class action lawsuits rather than helping poor

Americans solve their legal problems” (Spar 1996:1).

        The pressures against impact-type work imposed by government funding have not gone

uncriticized. In Congress, Senator Kennedy decried the effect those pressures were having:

        I personally do not think Washington should be deciding what legal issues local
        attorneys may raise on their client’s behalf; I do not think Washington should be

84
     See http://www.lsc.gov/anrep.html (visited 9/21/99).


                                                                                             39
       deciding what forums they can raise them in; and I most emphatically do not think
       we have any business telling a lawyer that the touchstone of whether or not to
       represent a client should be a measure of how controversial or how popular the
       issue. (Udell 1998b:901.)

But Senator Kennedy’s lament did not ultimately carry the day, either in 1974, when it was first

made, or in the subsequent controversies.

       As a final note, it is interesting to observe the striking parallel between the argument here

and Michael Selmi’s (1998:1404, 1439) claim that direct government entities have a similarly

narrow, circumscribed, cautious, bureaucratized focus in their work in the employment law area.

Selmi studies the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Department of Justice

and concludes that these entities “concentrate [their] efforts on small, routine cases” with the

primary goal of “process[ing] and dismiss[ing] claims” and the goal of remaining “politically

uncontroversial” (pp. 1404, 1439, 1447-49). The similarities to the picture painted above of legal

services work in the employment area are hard to overlook.



c.     Other organizations: Funding and nature of employment law work

       The discussion thus far has focused on two types of entities that provide legal

representation in the employment law context: national issue organizations and legal services

centers. The claim that has been advanced is that the work of these two types of entities

produces a pattern of coverage of 1) impact claims for high-profile, publicly charged issues, and

2) day-to-day claims for mundane issues such as unemployment benefits. This pattern leaves

uncovered the two remaining categories: impact claims in mundane areas and day-to-day claims

in high-profile, publicly charged areas. These gaps in coverage are a natural consequence of the

distortion of organizations’ objective functions as a result of funding pressures.




                                                                                                 40
       Do other public-interest legal organizations fill the void left by national issue

organizations and legal services centers? That is the question examined briefly in this section.

The analysis first looks at an important set of organizations that are similar to national issue

organizations but appear to operate predominantly at the regional or local level. It next looks at

the network of government-funded disability discrimination (“protection and advocacy”) centers,

which do case-by-case work in a variety of areas including employment discrimination, and thus

represent an exception to the general dichotomy drawn in this chapter. For reasons of space, this

discussion only scratches the surface; an important question for future work is what can be

learned from the alternative models described here, particularly the model used in the disability

discrimination context.



i.     “Regional issue organizations”

       Table 3 contains a list of organizations that are similar to national issue organizations but

seem to operate primarily (although not necessarily exclusively) on a more regional or local level

(although it is sometimes difficult to draw a sharp line between work on a rational level and

work on a regional or local level). Like the entities listed in Table 1 above, the entities in Table

3 focus on a particular set of issues or topics related at least in part to employment law, and they

appear to be funded largely or exclusively by sources other than the government. (Sometimes

publicly available information did not disclose sources of funding, but in no case was there any

indication of a significant role for government funding. For five organizations, the Asian Pacific

American Legal Center of Southern California, Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders, the

Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law (local affiliate centers), The Public Justice

Center, and the Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs, there was




                                                                                                 41
neither an indication of government funding nor any reason to suspect government funding. For

the Employment Law Center of the Legal Aid Society of San Francisco, there was no indication

of government funding, but the organization might receive such funding because it is part of a

legal aid organization. At the same time, the Center clearly receives substantial foundation

funding.85 Other entities listed in the table provided more information about their funding, as

detailed in the footnotes accompanying these entities.)

       In addition to the entities listed in Table 3, “legal services spin-offs”–entities spun-off

from legal services centers in the wake of the congressional restrictions on Legal Services

Corporation funds and the resulting difficulty of impact work for such centers–may look similar

to “regional issue organizations.” Carr and Hirschel (1998) offer a detailed case study of one

such spun-off entity. Some spun-off entities may well be doing impact work in the employment

area, but it is interesting to note that Community Legal Services of Philadelphia, which did

impact work in the employment area when it was funded by the Legal Services Corporation, is

now, since being spun off, focusing its attention away from litigation as a model (Carr and

Hirschel 1998: 330-31).

       Like the national issue organizations listed in Table 1, the organizations listed in Table 3

generally focus on issues involving discrimination and other high-profile civil liberties matters,

as is apparent from the descriptions given in the footnotes just above. The closest thing to an

exception to this pattern is The Public Justice Center, which seems to do substantial work in the

wage and hour area, as the description given above shows. But even that organization (like the

National Employment Law Project, the primary outlier among the national issue organizations in

Table 1), also works on employment discrimination issues.

        Also like the organizations in Table 1, the organizations in Table 3 are involved across-

the-board in impact litigation.   For instance, the Asian Pacific American Legal Center of

Southern California has “spearheaded several lawsuits which have had a strong impact in the

legal community,” and the Northwest Women’s Law Center “brings public impact cases

throughout the Northwest.”96      Some of these organizations may also do some individual

representation; for instance, The Public Justice Center seems to engage in some such activity.97

But other organizations on Table 3 appear to be limited to impact work in their representation

activities.98



ii.     Day-to-day representation in discrimination cases: The case of disability

        The “regional issue organizations” just discussed fit neatly into the dichotomy drawn in

this chapter between national issue organizations and legal services centers, since the regional

(Northwest Women’s Law Center) (describing services as a combination of “impact litigation”
and “self help” for individuals through information packets and a telephone hotline (but not legal
representation)).


                                                                                               44
organizations are so similar to the national issue organizations. Less easy to fit comfortably

within the dichotomy are the state centers across the country serving the needs of disabled

individuals, including disabled employees.99 These centers are funded by the government (at

least to a significant degree) and focus at least in significant part on day-to-day representation of

individual clients100–so in those respects they are like legal services centers–but their primary

focus in the employment area is, not surprisingly, discrimination101–so in that respect they are

like national (and regional) issue organizations.

       The example of disability centers, while important and interesting, does not disrupt in a

fundamental way the more general idea that for many types of discrimination claims, legal

representation on day-to-day matters seems likely to be severely limited. Lynn Kelly (1998:725)

notes that “there is almost no representation of low wage workers with discrimination claims.”

At the same time, the disability example similarly does not alter the suggestion above that legal

representation for impact work in relatively mundane areas of employment law such as

unemployment benefits is highly inadequate and incomplete.



Conclusion

       It bears emphasis that this chapter has not attempted to provide anything approaching a

comprehensive normative assessment of how a range of legal institutions should, in an ideal

world, function to enforce the employment laws. Projects of that broader and necessarily rather

speculative sort have been undertaken in other contexts; for instance, Susan Sturm (1993b) has

offered a broad set of recommendations for improving the enforcement of laws in another

context involving even more vulnerable beneficiaries–the prisoners’ rights context–and

Houseman (1995) has recently undertaken a similar project for legal advocacy for low-income

individuals in general. Joel Handler (1978b:283-84) offers some brief remarks on the question

of optimal institutional design in the specific context of employment discrimination law

(although not employment law generally), prescribing a broad division of roles among

government, private, and public interest actors. The emphasis of the present inquiry, by contrast,

has been on highlighting two central types of public-interest legal organizations involved in the

enforcement of the employment laws and on assessing some of their features and functions.

         This work also has not attempted to model in a comprehensive way the objective function

of public-interest legal organizations working in the employment law area. Previous work on

public-interest legal organizations in general (not specifically in the employment law area) has

catalogued various of the objectives they may pursue (Komesar and Weisbrod 1978:81-89, 96-

99). The discussion here has focused more specifically on a particular and apparently distorting

feature of the objective function of public-interest legal organizations working in the

employment law area–the emphasis on attracting and maintaining funding from either large

private donors, such as foundations, or the government. My conclusion about the apparently

distorting nature of funding of public-interest legal organizations in the employment law area

meshes with the more general conclusion reached by Neil Komesar and Burton Weisbrod

(1978:96-97) about funding-based distortions in public-interest legal organizations in a range of

areas.




                                                                                               46
       Future work might look at types of legal institutions other than those considered here–for

instance, pro bono models, law school clinical programs, social justice law firms, and client

nonprofits. As Louise Trubek (1998:805) notes, some large law firms have set up community

law offices as part of their pro bono efforts, and Lawrence Fox (1998:315) describes the

Litigation Assistance Partnership Project, an American Bar Association initiative that matches

legal services centers needing help on major cases with private law firms seeking pro bono work.

A broader inquiry into these additional types of institutions, and their potential role in enforcing

the employment laws, would also have to face the fundamental question of whether more

aggressive litigation of employment law claims would in the end help employees–a question

whose answer depends on the degree to which the courts are likely to rule in favor rather than

against employees’ claims.
