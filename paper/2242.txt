      Accounting for Racial Differences in School Attendance
    In the American South, 1900: The Role of Separate—But—Equal




                            ABSTRACT



     Everyone knows that public school officials in the American
South violated the Supreme Courts separate—but—equal decision.
But did the violations matter? Yes, enforcement of separate—but—
equal would have narrowed racial differences in school attendance
in the early twentieth century South. But separate—but—equal was

not enough. Black children still would have attended school less
often than white children because black parents were poorer and
less literate than white parents.

      In Plessy vs. Ferguson (189) the Supreme Court ruled that

 racially separate—but—equal public institutions, such as schools,
 were constitutional. Everyone knows that school officials in the
 American South violated the equal part of the ruling. Evidence
 linking the violations to educational outcomes, however, has been
 studied less often. An analysis of school attendance patterns in
 the South in 1900 shows that enforcement of separate—but—equal

would have raised the frequency of school attendance by black

children compared with white children. But poverty and high

rates of adult illiteracy ensured that black children still would
have attended school less often than white children even if

separate—but—equal had been enforced.


1. School Attendance in the American South, 1900



     In 1900 the 4 percent of southern children between the ages
of 5 and 20 who attended school went for an average of 89 days,

10 days longer than the average days attended by the 30 percent

of southern black children in school (U.S. Bureau of the Census,

1902a, pp. 352—383. Compounded over childhood the racial
differences in school attendance had predictable effects.   In

1910 24 percent of southern blacks between the ages of 15 and 24

wer illiterate, compared with    percent of southern whites (U.S.
Bureau of the Census, 1918, pp. 412—418.
    Why were racial differences in school attendance so large in

the South at the turn of the century? For W.E.B. Du Bois and
                                                                  2

Pugustus Dill (1911, p. 137; see also Ransom and Sutch, 1977, pp.
27—30) the answer was educational discrimination. School
officials in the South allocated fewer resources to black schools
than to white schools which, in turn, reduced the frequency of

school attendance among black children compared with white
children. Had the equal part of separate_but—equal been enforced
the quantity and quality of black schools would have been greater
and racial differences in school attendance smaller.
     How much smaller? Step one is to specify a model of school
attendance. My model is:


               =    +      + (LX,. +     +   fX1   +   e    [1]




The child is the unit of observation. A measures the frequency of
school attendance by the child, X,, is a vector of characteristics

of the childs parents, X is a vector of craracteriStiCS of the
child, X is a vector of public school characteristics, j is a
vector of geographic characteristics,
                                      the (s are coefficients,

 and e is an error term.
      Think of equation [1] as the outcome of a household utility

 maximization (see Goldin, 1979). Parents derive utility from the

 consumption of market goods and home production by household
 members and from their childreflS cooling. They allocate their
 childrenS time between schooling and other activities, such as
 work at home or in the market. How frequently a child attends
                                                      and the
 school depends on the characteristics of the parents
                                                                    3
 child; on the availability of schooling, quantity and quality;
 and on the returns to schooling compared with other uses of the

 child's time, which may vary with the household's location.    A
 househ3ld model is appropriate for the early twentieth century

 South. The economy was agricultural and children were productive
 workers. Most schooling was at an elementary level, completed
before the child left home. Southern legislators did not pass

compulsory schooling laws until after the turn of the century and
the laws were poorly enforced (Landes and Solmon, 1972).

     Step two is to estimate equation Cl]. The sample is 2,020
southern children between the ages of 5 and 1.. The data source
is the public use sample of the 1900 census. The dependent
variable is the number of months of school attended in the census

year. Because many children did not attend school the dependent
variable is censored at zero, and Tobit analysis is used.

     Sample means and standard deviations of the dependent and
independent variables are shown in Table i. On average, black

children attended 1.3 months of school, 1.1 months fewer than

white children. Although racial differences in child
characteristics were small, there were large racial differences

in the characteristics of parents, public schools, and household
location. Black parents were less literate than white parents,
and had lower incomes and wealth, as measured by the occupational
status of the household head and homeownership. Compared with

public schools for white children, the black schools were fewer
in number, school terms were shorter, class sizes larger, and
                                                                  4

teacher salaries lower. Black families were more likely to live

where cotton was the major crop, where plantation agriculture was
practiced (see below), or in or near an urban area.
     The tobit coefficients are shown in Table 2. Separate

equations were estimated for black and white children. Broadly

speaking, the result5 affirm the model described by equation [1].
     If a child's education were a normal good school attendance

should increase with parents' income and wealth. s noted above,
occupational status and homeownership are proxies for income and
wealth. Literacy and the ages of the parents control for human
capital characteristics associated with higher incomes and

wealth. Table 2 confirms the hypothesis for occupational status,
homeownershiP, literacy, and among white children, father's age.

slack children also attended school more frequently if their

mother was older. The age effect persists when mother's labor
force status is included (not shown), which suggests older black

mothers may have been more experienced at child rearing or more
aware of the economic benefits of educating their children.
     School attendance varied with the childs age.    The positive

coefficient on age reflects differences in the age of entering
school (typically between ages 6 and 9)." Most children had left

school by age 15 or 16, which explains the negative coeffiiant

on age squared. Unlike age, the child's gender had no
significant effect on school attendance.   The presence of a child

under age 5 in black families lowered school attendance among

older siblings, presumably by increasing parental demands on
                                                                the
                                                                      5
 siblings' home time.

      The school variables capture various aspects of the quantity

 and quality of public schools. School density——the number of
 schools per 1000 children——and the length of the school year are

 quantity variables. As school density rises the costs of getting
 to school fall and school attendance should rise. The longer

 schools are open the more months a child could attend. The

 teacher—pupil ratio and the average teacher salary measure the

 quality of schooling. As the number of teachers per pupil rises
 classrooms are less croqded. Average teacher salary is a proxy
 for the human capital of teachers: better trained teachers

recieved higher salaries (see Margo, 1984).     The coefficients of
all four school variables should be positive.

     The limitations of the school variables are numerous. The

variables are averages for the household's county of residence in
1900, so the effects of variations ,ithin counties are obscured.
The variables are measured incorrectly for households that moved

across county boundaries during the census year. The measure of
school density is a crude proxy in sparsely populated counties,
or where black and jhite families were residentially dispersed

instead of segregated.7 There are no direct measures of parent's
tastes for schooling in the regressions. Parents ho placed a

hiqh value on schooling may have moved Nhere schools were close
by and better in quality. The coefficients of the school
variables Nould be biased since the omitted "tastes" for

schooling would be correlated with the school variables.1
                                                                    6


    Given the criticisms it is reassuring that 7 of the 8

coefficients have correct signs.   School density is the

exception: its coefficient is negative in the black equation and
statisticallY insignificant for both races. Longer school terms

and smaller class sizes would have encouraged children of both
races to attend school more frequently, but the effect was larger

among blacks. Better—trained teachers also would have increased
attendance in the black schools.

     The geographic variables__Percentage of improved acreage in
cotton, whether the household lived where plantation agriculture
was practiced, and whether the household lived in or near an

urban area——capture variations in the returns to schooling
compared with other uses of the child's time.° School officials

believed that cotton and schooling didn't mix.    "tJhole families,"

                                              "are reared without
wrote a school superintendent from Georgia,
ever seeing the inside of a school. They are kept at work in the
cotton fields."t Cotton cultivation went hand—in—hand with
plantation agriculture, in which tenant farmers operated small

plots under the supervision of a single landlord (U.S. Bureau of
Census, l9l). ccordinq to Charles Johnson (1934, p. 129)
 'ElliteracY was not an asset in the plantation economy" and

 school attendance was discouraged. By contrast, the returns to
                                                            had
 schooling were higher in or near urban areas, and children
 fewer employment opportunities. n increase in cotton
 cultivation or residence in a plantation county did reduce school

 attendanCe, but the effects were statistically insignificant for
                                                                   7
 both races.' Urban children of both races, however did attend

 school significantly longer than rural children, but the effect
 was larger among blacks.



2. Separate—But—Equal and Racial Differences in School Attendance


     Evidently Du Bois and Dill were right: the characteristics
of public schools did affect black school attendance. Table 1

demonstrated there were significant racial differences in school
characteristics in the sample. How much smaller would racial
differences in school attendance have been if racial differences
in school characteristics were reduced to zero, that is, if
separate—but—equal had been enforced?

     The answer is in Table 3, which gives the percentages of the
mean racial difference in school attendance explained by mean

racial differences in the independent variables. The notes to
Table 3 describe the procedure for calculating the percentages.

The percentages in the column labelled Black Equation are based
on the black tobit coefficents and the percentages in the column
labelled White Equation on the white tobit coefficients.

     Racial differences in school characteristics account for 44
to 49 percent of the racial difference in months attended.

Clearly, had separate—but—equal been enforced black children
would have attended school more often. But black attendance still
would have been less than white attendance because of racial

differences in parents characteristics. Indeed, had black and
                                                                   8

white parents the same average characteristics the mean racial
difference in school attendance would have been cut by 63 to 72

percent, even without enforcement of separate—but—equal. Racial
differences in literacy alone explain 41 to 49 percent of the
racial difference in school attendance. Racial differences in

child and geographic characteristics were far less important,
however, accounting for 7 to 18 percent of the racial difference

in school attendance.
     Studies of racial differences in earnings show the returns

to schooling in the South were lower among blacks than whites for

most of the twentieth century (Smith and Welch, 1986). Were the
racial differences in returns to schooling solely a reflection of

racial discrimination fl   labor markets, black children would have
attended school less frequently than white children, other things

equal. The row labelled Total Explained, however, shows that
racial differences in the independent variables can explain all

of the racial difference in school attendance.   Race per se was

not hy black attendance was less than white attendance.
Whatever the reason for racial differences in the returns to
schooling, the differences were not an independent cause of the

racial differences in school attendance.'



3. Concluding Remarks


      I have examined one ay educational discriminatiOn in the
past affected educational outcomeS. Enforcement of the Supreme
                                                                   9
Court's separate—but--equal decision would have narrowed the

racial difference in school attendance in the South in 1900..    But
separate—but--equal as not enough. Black children still would
have attended school less often because their parents were poorer
and less literate than white parents.

     By 1930 racial differences in school attendance rates in the

South fell to 9 percentage points overall (see U.S. Bureau of the
Census, 1943). Why did the racial difference in school
attendance decline? Are changes in parent's characteristics or

household location responsible? Did the effects of seperate—but—
equal increase or decrease over time? An analysis of census data
from 1910 to 1930 using the framework developed here should help
answer the questions."

2. The 1900 census sample is a nationally representative sample
of the population of the United States in 1900. The sample is

made up of 27,609 households containing 100,438 individuals, or
approximately 1/760th of the u.s. population in 1900. The data

were originally collected by the Center for Studies in Demography

and Ecology, University of Washington, and were made available to
me by the Inter—University Consortium for Political and Social
Research, University of Michigan.

3.   In families headed by females the head's occupational status,

age and literacy are the mothers. Because occupational status
and homeownershiP are only proxies, the true effects of income
and wealth on school attendance (and the true racial differences
 in income and wealth) were undoubtedly larger.   If so, the

effects of separate_bUteqUal (see Table 3) are biased upwards.
4.   Months attended did not vary by age among children in school.
 Thus the significant age effect in the regressionS reflects
 variations in the ages of entering and leaving school.
                                                                   11

 5. The school variables are available for four states in 1900:

 North and South Carolina, Alabama, and Florida.    Observations
 from t',e states make up the sample. The per capita wealth of the
 county was also tried as a measure of school quality. The
 variable was always insignificant, however, and was excluded from
 the final runs.
 6.    Information on the variance in school characteristics within
 counties is not available for the sample from published sources.
 Data for Virginia in 1e90, however, suggest the variance across

 counties was much larger. For example, the variance within
counties of the length of the school year in black schools was a
third of the variance across counties (calculated from data in

Superintendent of Public Instruction, State of Virginia (1890)).
7. The number of children per square mile adjusts for the

sparsity of population. The variable was always insignificant,
however, and was excluded from the final runs.
8. That is, the school variables would be endogenous. Because the

coefficients of the school variables would be biased upwards the

effects of separate—but—equal (see Table 3) would be overstated.
Since the point is that separate—but—equal cannot explain all of
the racial difference in school attendance the conclusions are
the same.

9.    It is hard to believe that school density had no effect on

school attendance. Most southern children attended one—room
schools taught by a single teacher. Variations in the teacher—
pupil ratio (which has a positive and significant coefficient in
                                                                12


both equations) may capture the effects of school density in
addition to the effects of classroom crowding.
10. The geographic variables refer to the household's county of
residence in 1900. A family resides in or near an urban area if
its county of residence contains at least one urban place with

population greater than 10,000.
11. Quoted in Superintendent of Public Instruction, State of

Georgia (1907, p. 113).
12. If children aged 17—20 are added to the sample the
coefficients of the cotton share are significantly negative for

both races, which suggests the effects of cotton cultivation were
concentrated among older children.
13. Alternatively, labor market discrimination did make the
returns to schooling lower for blacks but black parents valued
their children's education more at the margin than white parents.

     A census sample for 1910 is under preparation at the

University of Pennsylvania. The manuscript censuses of 1920 and
1930 are not yet open to scholars, but will be in the future.

Predicted Racial Difference
months of schooling
at sample means = 0.96 months

To calculate the percentages I use the tobit coefficients to
predict for each race the number of months of school attended at
the race—specific sample means of the independent variables: m(b)
and m(), b=black, =hite. Next, I use the black coefficients
to predict the number of months a black child would attend at the
white sample means, m*(b), and the white coefficients to predict
the number of months a white child would attend at the black
sample means, m*w). The percent explained is either
(m*(b)—m(b)/(m(w)_m(b)) [the column labelled Black Equation] or
(m(w)—m*(w))/(m(w)—m(b)) [the column labelled White Equation].
The formula for the predictions is given in Madalla (1983, p.
159).
