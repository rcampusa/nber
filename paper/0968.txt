                    An Extended Accelerator Model of R&D
                          and Physical Investment



                                 ABSTRACT



      Using a multivariate autoregressive framework, we have found a simple

 causal structure for the variables of interest q, s, r, and i, which is

 consistent with our data. As expected from the stock market efficiency

hypothesis, q, the stock market one period holding rate of return, is

exogenous relative to the other three variables (or Granger causes them).

As postulated in the traditional accelerator model of investment, the rate

of growth of sales, s, can be also treated as exogenous to the rates of

growth of R&D and physical investment, r and i. Moreover, no strong feed-

back interaction is detected between the last two (r and 1).

     Within the simple structure of the extended accelerator model, the

substantive conclusion is that R&D and physical investment react very

similarly to the growth of the sales and to movements in q; the response

of R&D is, however, more stable or less irregular than that of physical

investment. Expected demand and expected profitability thus both appear to

be important determinants for R&D expenditures and physical investment.

I. INTRODUCTION


           The purpose of the present study is to investigate the determinants of

both R—D and physical investment using a panel of firm data, In a standard

neoclassical model of investment, the firm is assumed to choose an investment

plan so as to maximize the present discounted value of net cash flows subject to

the production technology, cost of adjustment function, initial capital stocks

and other appropriate constraints (or else to minimize the present discounted

total cost of production subject to the same constraints and an expected produc-

tion plan). In full generality, this involves considering non linear stochastic

control problems, and explicit solutions of the first order conditions are

intractable without very restrictive assumptions. Assumptions such as static

expectations about   prices,   a simple form of the production function, the

absence   of an explicit cost of adjustment function and the imposition of a given
la structure are usually made in order to derive the specification of the
investment function.
           In view of the complexities of a formal modellin of   investment deci-

sions, and also because of a lack of data on    factor prices at the firm   level, we

have   to settle for a looser approach in the spirit of data analysis as advocated

by Sims (1912, 1977, 1980; Sargent and Sims, 1911). A priori, expected dend

and profitability are important determinants for investment decisions. Bath are

unobservable. Following Fakes (this volume), we propose to use the stock

market one period holding rate of return, q, as an indicator of changes in

expectation about the firms future profitability. For expected demand, we have

used a more traditional distributed lag fornulation in the rate of growth of

sales s. These two variables plus the rates of growth of R—D and physical
                                      —




investment, r and i, are embedded in a multivariate autoregressive model. We
perform a series of exogeneity tests to investigate the appropriateness of

restrictea versions of this general model which are of interest. In particular,

we vindicate an extended form of the traditional accelerator model:   extended

both because it applied to R—D as well as to physical investment, and because it

takes expected profitability, and not only demand, as a major explanatory fac-

tor. Considerations on our model specification are developed in Section II,

while our results are presented in Section III.   We end with a few remarks.

II.      MODEL SPECIFICATION: STATISTICAL AND ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS


               We start from what we call our general model and derive our extended

accelerator model, discussing the meaning and specification of each equation in

turn.

1. A general model —            First   of all let us denote the four variables which our

study concentrates on by qt, ant, rnt, and tnt, where n and t represent finn

and year subscripts (n = 1 to N, t = 1 to T) respectively. To simplify matters

we shall suppress the firm subscript n in general and when convenient we shall

also represent by y             or      the column   vector   of our four variables, i.e.

     =
         (q,   s.c, r, ''

               t   is the stock market one period holding rate of return and is defined

as       =         — —i   +
                              d)/p,      where Pt is the price of a share at the end of year

t, and dt is the dividend per share paid during this year. q is thus equal to

the rate of change of the value of a one dollar share over the year plus the

corresponding dividend. st, rt and it denote the first difference between year

t and year (t—i) of the logaritl]ms of sales, R—D expenditures and gross invest-

ments respectively, and are thus approximately equal to their rate of change

from year to year: St = Log (S/St..), rt =                  Log(R/R...1),   it = Log   (It/It_i).1
               Given our focus on these four variables, we are interested in investi-

gating thoroughly their mutual dynamic interrelationships. Without pretending

too much a priori knowledge about these interrelations we start by assumin5

that they can be represented by an autoregressive model:


                          Ci)        =            +     +
                                         A(L)yt
                                                    —




where A(L) is a matrix of polynomials in the lag
                                                 operator (L),                     is a vector

of time specific effects or year dummies, and                    is a vector of disturbances
assumed      to be normally distributed, uncorrelated over time but correlated across
equations:            i.i.d.   N(0, ).         is   also called the vector of "innovations"

in the variables. We can write (1) more simply                  as:

                          (i')           =   A(L)       +



if we take care of the year effects At by measuring our variables relative to
their year means, as we shall assume from now on.2

              With an adequate number of lags, the autoregressive model is flexible

enough      to account well for the correlation structure of our variables and              sirmi—

late   their dynamic behavior. From a pure statistical standpoint, equivalent
formulations     can be obtained by      multiplying both sides of (i') by any non sine,u—
lar   (four by four) matrix
                                  B0. Among them, recursive formulations-may be of
practical interest: especially one that corresponds to the causal ordering we

are   going to hypothesize between our variables: i.e. causality running from q
to s, and from both q and s to r and i. This particular recursive forldulation
can be written as:

                         (i")      B0
                                             = B(L)         +
                                                                S.

where B(L) =          A(L) and     =
                 B0                     being a triangular matrix with 0 above
                                       B0 rL, B0
the diagonal and 1 in the diagonal and such that the transformed disturbances
       orthogonal (i.e. uncorrelated across equations). B0 is in fact uniquely
      are

determined; its inverse B' has the exact same lower triangular form with 1
on the diagonal and can be obtained from the appropriate Cholewski decoinpo—
sition   of   the original variance covariance          matrix a.     This can be written
                                                —5—



as       =   B1   , and amounts, in practice, to successive projections of the
original disturbances             which transform them into



                         it   =       n =a C.at + Ldt'
                                  It' 2t


              Among the many statistically equivalent foriulations, we endeavor to

give a specific structural economic meaninb to the pure autoregressive form (1),

and we refer to it, therefore, as our general model. All four equations of the

general model (q, s, r and i) can be interpreted and motivated by more or less

precise economic considerations, and we can test whether the restrictions

suggested by such considerations are compatible with our data.


2. Interpretation and Motivation

              We can justify our i—equation as an investment demand equation,

referring     directly to Malinvaud's recent book         on unemployment and profitability

(1980;   see also 1981). In this       book, Malinvaud studies the implications of     an
investment    model in which net investment depends on          expected capacity need and
expected profitability. While the influence of capacity needs corresponds to the

well known accelerator phenomenon and is supported by the bulk of the vast num-

ber of econometric studies of investment, he stresses the importance of profita-

bility as another major determinant. If we            assume the investment equation to be
log—linear    and take first differences we get:


                                            e             e
                                                      I



where i =                     i is the log change in desired net investment between
              Log(NI/NI
                                           —




periods (t—i) and t, s1 = Log(S 1/s) and                    =
                                                                Log(Q1/Q)     are the log

changes   or revisions of   capacity need and profitability between these same

periods   and as expected one period before.
              The revision in the expected profitability q1 is presumably due
to new information about the future which become available between (t—2) and
(t—i).    Such revisions should have direct bearing on the movements of stock pri-

ces during the same period, and hence will be reflected in the lagged values

       and       of our stock   market holding rate of'   return variable. We will

interpret,    therefore,        and k—2 as reasonable indicators of the unobservable
       in the investment equation.3

              In the absence of any direct inforiaation on expectations about capa-

city, the usual and simple procedure in most econometric studies is to treat

them as a function of past levels of output or sales. We can take, likewise,

the revision in the expected capacity need           as a distributed lag function of

past changes in sales 5tT' justifying thereby why lagged values                should

appear in the investment equation. ]bre generally we can consider s1 as a

forecast function depending not only on the past sf1, but also on the past

values of other relevant variables. Assuming rational expectations, the actual

change in sales s should     be itself   an unbiased "forecast't of the expected

       conditional on all the information available in period (t—l), and s1

should   only differ from s by an uncorrelated forecast error. In particular,
one would think that            being a forward looking variable, has a predictive

value for both s1 and s, and will, therefore, enter significantly in the

forecast function even in the presence of lagged                terms. Thus, one should
                                                            T

find   that    influences investment both directly and indirectly, via its
effect on expected sales.
              Finally, the change in the desired net investment variable        itself
 is also unobservable, and its relationship with the actual change in gross in-

 vestment must be specified. The various kinds of delays occuring between

 the decision and the execution of investment plans, as well as an approximate

 proportionality of retirements to past investments, suggest reasons why laiged

 investment terms should also appear in the investment equation.

              In sum, starting from Malinvaud's theoretical equation and taking

 into account all the necessary transformations for its einpirical implementation,

 we get to an equation which is very close to the investment equation of our

 general model. Clearly, such a tentative and informal derivation involves many

problematic assumptions and issues. Be that as it may, our investment equation

consists of two main factors: scale and
                                             intensity, as indicated by sales and

stock market profitability respectively, and allows for a quite flexible lag

structure. The standard objection one could raise is that more explanatory

variables should have been included, mainly the relative cost of labor and capi-

tal and the financial liquidity of the firm.      It is difficult though to get

relevant information about factor prices at the firm level; it is also plausible

that they tend to move roughly parallel for all firms, and that will be taken

care of by the year dummies in the equation. As for financial liquidity of the

firm, it could   be gauged by the importance of past profits, and it   may be
worthwhile   to consider   this possibility in further research.

             The r equation can be justified along the same lines as the i

equation and interpreted in terms of an R—D demand equation. One of our basic

topics of interest is to assess whether R—D and physical investment behave more

or less similarly.
                                           —B—



             From what we have already said the s or sales equation can be

understood as a forecast fuxiction purjxrting to account for the expectations of
firiis about their future sales. It seems plausible, however, that these expec-
tations might also depend on other variables besides the ones already included
in the equation.
             The q or stock market holding rate of return equation has little eco—

nomic justification. For the sake of symmetry with the s—equation it could be

viewed also as a forecast function of expectations on cit.          However, it is

usually admitted that t cannot be predicted by its own past values or that of

any other variable. This property is known as Fama's semi—strong test of stock

market efficiency (Fama 19T0, 19T6). Conditional on the information available

at the beginning of period t, the expected value of            should, by standard

arbitrage argument, equal the prevailing market rate of interest. In other

words, a trading rule based on public information alone would not allow traders

to achieve any excess return on average.


3. An extended accelerator model — The considerations we have just developed

suggest a causal ordering of the variables and specific restrictions on the

equations.

             We have touched on the issue of stock market efficiency. The

hypothesis of stock market efficiency simplifies our general model importantly,

the q—equation reducing itself to      =
                                           Tt    =
                                                     1+). In   other words, q is exoge-
nous relatively to the other variables or s, r and        do not cause q in the sense

of Granger (Pierce and Haugh, 1977 and 1979; Granger, 1980). Such

a hypothesis has been generally accepted in empirical work, but rather than

taking it for granted, it seems   better   to test it also on our data.
                                              —9—




              Our   central   interest, however, is in the appropriateness of the tra-

 ditional formulation of the accelerator model. This formulation postulates that

 sales or expected sales are exogenous relative to investment, thus ruling out

 feed—back effects from investment to sales. This is a major assumption since

without    it, not only the usual esti.mates of the so—called accelerator effect
might be biased, but the whole notion itself might not be very meaningful.
Within our general model, the accelerator assumption requires that i, as well as
r by    analogy, does not appear in the s—equation and is directly testable.

Besides the questions of stock market efficiency and appropriateness of the

accelerator assumption, we have also considered two other issues of lesser

sIgnificance. The first concerns the interrelations of physical and R—D invest-

ment. There seems to be no reason why physical investment should        influence   R—D
investment   per    se. One might   expect,   that the converse would not be
                                              however,

true. A successful R—D program would lead to product or process innovations,
which   could result in turn in new programs of investment. There is,
                                                                           however,
little evidence     in our data of such a causal ordering from R—D to investment.

While we do not find any- signi'icant influence of pasti on r, the influence of

past r on I is not significant either, and at best appears to be rather weak.

             The second   issue relates to the existence of contemporaneous
reciprocal influences,     or "instantaneou causality", between our variables. In

our general model (i), this amounts to testing the diagonality of the variance—

covariance matrix E (i.e. no correlation across equations arong the disturbances


        while in the transformed recursive formulation (1"), it becons the

test of the restriction that the contemporaneous value of a variable does not

enter as a regressor (i.e. B0 is an identity matrix or else fl. ).
                                                                              A
                                                —10—




year   being a long      enough period for interactions between variables to develop,
one would expect instantaneous causality to occur and hence the diaoziality re-

striction to be strongly rejected. This is indeed what              happens.   Another explan-

ation why the disturbances in our            model may be correlated across equations is of

course the omission of relevant (common or correlated) variables. One would

thus expect the disturbances in the investment and R—D equations                   and r)
to be   correlated   with each other, and also with the disturbance in the sales

equation (r). Indeed, this last disturbance can proxy for variables

influencing sales expectations but actually omitted from our forecast equation;

as such it should enter in both the investnrit and the R—D equation, accounting

partly for the correlation of their disturbances. The structure of the distur-




                              ,
bances and their correlations is clearly revealed by the appropriate Cholewski

decomposition        =   B'        as previously indicated.

            We can focus our interest primarily on two restricted versions of the

general model: the first one assuming only stock market efficiency, and the

second one assuming also the appropriateness of the accelerator formulation.

We call the latter restricted model the accelerator model or the extended

accelerator model since it         extends   the traditional investment accelerator to

research   and developnent expenditures, and also because it tries, through the use
of the q variable, to incorporate expected profitability as an important deter-
minant of   investment and R—D. Since interactions between investment and R—D do

not appear to be significant, we generally consider the extended accelerator

model without them —       but   this need not be so   in   principle.

 4.    Moving average representation and multipliers

              Changing slightly our notation but still measuring variables relati-

 vely to their year means, the extended accelerator model can be written:


                            =
                                flIt
                      St =      (L)            +   cx(L)    +
 (2)
                            = 4>(L)            + 1(L)       + 0(L) r1 +
                            =   *(L)           + ó(L) s1 + 1.(L)   i1 +
where   the   are mutually correlated across equations (but uncorrelated over
time). The causal structure of the model is simple and can be illustrated by
the path diagram in figure 1. Changes in q induce variations in s, r and i and
changes in s move r and i, but there is no feed—back from r and to s, and from

5 to q; there is also no interaction between r and i.               As we already stated, in

view of this specific structure, there is one appropriate and economically

meaningful decomposition of the correlated fl in terms of uncorrelated

Renaming these                                                  we can write
                      u, Vt and w (instead of ),

                                                   —12—




      or   an innovation in q, can thus be interpreted as a shift in the firm's

future profitability as expected by the traders on the stock market. We shall

call such a shock an expected profitability shock, or q—shock, and the dynamic
responses of our variables to it the q—effects or q—multipliers. Similarly,
a change or a "shock" in u, or an independent innovation in s, can be viewed
as   a shift in the expectation of the rate of               growth of sales, and we shall speak

of a demand—shock, or s—shock, and of the s—effects on s—multipliers. It is of

some interest to separate in the (total) q or s—effects the own effects and the

additional or cross—effects. The own effects are computed in the absence of

instantaneous causality (i.e. a=b=c=d=e=f=O or                         they result directly
from the initial change in q or s corresponding to a shock in c. or u,, as if

there was no other immediate impact of such shocks.5

                 In order to illustrate the q and s—multipliers and how a shock in

or u actually affects the movuents of our variables, we can consider a

simplified version of the accelerator model in which we keep only one lagged

variable (i.e. a first order autoregressive model), ignore the correlations of

the disturbances across equations (i.e.                   is diagonal) and drop the i—equation

(since i and r behave in the same way). It is enough to consider:


                               =
                                   Ct

The response pattern of our variables is described completely by this moving

                                        k
one period—one unit shock in C. Thus,       w is the cumulative effect on r
                                                            1=1
over a period of k years due to this shock, that is the proportional change in

the level of R—D after k years. It appears that a shock induces decaying fluc-

tuations in growth rates and puts the levels on higher growth paths.

Essentially, the effects on growth rates are transitory, while the changes in

levels are permanent.

             The long run effects of a one period—one unit in C or u on the levels

of sales and R—D can be easily computed and are given in table 1. A one percent

increase in u will induce sales and R—D to increase respectively by
     I
         = 11(1—a) and
11                                T=         y/(l—O)(1—a).        The ratio of these two effects:

y/(i—O) is the elasticity of R—D with respect to sales, and thus can be called

the long run accelerator effect or niultiplier. The long run elasticity of R—D

with respect to q is                   =     /(l—e)    + y/(l—O)(l—a). This expression
indicates clearly that q can affect R—D both directly and indirectly through
its impact on sales: the direct effect being /(1—0) and the indirect effect
being   the product of the impact of q on sales /(i—cx) and the long run accelera-

tor y/(l—O).



III. — EMPIRICAL RESULTS


1. Tests and estimates

             The empirical implementation of our study is based on a sample of 93

firms with data from 1962 to 1977. This sample derives from the Griliches and

Mairesse (this volume) restricted sample of 103 firms with no major merger

problems. We had to discard 10 firms   because   of the lack of all of the

necessary information to construct the variable. Although our sample may         seen
small in terms of number of firms and cannot be taken as representative of the

corporate sector in any definite sense, it is, in fact, of aboit the largest

size possible for R—D doing firms over a sufficiently long period (at least 10

good years for our type of time—series cross—section analysis).

            The sample means and standard deviations of our variables over the

twelve years 1966—1977, as well as the standard deviations of our variables

measured relative to their year means, are the following:


            q =    .i0!i     s = .062         r=      .025      i=     .036

As could be expected the stock market rate of return is extremely variable. So

is physical investment; it is not rare that for a firm physical investment
                                          —15-.



doubles (or goes down by half) from one year to the other. Note that R-D expen-

ditures are also quite variable, though much less so than is true for physical

investment.

             We have estimated all our models by Zeilner's seemingly unrelated

regression least squares method (based on the variance—covariance matrix

  estimated once and for all for the general model case). The parameters
estimates of the general model, the extended accelerator      model and also its

simplified    first order autoregressive version   are given in tables   2 and 3,   while

all   the different test results are brought together in table 4•

              The general model uses four lagged values of each of the four

variables and is therefore estimated over the twelve years period 1966—1917,

including also twelve year dummies. We have experimented some with shorter

lags, but four lags    seemed to   be necessary to capture the dynamic behavior of

our variables adequately. We have also checked for the possibility of serial

correlation of the disturbances. It is apparently negligible, the first and

second order autocorrelation coefficients of the residuals fl in each equa-

tion being rather small uniformly (—.01 and —.06 for the q—equation residuals,

respectively; —.02 and —.03 for the s—equation residuals; —.03 and —.01 for the

r—equation residuals, and —.01 and —.01 for the i—equation residuals).

             On the contrary, the contemporaneous correlations of the residuals

      across equations are rather high (.19, .01, and .01 between the q equation

and the s, r and i equations residuals respectively; .18 and .26 between the s

equation and the r and i equations residuals; .18 between the r and         equations

residuals). The test of diagonality is indeed strongly rejected. Using the

Cholewski decomposition we can write:
                                          —16--

                                                   Ct, Ut, Vt and w., being .358,

.101, .1914 and .380, respectively. It appears from these estimates that u,

the independent innovation in s, has an immediate and strong impact on and a

more moderate one on r, while the immediate effect of C, the innovation in q, is

quite weak. Note also that the independent innovation in r has a sizeable

effect on i as well.

           Considering the estimated equations of the general model in turn, it

is clear that all the implications suggested by the economic interpretation are

by and large supported. All the coefficients of the q—equation (i.e. the i6

coefficients of the lagged values of q, s, r and i except for the time dummies)

are insignificant and even taken together the hypothesis of their joint nullity

cannot be rejected at the 5% significance level. This is another confirmation

of the unpredictability of q from past information and thus also of the hypothe-

sis of stock market efficiency.

           All   eight coefficients of the lagged r and i       terms are insignificant

in the s equation. Assuming stock market efficiency their joint nullity

(together with that of the coefficient of q2, q3 and q14 which are also indi-

vidually insignificant) cannot be rejected at a 5% level of significance. We
                                             —17—




 can accept thus the hypothesis that s and q are exogenous relatively to r and i,

 that   the   accelerator model is a reasonable specification, even though at first

it appeared to be a rather strong simplification.6

               In the r equation, the four lagged i terms and likewise the four

lagged r terms in the i equation are all insignificant, except for the coef-

ficient of r1 on i which is on the verge of individual significance at the 5%

significance level. As a group, they are insignificant at the 5% significance

level. We can accept the absence of interactions between r and i, other than

instantaneous, and hence the accelerator model without such interactions. On

the other hand, the hypothesis (considered by way of illustration) that the

accelerator is first order autoregressive is strongly rejected.


2. Dynamic and long—run multipliers

               The   implications of   our results are best described by the dynamic

responses of our variables to the different shocks and the q and s—effects or
multipliers. All long—run multipliers are given in table 5, while the q and s
dynamic    multipliers are represented in figures 2 to 5.      We   shall comment on then
in turn.
           The eight matrices in table 5 consist of the own and total effects
estimated in case of the general model with and without stock market efficiency,
the extended accelerator model (without r and i interactions)         and also the first
order   autoregressive accelerator version. We have not endeavoured to compute

the standard deviations of these coefficients.7         However, the comparison of

their values for the four different specifications gives us a feeling for their

precision. As we have seen the general         model with market efficiency and the
                                           —1 b—




extended accelerator are not statistically different at the 5% significance

level;    indeed all the estimated effects for these two models are very close.
The general model without market efficiency differs mainly from that with market
efficiency by the estimated effect of s (or u) on q; however, this effect should
not be statistically significant, corresponding mainly to the large insignifi-
cant coefficient of S1 in the q—equation (see table 2). The largest discrepan-
cies   between the extended accelerator model and its     first order autoregressive
version    occurs in the estimated effects of s (or u) on r and i (and also of i

(or w) on itself); these discrepancies are probably significant since they

correspond    to the significant coefficients of s, and s in the r and i
equations (and also of      2'     and i
                                       in the i equation).
          The comparison of the own and total effects shows the importance of
the contemporaneous influences of q and s on r and i (i.e. the importance of
instantaneous causality). This was already clear from the Cholewski decom-
position    given above, showing the correlation structure of the innovations in

our   variables. Consider the one very striking case: the long run impact of a
one percent s or u shock on the level of physical investment would amount only
to .35 percent, instead of about .85, if the contemporaneous dependence between

s and i were eliminated.

             The four figures 2 to 5 consist each of three graphs, depicting the

yearly q or s (total) effects on the three rates of growth s, r, and i, or on

the three percentage changes in levels AS/s,       R/R, Al/i (these effects being
estimated   for the extended accelerator model). The responses of s and r to the

q or s shocks are similar enough, damping down rapidly with most of the effects

dissipated in three years. The investment growth rate i reacts more strongly
                                          —19—




 and irregularly. In response to a one percent q—shock, it goes up to about .15
 in the first year and down to .10 and —.05 in the second and third years, then
 cycles down quickly to zero. In response to a one percent s shock, after an
 immediate impact of about 1, it plunges to 0 and —.25 in the first and second
 years, then cycles back quickly to zero. In coherence with these patterns of
 response,   the levels of sales and R—D expenditures increase steadily toward

 their   new long run values while investment starts by overshooting its own, all

 cumulated   effects being practically completed in five years.
              The long run (total) effects of a one percent
                                                            q shock on sales, R—D
and investment levels are respectively about .15,      .20   and .30. These elastici-
ties appear   to be rather small; however, gauged in terms of the standard
deviations   of the corresponding rates of growth, they      are   quite sizeable. A one
standard deviation q shock induces changes in the levels of sales, R—D and

investment of about .55,   .I0   and .25 of their respective standard deviations.

             The absolute long run effects of a one percent s shock are much

larger than those of a one percent q shock, moving the levels of sales, R—D and

investment by about l., .95 and .85, respectively. Yet, measured in units of

standard deviations, s shocks are not more effective than q shocks in driving

R—D and physical investments; the changes induced by the formers being about

.50 and .20 to be compared to .!0 and .25    for   the latter. In this regard it

should be noted that only 30 percent of the q effect on R—D and 55 percent of

the q effect on investment relies on the direct influence of q, the remaining

effect resulting from the impact of q on s. This remark shows that         in con-
sidering an R—D or an investment equation in
                                                 isolation, one might be led to a

serious underestimate of the significance of the q variable.
                                      —20—




           For comparison with the results of other investment studies, it is

interesting to translate the long run s effects into the usual accelerator

elasticities (A[/I)J(ts/s) or (/R)/(L$/S): they are about .7 H.85/1.Lt) and

.6 (-'.85/1.I) for physical investment and R—D respectively. The latter estimate

.6 accords well with the elasticity of R—D capital stock reported to be around

.5 to .8 by Nadiri and Bitros (1980) in the only other study investigating

investment and R—D demand jointly. The former estimate of .7 is, however, lower

than their estimated elasticity of arcind 1. for physical capital stock. A

unitaryelasticity is implied by the standard Jorgensonian factor demand frame-
work (i.e., the inverse of the returns to scale in the production function,
which presumably are not very far from being constant), and is in fact found in

many econometric studies (for example, Jorgenson and Stephenson, 1967;

Jorgenson, 1911). Because of the various differences in specification, it is

difficult to pinpoint the actual reasons for our relatively low   accelerator
estimate. It probably arises from our rate of growth formulation. Using a

similar formulation, Eisner found an even lower estimate of about •)4   (Eisner,
1918; see also Oudiz, 1978).8 Eisner's explanation which is similar to

Friedman's permanent income hypothesis, may also be applicable to our results.

In our specification of the accelerator model, the q and s shocks are assumed to

be free from errors or contamination by any noise. In reality, the fluctuations

in q and s have large transitory components, which will have presumably little

impact on i and r. Our estimates of the accelerator elasticity and, more

generally., of the q and s effects might be larger, if we could disentangle the

transitory variations from the permanent changes in q and s.

 IV — FINAL REMARKS


             Using a multjvariate autoregressive framework, we have found a simple

 causal structure for the variables of interest q, s, r, and i, which is con—

 sistent with our data. As expected from the stock
                                                         market efficiency hypothesis,

 q, the stock market one period holding rate of return is exogenous relatively to

 the other three variables (or Granger causes them).       As postulated in the tradi-
 tional accelerator model of investment, the rate of growth of sales, s, can be

 also treated as exogenous to the rates of growth of R—D and pkysical investment,

 r and i.
               Moreover, no strong feedback interaction is detected between the last
two   (r   and i).

              Within    the simple structure of the extended accelerator model, the
substantive conclusion is that R—D and physical       investment react very   similarly
to   the growth of sales and to movements in q; the response of R—D is however

more stable or less irregular than that of physical investment. Expected demand

and expected profitability thus appear to be both important determinants for R-D

expenditures and physical investment.

              It would be important to check our findings against other bodies of

data. Also, our study could be improved by incorporating other variables of

interest (see Ben—Zion; this volume). In further work, it would be particularly

interesting to go deeper in two directions:

              1.     The multivariate autoregressive setup proved to be useful and

convenient for studying the dynamic relationships between variables.
                                                                              However,
a more elaborate specification might help to filter out the permanent from the

transitory components of the variables. This       issue is related to our choice of
growth rates formulation, which has many advantages but also tends to magnify
the relative importance of transitory components or errors in the variables.

           2.   The fact that past q's, though probably error ridden, are signifi-

cantly correlated with s, r and   confirms that movements in stock prices carry

valuable expectational information about future profitability. This interpre-

tation of the q variables should be substantiated, however, more rigorously and

its relation to Tobints QTt clarified. MDre generally, the extended accelerator

model should be grounded more firmly in theory and provided with a more definite

behavioral interpretation.

 1.     In the empirical implementation,         is adjusted for stock splits when they

 occur. Sales are deflated using industry price indices; R—D and investment

 expenditures are also deflated by an overall price index. There is the possibi-

 lity of some mismatch in timing between
                                                 5r     and i which are based on the
 companies' fiscal year, and           which is based on calendar year. From previous

work, we know that fiscal and calendar years do not coincide for a large enough

proportion of firms; an attempt to correct for this probln had, however, very

little impact on our results. We preferred not to make any such correction in

the present study.

2. Our adoption of a formulation in terms of rates of growth of the variables

or log differences results from a number of considerations. Using first dif-

ferences is usually advised in the time—series literature in order to get more

stationary processes (Granger and Newbold, 1978). Actually, when we tried to

estimate the autoregressive model in the levels of variables, the results

suggested a first difference formulation (some of the roots of the character-

istic equation associated with the model being close to one in absolue values).

Going to first differences is also a simple way to avoid dealing with firm

specific effects, while the formulation in terms of levels raises the well

known   difficulties of estimating       a dynamic model with such effects (Balestra and

Nerlove, 1966). First differences have, however, the drawback of magnifying the
problems of errors in the variables (augnnting the ratio of error to true
variance).

3.    The   usefulness of   stock   market valuation as an indicator of expectations
about future profitabilty       in an investment function can be traced back to
                                               —34—



Grunfeld (1960), and more recently to the literature on "Tobin's Q"                      (Tobin
1971). Our q variable will be equal to the percentage change in Tobin's

Q    variable,       if debts are proportional to equity and there is no change in the

replacement value of the firm. Actually, the correlation between our q

variable and the change in Tobin's Q           variable,    as computed otherwise, is quite

high in our sample. Our          study   is thus related to the studies investigating

Tobin's Q       as   a determinant of investment.       See, for example, Engle and PDley

(1975), Von Fustenberg (1977) and Summers              (1980)   among others.

 .        Doubts have been recently expressed about the efficiency of stock markets.

Schiller (1981) pointed out that the actual stock prices fluctuate too much to

reconcile with the stable and smooth series of the present value of subsequent

real dividends. See also F4alinvaud (1981) and Summers (1982).

5.        The formulations (1') and (1") of the general model can be also written:
      =
          P(L)U,
                   and y =
                             T(L),   P(L) and T(L) being respectively the matrix of the

own and total effects with: P(L) =           (I   —   A(L)L)    =   (I   —   B1B(L)L)'
and T(L) =
                P(L)B.
6.     The fact that we cannot reject both exogeneity tests of q (stock market

efficiency) and of s (accelerator model) is all the more meaningful as our

sample      has a large number of observations (see, for example, Learner 1978, Chapter
1).
7.     The total and own      effects are highly nonlinear and complicated expressions

of the      estimated parameters, making     the derivation of their standard deviations

a    problematic task (see footnote 5).
8. To be precise, Eisner's dependent variable is the deviation from the firm
mean of the investment—capital ratio, or the rate of growth of the capital stock

plus its rate of depreciation.
