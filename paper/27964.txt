How Did Depositors Respond to COVID-19?

                                          ABSTRACT

Why did banks experience massive deposit inflows during the first months of the pandemic?
Using weekly branch-level data on interest rates and county-level data on COVID-19 cases, we
discover that interest rates at bank branches in counties with higher COVID-19 infection rates fell
by more than rates at other branches—even branches of the same bank in different counties.
When differentiating weeks by the degree of stock market distress and counties by the likely
impact of COVID-19 cases on economic anxiety, the evidence suggests that the deposit inflows
were triggered by a surge in the supply of precautionary savings.

1. Introduction
U.S. banks experienced massive deposit inflows during the first months of the COVID-19
pandemic. At a national level, total deposits increased from $13 trillion in January to $15

trillion in April of 2020 (see Figure 1). At a local level, banks branches in counties with
higher COVID-19 infection rates, as measured by cases per capita, experienced more rapid
deposit growth rates (see Figure 2). Furthermore, average saving rates surged over this
period, with monthly personal savings as a percentage of personal income rising from about
eight percent in January and February to over 30% in April (Figure 3). While it is clear that
deposits and savings increased, it is unclear what drove these developments.
       There are at least four distinct, though not mutually exclusive, views of why deposits

surged during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic. First, the precautionary savings
view suggests that as the pandemic deepened concerns about economic disruptions and
layoffs (e.g., Acharya and Steffen 2020), households boosted savings as a precaution against
declines in future income, and some of those additional savings flowed into bank deposits

(e.g., Browning and Lusardi 1996). This view also offers cross-county predictions about the
relation between COVID-19 and both bank deposits and deposit interest rates. Given well-
documented differences in COVID-19 infection rates across U.S. counties and assuming that
these differences translate into cross-county differences in concerns about future income, the

precautionary savings view suggests a positive relation between COVID-19 cases and bank
deposits at the county level. Furthermore, the COVID-19 driven increase in local deposits
will reduce local deposit interest rates, as long as there is some segmentation of banking
markets. Although past research provides mixed evidence on the importance of precautionary
savings (e.g., Dynan 1993; Starr-McCluer 1996; Carroll and Samwick 1998; Engen and
Gruber 2001, Agarwal and Qian 2014; D’Acunto et al. 2020), we make an initial effort to
evaluate the precautionary savings view in the context of a pandemic such as the COVID-19
using granular and high frequency data.
       Second, the “flight-to-safety” view stresses that adverse financial market shocks
induce people to flee from risky investments and into the safety of bank deposits (e.g.,
Bernanke Gertler, and Gilchrist 1996; Kashyap, Rajan, and Stein 2002; Gatev and Strahan
                                                                                                2



2006; Cornett et al. 2011), while stock market booms are associated with a reduction in
households’ demand for deposits (Lin 2019). When applied to the COVID-19 pandemic, this
flight-to-safety view suggests that COVID-19 triggered financial market panic that prompted

investors to allocate more of their savings to deposits. The COVID-19 crisis, however, is
qualitatively different from the crises underlying past flight-to-safety studies, because the
COVID-19 crisis did not originate as a shock to the financial sector. Thus, past research on
the flight-to-safety view may not apply to the COVID-19 crisis. It is also valuable to note that
the flight-to-safety view does not offer clear predictions about the cross-county intensity with
which individuals reallocate their savings out of risky financial markets and into the safety of
bank deposits. Specifically, although the view asserts that increases in the riskiness of

national capital markets induce a generalized flight into deposits, the flight-to-safety view
does not necessarily predict that this flow out of capital markets and into deposits will be
greater in counties with higher COVID-19 infection rates.
       A third view stresses that COVID-19 may have induced an increase in the demand for

deposits. If businesses drawdown their lines of credit with banks in response to the economic
disruptions triggered by the pandemic, then banks may increase rates to attract deposits in
order to satisfy those drawdowns. Consistent with this demand-side effect, Acharya and Mora
(2015) find that banks facing greater liquidity risks during the 2007-2009 financial crisis

offered higher deposit interest rates. From this perspective, the pandemic-induced surge in
bank deposits is driven by a demand shock, not a shock to the supply of deposits. One
strategy for evaluating the comparative roles of demand and supply shocks is to examine
prices, i.e., to examine how the pandemic influenced deposit interest rates.
       A fourth explanation notes that expansionary monetary and fiscal policies could have
triggered the flow into deposits (e.g. Agarwal et al., 2020). From this perspective, the Federal
Reserve’s asset purchases and lending programs and the Federal government’s spending
programs may have induced deposits to swell. The massive increase in deposits, therefore,
might have more to do with national policies than with actions driven by a flight-to-safety,
precautionary savings, or banks’ demand-for-deposits.
                                                                                                   3



       In this paper, we primarily use weekly branch-level data on deposit interest rates and
county-level data on COVID-19 cases to evaluate why deposits surged during the first
months of the COVID-19 pandemic. For each bank branch, we use weekly data on interest

rates on CDs (certificates of deposit). For each county, we use the logarithm of the number of
confirmed COVID-19 cases per one million people on the Friday of each week. Our primary
sample includes 287,262 branch-week observations over the period from January through
April of 2019 and 2020, involving 9,847 branches.
       We examine deposit interest rates to help distinguish between views stressing supply-
or demand-side shocks. The flight-to-safety, precautionary savings, and expansionary policy
views stress that COVID-19 triggered a surge in the supply of deposits, implying a drop in

deposit interest rates. In contrast, the demand-for-deposits view predicts that rates will rise as
banks seek to attract funds to satisfy borrowers drawing down their credit lines. By
examining deposit rates, we provide evidence on which effect dominates.
       In our baseline analyses, we regress deposit interest rates at the branch-county-week

level on the county’s COVID-19 infection rate in the previous week. The analyses include (1)
branch fixed effects to help account for any time-invariant, branch-specific factors, (2) state-
by-week fixed effects to control for all time-varying national and state-specific
considerations, such national financial market fluctuations, national policies, as well as state-

level economic conditions, policies, and demographics, and (3) bank-by-week fixed effects to
control for time-varying bank characteristics that might be simultaneously correlated with
COVID-19 infection and deposit interest rates, so that we can focus on differences in interest
rates across a bank’s branches in different counties.
       We discover that deposit rates at bank branches in counties with higher COVID-19
infection rates fall by more than branches—even branches of the same bank—in otherwise
similar counties. The drop in deposit rates following increases in county-level COVID-19
infection rates suggests that shocks to the supply of deposits dominate any increase in banks’
demands for deposits, which is consistent with the three supply side views of how the
pandemic influenced bank deposits. With respect to the economize size of the impact, the
coefficient estimates suggest that a one standard deviation increase in Ln(Cases per capita) is
                                                                                                   4



associated with an average decline in deposit rates equal to 3.5% of the standard deviation of
deposit interest rates when conducting the estimation over the full sample period and 13.6%
of the standard deviation of deposit interest rates when focusing on the early weeks of the

pandemic, which is before implementation of policies that muted the impact of local COVID-
19 cases on deposit interest rates.
       The baseline analyses also suggest that an increase in precautionary savings plays a
material, independent role in driving the surge in deposits and the drop in deposits rates. In
particular, the granular, high-frequency nature of the data and the extensive array of fixed
effects mean that our analyses largely control for a flight-to-safety and national policies do
not fully account for these developments. First, while the precautionary saving view suggests

that local COVID-19 conditions will affect local anxiety about the economy and hence
influence local savings and deposits, the flight-to-safety view does not necessarily suggest
that the flight out of national capital markets and into banks deposits will be greater in
counties with higher COVID-19 infection rates. Thus, by examining how weekly deposit

rates at local branches change with local COVID-19 cases while including state-week and
bank-week fixed effects, we largely abstract from the flight-to-safety effect. Second, our
empirical strategy also controls for national policies by including state-time and bank-time
fixed effects. Third, to assess whether the relation between deposit rates and local COVID-19

cases varies across different policy regimes, we show that the results are robust across
different sample periods, including (a) before major policy reactions to the crisis, such as the
CARES Act and the large payments associated with the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP)
and (b) during different periods of the Federal Reserve response. In these ways, we abstract
from the impact of national policies on deposits and focus on how a county’s exposure to
COVID-19 cases shapes deposit interest rates.
       We next conduct a series of tests of whether deposit interest rates fall by more in
response to increases in COVID-19 infection rates in weeks and counties in which people are
likely to be more sensitive to adverse news concerning their economic futures. One factor
that could increase people’s sensitivity to news about local COVID-19 cases is the overall
degree of financial system fragility. In particular, stock market volatility or declining values
                                                                                                       5



could create a situation in which an increase in local COVID-19 cases makes people more
concerned about the local economy and their economic futures than the same news in better-
performing markets. In this way, the anxiety-enhancing effects of national capital market

fragility could influence the precautionary savings response to local COVID-19 cases. To
evaluate this possibility, we assess whether the relation between deposit interest rates and
COVID-19 cases is greater when (a) the stock market is more volatile and (b) the market is
performing poorly. This is what we find. The rate-reducing effects are stronger when the
stock market is more volatile and when market returns are lower. The results on volatility and
stock returns are consistent with the view that (a) local COVID-19 cases create concerns
about future income and (b) national financial market fragility magnifies the impact of those

COVID-19 cases on the fears that residents have about the economy, generating a bigger
surge in precautionary savings.
        We then explore three additional implications of the precautionary savings view of
how COVID-19 influences deposit interest rates by testing whether deposit interest rates fall

by more in response to increases in COVID-19 infection rates in counties likely to be more
sensitive to such news. First, news stories and academic research suggests that people aligned
with the Democrat Party have responded with greater concern to the COVID-19 pandemic
than those aligned with Republican Party. For example, according to an Axios poll in early

March, 62% of Republicans believe that the COVID-19 threat is exaggerated, whereas just
31% of Democrats responded similarly. 1 Several recent studies (e.g., Allcott et al 2020;
Grossman et al 2020) show significant differences in attitudes and responses towards
COVID-19 between residents in Republican leaning counties and those of Democratic
counties. Although researchers and commentators provide different explanations for these
cross-party differences, we exploit these observations to evaluate an implication for our
study: If local COVID-19 cases trigger more concern about future economic conditions in
democratic-leaning counties, then the impact of local COVID-19 cases on deposits should be
greater in more democratic-leaning counties. Consistent with this view, we discover that the

coronavirus-threat-is-exaggerated-new-survey-finds-2020-03-10.
                                                                                                  6



rate-reducing effects of COVID-19 are stronger in counties that align more with the
Democratic Party. In particular, the deposit interest rates drops more (a) among counties with
a comparatively lower share of votes for Donald Trump in the 2016 election, and (b) among

counties in states with a Democratic governor.
        Second, if pandemic-generated fear helps drive the reduction in deposit rates, then
this effect should be larger in counties with more “COVID-19 sensitive” demographic
groups, i.e., where people become more fearful in response to local COVID-19 cases. For
example, since older individuals are more susceptible to the disease, we would expect a
larger precautionary-induced rush into deposits in counties with a larger proportion of older
residents. Furthermore, more educated populations might be more aware of news and

analyses discussing potential economic fragilities created by the disease. Under these
conditions, COVID-19 will tend to generate stronger effects among more educated people, so
that the response to COVID-19 is stronger in counties with more educated residents.
Consistent with these views, we find that counties in which a larger proportion of the

population is elderly or well-educated experienced sharper declines in deposit interest rates at
local banks than other counties.
        Third, a large literature on social capital stresses that communities with strong bonds
and engagement with each other are more effective at addressing an array of challenges than

those with less social connections. When applied to the COVID-19 pandemic, this suggests
local COVID-19 cases are likely to induce less panic about future income in communities in
which there are stronger social connections that provide emotional support and insurance
during times of duress. From this perspective, the increase in deposits associated with
precautionary savings is likely to be muted in counties with greater social capital. This is
what we find: counties with higher values of Community Health experience less of a drop in
deposit rates for branches in response to local COVID-19 cases. The results on social capital
provide further support for the precautionary savings view of how COVID-19 influences
deposit interest rates.
        We also examine the quantity of deposits and consumption spending at the bank-
county and the county level, respectively. In terms of the quantity of deposits, there are
                                                                                                 7



material data limitations. Namely, data on the quantity of deposits in 2020 are only available
at the bank-by-county level (not the branch level) and at an annual frequency (not weekly).
When conducting the analyses on these available data, we find that deposits increase by more

among banks in counties more exposed to COVID-19. There are also data limitations on
savings, as we do not have weekly data on savings at the county level. Instead, we examine
the degree to which consumption varies with COVID-19 infection by using data on consumer
spending at the county-level. We find that consumer spending drops more in counties with a
higher COVID-19 infection rate. Though subject to limitations, these analyses of deposits
and consumption are consistent with the precautionary savings view of how local COVID-19
infection rates changes in deposits among branches in the county.

       Our results suggest that an increase in precautionary savings helps account for the
surge in bank deposits in response to the pandemic. Without ruling out that people flee from
risky assets into bank deposits, banks increase their demand for deposits, or that national
policies contribute to the flow of funds into bank deposits, our branch-county-week analyses

suggest that local exposure to COVID-19 cases triggered concerns about the economy that
induced a sharp increase in precautionary savings.
       Our research is related to but different from Li, Strahan, and Zhang (2020). They
investigate how COVID-19 as a nationwide shock affects bank lending during the crisis, and

discover that bank C&I lending differs across banks with different pre-pandemic conditions.
They also explain the potential funding sources for large vs. small banks. We instead
examine the effects of branch exposure to time-varying, local COVID-19 cases on depositor
behavior. The weekly, branch-level deposit rates data enable us to control for any time-
varying nationwide and statewide factors, so that we can exploit cross-county variations in
local exposure to COVID-19 and evaluate its association with deposit rates. To our
knowledge, ours is the first study of why deposits surged during the COVID-19 crisis.
                                                                                                  8



2. Data
2.1 COVID-19
       The Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University

(JHU) provides daily data on the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases for each U.S.
county, starting in January 22, 2020. To measure county-specific exposure to the pandemic,
we compute Ln(Cases per capita) as the logarithm of one plus the cumulative number of
confirmed cases divided by population (in millions) in a county on each day. County-level
total population data comes from the Census. To generate weekly COVID-19 exposure data
from daily observations, we use the value of Ln(Cases per capita) on Friday. As shown in
Table 1, the average number of cases per capita in a county equals 94 (across all counties and

weeks), and equals 720 when eliminating county-weeks where Cases per capita equals zero.


2.2 Deposit data
       To evaluate the impact of COVID-19-exposure on deposit rates, we obtain data from

RateWatch, which provides weekly interest rate data at the branch level for each type of
deposit product. Our analyses focus on the most commonly tracked deposit product among
U.S. branches, 12-month certificates of deposits (CDs) with an account size of $10,000. The
key results hold when using CDs with different features, such as 24-month and 36-month

CDs with an account size of $10,000, as well as 12-month CDs with an account size of
$100,000. Our primary sample includes 287,262 branch-week observations over the period
from January through April of 2019 and 2020, involving 9,847 branches.


2.3 Stock market data and county characteristics
       To examine the heterogeneous effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on deposit rates by
stock market conditions and county traits, we use data on (a) stock market returns and
volatility and (b) county-specific characteristics. First, we retrieve daily U.S. market return
data on the S&P500 index from Datastream provided by Thomson Reuters and compute the
weekly stock returns, Ret, which equals the closing price on the last trading day of week t (Pt)
                                                                                               9



minus that of week t-1 (Pt-1) divided by Pt-1. To measure weekly market volatility, we use
Vol, which equals the standard deviation of daily S&P 500 returns during each week.
       Second, to measure the degree to which a county leans toward the Republican or

Democrat Party, we collect data on (a) each county’s voting results in the 2016 presidential
election from the MIT Election Data and Science Lab (MIT 2018), and (b) whether a state’s
governor is a member of the Democratic or Republican Party from the National Governors
Association’s Rosters of Governors. In particular, we compute the vote share won by Donald
Trump in the 2016 presidential election and set LoTrump equal to one if a county’s vote share
for Trump is below the sample median of county vote shares, and zero otherwise. DemGov is
a dummy variable that equals one if a county is in a state with a governor who is a member of

the Democratic Party, and zero otherwise.
       Third, we collect county-level data on population age and education from the Census.
Hi%Age is an indicator that equals one if the proportion of the population in a county over
the age of 70 is above the sample median across counties, and zero otherwise. Hi%College or

above is an indicator that equals one if the proportion of the population in a county with a
college degree is above the sample median, and zero otherwise.
       Fourth, to measure the degree of community cohesion and engagement, we use the
index of Community health from the U.S. Congress (Joint Economic Committee) and the

index of Associations collected by Penn State’s Northeast Regional Center for Rural
Development. Community health index captures the degree to which individuals engage in
community activities, which includes membership organizations, non-religious non-profits
organizations, and congregations, serving on a committee or as an officer, and the degree of
community involvement in informal social activities such as attending public meetings,
volunteering, helping neighbors, and taking part in political meetings or demonstration.
Similarly, Associations equals the number of establishments related to community activities
divided by population (in thousand), such as sports teams, clubs, and bowling teams, as well
as religious, civic, business, professional, labor, and political establishments. Thus, both
Community health and Associations indicators measure the degree of community
                                                                                                10



engagement. We also use the average of these two measures as an alternative measure in
robustness analyses.



3. Empirical Strategy
3.1 Baseline specification
       We begin our evaluation of the relation between COVID-19 and deposit rates using
the following baseline regression model.


                   𝐷𝑒𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡 𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒!",$,% = 𝛼& + 𝛽𝐿𝑛(𝐶𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑠 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑐𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎)$,%'(
                                                  +𝛼!" + 𝛼),% + (𝛼*+, + 𝛼!,% ) + 𝜀!",$,% ,      (1)



where br, c, and t index branch, county, and week, respectively. The dependent variable,
Deposit Ratebr,c,t, represents the deposit rate on 12-month CDs offered by branch br located
in county c during week t. Ln(Cases per capita)c,t-1 denotes the logarithm of one plus the

cumulative number of confirmed cases per capita in county c on Friday of week t-1. We
estimate the model using OLS and report standard errors clustered at the county levels.
       As an initial strategy for isolating the relation between COVID-19 and deposit rates,
we include an array of fixed effects. First, we include branch (αbr) fixed effects to account for

time-invariant influences at the branch level. These fixed effects condition out branch and
local community traits shaping the cross-sectional distribution of deposit rates. For example,
to the extent that market structure does not change much over these weeks, these fixed effects
account for the differences of a branch’s market power (Berger and Hannan 1989; 1991).
Second, we control for state-by-week fixed effects (αs,t) to account for all time-varying
factors at the state-level. Thus, to the extent that states respond differently to the pandemic, or
differences in demographics across states influence responses to COVID-19, or the evolution
of other state-level (or national) economic conditions shape the evolution of the pandemic or
the population’s dynamic response to the pandemic, these fixed effects control for those
influences and help in isolating the relation between Ln(Cases per capita)c,t-1 and local
deposit rates. Third, time-varying bank characteristics might be simultaneously correlated
                                                                                                             11



with COVID-19 infection rates and deposit rates across the bank’s branches. For example,
the pandemic and the policy response to the crisis could differentially shape the evolution of
bank actions and bank risk, potentially altering deposits and the rates offered on those

deposits. To address this concern, we control for bank-by-week fixed effects (αb,t). In this
way, we focus on the differential response of local bank branches within the same bank to
differential exposures to local COVID-19 cases. Finally, in some analyses, we include survey
day fixed effects. Specifically, all branches are not surveyed on the same day of the week
about their deposit rates. To address the concern that common shocks on particular survey
days affect deposit rates across all branches, we therefore include survey date fixed effects
(αday).2

           In conducting the baseline analyses, we also consider the possibility that expansionary
monetary and fiscal policies triggered the surge in bank deposits, which we call the national
policy view. Our empirical strategy of combining branch-level data on interest rates, county-
level data on COVID-19 cases, and weekly observations directly addresses the possibility

that national monetary and fiscal policies—and even state-level policies—account for our
examination of the relation between deposit rates and COVID-19 cases. Specifically, by
including state-time, and even bank-time fixed effects, it is unlikely that aggregate policies
account for the time-varying relation between branch interest rates and county-level COVID-

19 exposure. We also go farther in assessing the national policy view. We test whether the
relation between branch deposit rates and local COVID-19 cases varies across periods of
different monetary and fiscal policies.


3.2 Additional implications
           After reporting the results using this initial baseline regression model, we then extend
the analyses to test whether deposit interest rates fall by more in response to increases in
COVID-19 cases in weeks and counties in which people are likely to be more sensitive to
adverse news about future economic uncertainties. By testing these additional implications,
2
  Thus, for each branch-week observations, the vector of fixed effects, αday, includes five dummy variables, one
for each day of that week, where the actual survey day is set equal to one and all of the other dummy variables
are set equal to zero.
                                                                                                 12



we both enrich the examination of the mechanisms linking local differences in exposure to
COVID-19 and changes in deposit interest rates and reduce concerns that other factors shape
the negative relationship between deposit interest rates and local COVID-19 cases.

       The additional implications that we evaluate build from the precautionary savings
view’s core insight: increasing fears about disruptions to future income induce people to save
more. First, the precautionary savings view suggests that the same news about local COVID-
19 cases will induce a bigger increase in precautionary savings when people are more
sensitive to such adverse news about their economic futures, such as when financial markets
are in turmoil. Thus, we evaluate whether the relation between deposit interest rates and
COVID-19 cases is greater when (a) the stock market is more volatile and (b) the market is

performing poorly. Second, the precautionary savings view suggests that the impact of the
same information about COVID-19 cases will have bigger effects on precautionary savings
among individuals in which that information triggers greater fears about future income. We
examine three county characteristics likely to influence the impact of COVID-19 exposure on

fear and hence on precautionary savings and deposit interest rates. Specifically, we expect
that the impact of COVID-19 cases will be greater (1) in counties with stronger leanings
toward the Democratic rather than the Republican Party, as a growing body of evidence
suggests that people aligned with the Democratic Party have been more concerned by

COVID-19 than those aligned with the Republican Party (e.g., Allcott et al 2020; Grossman
et al 2020), (2) in counties with older and more educated populations, older people are more
susceptible to COVID-19 and have shorter investment horizons in terms of recouping loses
and more educated individuals are likely to be more attuned to the economic risks triggered
by the pandemic, and (3) among communities with less social capital, which might act as an
economic and emotion buffer to the adverse repercussion of COVID-19 exposure.


4. Baseline Results
       Results in Table 2 show that deposit rates drop more in counties exposed to a larger
number of COVID-19 cases. As shown in columns 1 and 3, Ln(Cases per capita) enters
negatively and significantly in all specifications, suggesting that interest rates on deposits fall
                                                                                                 13



more among branches in counties more heavily exposed to the disease. The results hold when
conditioning on a full set of branch and state-by-week fixed effects. In terms of the
magnitude of the estimated impact, the coefficients in column 3 indicate that a one standard

deviation increase in Ln(Cases per capita) (1.65) is associated with 2.2 basis point decline in
deposit rates, which is equivalent to 3.5% of the standard deviation of Deposit Rate. As
shown, the finding that exposure to COVID-19 puts downward pressure on deposit rates is
robust to including both bank-by-time and survey day fixed effects.
        Figure 4 plots the relation between branch-level deposit rates and local COVID-19
cases. The vertical axis represents the residual deposit rate after conditioning out branch,
state-week, and survey date fixed effects (Deposit rate). The horizontal axis is based on the

residual values of Ln(Cases per capita), where the residuals are computed after conditioning
out state-week fixed effects. We divide residual Ln(Cases per capita) into 100 bins, so that
each dot represents the average deposit rate across branches located in counties with residual
Ln(Cases per capita) falling into the corresponding percentile. As shown, there is a strong

negative relation between deposit rates and COVID-19 exposure.
        We next turn to the national policy view. This view stresses that expansionary
monetary and fiscal policies in response to the pandemic could have triggered the surge in
deposits and the drop in deposit interest rates. Our empirical design, however, reduces the

possibility that national, or even state, policies account for our findings. By examining the
relation between branch-level deposit rates and county-level COVID-19 cases, while
including branch, and state-time, it is unlikely that monetary and fiscal policies account for
the results.
        To go further in reducing concerns that macro policies confound our inferences, we
extend the results in the following three ways. First, we distinguish among three sub-periods
during the January through April of 2020. In particular, we first define the one-zero indicator
variable Before RateCut as equal to one during the weeks before March 3rd of 2020, which is
the period before the Federal Reserve first intervened by cutting the federal funds rate on
March 3rd. We next similarly define the one-zero indicator variable 1st RateCut and 2nd
RateCut. 1st RateCut equals one during the weeks between March 3rd and March 15th, which
                                                                                                                14



is after the first cut in the federal funds rate and before the Fed further lowered the federal
funds rate and announced its intention to purchase Treasury securities and agency mortgage-
backed securities on March 15th. 2nd RateCut equals one after March 15th.3 We then examine

whether the relationship between deposit interest rates and exposure to COVID-19 changes
across these sub-periods.
         In particular, we add to equation (1) the interactions between county exposure to the
coronavirus (Ln(Cases per capita)) and each of the three sub-period indicators: Before
RateCut, 1st RateCut, and 2nd RateCut. If conventional monetary policy is driving the
results, then we should observe a stronger relation between COVID-19 and deposit rates
when monetary policy is more expansive. As shown in Table 2, in the even numbered

columns, we do not find this. Indeed, the coefficient estimates on the interaction between
Ln(Cases per capita) and Before RateCut, 1st RateCut, and 2nd RateCut drop monotonically
over time. This finding suggests that the rate-reducing effects of COVID-19 exposure are
strongest before any monetary policy reactions. The estimated coefficients from column 4

indicate that a one standard deviation increase in Ln(Cases per capita) (1.65) is associated
with a drop in deposit rates of 8.6 basis points during the first weeks of the virus outbreak,
equivalent to 13.6% of the standard deviation of Deposit Rate.
         Second, to mitigate the concern that results are driven by Federal Reserve and

government lending, we repeat the analyses in Panel A of Table 2 while (a) restricting the
analyses to the period from January through March 27, 2020, on which the CARES Act is
passed, or (b) controlling for the amount of SBA Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans
received by small businesses in each county and each week. We obtain data on PPP from the
U.S. Department of the Treasury, which provides loan-level information on size4, origination
date, geographic location, borrower characteristics, etc. Accordingly, we compute LnPPP as
the log cumulative amount of PPP loans originated in a county, up to the Friday of the
previous week. In this way, we omit the impact of the CARES Act (The Coronavirus Aid,


3
  Regarding fiscal policy, the U.S. Government passed the CARES (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic
Security) Act on March 27th, and the U.S. Treasury mailed coronavirus economic assistance checks on April 29th).
4
  For loans larger than $150k, the exact loan size is not provided. Instead, only a size range is specified. In our
analysis, we use the mid-point of each size category as a proxy for the loan size.
                                                                                                                15



Relief, and Economic Security Act) and control for payments associated with the Paycheck
Protection Program (PPP). As shown in Panel B of Table 2, all of the results hold over this
period (columns 1 – 3) and when conditioning on the amount of PPP loans received by small

businesses in each county-week (columns 4 – 6), suggesting that the rate-reducing effects of
local infection rates are not a simple manifestation of government liquidity injections.


5. Results on Additional Implications
         In this section, we conduct four tests of whether deposit interest rates fall by more in
response to increases in COVID-19 infection rates in weeks and counties in which people are
likely to be more sensitive to adverse news concerning their economic futures. To examine

this, we identify (a) periods when people are likely to be more concerned about their
economic futures and (b) counties where people likely to be more sensitive to COVID-19
cases and test whether the interest rate reducing effects of COVID-19 are greater in those
periods and counties.5



5.1 Stock markets
         One factor likely to intensify the impact of news about local COVID-19 cases on
anxiety about the local economy is the overall degree of financial system fragility. From this

perspective, the same information about COVID-19 exposure is likely to trigger
precautionary savings more when people are more worried about the financial markets. To
evaluate this implication, we assess whether the relation between deposit interest rates and
COVID-19 cases is greater when (a) the stock market is more volatile and (b) the market is
performing poorly.
         Consistent with the precautionary savings view, we find that local deposit interest
rates fall by more in response to local COVID-19 cases when stock market volatility is
relatively high. Specifically, to equation (1), we add an interaction term, the interaction

5
 In moving from the baseline analyses to these additional studies in which we explore the heterogenous response
of deposit rates in differing periods and counties, we no longer present the findings while including and excluding
bank-week fixed effects. Since the vast majority of banks in RateWatch have only one branch, including branch
and bank-week fixed effects eliminates most (more than 75%) of the full sample. Since in this section we are also
differentiating by period and country traits, we include branch, state-week, and survey date fixed effects.
                                                                                                16



between the county’s exposure to COVID-19 as of week t-1 (𝐿𝑛(𝐶𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑠 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑐𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎)$,%'( )

and the volatility of daily stock market returns during week t-1 (𝑉𝑜𝑙%'( ). Since 𝑉𝑜𝑙%'( is
computed at the national level, state-year fixed effects eliminate the linear 𝑉𝑜𝑙%'( term. As
shown in Table 3, both 𝐿𝑛(𝐶𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑠 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑐𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎)$,%'( and 𝐿𝑛(𝐶𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑠 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑐𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎)$,%'( ∗

𝑉𝑜𝑙%'( , enter negatively and significantly, suggesting that the rate-reducing effects of
COVID-19 exposure are more pronounced when financial markets are more volatile. The
coefficient estimates from column 1 suggest that a one standard deviation increase in the
stock market volatility (0.019) would increase the sensitivity of deposit rates to local
COVID-19 exposure by 0.0036 (=0.187 * 0.019). This is not small given that the average
sensitivity of deposit rates to local COVID-19 exposure is 0.0121 (Table 2).

         Also we find that the rate-reducing effects of exposure to COVID-19 are greater when
stock returns are lower. In particular, we include the interaction between Ln(Cases per
Capita) and Ret, where Ret denotes the weekly return on the S&P 500. As reported in Table
3, while Ln(Cases per Capita) enters negatively and significantly, Ln(Cases per Capita) *

Ret enters positively and significantly. This indicates that COVID-19 exposure has a larger
rate-reducing effect when stock returns are lower. Furthermore, we distinguish weeks in
which the market has positive or negative returns. Ret+ equals Ret if Ret is positive, and zero
otherwise. Ret- equals Ret if Ret is negative, and zero otherwise. When simultaneously

including Ln(Cases per Capita) * Ret+ and Ln(Cases per Capita) * Ret- in the model, we find
that the coefficient estimates on Ln(Cases per Capita) * Ret- are positive and statistically
significant. These findings further confirm that the rate-reducing effects of exposure to
COVID-19 are larger when stock returns are lower. Taken together, the results on volatility
and stock returns are consistent with the view that local exposure to COVID-19 cases trigger
more precautionary savings when market volatility is higher and stock price performance is
worse.


5.2 Political affiliation
         We next evaluate whether deposit interest rates fall by more in response to increases
in COVID-19 infection rates in counties likely to be more sensitive to such news, where we
                                                                                                17



first focus on political affiliation. Research suggests that people aligned with the Democrat
Party have responded with greater concern to the COVID-19 pandemic than those aligned
with the Republican Party. Although researchers and commentators provide different

explanations for these cross-party differences, we exploit past research to evaluate an
implication for our study: If more local COVID-19 cases trigger greater uncertainty about
income and precautionary savings, this response should be greater in counties where COVID-
19 induces greater concerns, i.e., in more democratic-leaning counties. As defined above, we
use two measures of the degree to which a county is more democratic or republican leaning:
LoTrump equals one if a county’s vote share for Trump is below the sample median of
county vote shares, and zero otherwise; and DemGov equals one if a county is in a state with

a governor who is a member of the Democratic Party, and zero otherwise.
       Consistent with the precautionary savings view of how COVID-19 shapes deposits—
and past results that Democrats are more sensitive to the pandemic, we find that the rate-
reducing effects of COVID-19 are stronger in counties more closely aligned with the

Democratic Party. To test this, we add to equation (1) either the interaction between
Ln(Cases per Capita) and LoTrump or its interaction with DemGov. As shown in Table 4,
both the Ln(Cases per Capita) * LoTrump interaction term and the linear term, Ln(Cases per
Capita), enter negatively and insignificantly, suggesting that deposit rates drop by more in

counties with lower vote shares for Donald Trump in the 2016 election. Table 4 also shows
that the Ln(Cases per Capita) * DemGov interaction term enters negatively and significantly,
suggesting that deposit rates fall by more in states with a Democratic governor. To illustrate
the economic magnitudes, the estimates from column 2 indicate that a one-standard-deviation
increase in county-level Covid-19 exposure is associated with a 1.8 basis point (= -0.0108
*1.65) large reduction in deposit rates in Democratic counties than in Republican counties.


5.3 Demographics
       Different demographic groups may also have different sensitivities to COVID-19
exposure, leading to different rate-reducing effects of COVID-19 across counties. That is, if
COVID-19 generated fears about the economy and financial markets help drive the surge in
                                                                                                  18



deposits and the reduction in deposit rates, then this effect should be larger in counties with
more “COVID-19 sensitive” demographic groups, i.e., where people become more fearful in
response to local COVID-19 cases. Since older individuals are more susceptible to the

disease and have shorter invest horizons to recoup losses, we expect a larger rush into
deposits in counties with a larger proportion of older residents. Furthermore, more educated
populations might (a) be more aware of news and analyses discussing potential economic
fragilities created by the disease and (b) be more forward-looking about future cash flow
risks. Under these conditions, COVID-19 will tend to generate stronger effects among more
educated people, so that the precautionary response to COVID-19 is stronger in counties with
more educated residents. To measure these cross-county differences, we use (1) Hi%Age,

which equals one if the proportion of the population in a county over the age of 70 is above
the sample median, and zero otherwise, and (2) Hi%College or above, which equals one if
the proportion of the population in a county with a college degree is above the sample
median, and zero otherwise.

       On the age and education of counties, the results are also consistent with the
precautionary savings view of how COVID-19 influences deposit interest rates. Specifically,
we find that counties in which a larger proportion of the population is elderly or well-
educated experienced sharper declines in deposit interest rates at local banks than other

counties. As shown in Table 5, Ln(Cases per Capita) * Hi%Age enters negatively and
significantly, indicating that deposit prices of branches with an older customer base fell more
in response to COVID-19 than branches with a younger customer base. These results are
consistent with the view that older individuals are more susceptible to the disease, and
therefore react more strongly. Furthermore, we also find that deposit rates fall more in
counties with more well-educated people. As shown, Ln(Cases per Capita) * Hi%College or
above enters negatively and significantly. This is consistent with the view more educated
people become more informed about the economic risks associated with the pandemic and
save more to protect themselves against future income shocks.


5.4 Social capital
                                                                                               19



       Social capital is also apt to shape the degree to which local COVID-19 cases generate
anxiety about future income and hence a surge in precautionary savings. In particular, while
social capital in general refers to the shared values, accepted norms, reciprocal bonds, and

trust among individuals in a community, social capital has distinct features, reflecting
community engagement, social commitment, and family structure and stability. The
“community engagement” feature of social capital stresses that communities which people
residents have stronger bonds and engagement with each other are more effective at
addressing an array of challenges than those with less social connections. When applied to
the COVID-19 pandemic, this suggests local COVID-19 cases are likely to induce less fears
in communities in which there are strong social connections that provide support and

insurance during times of duress. From this perspective, community engagement will tend to
reduce the rate-reducing effects of local COVID-19 cases. To test the prediction, we use the
index of Community health, which measures the degree of cohesion and engagement across
U.S. counties. Thus, to the equation (1) regression, we include the interaction between

Ln(Cases per Capita and High Community Health, which is a dummy that equals to one in a
county if Community health is above sample median and zero otherwise.
       The results on social capital provide further support for the precautionary savings
view of how COVID-19 influences deposit interest rates. In particular, consistent with the

views that (a) local exposure to COVID-19 cases generates economic uncertainty that
triggers precautionary savings and (b) social capital is a form of community insurance that
reduces COVID-19 generated uncertainties, we find that county COVID-19 cases are
associated with smaller reduction in local deposit rates in counties with greater social capital.
As reported in Table 6, while the linear term, Ln(Cases per Capita), enters negatively and
significantly, the interaction term, Ln(Cases per Capita)* High Community Engagement,
enters positively and significantly in all columns, suggesting that counties with higher values
of Community Engagement experience less of a surge in precautionary savings at local
branches in response to Covid-19 cases, where community engagement is measured by the
indicators of Community Health (column 1), Associations (column 2), or the average of the
two (column 3).
                                                                                               20



        Figure 5 – 8 illustrates the heterogeneity of results across counties with different
characteristics. We plot the sensitivity of branch-level deposit rates to local COVID-19 cases,
while differentiating counties by (a) the degree to which a county is more democratic or

republican leaning, (b) population age, (c) the degree of education, and (d) the extent to
which residents in local communities have strong bonds and engagement with each other.
The vertical axis represents the residual deposit rate in each bank branch in each week, after
conditioning out branch, state-week, and survey date fixed effects. Ln(Cases per capita) is
measured at the county-week level and equals the residual log number of cases per 1 million
population, after conditioning out state-week fixed effects. We divide residual Ln(Cases per
capita) into 100 bins, so that each dot represents the average deposit rates across branches

located in counties with residual Ln(Cases per capita) falling into the corresponding
percentile. As shown, the relation between branch deposit rates and local COVID-19
infection rates is stronger in counties where people are likely to become more anxious about
the local economy’s future in response to any given value of Ln(Cases per capita).

        Finally, Table 7 reports regression results in which we simultaneously include the
array of interactions associated with financial market fragility, political affiliations,
demographics, and social capital. Specifically, we estimate a model that includes Ln(Cases
per Capita)*Vol, Ln(Cases per Capita)*Ret, Ln(Cases per Capita)*LoTrump, Ln(Cases per

Capita)*Hi%Age, Ln(Cases per Capita)*Hi%College or above, and Ln(Cases per
Capita)*High Community Health. As shown, each of the interaction terms enters statistically
significantly, with the same sign as when they were examined separately. These results
suggest that these conditioning variables capture different aspects of heterogeneity, rather
than the same factor being proxied by different variables. These results also confirm the
implications of the precautionary savings view of how COVID-19 influences deposit interest
rates, reducing concerns that omitted variables drive the findings.


6. The Quantity of Deposits and Consumer Spending
        A key feature of the precautionary savings view is that more funds flow into deposits
and this drives down deposit rates. As emphasized above, we do not focus on examining the
                                                                                                   21



flow of funds into bank branches because (1) we aim to distinguish the supply-side effects
from the demand side by examining the price and (2) there are data limitations on deposits in
2020, i.e., data on the quantity of deposits are only available at the bank-by-county level (not

the branch level) and at an annual frequency (not weekly). While recognizing these
limitations, we provide evidence on the response of bank deposits to COVID-19 using
available data. We examine changes in bank deposits from June 30, 2019 to June 30, 2020
using data from the Summary of Deposits, and relate these changes to banks’ exposure to
COVID-19.
        We use the following regression specification:


    𝐷𝑒𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡 𝐺𝑟𝑜𝑤𝑡ℎ!,$ = 𝛼& + 𝛽𝐿𝑛(𝐶𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑠 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝐶𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎)$ + 𝑋! + (𝛼) + 𝛼+ ) + 𝜀! ,                       (2)



where there is one observation per bank-county, data permitting. 𝐷𝑒𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡 𝐺𝑟𝑜𝑤𝑡ℎ!,$ is the

growth in deposits held at bank b’s branches in county c and is computed over the period

from June 30, 2019 to June 30, 2020. 𝐿𝑛(𝐶𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑠 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝐶𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎)$ is the county exposure to
COVID-19 cases as of June 2020. 𝑋! is a vector of bank characteristics including lagged
growth in deposits, size, equity-asset ratio, profitability, and Tier-1 capital ratio. Lagged
growth in deposits is the growth in deposits held at bank b’s branches in county c and is

computed over the period from June 2018 through June 2019. We include lagged growth in
deposits to control for potential trends in deposit growth. Size equals the log of book value of
total assets. Equity-asset ratio equals total equity divided by total assets. Profitability equals
operating income divided by total assets. Tier-1 capital ratio equals Tier 1 capital divided by
risk-weighted assets. 𝛼) is the fixed effect for the bank’s headquarter state, and 𝛼+ is the
fixed effect for the bank’s regulatory agency.
        Consistent with the precautionary savings view, Table 8 shows a larger increase in
deposits among bank-branches in counties more exposed to COVID-19. The results hold
when conditioning on (a) an array of bank traits, namely lagged deposit growth rate, size,
equity-asset ratio, profitability, and Tier1 capital ratio, and (b) bank, headquarter state, and
regulatory agency fixed effects.
                                                                                                    22



        Another key feature of the precautionary savings view is that an increase in anxiety
about future income triggers a reduction in consumption and an increase in savings. We
cannot evaluate the impact of local COVID-19 infection rates on local saving rates because

we lack weekly data on savings at the county level. However, we can shed additional light on
the precautionary savings mechanism by examining seasonally-adjusted consumer spending
data at the county-level. These data are provided by Economic Tracker, which is based on
Chetty et al. (2020).
        As shown in Table 9, consumer spending drops more in counties with a higher
COVID-19 infection rate. The coefficient estimates on Ln(Cases per Capita) are negative and
statistically significant in all specification. In particular, the results hold when including or

excluding (a) county, time, and/or state-by-time fixed effects, and (b) local employment,
which helps account for economic conditions in the county. The results are also consistent
with recent studies showing an aggregate reduction in consumer spending during the
COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., Chen, Qian, and Wen 2020).



7. Conclusion
        In this study, we investigate deposits’ behavior and explain why deposits surged
during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using weekly data at the branch level on

deposit interest rates and weekly data on COVID-19 cases at the county level, we assess the
dynamic relation between deposit rates and COVID-19 cases. Consistent with the
precautionary savings motive, our baseline analyses show that deposit rates at bank branch in
counties with higher COVID-19 infection rates fall by more than branches in otherwise
similar counties. Thus, the increase in deposits were driven by the supply of deposits, rather
than the demand side. Moreover, the impact of exposure to COVID-19 on deposit rates is
greater when (a) the stock market is more volatile and (b) the market is performing poorly,
suggesting that the effects were exacerbated by a flight-to-safety, i.e., when people are more
likely to be sensitive to financial system stability.
        Several extensions further indicate that the negative relation between local COVID-19
infection rates and deposits rates reflects an increase in precautionary savings. The rate-

reducing effects of COVID-19 are more pronounced (a) in more democratic-leaning counties,
(b) in counties with a larger proportion of elderly or well-educated population, and (c)
communities with weaker bonds and engagement. Overall, the evidence is consistent with the

precautionary savings view that due to concerns about future income, depositors increase
precautionary savings, pushing down deposit rates.

Figure 2. Deposit Quantity and COVID-19 Exposure
This figure plots the relationship between deposit quantity and a bank’s exposure to COVID in a county.
Deposit growth equals the log difference of total deposits held by bank b in county c between 2019 June 30 and
2020 June 30. The vertical axis is the residual deposit growth after conditioning out bank fixed effects. The
horizontal axis is the county-level exposure to COVID-19, Ln(Cases per capita).We divide Ln(Cases per
capita) into 100 bins, so that each dot represents the average deposit growth across bank-counties with Ln(Cases
per capita) falling into the corresponding percentile. The line is the fitted linear line that relate deposit growth to
exposure to COVID-19. Source: Summary of Deposits and John Hopkins University.

Table 2. Deposit rates and COVID-19 exposure
Panel A represents the baseline regression results that estimate the effect of COVID on deposit rate. Panel B
repeats the baseline regressions in Panel A, while (a) restricting the analyses to the period from January through
March 27, on which the CARES Act is passed, or (b) controlling for the amount of PPP loans received by small
businesses in each county and each week. LnPPP is the log cumulative amount of PPP loans that are originated
in the same county, up to the Friday of the previous week. The dependent variable is the percentage rate of 12-
month certificate deposits of each branch in each week, reported by RateWatch. Ln(Cases per Capita) is the log
number of total COVID cases per 1 million population in each county reported on the Friday of the previous
week. Before RateCut indicates the period before March 03, 2020, when the first federal funds rate cut is
announced; 1st RateCut indicates the period between March 03 and March 15, 2020, when the second rate cut is
announced; 2nd RateCut indicates period after March 15, 2020. LnPPP is the log cumulative amount of PPP
lending up to the Friday of the previous week. Survey Date is the calendar date when the branch is surveyed
about its deposit rate in a week. Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors are clustered by county, as reported in
the parenthesis. “*” indicates statistical significance at 10% level, “**” at 5% level, and “***” at 1% level.

Table 6. COVID-19 exposure and deposit rates, differentiating by social capital
This table represents the regression results that estimate the effect of COVID on deposit rate across areas with
different levels of social capital. The dependent variable is the percentage rate of 12-month certificate deposits
of each branch in each week, reported by RateWatch. Ln(Cases per Capita) is the log number of total COVID
cases per 1 million population in each county, reported on the Friday of the previous week. High Community
health is a dummy that equals to one if the county-level community health index is above median. Survey Date
is the calendar date when the branch is surveyed about its deposit rate in a week. Heteroskedasticity-robust
standard errors are clustered by county, as reported in the parenthesis. “*” indicates statistical significance at
10% level, “**” at 5% level, and “***” at 1% level.
