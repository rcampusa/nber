Italy’s economic and banking systems have been under stress in the wake of the Global Financial
Crisis and Euro Crisis. Firms in business groups have been more likely to survive this
challenging environment, compared to unaffiliated firms. Better performance stems from access
to an internal capital market, and the survival value of groups increases, inter alia, with group-
wide cash flow. We show that actual internal capital transfers increase during the crisis, and
these transfers move funds from cash-rich to cash-poor firms and also to those with more
favorable investment opportunities. The ability to borrow externally provides additional funds
that are shared across group affiliated firms. Our results highlight the benefits of internal capital
markets when external capital markets are tight or distressed.

I. Introduction

       The Italian banking system began experiencing large credit losses starting at the

beginning of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis and increasing further with the onset and

deepening of the Euro Crisis in 2011. By December of 2015, aggregate bad loans had

reached about €200 billion, or approximately 8% of total loans outstanding (Figure 1).

Losses are substantially higher when other troubled loans not yet written off are included.

Unlike other recent banking problems, where losses were concentrated in real estate or

sovereign debt exposure, most of these losses – close to 80% – come from bad debts in

lending to non-financial businesses.

       As a result of these banking system-wide losses, the availability of credit overall

in Italy has been constrained. A number of recent studies find that credit supply by

distressed banks was reduced in Italy during both the 2007-2008 Global Financial Crisis

as well as the more recent Euro crisis (e.g., Albertazzi and Marchetti (2010); Bolton et al.

(2013); Bofondi et al. (2013)). Losses at banks, combined with a weak legal system,

have made the situation even worse because Italian firms sometimes delay payments to

banks weakened by past losses and facing large time and legal expenses associated with

enforcing loan defaults in court (Schiantarelli, Stacchini and Strahan (2016)). In

addition, bank distress from exposure to risky sovereign debt has also reduced credit

supply and helped propagate the Euro crisis from distressed to non-distressed countries

across the Euro system (e.g. Popov and van Horen (2013); De Marco (2015)). This

distress is one important reason for Italy’s poor growth performance.

       In this paper, we show that Italian business groups have helped firms survive the

ongoing crisis by mitigating the costs of limited credit stemming from banking problems.




                                             1
In 2014, one-third of total employment in industry and services occurs at firms affiliated

with Italian business groups (5.6 million employees). They produce over than €376

billion in value added, or 55 percent of total value added in industrial and service sectors.

We test whether firms in these business groups use their access to the internal capital

market as a substitute for external finance normally supplied by banks. We show that

they do. Groups move capital from cash-rich to cash-poor firms, thereby benefiting firms

that otherwise would face binding external financial constraints. Group affiliated firms

also share financial resources obtained externally, but this mechanism weakens during the

years of banking distress. Thus, sharing of internal cash resources supplants external

finance during these years.

       In our first set of tests, we show that affiliation with business groups helps firms

survive the recent financial and economic downturn. Using the non-parametric Kaplan-

Meier estimate of survival probabilities, we show that firms in large business groups are

approximately 11 percentage points more likely to survive from 2006 to 2013, compared

with unaffiliated firms (50% survival probability for unaffiliated firms, versus 61% for

firms in large groups). Firms in small groups are also more likely to survive, although

the difference is smaller. To understand the role of internal capital markets, we report

results that condition on firm fundamentals in a discrete-time logit hazard model with

time-varying covariates. These models imply that the survival value of group affiliation

becomes stronger during the crisis years. Moreover, controlling for fundamentals has

only a small effect on the survival value of group affiliation, suggesting that such

affiliation provides benefits beyond factors that might improve firm sales or firm

profitability. Consistent with internal capital markets driving this difference, we show




                                              2
that survival increases not only when own fundamentals are stronger, but also when

fundamentals of other group-affiliated fundamentals are stronger.

         In our second set of results, we explore how access to the internal capital market

enhances the survival value of group affiliation. We show that firms substitute toward

the internal capital market when the banking system becomes distressed. Figure 2 shows

this pattern at an aggregate level: intra-group capital transfers increase sharply as the

Euro Crisis explodes in 2011, and this increase is mirrored by a drop in outside

borrowing (mainly from banks.) Analysis of firm-level data supports this substitution.

First, intra-group capital flows from firms with high cash flow to those with low cash

flow and also toward firms with high investment opportunities (proxied by sales

growth).1 Moreover, the marginal effect on transfers of negative shocks to a firm cash

flow is greater for high sales firms. Second, after combining the firm-level data with data

drawn from the Italian Central Credit Register, we are able to link the use of internal

capital markets to the relative distress of a firm’s own bank(s). In particular, we show

that the internal capital flows are more pronounced among firms with more distressed

banks. This is strong evidence that the internal capital substitutes in for the external

markets when those markets are distressed.

         Two conditions are required for internal capital markets to matter for investment

and firm outcomes. First, external capital markets must be more costly than internal

ones, otherwise Miller-Modigliani propositions would hold in the sense that firms would

be able to exploit all positive net-present value (NPV) projects. Second, there must be

some variation in the availability of cash resources relative to investment opportunities

1
  GDP does not change much during the first three quarters of 2008 and it starts declining substantially
only in the fourth quarter of 2008. See Figure 1.




                                                     3
across firms within the internal capital market. If all firms have excess cash, for example,

then all would be able to finance their own projects internally; that is, without the need

for internal (or external) capital. Similarly, if all firms within the internal capital market

face cash shortages relative to investment options, then there would be little scope for

reallocation across affiliated firms.

         We develop our tests with these two conditions in mind. We need to measure the

degree of constraints from both the external and the internal capital markets. For the

former, identification comes from the shocks to the banking system starting in 2008 and

worsening over the subsequent years; these shocks made bank credit less available and

more expensive.2 We then improve the granularity of each firm’s exposure to external

financing constraints by conditioning on the health of their own set of bank lenders. For

the latter, we measure sales growth as a proxy for each firm’s investment opportunities

and free cash flow as a measure of each firm’s scope for internal capital transfers within

the internal capital market. Our data are sufficiently rich to allow us to control for

potentially confounding effects (such as variation in unobserved aspects of investment

opportunities) with granular fixed effects. In some specifications, we even control for

both firm, industry x time, region x time, and group x time effects. Our main results are

stable across a host of permutations of sets of these fixed effects.

         The existing literature has not achieved consensus about the value of internal

capital markets. The theoretical literature has identified tradeoffs associated with internal

capital market use, relative to the external markets. On one hand, models such as Stein

(1997) emphasize that with external financial constraints, firms use internal capital

2
  Interest rates on loans start decreasing from 2014 onward, but credit supply remains tight until the end of
2015.




                                                      4
transfers to move funds away from low-return projects and toward high-return ones.

Consistent with our results, that paper suggests more movements of capital across

affiliated firms with different investment opportunities during times when external capital

is especially expensive or hard to access. Other papers, however, have focused on

offsetting agency costs (e.g. divisional rent seeking) of internal capital markets in large,

diversified conglomerates (see, e.g., Lang and Stulz (1994); Scharfstein and Stein

(2000)). Subsequent empirical studies raise doubts about whether a large and well-

diversified internal capital market creates or destroys value (e.g., Whited, 2001; Schoar,

2002; Villalonga, 2004).3

          Our paper suggests that during periods when external capital markets are

constrained, the internal capital market likely increases firm value, as its use increases

and firms with access to large internal capital markets are more likely to survive the

crisis.4 This result is consistent with Kuppuswamy and Villalonga (2015), who find that

U.S. diversified conglomerates became significantly more valuable than otherwise-

similar single segment firms during the 2008 financial crisis. In addition, Matvos and

Seru (2014) report simulations based on the 2008 financial crisis which suggest

diversified conglomerates are more likely to share resources across the internal capital

market when external finance is costly. And, in a related study, Matvos, Seru and Silva

(2016) offer evidence that diversifying mergers are more likely during periods in which

external market constraints are more likely to bind.

  Consistent with internal capital markets reducing firm value, Lamont (1997) provides evidence that oil
company investment in non-oil segments represented over-investing in low profit projects.
4
    We do not explore valuation effects because almost all of our firms do not have publicly traded equity.




                                                       5
        Our results also provide some evidence that internal capital markets do involve a

tradeoff between agency costs versus their ability to move capital to better uses. Large

groups consistently move capital toward higher sales-growth firms, regardless of

conditions in the external capital market. But among firms affiliated with small groups,

where agency problems may be more likely to be relevant, we find no correlation

between intra-group capital reallocation and sales growth during the non-crisis years.5

During the crisis, however, both large and small groups move capital across their

affiliates similarly – away from low-growth and toward higher growth firms.

        Our study also supports earlier papers that find evidence that investment rates are

insulated from cash-flow shocks for firms with access to a wide internal capital market.

Schiantarelli and Sembenelli (2000), also studying Italian business groups, find that

investment is less sensitive to cash flow for firms owned by large business groups.

Similarly, Shin and Stulz (1998) find lower investment-cash flow sensitivities for U.S.

segments held by diversified conglomerates. Both of these studies are consistent with our

finding that there is an active internal capital market within business groups, but they

suffer from the well-known ambiguities that emerge in interpreting investment links to

cash flow (e.g., Alti (2003)).6 Because we study the actual movements of capital, rather

than investment itself, our approach does not suffer from these criticisms.

        Our paper extends a small number of studies that test how business groups

circulate their internal capital market cash flow across affiliated firms. Gopalan et al.


5
  Small groups are more likely to have family control and management, which has been associated with
greater agency problems (e.g., Bennedsen et al., 2007).
6
 Shin and Stulz also show that the sensitivity to cash flow does not depend upon investment opportunities,
measured by ‘q’ of the segment a firm in a conglomerate belongs to. This result leads them to question
whether funds are efficiently allocated within a conglomerate.




                                                    6
(2007) exploit business groups in India and, like us, find that intra-group capital transfers

are used to help affiliated firms who are facing low cash flow, but their study does not

consider how the value of the internal capital market responds to shocks to the external

providers of capital, as we do. Unlike the earlier literature, our data allow us to measure

all sources of capital deployed by a given firm from group-affiliated firms, including

financial debt, trade credit and equity. Almeida et al. (2015) study how Korean Chaebol-

related firms move equity within their groups, but do not capture the full extent of the

internal capital market, as they focus only on investment opportunities but not cash flow,

which we find to be the most important variable driving intra-group transfers. Their

study also relies on a much smaller data set which does not allow them to address

potentially confounds with granular fixed effects of various types, as we do.

       The next section provides a brief overview of the role of business groups in Italy.

Section III then describes our data, while Section IV discusses our empirical

methodology and results. Section V concludes.


II. Business Groups in Italy

       Business groups remain a prevalent organizational form around the world, across

both developed and developing economies (e.g., La Porta et al. (1999); Khanna, (2000)).

Business groups are widely diffuse in Italy, and group affiliation appears to be a

persistent feature within the domestic corporate landscape (e.g., Cannari and Gola (1996);

Bianchi et al. (2005); Bianchi et al. (2008)). According to the Italian Civil Code, a

business group exists when a dominant influence on a firm is exerted through centralized

coordination. Such coordination may occur when control is performed on either a de jure




                                              7
or a de facto basis, or when a firm’s capital is equally distributed among different owners,

or when corporate decisions are subject to any shareholders agreements.


       Traditionally, a few key families and government entities played the central role

in shaping the ownership structure of major Italian business groups. Such families have

dominated the domestic corporate scene since the 1950s, initially benefiting from the

supportive role of the state and, later, from a revival of the stock market. The state’s role

– as well as the role of once-dominant families – has gradually decreased in the

governance structure of national groups, especially after the wave of privatization starting

in the 1990s. Indeed, after this phase, an internationalization process occurred during

which foreign groups increased their presence in Italy, especially in the large retail sector

and in telecommunications. Domestic groups also expanded their ownership structure

abroad, particularly in those countries that were experiencing fast economic development

(Santioni (2011)).

       Business groups play a prominent economic role in Italy. In 2014, with 5.6

million employees, they represent about one-third of total employment in the industrial

and service sectors, and they produce about 55 percent of total value added. Most groups

have a fairly simple structure, with just one or two active firms based in Italy. Other

large groups have a more complex ownership structure, often with more than ten

domestic firms. These large groups are fewer in number but have a stronger economic

impact. Many small groups are likely to be family dominated, with less structured

professional management and governance, and a higher weight given to the non-

pecuniary benefits from control.




                                              8
          The historical memory of bank failures in the 1920s and 30s, along with bank

reforms of 1936, generated a system in Italy with separation between banking and

industry, and between short-term and long-term lending institutions. While the latter

distinction disappeared in the 1990s, the separation between ownership of industry and

ownership of financial institutions still characterizes the Italian economy. For instance,

the 1993 banking law stipulates that entities with relevant industrial interests cannot

control more than 15% of voting shares of a banking institution. Moreover, banks are

restricted in their shareholding of non-financial firms to a maximum of 15% of bank

capital overall, and just 3% for shares in a single firm. Although some of these limits

were relaxed in 2008, there are no significant cross-ownership relationships between

banks and firms.7 Thus, business groups do not have special access to bank credit, as in

structures like the Japanese Keiretsu. Yet being a group member is likely to confer an

advantage in accessing external finance (Schiantarelli and Sembenelli (2000)).8


III. Data and Descriptive Statistics

          We build a novel dataset that combines the structure of Italian groups with data on

both firm performance and measures of the health of their bank (or banks). In this

section we describe the data sources and present some basic descriptive statistics.


III.i. Data




7
    The separation between banking and commerce in Italy is similar to the one that characterizes the US.
8
 On the real consequences of credit supply shocks in Italy see Cingano, Manaresi and Sette (2016) and
Balduzzi, Brancati, and Schiantarelli (2016).




                                                      9
       To build our data, we combine several sources. We rely on the Gruppi Italiani

data (produced by Cerved) for information on the ownership structures of the entire

universe of Italian groups (both financial and non-financial). We obtain the firm-level

balance sheet, income statement and statement of cash flows information from the

Centrale dei Bilanci data set (also from Cerved). We match these with firm-level

individual loan data from the Italian Credit Register and bank-level data from the Bank of

Italy Supervisory Reports to construct a firm-specific measure of the quality the bank (or

banks’) portfolio from which each firm borrows.

       We focus our analysis of intra-group capital transfers between firms affiliated

with large and small domestic business groups, as transfer to firms outside of Italy –

relevant for Italian firms associated with foreign groups or holding companies – are not

observable in our data. While the definition of a large versus small group is a bit

arbitrary, we use a cutoff of 50 employees and no more than 10 million euros in sales or

total asset to draw a distinction between groups likely to be controlled by a family versus

large ones that are more likely to have a formal group structure and professional

management. This categorization, we admit, is imperfect, so we report all of our results

both with and without this separation of the sample. Moreover, we want to avoid linking

the group-size definition to ex post success of firms owned by a given group type.

Hence, we define each group based on its size in the first year in which it enters the

sample, and then we leave the definition constant across all subsequent time periods.

Thus, we would keep a group that starts with, say, 60 employees but shrinks to 45 due to

poor performance in the large-group category.




                                             10
         Although ours is the first study able to combine the comprehensive financial

statement data to time-varying measure of ownership structure, we are restricted in our

access to just three points in time: 2006, 2010 and 2014.9 In other words, we can only

merge the ownership connections to the year-by-year financial statements during these

three points in time. In our regression analysis, which we describe in more detail below,

we focus on annual panel data from 2004 to 2014. Hence, we need to assume that

ownership connections remain constant over periods longer than a single year. To

minimize classification error, we assign ownership as follows: we use the 2006

ownership data for all firms during the years 2004-2007; the 2010 ownership information

we assign to the years 2008-2011; and the 2014 ownership data we assign to the years

2012-2014. Our strategy works well because business group affiliation in Italy is

persistent over time.

         After combining Cerved with the structural data from Gruppi Italiani, we apply

several filters to remove data that may be unreliable. First, we drop observations with

zero total assets or zero sales. Second, we include firms with financial statements

reported in abbreviated form, under the condition that financial or trade aggregates in the

balance sheet are recognized and fully disclosed. Third, we require the disclosure of the

full statement of cash flow. And fourth, we drop financial companies.

         According to national rules, firms are required to indicate their lending or

borrowing positions within the group on their balance sheets (article 2424 of the Italian

Civil Code). We use this information to construct Intra-Group Net Financial

Position/Assets, which equals the total amount of financial debt owed by a given firm to
9
 Santioni and Supino (2017) take a first step in this direction using ownership data for 2006 and 2014.
This paper contains a descriptive analysis of Italian groups and of the working of their internal capital
markets when credit becomes tight.




                                                     11
all other firms affiliated with the same group, net of loans provided, as a percentage of

the firm’s total assets. The variable represents non-arm’s length, net debt that, we argue,

provides the main tool used by groups to effect intra-group transfers of capital. Positive

values of Intra-Group Net Financial Position/Assets indicate that a firm is borrowing

(that is, demanding funds) from the internal capital market; negative values indicate that

the firm is lending (i.e., supplying funds) to the internal capital market. Hence, across all

firms in a given group, the variable averages to zero (appropriately weighted). We also

construct a second measure of intra-group transfers – the Intra-Group Net Position

(total)/Assets – that includes net trade debt as well as financial debt. Trade debt (Gross)

is less important quantitatively than financial debt, representing around 35% of gross

intragroup financial debt – the latter of which equals about 30% of total financial debt.

We do not include equity transfers because in the Italian context they are not a significant

method to transferring resources between group members. Disclosure on the details on

intragroup transactions, however, are not compulsory for those firms that prepare

abridged financial statements, so we drop those firms that do not report this item.

       Finally, we use the Credit Register loan data and the bank balance sheet

information from the Bank of Italy Supervisory Reports to construct our firm specific

measure of the health of each firm’s bank(s). Italy’s Credit Register is an archive

providing lender-borrower level data on characteristics of loans extended by banks

operating in Italy. The data include information on loan type (credit lines, term loans),

size, maturity, the pledging of real collateral, personal guarantees, accounts receivable,

and ex post performance. From 2009 on, loans are reported when tranches exceed

€30,000 by the entire population of credit institutions, having been lowered from €75,000




                                             12
before 2009. These data allow us to measure those banks from which each firm has

borrowed significant funds, which we in turn use to assess the average heath of each

firm’s banks. As such, we construct the variable Bad Loans, equal to the weighted

average of the banks’ ratio of bad loans to total assets, where the weights equal the

fraction of credit received by a given firm from each of its banks. This approach allows

us to exploit both the time series and cross sectional variation in a firm’s credit access.

As shown in Figure 3, Bad Loans has substantial variation both over time, rising on

average in the post-crisis years, and displaying an increased dispersion across firms.




III.ii. Summary Statistics

       Table 1 reports summary statistics for large-group and small-group affiliated

firms, as well as for unaffiliated firms, with these data broken into non-crisis (2004-2008)

and crisis (2009-2014) years. Clearly the small-group and unaffiliated firms are more

similar to each other in terms of size, than either type is relative to large-group affiliated

firms. For small-groups, the median firm has just €908,000 in assets, compared to

€417,000 for unaffiliated firms (non-crisis years); these are clearly very small firms on

average. (And, by construction the small-group affiliated firms start in the sample with

fewer than 50 employees.) In contrast, firms associated with large groups are themselves

much larger – at the median these firms have €5.9 million in assets (pre-crisis). All three

types experienced large declines in operating performance from the non-crisis to the

crisis years, with sales growth falling across the whole distribution.

       For the group-affiliated firms, Table 1 also shows how Intra-Group Net Financial

Position/Assets varies across firms and over time. As expected, the median value is near




                                              13
zero, which follows from the fact that the measure nets up to zero within each group.

The aggregate growth in gross intra-group financial borrowing shows a sharp increase in

internal capital transfers in 2011, the year that the Euro crisis reached its nadir (recall

Figure 2). As the figure also shows, lending from external source shrinks sharply in 2011

as well and the contraction continues into 2014.10 These aggregate patterns suggest

substitution from the external to internal sources of financing, although these overall

growth rates are also affected by the overall economic conditions (i.e., by demand for

capital). But the patterns clearly show an overall rise in the importance of the internal

capital market relative to the external financial markets during the crisis years.

           Table 2 reports transition probabilities for our firms over two, non-overlapping

periods: 2006 to 2010 and 2010 to 2014. Recall that these two periods (or, three points in

time) represent the only ones in which we have exact data allowing observation of firm

ownership. The transition matrix shows, first, that firms normally either remain in the

same category or they exit the sample. This general pattern holds in both periods.

Second, the rate of exit increases across all categories in the second period, which

represents most of the crisis years. Third, the increase in exit rates is higher for

unaffiliated and small-group affiliated firms than for firms affiliated with large groups.

For example, unaffiliated firms’ exit rates increase from 32.3% to 39.8%, an increase of

23%. Small group affiliated firms’ exit rates increase from 31.2% to 38%, as increase of

22%. In contrast, large-group affiliated firms’ exit rates increase much less, rising from

25.5% to 28.9% (or 13%). Although exit from the sample does not necessarily imply the

death of a firm, these simple comparisons suggest that affiliation with a large group may

enhances the likelihood that a firm will survive the poor economy and associated

reductions in bank credit that have plagued Italy in recent years. We will make more

precise what we mean by a firm “failing” and discuss the issue of firm survival more

formally in the next section.


IV. Empirical Methods and Results

       We now provide evidence on the importance of group membership before the

financial crisis and in the years that followed. These years include the sovereign debt

crisis and a steady deterioration of the health of Italian banks due to the accumulation of

bad loans on bank portfolios. The latter, in turn, reflected the poor overall performance

of the Italian economy. We first present an analysis of firm survival, comparing group-

affiliated and non-affiliated firms. We then investigate the determinants of intra-group

capital flows, focusing specifically on how these flows differ in the pre-crisis versus

crisis years, and how the health of the banking sector affects them.




IV.i Discrete-time hazard Analysis

       Is group affiliation beneficial to firms? If so, is it particularly important during

crisis? To answer these questions, we test whether group affiliation raises firm survival

probabilities, using a discrete-time proportional hazard model with time-varying

covariates (Allison (1982) and Singer and Willett (1993)). The model defines the hazard

probability for a given firm i over discrete time intervals (=one year in our context), as

follows:




                                             15
       Pit = Prob (Ti=t | Ti>=t, Xit),


where Pit represents the probability that firm i fails in period t, conditional on having

survived until the beginning of the interval. This probability depends on a set of time-

varying, firm-specific variables (Xit). So, for example, the hazard rate for 2011 would be

equal to the probability that the firm fails during the year 2011, conditional on its having

survived to the beginning of that year and conditional on its covariates at the beginning of

that year. Because time is measured in discrete intervals (years), these hazard rates are

proper probabilities and we model them using a standard logistic function. One major

advantage of this approach is that time-varying covariates can be introduced and their

coefficients estimated easily. With this formulation, the logistic function of the hazard

probability depends on time indicators and firm-specific, time-varying covariates, as

follows:


       Pit=1/[1+exp(Xi,tβ - αt)]


The equation becomes linear when rewritten in the log odds ratio form:


       Ln (Pi,t/(1-Pi,t)) = Xi,tβ + αt,


where Xi,t is the vector of k-covariates, β the associated vector of coefficients and αt year

indicator variables that we will allow also to vary by firm type.


       Since we want to draw inferences about the utility of the internal capital market

(i.e., the role of capital transfers), we need to control for the economic environment, the

set of cost conditions and the state of demand conditions facing firms, as these will all

have a large effect on survival but might be correlated with group affiliation. In addition,




                                             16
we need to account for firm size, as larger firms likely can absorb larger negative shocks

without failing compared to smaller firms. Similarly older firms may be less

informationally opaque than younger firms, more able to access external finance, and,

therefore, may have a higher probability of survival.11 Given these controls, we then

argue that any residual effect of group status on survival reflects advantages of the

internal capital market. Since all firms in Italy experience, to put it kindly, a challenging

economic downturn, this test should be quite powerful.


         The cost of the logit model is that we need to make a specific assumption about

the shape of the hazard probability function, but by doing so we can estimate models with

substantial heterogeneity related to location, industry, and time varying firm

characteristics. As a preliminary exercise that avoids making parametric assumptions, we

also report below further evidence on survival rates by plotting the Kaplan-Meier

estimate of the survival function and hazard rates over time for various types of firms.

We parameterize the covariates in the logit hazard model, as follows:


         Xi,tβ = β1Groupi + β2Groupi x Crisist + β3Sales Growthi,t -1+                                  (1)
         β4Cash flowi,t-1/Assetsi,t-2 + β5log agei + Year, Size, Province and Industry
         Indicators.



         In some specifications, the year effects vary by industry, province and size. In

Equation (1), the coefficients of interest are β1 and β2, as they test whether group

affiliated firms have higher (or lower) failure rates relative to unaffiliated firms before

and after the crisis. The unaffiliated firms provide the comparison sample for the group-
11
   Firm age may also proxy for hard-to-observe variables such as managerial risk aversion, which likely
affect failure rates. Note that our results linking failure rates to group states are not sensitive to whether or
not we control for age.




                                                       17
affiliated firms. We include only those firms that exist as of 2006, but we allow variables

that capture fundamental shocks – sales growth and cash flow – to change each year,

from 2006 to 2013. Group affiliation is allowed to change, while size and age are left at

their 2006 values. We also estimate models that separate the effect of group status based

on group size, as the aggregate data in Table 1 suggest that large group-affiliated firms

were more likely to survive during the crisis years.

        Equation (1) ‘controls’ for the general economic environment with the year

indicators. As such, we do not need to control for the direct effect of the Crisis indicator

in Equation (1). To control for specific shocks faced by firms, we control for lagged

values of both Sales Growth and Cash Flow, in addition to log age.12 In the hazard

model, however, large sets of fixed effects cannot be absorbed, as they can in linear

models. Instead, we parameterize and estimate the effects of indicator variables to

account for industry, region and size differences. Variation in the overall macroeconomic

environment is captured by the time-varying baseline hazard rate (αt). And, in some

models, we interact time with industry, region, and size effects.

        Our sample includes those firms that were present in the sample in 2006. Later

entrants are not considered. Moreover, we classify a firm as “failed” when it disappears

permanently from the sample. In some (few) cases, we miss the firm balance sheet for

one year, or even more, but then the firm reappears in the sample. In these cases we

delete the entire string of information for that firm. In the same spirit, we end our

survival analysis in 2013 and classify as failed in that year only firms that do not have a

balance sheet both in 2013 and 2014.

12
  We draw the distinction between own v. other cash flow and sales growth later in the analysis, when we
analyze the effects of group affiliation.




                                                   18
        The results for the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the survival function are reported in

Figure 4, while the estimates of the discrete-time hazard are contained in Table 3. The

simple results from the Kaplan-Meier analysis – which are no more than the raw survival

and hazard rates themselves – suggest that the survival of a large-group affiliated firm is

greater than that of both members of small groups or unaffiliated firms. For instance, the

probability that a firm belonging to a large group survives from 2006 until 2013 is 61

percent, while it is approximately 53 percent for the member of a small group and 50

percent for unaffiliated firms. These estimates, however, do not control for firm level

differences in growth opportunities or internal cash flow or for the industrial regional or

size characteristics (time invariant or time varying). As a result one cannot attribute the

differences in survival to a pure group effect, operating, for instance, through intra-group

transfers.

        To address fundamentals, Table 3 (Panel A) presents four specifications in which

we allow the difference between unaffiliated and group members to vary between the

pre- and post-crisis period. In column 1, we control (in addition to log age) for a

common year effect and for industry, location and size effects. We allow for 25

industries, 20 regions and two firm-size categories (small firms have fewer than 50

employees and sales or asset less than €10 million, with others classified as large). In

column 2, we introduce a firm’s own cash flow and own sales growth as additional

regressors. In column 3 and 4, we replicate these two specifications, but allow the year

effects to interact with industry, region and size. In Panel B of Table 3, we then allow the

group effects to differ between small versus large groups.




                                             19
        Recalling that a negative coefficient on a variable means that it lowers the

probability of failing, we see that unaffiliated firms fail at greater rates than group

members in the pre-crisis period, and this difference becomes statistically significantly

larger during the crisis period. In terms of magnitude, the odds ratio (Pi,t/(1-Pi,t)) of

failing in the crisis years for a group member firm equals 77% of an independent firm,

keeping constant the other firm characteristics (= exp(-0.26), using column 4 of Table 3,

Panel A). The effect of cash flow, sales growth and age enter the model as expected,

with older firms, firms with greater sales growth or with greater cash flow less likely to

fail. While the coefficient on cash flow is roughly 10 times as large as that the coefficient

on sales growth, its standard deviation is roughly 1/10; hence, their economic magnitudes

are roughly equivalent. Also, adding sales growth and cash flow decreases somewhat the

quantitative impact of group affiliation, but not by much and the effect remains highly

significant. Thus, group affiliation’s positive effect on firm survival does not appear to

be mainly due to better fundamentals. Rather – as we show below – the differential

survival reflects access to the internal capital market.

        Table 3, Panel B augments the model to allow differences related to both firm size

and group size. We do this in a simple way by constructing a set of mutually exclusive

and exhaustive indicator variables, as follows: Large Independent = 1 for large,

independent firms; Small Firm in Small Group = 1 for small firms in small groups; Small

Firms in Large Group = 1 for small firms in large groups; and Large Firms in Large

Group = 1 for large firms in large groups. Since small groups contain only small firms,

these indicator variables exhaust all configurations. Small independent firms serve as the




                                              20
omitted category. We also allow the effect of each firm-group-type indicator to vary

between the pre-crisis and crisis years.

        The coefficients suggest a sensible ordering of firm failure rates: small,

independent firms (the omitted category) are generally most likely to fail, as the

coefficients on all but one of the coefficients on the firm-group-type indicators sign

negatively. (The only exception: small firms in large groups during the pre-crisis years,

which fail at rates similar to unaffiliated, small firms.) Small firms affiliated with either

group type are next most likely to fail, followed by large independent firms, with large

firms affiliated with large groups being the least likely to fail. Hence, controlling for firm

size, group affiliation raises survival rates. The magnitudes suggest that large-group

affiliation has a much larger effect than small-group affiliation, and the difference in

these coefficients is statistically significant at any level of confidence. Moreover, the

value of group affiliation for survival increases during the crisis years for both small and

large firms, consistent with the more parsimonious specification in Panel A.

        To understand magnitudes, consider the effect of group affiliation on large-firm

failure, which can be inferred from the difference in the coefficients on Large

Independent v. Large Firms in Groups. In the pre-crisis years, group affiliation lowers

the odds ratio of failure for large affiliated firms by 0.07, relative to the large unaffiliated

ones, based on the coefficients from column 4 (= exp( -0.85) - exp(-0.69)). During the

crisis years, the advantage of group affiliation increases, with the odds ratio of failure

being 0.34 lower for group-affiliated, large firms (= exp( -0.96) - exp(-0.32)).

        Why do group-affiliated firms survive more than independent firms, especially

during the crisis years? Our specifications in Table 3 control for firm fundamentals, yet




                                               21
the magnitude of group affiliation changes little when we leave these controls out. Thus,

some mechanism other than a firm’s own access to cash flow or investment opportunities

must explain the benefits of group affiliation. To test whether access to the internal

capital market at the group level helps firms, we estimate survival models for the group-

affiliated firms only, and test whether cash resource at other group-affiliated firms

reduces this firm’s failure rate. In particular, we modify equation (1) as follows:



        Xi,tβ = β1Sales Growthi,t-1 + β2Other-Sales Growthi,t-1                            (2)
        + β3Cash flowi,t-1/Assetsi,t-2 β4Other-Cash flowi,t-1/Assetsi,t-2
        + β5Crisist x Sales Growthi,t-1 + β6Crisist x Other-Sales Growthi,t-1
        + β7Crisist x Cash flowi,t-1/Assetsi,t-2 + β8Crisist x Other-Cash flowi,t-1/Assetsi,t-2
        + β9log agei, + β10log(asset ratio)i,t-1 + Year, Size, Province and Industry
        Indicators.



        In equation (2), we condition on the average sales growth and average cash flow

of the other members of the firm’s group (Other-Sales Growth and Other-Cash

flow/Assets). In addition, we add a measure of the asset size of the firm relative to the

sum of assets across all firms in its group (log(asset ratio)). As such, these models

include only group-affiliated firms.

        Table 4 reports the results. Coefficients are separated into two blocks of rows,

with the first block reporting the effects of the firm’s own fundamentals and the second

reporting the effect of the fundamentals of other group-affiliated firms. As expected, a

firm’s own sales and cash flow shocks continue to affect failure rates very strongly (and

with similar magnitudes to the models in Table 3). In addition, shocks to other firms

affiliated with the group also have a statistically significant effect on this firm’s failure.




                                                22
Thus, the potential to share resources across the group’s internal capital market is

associated with lower failure. When other group-affiliated firms have high sales and/or

substantial cash flow, this firm is less likely to fail. The magnitudes are substantially

smaller than that of own sales and cash flow, which makes sense because the firm’s own

fundamentals affect not only its access to funds, but also correlate with the firm’s

profitability and future business opportunities. In addition, the effect of shocks to both

other sales growth and other cash flow increase in magnitude during the crisis years.




IV.ii Intra-group Capital Transfers

       Together, the results of Tables 3 and 4 suggest that group affiliation helps firms

survive by increasing their potential tor share funds across the group. Do firms actually

share financial resources? To answer this question, we analyze capital transfers across

group-affiliated firms. If internal capital markets explain group survival value, then

financial resource sharing ought to be more pronounced when external markets become

distressed. Hence, we first compare internal capital market transfers before versus after

the onset of crisis. Then, we construct a measure of constraints from the external markets

more precisely by exploiting firm-year variation in the health of a given firm’s banks in a

given year.

Crisis versus Non-Crisis Years

       To provide tests over time, we regress capital transfers on investment

opportunities and cash flow – both own and other – allowing these relationships to shift

over time. Investment opportunities measure a firm’s demand for financial resources,




                                             23
while cash flow measures a firm’s supply of internal financial resources. If the firm’s

relative demand exceeds its internal supply of cash, then it would need to fill a financing

gap either through a within-group transfer or by accessing the external market.

       Given this conceptual framework, we report our baseline regression strategies, as

follows:



       Net Transfer i,t =β1Sales Growthi,t + β2Other-Sales Growthi,t                     (3)
       + β3Cash flowi,t/Assetsi,t-1 + β4Other-Cash flow/Assetsi,t-1
       + β5Crisis,t x Sales Growthi,t + β6Crisist x Other-Sales Growthi,t
       + β7Crisist x Cash flowi,t/Assetsi,t-1 + β8Crisist x Other-Cash flowi,t/Assetsi,t-1
       + Fixed Effects + εi,t ,


where i represents the firm and t the year. We report the two measures for Net Transfer i,t

described in Section III.i: the first includes intra-group net financial borrowing scaled by

the end of previous period assets (we call this the Intra-Group Financial Position); the

second adds the intragroup net trade position (accounts payable minus accounts

receivable) to the intra-group net financial position in the numerator (we call this the

Intra-Group Financial and Trade Position). To capture investment opportunities, we

again use real sales growth. In some models we also allow coefficients to vary based on

the type of business group (large or small).

       The sample includes only group affiliated firms, as only these firms have access

to an internal capital market. We capture unobserved heterogeneity by including a series

of granular fixed effects: industry x year, province x year, and firm. We allow for 286

industrial sectors and 105 provinces, which generates much more detailed year effects in

our linear regression for intragroup transfers than in the non-linear survival models. In




                                               24
some specifications, we also add a group-specific year effects. Finally, when we allow

the slope coefficients to differ between small and large groups, we also permit the

industry and location specific year effects to differ according to group size. By including

so many fixed effects, we are able to remove potential sources of bias related to economic

conditions at the industry and geographical levels. Since we allow these effects to vary

with time, they will account for the rapid deterioration in the Italian economy during our

sample period (recall Figure 1). To construct standard errors, we double cluster by firm

and by group-year.13

        Equation (3) explicitly models the idea that relative demand for and supply of

funds is what motivates capital transfers. Other-Sales Growth captures the demand for

funds elsewhere in the group (i.e., in the internal capital markets), defined as in the

survival analysis. Other-Cash flow captures the availability of funds elsewhere in the

group, and is also defined as in the survival analysis. Conversely, Sales Growth captures

the effects of a firm’s own demand for funds and Cash Flow captures its own supply of

funds. We normalize each of the cash flow measures by the firm’s assets at the end of

the previous period; since the outcome is normalized with the same denominator, the

coefficients have a natural interpretation as the marginal effect of an additional unit of

cash flow on intra-firm transfers. In the most general specification, we incorporate group

x year fixed effects. This empirical strategy, by differencing out the group-time means, is

equivalent to re-defining the effects of investment opportunities and cash resources in a

relative sense within a given group in a given year.

13
   Fixed effects help allay concern about omitted variables but not reverse causality. For example, perhaps
receiving more capital transfers allows firms to experience higher cash flow or sales. This source of
endogeneity cannot explain why cash flow effects would become so much greater during the crisis.
Nevertheless, we have also estimated the regressions of Table 5 after lagging both cash flow and sales
growth one year. These results are similar to those presented in Table 5.




                                                    25
         Panel A of Table 5 reports the estimates for equation (3). We report each

regression first for Intra-Group Net Financial Positiont/Assetst-1 (columns 1 and 2), and

then for Intra-Group Net Financial and Trade Positiont/Assetst-1 (columns 3 and 4).14

Panel B allows the slope coefficients to differ between small groups and large ones. (The

group-type indicators are absorbed by fixed effects.) Positive coefficients indicate that an

increase in the explanatory variable leads a firm to use more funds from the internal

capital market, whereas negative coefficients mean that an increase in the explanatory

variable leads the firm to supply more funds to the internal capital market.

         Both Panels A and B suggest that group-affiliated firms make greater use of

capital transfers during the crisis years, particularly with regard to the effects of cash flow

on transfers. Sales growth positively affects transfers in both periods, meaning that

groups move capital efficiently – toward high sales growth firms. For example, the

coefficient on Sales Growth is positive and significant in both crisis and non-crisis years

(in both column 1 and 2), so funds flow toward high investment opportunity firms. Cash

flow affects capital transfers strongly, with much larger magnitudes during the crisis

years. The negative coefficient on Cash Flow implies that firms with high cash flow

supply funds to other firms in the group.

         These coefficients have a natural interpretation because they represent funds

available for investment (unlike sales growth, which acts as a proxy that helps capture

future investment opportunities). During the crisis years, for example, a 1-€ increase in a

firm’s own cash flow leads, approximately, to a 0.15€ decline in its borrowing from the


14
   We report transfers from financial plus trade credit as a robustness test, but our focus is on the financial
transfers. Adding trade credit reduces the sample substantially, so the results between columns 1-2 versus.
3-4 are not directly comparable, although the core result is similar. In future work, we will explore
differences in transfers between financial and non-financial resources (i.e. trade credit).




                                                      26
internal capital market; whereas a 1-€ increase in average cash elsewhere in the internal

capital market raises borrowing by this firms of about 0.02-0.03€ (column 1). Thus, the

marginal effect of cash generated at the firm level is much larger than that of cash flow

generated by other firms in the same group; this reflects the fact that firms in a group are

distinct legal and economic entities over which the holding company does not exercise

unchecked control. As a result each unit has a degree of control over the use of their own

cash compared to their control over cash generated elsewhere in the internal capital

market. Prior to the crisis, however, we don’t see as strong a link between internal

capital transfers and own cash, presumably because external finance is relatively

available. The models with group x year effects suggest larger effects; these imply that a

1-€ increase in Cash Flow (relative to the group-level average) decreases a firm’s use of

internal transfers by 0.20€ (column 2). The effect of Cash flow also increases in

magnitude when we also incorporate trade credit (columns 3 and 4), while the coefficient

of cash flow of other group members becomes less significant.

         Panel B allows the marginal effects of Sales Growth and Cash Flow to vary by

group size. These comparisons suggest, broadly, that large-group capital transfers

respond more strongly to Cash flow than smaller groups, whereas small groups are more

responsive to Other Cash flow than large groups.15 Moreover, the coefficients on Cash

flow and on Other Cash flow for small groups are more similar to each other. We also

find that small groups are unresponsive to Sales Growth in the pre-crisis period but this

pattern changes in the crisis. Large groups, in contrast, consistently transfer funds to

firms with high Sales Growth in both periods. These differences may reflect differences


15
   Despite these differences, the results below in Table 6b suggest that the effects of own and other cash
flow on transfers do not differ robustly between large and small groups.




                                                     27
in the management of the internal capital market related to agency problems, likely to be

most prevalent in small, family-controlled groups. That said, exploring this dimension in

detail is beyond the scope of this paper.16 For our thesis, what matters most is that both

group types clearly increase the use of the internal capital market during the crisis, as the

(negative) magnitude for Cash flow increases sharply between during the crisis years.

           Robustness across various permutations of fixed effects helps allay the concern

that omitted variables can explain our results. But, fixed effects do not address

endogeneity questions that might come from reverse causality. For example, perhaps

firms receiving more capital transfers are able to use the capital to generate higher sales

growth. However, if transfers indeed help promote sales, this would be an indication that

funds were not wasted in not sales enhancing expenditures. Nevertheless, we have also

estimated the regressions in Table 5 allowing sales growth to be endogenous and using its

own lagged values (once and twice) as additional instruments. These results are similar

in terms of sign, size and significance and are not reported here. 17 There is also a

potential endogeneity issue for cash flow, based on a parallel argument. The problem is

less worrisome because it would generate a positive coefficient on Cash Flow, not a

negative one as we find. Reverse causality also cannot explain why Cash Flow’s effect

would become so much greater in magnitude during the crisis.

           We have also estimated models like those in Equation (3) that allow the effects of

Cash flow (along with the other variables) to vary in each year. This model thereby

measures the sensitivity of capital transfers to both investment opportunities (sales

growth) and cash flows on a year by year basis. Rather than report all of these

     Our data do not allow us to identify groups that are family controlled.

     Results are not reported here, but are available from the authors’.

coefficients, Figure 5 summarizes the main finding by graphing the coefficient on Cash

flow over time. The results suggest that the cash flow coefficient is not statistically

significant before 2009, is consistently negative thereafter, and increases in magnitude as

the banking problems in Italy grow worse over these years. Hence, firms seem to use the

internal capital markets more aggressively as the banking system ceases to function well.

Bank Health and Transfers

       The results so far merely exploit time variation in coefficients, arguing (perhaps

loosely) that financial conditions deteriorate in the later years. While this is clearly true,

it is crude. To focus more precisely on bank credit availability (i.e., the availability of

external finance, as most is supplied by banks in Italy), we account for the health of each

firm’s bank(s), and we model this health directly in the capital transfer regressions. As

noted earlier, bank credit has declined sharply in Italy and earlier research suggests that

more distressed banks cut lending more than less distressed ones. Hence, we use Bad

Loans at the end of the previous year as a measure of bank health. Specifically, we

estimate models with the following structure:



       Net Flowj i,t =β1Sales Growthi,t + β2Other-Sales Growthi,t                      (4)
       + β3Cash flowi,t/Assetsi,t-1 +β4Other-Cash flowi,t/Assetsi,t
       + β5Bad Loansi,t-1 x Sales Growthi,t + β6Bad Loansi,t-1 x Other-Sales Growthi,t
       + β7Bad Loansi,t-1 x Cash flowi,t/Assetsi,t-1
       + β8Bad Loansi,t-1 x Other-Cash flowi,t/Assetsi,t-1 + β9Bad Loansi,t-1
       + Fixed effects + εi,t .


Equation (4) parallels Equation (3), but replaces the crisis interaction terms (which vary

only by time) with Bad Loansi,t-1 and its interactions, which vary both at the firm and




                                              29
time level. Bad Loansi,t-1 equals the average ratio of bad loans to assets for firm i’s

bank(s) at the end of the previous year, where we weight by the amount borrowed from

each bank.

       Panel A of Table 6 reports the results. Columns (1) and (2) contain data for the

full sample, and columns (3) and (4) contain data from just the post-crisis years. The

interaction between Cash Flow and Bad Loans consistently enters with a negative and

significant coefficient across all specifications, suggesting that firms with weak banks

substitute more into the internal capital market. This represents very convincing

evidence that the importance of internal markets increases when external debt markets

become more distressed. The interaction between Bad Loans and the Other Cash Flow

(as well as the Sales Growth measures), however, are typically not significant. The last

two columns, which use only the post-crisis sample, get identification only from variation

in bank distress, rather than from comparisons between pre- versus post-crisis years. The

coefficients of the interaction between own Cash Flow and Bad Loans are of similar

magnitude, and remain highly significant. Moreover, their economic significance is larger

because the variation in Bad Loans increases sharply during the crisis years (recall Figure

3).

       Panel B of 6 reports models with the Bad Loans interaction effects, splitting by

group size as in Table 5 (Panel B). To understand the implications of these interactive

models (Table 6, Panel A and B), we report Figures 6 and 7 with marginal effects of

Cash Flow estimated from the pooled model (Figure 6) and again separately for large

versus small groups (Figure 7). We report the marginal effects across the distribution of

lagged Bad Loans, varying from 0.01 to 0.07. The marginal effect increases as the health




                                             30
of the firm’s bank(s) worsens. At the overall mean for Bad Loans in the crisis years

(0.034), the marginal effect of cash flow is about -0.10 in the pooled model. For firms

whose banks are one standard deviation above the mean of Bad Loans, the marginal

effect approximately doubles (and it is cut in half for firms that are one standard

deviation below the mean). For firms whose banks are most distressed, therefore, each 1-

€ decline in internal cash brings 0.2€ transfer from other group members.

       Finally, over most of the distribution of bank health, the marginal effect of Cash

Flow is greater for firms belonging to larger groups than for smaller ones (Figure 7).

This confirms that larger groups generally respond more strongly with internal transfers

when a firm suffers a negative cash flow shock. The effect becomes larger for smaller

groups only when a firm’s lending banks become very distressed (above the 90th

percentile).

Is the Internal Capital Market Efficient?

       We have seen that group membership increases firm survival, that this effect is

stronger in groups with high cash flow, and that groups move capital across firms during

the crisis years. Are these actions efficiency enhancing? Or, are groups propping up

weak firms (perhaps for reasons related to agency problems)? Most of our results point

toward efficiency. For example, sales growth is a strong predictor of both firm survival

and also, in most cases, of intra-group capital transfers. Among large groups, we find a

consistent positive relationship between sales growth and capital transfers in both the pre-

crisis and post-crisis years. For firms in small groups, this relationship is weak during the

non-crisis years, but becomes positive and significant during the crisis.




                                             31
         As a last test for efficiency, Table 7 reports the capital transfer models of Panel B

of Table 6, after adding an interaction between the two cash flow variables (own and

other) with an indicator variable equal to one for firms with above-median sales growth

for that year. Efficiency in the internal capital market would imply that low cash flow

firms with high sales ought to receive more intra-group transfers than low cash flow firms

with low sales. In other words, Above-Median Sales*Cash flow ought to enter

negatively. The opposite would be true for other cash flow, meaning that Above-Median

Sales*Other Cash flow ought to enter positively.

         For large groups, we find precisely these effects, and they are significant (or

almost significant at conventional levels) for both dimensions of cash flow shocks (own

and other). The economic effect is large, suggesting that the incremental effect of a

firm’s own Cash flow on internal transfers rises in (absolute) magnitude by about 0.03 to

0.08 for high-sales firms, which represents between an 80% to 120% increase above the

effect of Cash flow for low sales growth firms belonging to a large group. The effect of

high sales on the marginal effect of cash flow for small groups, however, enters

significantly only for the Other Cash flow term in the specification without group-year

fixed effects. Taken together, our results suggest that large groups make better use of

their internal capital markets than small ones.18

Bank Debt and Intra-Group Transfers

         Up to now we have focused on how cash is transferred within a group: the cash

earned by an affiliated firm can provide financing for other member firms and this effect

18
   We have also tested whether capital transfers respond more to cash flow for the largest firm within
groups. The evidence, which might point toward agency-based explanations for transfers, does not suggest
that transfers are more sensitive to cash flow in the case of ‘dominant” firms. We do not report these results
here, but they are available from the authors.




                                                     32
intensifies when external financial markets are distressed. However there is another

source of funding for intra-group transfers: a firm may borrow externally and then extend

that credit internally, effectively sharing their debt capacity with affiliated group

members. Such sharing likely diminishes in times when credit markets are tight.

       To investigate the role of external finance as funds for the internal capital market,

we add bank debt to assets (from the prior year) to our specifications. Because bank debt

is a dimension of firm financial policy (as are net transfers, the outcome in these models),

drawing a causal inference becomes less compelling than in our earlier models that focus

on operating variables (i.e., cash flow and sales growth). Hence, we introduce this

variable as part of our last set of tests, with the caveat that drawing clear causal

inferences is difficult. As before, we include both a firm’s own bank borrowing and also

bank debt to assets averaged across all other firms in the group. We focus on bank debt

because it acts as the main source of external finance in Italy. Table 8 reports those

specifications that allow coefficients to vary between the pre and crisis periods (as in

Table 5). In Table 9, we replace the crisis/non-crisis interaction terms with interactions

using Bad Loans (as in Table 6).

       The results confirm, as expected, that a firm’s own borrowing enters significantly

with a negative sign, while that of other affiliated firms enters positively. Thus, an

increase in a firm’s own debt capacity increases its net transfers to other firms;

conversely, an increase in the average debt capacity of other firms in the group increases

net transfers to this firm. Moreover, the results in Table 8 show that these effects are

attenuated during periods of crisis, when credit tightens. Thus, when external finance is

less abundant – during the crisis years – group-affiliated firms actively share cash flow




                                              33
(internal funds); in contrast, when external finance is more abundant, they actively share

debt capacity (external funds). These conclusions are confirmed by the results in Table 9.

When the health of the bank(s) a firm borrows from deteriorates, less of the external

funds are distributed to other firms in the group. Specifically, the interaction between a

firm’s own bank borrowing and the health of its lenders enters positively (significantly so

in most models), meaning that weakened banking mitigates the sharing of debt capacity.19


V. Conclusions

        We have shown that group affiliation becomes very important for firm survival

during the economic and financial distress that has plagued the Italian economy in recent

years. This effect does not reflect differences in fundamentals or cash flow to firms.

Group affiliation is not strongly correlated with changes in firm’s fundamentals during

the crisis years, as both affiliated and unaffiliated firms’ fortunes deteriorated sharply.

But group-affiliated firms have access to internal capital markets, which allows them to

survive despite declining credit supplied by banks. As evidence, we show that the overall

use of internal capital transfers increases sharply during the crisis years, and that those

transfers move funds from relatively cash-rich to relatively cash-poor firms within the

internal capital market. Transfers also respond positively to better investment

opportunities. Moreover, the marginal effect of a drop in cash flow on transfers is greater

for high sale growth firms belonging to large groups. We also find that the ability to

19
  We have also explored whether there is any evidence that lending becomes more concentrated during the
crisis is a very limited number of firms. There is no clear evidence supporting this, using the CR1 or CR2
concentration ratios. Moreover we did not find evidence that the holding or sub-holdings play a large and
increasing role in borrowing from the outside. For instance, the firm with the highest bank borrowing
relative to total bank borrowing of the group, are holdings or sub-holdings only in approximately 20% of
the cases and this percentage does not vary much over time.




                                                   34
borrow from banks provides additional funds that are shared with other group members,

but this mechanism loses its potency during the crisis period. This last finding highlights

the importance of internal sources of funds combined with an active internal capital

market as a substitute for banking and external finance.

         This table reports regressions of intra-group transfers as a function of sales growth, cash flow and rating
         at the firm-level and cash flow, sales growth and rating for other firms affiliated with the same group.
         Columns 1 and 2 include just net financial transfers, while columns 3 and 4 incorporate net trade position.
         Increases in the dependent variable reflect increased borrowing from group-affiliated sources.

        Figure 1: Italian GDP growth rate and Aggregate Bad loans Ratio

This figure reports Italian GDP growth rate and the aggregate bad loan to total loan ratio for
the Italian banking system from 2003 to 2015.




                     Figure 2: Gross Intra-Group Financial Debt

This figure reports the growth in aggregate Gross Intra-Group Financial Debt, bank debt for
continuing firms. Values in 2004 normalized to 100. The description of variables and their
data sources are provided in the Appendix.

                                 Figure 3: Bad loans ratio

This figure reports the time-series and cross-sectional variation of the median and 5th and 95th
percentile range for the firm-bank’s bad loans-to-assets ratio, from 2004 to 2014. The
description of variables and their data sources are provided in the Appendix.




                            Figure 4: Kaplan-Meier survival estimates

This figure plots the Kaplan-Meier survival estimates for firms that exist in 2006 over the subsequent
seven years (until 2013). The vertical axis equals the fraction of firms that remain in the sample in that
year.

                          Figure 5: Cash flow coefficients by year

This figure reports the coefficient on firm cash flow in regressions of Net Intra-group Capital
Transfers like those of Table 5, allowing the marginal effect to vary in each year in the sample.




                        Figure 6: Marginal effect of own cash flow

This figure plots the marginal effect of own cash flow on intra group transfer (vertical axis) as a
function of the bad loans ratio (horizontal axis), based on the models of Table 6A.

               Figure 7: Marginal effect of own cash flow, by group size

This figure plots the marginal effect of own cash flow on intra group transfer (vertical axis) as a
function of the bad loans ratio (horizontal axis), for small and large groups. The regression
coefficients are based on the models of Table 6B.
