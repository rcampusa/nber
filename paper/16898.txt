                                             ABSTRACT

This study explores the role of investor sentiment in a broad set of anomalies in cross-sectional stock
returns. We consider a setting where the presence of market-wide sentiment is combined with the
argument that overpricing should be more prevalent than underpricing, due to short-sale impediments.
Long-short strategies that exploit the anomalies exhibit profits consistent with this setting. First, each
anomaly is stronger—its long-short strategy is more profitable—following high levels of sentiment.
Second, the short leg of each strategy is more profitable following high sentiment. Finally, sentiment
exhibits no relation to returns on the long legs of the strategies.

1.        Introduction

Whether investor sentiment affects stock prices is a question of long-standing interest to
economists. At least as early as Keynes (1936), numerous authors have considered the pos-
sibility that a significant presence of sentiment-driven investors can cause prices to depart
from fundamental values. The classic argument against sentiment effects is that they would
be eliminated by rational traders seeking to exploit the profit opportunities created by mis-
pricing. If rational traders cannot fully exploit such opportunities, however, then sentiment
effects become more likely.

       This study investigates the presence of sentiment effects by combining two concepts
that are prominent, separately, in the related literature. The first concept is that investor
sentiment contains a market-wide component with the potential to influence prices on many
securities in the same direction at the same time.1 The second concept, which traces to Miller
(1977), is that impediments to short selling play a significant role in limiting the ability of
rational traders to exploit overpricing.2 As Miller argues (p. 1154),
         A market with a large number of well informed investors may not have any grossly
         undervalued securities, but if those investors are unwilling to sell short (as they
         often are) their presence is consistent with a few investments being overvalued.
Combining Miller’s argument with the presence of market-wide sentiment replaces the “few”
overpriced investments with potentially many such investments when market-wide sentiment
is high. In contrast, periods of low market-wide sentiment, by Miller’s reasoning, should not
be accompanied by substantial underpricing.

       We explore sentiment-related overpricing as at least a partial explanation for 11 asset-
pricing “anomalies” that survive adjustments for exposure to the three factors of Fama and
French (1993). These anomalies reflect sorts on measures that include financial distress, net
stock issues, composite equity issues, total accruals, net operating assets, momentum, gross

profit-to-assets, asset growth, return-on-assets, and investment-to-assets.3 For each anomaly,
we examine the strategy that goes long the stocks in the highest-performing decile and short
those in the lowest-performing decile. We then use the market-wide investor sentiment index
constructed by Baker and Wurgler (2006) to explore sentiment effects.

      We investigate three hypotheses that result from combining the presence of market-wide
sentiment with the Miller short-sale argument. The first hypothesis is that the anomalies,
to the extent they reflect mispricing, should be stronger following high sentiment. If the
primary form of mispricing is indeed overpricing, then mispricing should be more prevalent
when sentiment is high. We find that each of the 11 anomalies is stronger following high
levels of investor sentiment (i.e., levels of sentiment above the median value). When averaged
across anomalies, 70% of the benchmark adjusted profits from a long-short strategy occur in
months following levels of investor sentiment above its median value. Time-series regressions
confirm a significant positive relation between investor sentiment and the long-short anomaly
profits.

      The second hypothesis is that the returns on the “short-leg” portfolio of each anomaly
should be lower when sentiment is high. The stocks in the short leg are relatively overpriced
compared to the stocks in the long leg, to the extent the anomaly reflects mispricing. More-
over, the stocks in the short leg should be more overpriced when sentiment is high. For
each of the 11 anomalies, we find that the return on the short leg is lower following high
sentiment. When averaged across anomalies, 78% of the benchmark adjusted profits from
shorting that leg occur in months following high sentiment. Time-series regressions confirm
a significant negative relation between investor sentiment and the returns on the short leg.

      The third hypothesis is that investor sentiment should not greatly affect returns on the
“long-leg” portfolio of each anomaly. If, as in the Miller argument, there is no underpricing,
then the returns on the long leg should not be higher following low sentiment than following
high sentiment. When market-wide sentiment is high, the stocks in the long leg could
be overpriced, but the long leg should contain the least degree of overpricing. Overall,
we should not expect to see sentiment playing much of a role in the long-leg returns. This
hypothesis is also confirmed. None of the 11 long legs exhibit a significant difference between
high and low sentiment periods. When averaged across anomalies, the benchmark-adjusted
returns on the long leg exhibit only a 4 basis-point monthly difference between high and
low sentiment periods. Time-series regressions confirm the absence of a relation between
  3
    Chen, Novy-Marx, and Zhang (2010) report that these anomalies are especially hard to explain using
traditional asset pricing models such as the CAPM or Fama-French 3-factor model.

benchmark-adjusted long-leg returns and investor sentiment.

   Perhaps the study most closely related to ours is that of Baker and Wurgler (2006), who
argue that market-wide sentiment should exert stronger impacts on stocks that are difficult
to value and hard to arbitrage. They examine returns on stocks judged most likely to possess
both characteristics, as proxied by a number of observable variables. They conclude that
market-wide sentiment is associated with cross-sectional return differences that are consistent
with the importance of those characteristics. A key difference between our study and theirs is
that we consider impediments to short-selling as the major obstacle to eliminating sentiment-
driven mispricing. To the extent such mispricing exists, overpricing should then be more
prevalent than underpricing, and overpricing should be more prevalent when market-wide
sentiment is high. In order to explore the presence of such mispricing effects on a market-wide
basis, we examine a broad set of 11 well-documented anomalies relative to the Fama-French
three factor model. None of these anomalies are examined by Baker and Wurgler.

     Another related study is Yu and Yuan (2010), who show that the correlation between
the market’s expected return and its conditional volatility is positive during low-sentiment
periods and nearly flat during high-sentiment periods. Their study envisions a setting similar
in spirit to ours, in that they argue the market is less rational during high-sentiment periods,
due to higher participation by noise traders in such periods.

     The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 develops our hypotheses. Section
3 discusses the investor-sentiment data and describes returns on the long-short strategies
constructed for each of the 11 anomalies. Sections 4 reports the main empirical results.
Section 5 investigates the robustness of our results to macroeconomic effects as well as the
use of an alternative sentiment index. Section 6 concludes.



2.      Hypotheses

Here we develop the hypotheses used to explore mispricing as at least a partial explanation
for the broad set of anomalies we consider. Our hypothesized setting combines two prominent
concepts: market-wide sentiment and short-sale impediments.

     For many years, researchers in finance have argued that empirical evidence supports the
notion that the beliefs of many stock-market investors include a common time-varying “senti-
ment” component that exerts market-wide effects on equity prices. Lee, Shleifer, and Thaler
(1991), for example, conclude that market-wide sentiment contributes to the differences be-

                                               3
tween prices of close-end funds and their net asset values. Ritter (1991) reports evidence of
long-run reversals in returns on initial public offering (IPO) stocks, and he concludes that
the evidence is consistent with periodic waves of optimism that especially impact the prices
of young growth stocks.

   Numerous studies have argued that there exist short-sale impediments in the stock mar-
ket, due to institutional constraints, arbitrage risk, behavioral biases of traders, and trading
costs. First, many institutional investors, such as mutual funds, are simply prohibited by
their charters from taking short positions. Second, even investors who do not face institu-
tional constraints or high shorting costs can nevertheless be deterred by the risks in arbitrage,
as discussed by Shleifer and Vishny (1997). Traders who short a security in the belief that
its price is too high can be correct, in that the price will eventually fall, but they face the risk
that the price will go up before it goes down. Such a price move, requiring additional capital,
can force the traders to liquidate at a loss. A similar risk does not arise for long positions
without leverage. Shleifer and Vishny (1997) further argue that such arbitrage risk looms
particularly large for institutional managers, whose career paths depend heavily on recent
performance. Third, individual investors, due to limited knowledge or behavioral biases, are
reluctant to take short positions. For example, Barber and Odean (2008) document that
only 0.29% of positions of individual investors are short positions. Finally, shorting can be
costly. D’Avolio (2002), for example, finds that many stocks are costly to short due to low
supplies of stock loans from institutional investors.

   Miller (1977) argues that, with short-sale impediments, overpricing should be more preva-
lent than underpricing. Investors with the most optimistic views about a stock, relative to
the views of other investors, will exert the greatest effect on the stock’s price, since their
views are not counterbalanced by the valuations of the relatively less optimistic investors.
The latter investors are inclined to take no position if they view the stock as undervalued,
rather than take a short position. When the most optimistic investors are too optimistic and
overvalue the stock, overpricing results. In contrast, underpricing is less likely: as long as the
cross-section of views includes the view of rational investors, the most optimistic investors
do not undervalue the stock.

   Combining market-wide sentiment with Miller’s argument about the effect of short-sale
impediments leads to our hypotheses. During periods of high market-wide sentiment, the
most optimistic views about many stocks tend to be overly optimistic, and many stocks
tend to be overpriced. During low-sentiment periods, the most optimistic views about many
stocks tend to be those of the rational investors, and thus mispricing during those periods


                                                 4
is less likely. Therefore, mispricing is more likely during high-sentiment periods than during
low-sentiment periods. We examine 11 different anomalies. If each of these anomalies at
least partially reflects mispricing, we then arrive at our first hypothesis:

   Hypothesis 1: The anomalies should be stronger following high investor sentiment.

   Consider a long-short strategy whose positive average profit reflects the unexplained
cross-sectional difference in average returns constituting an “anomaly.” To the extent that
an anomaly represents mispricing, the profits of the long-short strategy can reflect relatively
greater overpricing of stocks in the short leg, relatively greater underpricing of stocks in the
long leg, or both. In our hypothesized setting, overpricing should be the prevalent form of
mispricing, so the profits of the long-short strategy should arise primarily from overpricing
of stocks in the short leg. Since overpricing should be greater during high-sentiment periods,
we arrive at our second hypothesis:

   Hypothesis 2: The short legs of the long-short strategies should have lower returns (greater
profits) following high investor sentiment.

   The stocks in the long leg are unlikely to be underpriced in our simple scenario. They
could be overpriced, and overpricing would be more likely when sentiment is high. If the
anomaly’s sorting variable is related to mispricing, however, the overpricing of the stocks in
the long leg should be the smallest in the cross-section. Taking this reasoning to its limit,
we entertain the possibility that any sentiment-related overpricing of the long-leg stocks is
minimal. We thus arrive at our third hypothesis:

   Hypothesis 3: The long legs of the long-short strategies should have similar returns fol-
lowing high and low investor sentiment.

   It is useful to clarify in our setting the role of cross-sectional dispersion in investors’ views.
Arguing that underpricing is unlikely requires the view of rational investors to lie within the
cross-section of views across all investors. When sentiment is low, investors’ views must be
sufficiently disperse to include rational valuations, even if the latter views are then the most
optimistic views. To that extent, cross-sectional dispersion of views is a necessary ingredient
of our hypothesized setting.

   Our setting does not assign a role for variation over time in the cross-sectional dispersion
of views. We simply assume that the views of the most optimistic investors in the cross-
section are more likely to be too optimistic when our empirical measure of investor sentiment
is high than when it is low. There are various ways that can happen. As our sentiment

                                                 5
measure increases, the cross-sectional mean of investors’ views can remain close to a rational
valuation level while the cross-sectional dispersion of views increases. Alternatively, as our
sentiment measure increases, the dispersion of views can remain relatively constant, or even
decline, while the mean of investors’ views increases significantly above a rational valuation
level. Distinguishing among such scenarios is beyond the scope of our study.



3.      Data: Investor sentiment and anomalies

3.1.     Investor Sentiment

We measure investor sentiment using the monthly market-based sentiment series constructed
by Baker and Wurgler (2006). The index spans over 42 years, from July 1965 to December
2007. Baker and Wurgler (2006) form their composite sentiment index by taking the first
principal component of six measures of investor sentiment. The principal component analysis
filters out idiosyncratic noise in the six measures and captures their common component.
The six measures are the closed-end fund discount, the number and the first-day returns of
IPO’s, NYSE turnover, the equity share in total new issues, and the dividend premium.

     The BW sentiment index is plotted in Figure 1. It appears to capture most anecdotal
accounts of fluctuations in sentiment. Immediately after the 1961 crash of growth stocks,
investor sentiment was low but rose to a subsequent peak in the 1968 and 1969 “Electronics
Bubble.” Sentiment fell again by the mid-1970s, but it picked up and reached a peak in the
“Biotech Bubble” of the early 1980s. In the late 1980s, sentiment dropped but rose again in
the early 1990s, reaching its most recent peak during the “Internet Bubble.”


3.2.     Anomalies

We explore previously documented differences in cross-sectional average returns that survive
adjustment for exposures to the three factors defined by Fama and French (1993). Using
the Fama-French model as the benchmark against which to define the set of “anomalies”
imposes a higher hurdle than the single-factor CAPM of Sharpe (1964) and Lintner (1965)
while still providing a broad set. With the CAPM as the benchmark, the set of documented
anomalies would expand to an unmanageable size.

     We consider 11 well-documented anomalies:


                                              6
   1 and 2: Financial Distress

    Financial distress is often invoked to explain otherwise anomalous patterns in the cross-
section of stock returns. However, Campbell, Hilscher, and Szilagyi (2007) find that firms
with high failure probability have lower rather than higher subsequent returns (anomaly
1). Campbell et al. suggest that their finding is a challenge to standard models of rational
asset pricing. Using Ohlson’s (1980) O-score as the distress measure yields similar results
(anomaly 2).

   3 and 4: Net Stock Issues and Composite Equity Issues

   The stock issuing market has been long viewed as producing an anomaly arising from
sentiment-driven mispricing: smart managers issue shares when sentiment-driven traders
push prices to overvalued levels. Ritter (1991) and Loughran and Ritter (1995) show that, in
post-issue years, equity issuers underperform matching nonissuers with similar characteristics
(anomaly 3). Daniel and Titman (2006) study an alternative measure, composite equity
issuance, defined as the amount of equity a firm issues (or retires) in exchange for cash
or services. Under this measure, seasoned issues and share-based acquisitions increase the
issuance measure, while repurchases and dividends reduce this issuance measure. They also
find that issuers underperform nonissuers (anomaly 4).

   5: Total Accruals

   Sloan (1996) shows that firms with high accruals earn abnormal lower returns on average
than firms with low accruals, and suggests that investors overestimate the persistence of the
accrual component of earnings when forming earnings expectations.

   6: Net Operating Assets

   Hirshleifer, Hou, Teoh, and Zhang (2004) find that net operating assets scaled by total
assets is a strong negative predictor of long-run stock returns. They suggest that investors
with limited attention tend to focus on accounting profitability, neglecting information about
cash profitability, in which case net operating assets, measured as the cumulative difference
between operating income and free cash flow, captures such a bias.

   7: Momentum

   The momentum effect, discovered by Jegadeesh and Titman (1993), is one of the most
robust anomalies in asset pricing. It refers to the phenomenon that high past recent recent
returns forecast high future returns. In a contemporaneous study, Antoniou, Doukas, and

                                              7
Subrahmanyam (2010) find that the momentum effect is stronger when sentiment is high, and
they suggest this result is consistent with the slow spread of bad news during high-sentiment
periods.

   8: Gross Profitability Premium

   Novy-Marx (2010) discovers that sorting on gross-profit-to-assets creates abnormal benchmark-
adjusted returns, with more profitable firms having higher returns than less profitable ones.

   9: Asset Growth

   Cooper, Gulen, and Schill (2008) find companies that grow their total asset more earn
lower subsequent returns. They suggest that this phenomenon is due to investors’ initial
overreaction to changes in future business prospects implied by asset expansions.

   10: Return on Assets

   Fama and French (2006) find that more profitable firms have higher expected returns than
less profitable firms. Chen, Novy-Marx, and Zhang (2010) show that firms with higher past
return-on-assets earn abnormally higher subsequent returns. Wang and Yu (2010) find that
the anomaly exists primarily among firms with high arbitrage costs and high information
uncertainty, suggesting that mispricing is a culprit.

   11: Investment-to-Assets

   Titman, Wei, and Xie (2004) and Xing (2008) show that higher past investment predicts
abnormally lower future returns. Titman, Wei, and Xie (2004) attribute this anomaly to
investors’ initial underreactions to the overinvestment caused by managers’ empire-building
behavior.

   As noted earlier, defining anomalies with respect to the CAPM, using just a single market
benchmark instead of the three Fama-French benchmarks, would add substantially more
anomalies. Chief among them would be the two additional Fama-French factors: the return
spread between small and large firms (SMB)—the “size” factor—and the return spread
between firms with high and low book-to-market ratios (HML)—the “value” factor. Baker
and Wurgler (2006) document significant effects of investor sentiment on both the size and
value factors. They find that, when sentiment is high, subsequent returns are low on stocks
judged harder for investors to price: small stocks as well as on stocks at both extremes
of the value-growth spectrum. If the size and value factors are viewed as anomalies that
reflect only mispricing, then the Baker-Wurgler results would appear to be inconsistent with

                                              8
our basic story that anomalies are stronger following high sentiment. For example, the
size factor, which takes a long position in small stocks, is actually weaker following high
sentiment. Many researchers have argued, however, that the size and value factors are not
solely the result of mispricing but instead reflect priced systematic risks not captured by the
CAPM. If we were to entertain the size and value factors as being part mispricing and part
risk compensation, our sentiment story would apply to the “anomalous” mispricing part.
Without a model to separate the two parts, however, extending our analysis to the size and
value factors seems difficult.


3.3.       Long-short strategies

For each of the 11 anomalies, we obtain value-weighted portfolio returns within each decile
of the anomaly’s sorting variable. We then construct a long-short strategy using the extreme
deciles, 1 and 10, with the long leg being the higher-performing decile (as reported by previous
studies and confirmed in our sample period). For all but one of the anomalies, our decile
portfolio returns are also used in Chen, Novy-Marx, and Zhang (2010).4 For the remaining
anomaly—gross profit to assets—we construct portfolios following the procedure in Novy-
Marx (2010). We also construct a “combination” strategy that takes equal positions across
the long-short strategies constructed in any given month. Most of the portfolio returns
cover the period from August 1965 through January 2008. Due to more stringent data
requirements, the portfolios sorted by O-score (anomaly 2) and ROA (anomaly 10) are
available beginning in January 1972, while the failure-probability portfolios (anomaly 1)
start in December 1974.

      Table 1 reports properties of monthly returns on the long-short strategies across all
months in our sample period. Panel A reports correlations among the long-short return
spreads. Overall, the strategies are not highly correlated with each other. For the 11 individ-
ual strategies, the percentages of overall variance explained by each of the first five principal
components are [32.3, 20.2, 8.9, 8.3, 8.0], and even the last principal component still explains
2.0 percent. Of the 11 strategies, the first one listed—Failure Probability—exhibits the high-
est correlations with the other strategies, and its correlation with the combination strategy
is 0.83. The asset-growth and investment/assets strategies exhibit the lowest correlations
with the other strategies, although their correlation with each other is 0.61.

      Panel B of Table 1 reports averages and accompanying t-statistics for the excess monthly
  4

returns (returns in excess of the monthly Treasury bill rate) on the long and short legs of
each strategy as well as the long/short return spreads. Panel C reports the corresponding
values for “benchmark-adjusted” returns, which in this study we define as returns net of
what is attributable to exposures to the market, size, and value factors constructed by Fama
and French (1993): the excess return on the stock market (MKT ), a return spread between
small and large firms (SMB), and a return spread between stocks with high and low book-
to-market ratios(HML).5 That is, the benchmark-adjusted average return on a strategy is
the estimate of ai in the regression,

                          Ri,t = ai + bMKTt + cSMBt + dHMLt + i,t.                                     (1)

where Ri,t is the strategy’s excess return in month t. All 11 of the long/short strategies
produce significant positive average return spreads in both panels B and C—consistent with
their being identified as “anomalies” for this study. The average benchmark-adjusted return
spread for the combined strategy is 87 basis points (bp) per month, with the individual
strategies ranging from 43 bp (composite equity issues) to 177 bp (momentum).



4.        Empirical analysis: Sentiment and returns

4.1.       Average returns: Low versus high sentiment

We first classify returns each month as following either a high-sentiment month or a low-
sentiment month. A high-sentiment month is one in which the value of the BW sentiment
index in the previous month is above the median value for the sample period, while the low-
sentiment months are those with below-median values. We then compute average returns
separately for the high- and low-sentiment months. Table 2 reports results for excess returns,
while Table 3 reports results for returns adjusted by the three Fama-French benchmarks.6

       First consider Hypothesis 1, which predicts that the anomalies should be stronger fol-
lowing high sentiment than following low sentiment. Tables 2 and 3 reveal that each of
the long-short spreads exhibits higher average profits following high sentiment: all of the
values in the last column of each table are positive. In Table 2, the t-statistics for 8 of the
11 anomalies reject, at a 0.05 significance level, the null hypothesis of no sentiment-related
difference in favor of the (one-sided) alternative represented by Hypothesis 1. The combined

    The Appendix reports, in Table A1, results based on returns adjusted for just a single market benchmark,
instead of the three Fama-French benchmarks. All conclusions are very similar.


                                                    10
long-short spread earns 93 bp more per month following high sentiment, with a t-statistic
equal to 4.25. In Table 3, with benchmark-adjustment returns, 7 of the 11 individual t-
statistics reject the null in favor of Hypothesis 1, and the combined long-short spread earns
70 bp more per month following high-sentiment (t-statistic: 3.74). In Table 2, the long/short
profits on the combined strategy in high-sentiment months account for 80% of that strategy’s
profits earned across all months. In Table 3, the corresponding share is 70%. Overall, the
results in Tables 2 and 3 provide strong support for Hypothesis 1.

   Next consider Hypothesis 2, which predicts that average returns on the short leg should
be significantly lower following high sentiment than following low sentiment. The support for
this hypothesis is especially strong. In both Tables 2 and 3, the short legs of all 11 anomaly
strategies have a lower average return following high sentiment, and 10 of them have t-
statistics that reject the no-difference null in favor of Hypothesis 2 at a 0.05 significance level.
In Table 2, based on excess returns, the short leg of the combined strategy earns 132 bp less
per month following high sentiment (t-statistic: -2.41) than following low sentiment. The
short leg of that strategy actually earns a negative average excess return of -68 bp per month
following high sentiment (t-statistic: -1.54). In contrast, the same short leg earns a positive
average excess return of 65 bp following low-sentiment. We see in Table 3 that adjusting
for benchmark exposure shrinks the differences between high- and low-sentiment returns on
the short leg, as compared to the excess returns reported in Table 2. Nevertheless, in Table
3, the difference for the combined strategy is still 66 bp per month (t-statistic: −3.89), and
78% of the short-leg profits across all months occur in the months following high sentiment.

   The evidence in Tables 2 and 3 appears to support an inference that sentiment-driven
overpricing is at least a partial explanation for all of the anomalies analyzed here. The
anomalies are stronger following high investor sentiment (Hypothesis 1), and the short legs
are substantially more profitable in months following high sentiment (Hypothesis 2), to the
extent that the short-leg portfolios in those months even return less on average than the
T-bill rate.

   Finally, consider Hypothesis 3, which predicts that sentiment should not have an ap-
preciable effect on the long-leg returns. If underpricing driven by market-wide sentiment
makes a significant contribution to the profitability of the long legs of the anomaly strate-
gies, there should be greater underpricing, and hence higher long-leg returns, following low
sentiment. Alternatively, higher long-leg returns following low sentiment could also reflect
overpricing of long-leg stocks during high-sentiment periods, despite those stocks’ being in
the decile of highest overall performance. We don’t see much evidence of either scenario.


                                                11
In Table 2, the long legs do have higher returns following low sentiment, but only 1 of the
11 anomalies (investment/assets) has a t-statistic that rejects the no-difference null in favor
of that alternative. The long leg of the combined strategy earns 39 bp less following high
sentiment, but the t-statistic is only -0.93. Any evidence for sentiment effects on the long
leg become even weaker after benchmark adjustment. In Table 3, none of the t-statistics
reject the no-difference null in favor of higher returns following low sentiment. In fact, 8 of
the 11 differences go in the opposite direction, although only 1 anomaly (net stock issues)
has a significant one-tailed t-statistic (1.69). The benchmark-adjusted return on the long leg
of the combined strategy exhibits only a 4 bp difference between high- and low-sentiment
periods. Overall, the evidence in Tables 2 and 3 appears to be consistent with Hypothesis 3
as well.


4.2.       Predictive regressions

The results reported above are obtained by averaging within high-sentiment versus low-
sentiment months, where the high/low classification is simply a binary measure. Here we
conduct an alternative analysis, using predictive regressions to investigate whether the level
of the BW sentiment index predicts returns in ways consistent with our hypotheses. Table
4 reports of results of regressing excess returns on just the lagged sentiment index. Table
5 reports results of regressing excess returns on the lagged sentiment index as well as the
contemporaneous returns on the three Fama-French factors.7 The latter regression thus
investigates the ability of sentiment to predict benchmark-adjusted returns.

       Hypothesis 1—anomalies are stronger following high sentiment—predicts a positive rela-
tion between the profitability of each long-short spread and investor sentiment. Consistent
with this prediction, the slope coefficients for the spreads of all 11 anomalies are positive in
both Tables 4 and 5. In Table 4, 9 of the individual t-statistics are significant at a one-tailed
0.05 significance level, while 8 are significant in Table 5. The combination strategy has a t-
statistic of 3.79 in Table 4 and 2.98 in Table 5. Returns are measured in percent per month,
and the sentiment index is scaled to have zero mean and unit standard deviation. Thus,
for example, the slope coefficient of 0.50 for the combination strategy indicates that a one-
standard-deviation increase in sentiment is associated with $0.005 of additional long-short
monthly profit on a strategy with $1 in each leg of the spread.
   7
    The Appendix reports, in Table A2, results based on regressing excess returns on the lagged sentiment
index and just the single market factor, instead of the three Fama-French factors. The conclusions are very
similar.



                                                    12
   Hypothesis 2—greater short-leg profits following high sentiment—predicts a negative
relation between the returns on the short-leg portfolio and the lagged sentiment level. Con-
sistent with this prediction, the slope coefficients for the short-leg returns of all 11 anomalies
are negative in both Tables 4 and 5. In Table 4, all 11 individual t-statistics are significant,
while 8 are significant in Table 5. The combination strategy has a t-statistic of -2.90 in Table
4 and -3.01 in Table 5. In Table 4, we see that a one-standard-deviation increase in senti-
ment is associated with nearly a one percent lower monthly excess return on the short-leg
portfolio.

   Hypothesis 3 predicts no significant relation between returns on the long-leg and lagged
sentiment. Here, for essentially the first time, we see that benchmark adjustment makes a
noticeable difference. In Table 4, which is based simply on excess returns without benchmark
adjustment, the coefficients for the long-leg returns are all negative, and 5 of the 11 are sig-
nificant at an 0.05 significance level for a one-tailed test—appropriate against an alternative
of sentiment-related mispricing. The combination strategy in Table 4 has a slope of -0.43,
which is only half the magnitude for the short leg but is nevertheless significant (t-statistic:
-1.85). After adjusting for benchmark exposures, however, we see results that essentially fall
right in line with Hypothesis 3. In Table 5, which is based on returns adjusted for exposures
to the Fama-French benchmarks, 7 of the 11 long-leg slopes are positive, none significantly,
and only 1 of the negative slopes is significant. The combination strategy in Table 5 has a
zero slope (to two decimal places) and a t-statistic of 0.15, giving a result that could not be
closer to the prediction of Hypothesis 3.

   In sum, results from the predictive regressions reported in Tables 4 and 5 deliver the same
message as the comparisons of high- and low-sentiment periods in Tables 2 and 3. The data
support a scenario in which market-wide sentiment creates overpricing, due to short-sale
limitations. Sentiment-driven overpricing appears to be at least a partial explanation for the
broad set of anomalies examined here.

   We should also note that the potential bias in predictive regressions, as analyzed by
Stambaugh (1999), appears not to be a problem in the results reported. The correlations
between the predictive-regression residuals and the innovations in sentiment level obtained
from a first-order autoregression are small. Applying Stambaugh’s bias correction to the
reported slopes in Table 4, for example, produces only small changes in the second decimal
place of some of the coefficients and no changes to the others.

5.       Robustness

5.1.      Controlling additional macro variables

One might be inclined to seek a risk-based explanation of our results, as an alternative
to sentiment-driven overpricing. One risk-based explanation would involve an omitted risk
factor to which each short leg is sensitive but each long leg is not. If the premium on that risk
factor then varies over time in a manner correlated with our sentiment index, our results could
obtain. Explaining why, across the 11 anomalies, there would be such differences in loadings
between long and short legs presents a challenge. Even if such differences exist, however,
there would remain the question of whether the omitted risk factor’s premium exhibits the
required correlation with sentiment. It seems reasonable to expect that variations in any
risk premium would be correlated with some aspect of macroeconomic conditions.

      Baker and Wurgler (2006) remove macro-related variation from their sentiment index by
regressing raw sentiment measures on six macro variables: the growth in industrial produc-
tion, the growth in durable, nondurable, and services consumption, the growth in employ-
ment, and a flag for NBER recessions. To assess the potential for a risk-based explanation
of our results, we control for an additional set of macro-related variables that seem reason-
able to entertain as being correlated with a risk premium: the default premium, the term
premium, the real interest rate, the inflation rate, and CAY. The default premium is defined
as the yield spread between BAA and AAA bonds, and the term premium is defined as the
spread between 20-year and 1-year Treasuries. The real interest rate is defined as the most
recent monthly difference between the 30-day T-bill return and the CPI inflation rate. Cay
is the consumption-wealth variable defined in Lettau and Ludvigson (2001).8

      Table 6 reports the results of regressing excess returns on the lagged sentiment in-
dex, the contemporaneous returns on the three Fama-French factors, and the five lagged
macro-related variables. Thus, we investigate whether the ability of sentiment to predict
benchmark-adjusted returns is robust to including macro-related fluctuations in addition to
those already controlled for by Baker and Wurgler. The effects of investor sentiment re-
main largely unchanged by including the additional five variables: the coefficients and their
t statistics are close to those in Table 5, in which the additional macro-related variables are
not included.
  8
    The bond yields are obtained from the St. Louis Federal Reserve, the T-bill return and inflation are
obtained from CRSP, and Cay is obtained from Sydney Ludvigson’s website.




                                                  14
       In sum, if an unnamed risk factor indeed drives our results, it seems the variation over
time in its premium must not be strongly related to either the six macro variables used
by Baker and Wurgler or the five additional variables included in our analysis. Of course,
even if such a factor does exist, there remains the challenge of explaining why, across the 11
anomalies, the short legs are sensitive to this factor while the long legs are not.


5.2.       Alternative sentiment measures

We also investigate the robustness of our results to using an alternative sentiment index. A
number of investor-sentiment studies use the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment
Index (e.g. Lemmon and Portniaguina (2006), Bergman and Roychowdhury (2008)). While
the Baker-Wurgler index is a measure of sentiment based on stock-market indicators, the
Michigan sentiment index is a survey-based measure. The monthly survey is mailed to a
random set of 500 households and asks their views about the economy. To remove macro-
related information from the index, we follow a similar approach to Baker and Wurgler
(2006). Specifically, we take the residuals from a regression of the Michigan index on the six
macro-related variables used by Baker and Wurgler.9

   Table 7 reports the results of regressing excess returns on the lagged Michigan sentiment
index (adjusted as above) as well as the contemporaneous returns on the three Fama-French
factors. Our three hypotheses are supported with the Michigan index as a proxy for senti-
ment. For the combination strategy of the 11 anomalies, the long-short profit is significantly
higher following higher sentiment (Hypothesis 1), the short leg has lower returns following
higher sentiment (Hypothesis 2), and sentiment exhibits no significant ability to predict the
long-leg returns (Hypothesis 3). The patterns of the results across the 11 individual anoma-
lies are also similar to those obtained using the Baker-Wurgler index, as reported in Table
5, although some of them are weaker.10



6.        Conclusions

With impediments to short selling, overpricing becomes more difficult to eliminate, so a
firm’s stock price can reflect the views of investors who are too optimistic. With market-
   9
    The results are essentially the same if we also include the five additional macro variables discussed above.
  10
    In unreported results, we repeat the same analysis using the Conference Board Consumer Confidence
Index as a proxy for sentiment, and the results are largely the same as obtained using the Michigan sentiment
index. The results can be provided upon the request.

wide variations in investor sentiment, such overpricing can occur for many stocks during
periods of high sentiment.

   Long-short strategies for a set of 11 anomalies in cross-sectional returns exhibit empir-
ical properties consistent with a combination of short-sale impediments and market-wide
sentiment. Since overpricing is more likely than underpricing in our hypothesized setting,
anomalies should be stronger following periods of high sentiment, to the extent that the
anomalies reflect mispricing. We indeed find greater profitability of the long-short strate-
gies following high sentiment. If overpricing is the primary source of those greater profits,
the short legs of the strategies should be more profitable following high sentiment, and we
also find that implication to be supported strongly by the data. Sentiment does not ex-
hibit a significant effect on profits from the long legs of the strategies. The latter result is
also consistent with the prediction that underpricing should be less prevalent in our simple
setting where short-sale impediments present the key obstacle to traders seeking to exploit
mispricing.

   This study does not aim to find complete explanations for each of the anomalies con-
sidered. Numerous studies have examined the individual anomalies in more detail and have
provided more specifically focused contexts and interpretations. We paint the set of anoma-
lies with an intentionally broad brush, given our objective to consider the implications when
market-wide sentiment interacts with short-sale impediments. While this approach reveals
novel evidence consistent with overpricing as at least a partial explanation for many anoma-
lies, there is certainly more work ahead in order to develop a richer understanding of how
sentiment plays a role in pricing financial assets.

  The table reports average returns in excess of the one-month T-bill in months following high and low levels
  of investor sentiment, as classified based on the median level of the index of Baker and Wurgler (2006). Also
  reported are returns on a strategy that equally combines the strategies available within a given month. The
  sample period is from 1965:8 to 2008:1 for all but anomaly (1), whose data begin 1974:12, and anomalies (2)
  and (10), whose data begin 1972:1. All t-statistics are based on the heteroskedasticity-consistent standard
  errors of White (1980).

                 Anomalies During Periods of High and Low Investor Sentiment:
                    Benchmark-Adjusted Returns on Long-Short Strategies


  The table reports average benchmark-adjusted returns following high and low levels of investor sentiment, as
  classified based on the median level of the index of Baker and Wurgler (2006). The average returns in high-
  and low-sentiment periods are estimates of aH and aL in the regression,

                          Ri,t = aH dH,t + aL dL,t + bM KTt + cSM Bt + dHM Lt + i,t ,

  where dH,t and dL,t are dummy variables indicating high- and low-sentiment periods, and Ri,t is the excess
  return in month t on either the long leg, the short leg, or the difference. Also reported are returns on a
  strategy that equally combines the strategies available within a given month. The sample period is from
  1965:8 to 2008:1 for all but anomaly (1), whose data begin 1974:12, and anomalies (2) and (10), whose data
  begin 1972:1. All t-statistics are based on the heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors of White (1980).

                     CAPM-Adjusted Returns on Long-Short Strategies


  The table reports average CAPM-adjusted returns following high and low levels of investor sentiment, as
  classified based on the median level of the index of Baker and Wurgler (2006). The average returns in high-
  and low-sentiment periods are estimates of aH and aL in the regression,

                                    Ri,t = aH dH,t + aL dL,t + bM KTt + i,t ,

  where dH,t and dL,t are dummy variables indicating high- and low-sentiment periods, and Ri,t is the excess
  return in month t on either the long leg, the short leg, or the difference. Also reported are returns on a
  strategy that equally combines the strategies available within a given month. The sample period is from
  1965:8 to 2008:1 for all but anomaly (1), whose data begin 1974:12, and anomalies (2) and (10), whose data
  begin 1972:1. All t-statistics are based on the heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors of White (1980).

  Investor Sentiment and Anomalies: Predictive Regressions for
       CAPM-Adjusted Returns on Long-Short Strategies


The table reports estimates of b in the regression,

                         Ri,t   =   a + bSt−1 + cM KTt + ut ,

where Ri,t is the excess return in month t on either the long leg, the short leg, or the
difference, and St is the level of the investor-sentiment index of Baker and Wurgler
(2006). Also reported are returns on a strategy that equally combines the strategies
available within a given month. The sample period is from 1965:8 to 2008:1 for all
but anomaly (1), whose data begin 1974:12, and anomalies (2) and (10), whose
data begin 1972:1. All t-statistics are based on the heteroskedasticity-consistent
standard errors of White (1980).
