Empirical analyses of climatic event impacts on growth, while critical for policy, have been slow
to be incorporated into macroeconomic climate-economy models. This paper proposes a joint
empirical-structural approach to bridge this gap for tropical cyclones. First, we review competing
empirical approaches in a harmonized global dataset and through a theory lens. Second, we
estimate cyclone impacts on structural determinants of growth (productivity, depreciation,
fatalities) to quantify a stochastic growth model for 40 vulnerable countries and project welfare
effects of climate-driven cyclone risk changes. Third, we compute cyclone impacts on the social
cost of carbon in the seminal DICE model.

1    Introduction
What are the macroeconomic consequences of climate change? Over the past decade, a
rapidly growing body of empirical work has documented large potential growth impacts of
weather shocks. While many of these studies seek to enhance our understanding of the social
costs of climate change, their …ndings have often been slow to be incorporated into macro-
economic climate-economy models, as has been the case for other impact areas (Greenstone,
2016; Au¤hammer, 2018). One general issue is that new empirical studies are often based on
weather variation, whereas climate-economy models feature damages as a function of the cli-
mate, i.e., the long-run average of weather. Frontier work continues to develop econometric
techniques to harness the identifying power of weather variation whilst accounting for adap-
tation to long-run climate change in areas such as energy demand, mortality, and agriculture
(see, e.g., Deryugina and Hsiang, 2017; Au¤hammer, 2018; Lemoine, 2019). However, for
macroeconomic or general equilibrium impacts, there are fundamental additional challenges
that must be overcome in maping reduced-form evidence into structural models. Given that
policymakers use climate-economy models to quantify the social cost of carbon emissions
(Greenstone, Kopits, and Wolverton, 2013), and given that growth impacts may add signif-
icantly to these costs (e.g., Moore and Diaz, 2015), this "micro-macro" gap also represents
a critical policy concern (Obama, 2017).
    This paper analyzes the causes of this gap and proposes a novel joint empirical-structural
approach to overcome it in the context of tropical cyclones (i.e., hurricanes, typhoons). Cy-
clones are the leading cause of natural disaster damages world-wide1 and losses are projected
to increase with global changes (e.g,. Nordhaus, 2010b; Mendelsohn et al., 2012; Ranson
et al., 2014), making them a climate risk of special academic and policy interest. However,
empirical estimates of cyclone impacts on economic growth have again been slow to be incor-
porated into climate-economy models.2 One of the …rst challenges facing interested modelers
is that the empirical literature has found a wide range of results, ranging from positive im-
pacts of cyclones on growth (e.g., Skidmore and Toya, 2002, "ST") to mixed impacts (e.g.,
Noy, 2009) and very large negative e¤ects (e.g., Hsiang and Jina, 2014, "HJ").
    First, we thus present an empirical and conceptual review of competing approaches to
quantifying cyclone impacts on growth. We assemble a modern global dataset encompassing
the full history of cyclones around the globe from 1970-2015 in order to revisit some of these

    Narita, Tol, and Antho¤ (2009) use the FUND climate-economy model to project direct cyclone damage
    impacts on the SCC, but not growth impacts. Fried (2019) develops a general equilibrium model of
    weather disasters and the U.S. economy using an original quanti…cation. We discuss these studies below.



                                                    2
prior results in a harmonized sample. For example, re-estimating both a cross-sectional
speci…cation à la ST and a standard panel speci…cation in the spirit of HJ, we …nd that
the qualitative di¤erence in results remains. We then argue that this di¤erence can be
resolved through the lens of macroeconomic theory. Cross-sectional regressions capture the
e¤ect of cyclone risk on average growth, which is theoretically ambiguous in several types
of growth models through, e.g., precautionary savings e¤ects. Panel …xed-e¤ects models, on
the other hand, isolate the e¤ects of cyclone strikes, which should decrease contemporaneous
growth through the destruction of productive assets. Importantly, theory also tells us that
neither reduced-form approach may be individually su¢ cient to characterize the welfare
e¤ects of future changes as, for example, cyclone risk can a¤ect economic growth and welfare
in opposite ways.
    Second, we propose and implement a novel approach to estimating and modeling cyclone
impacts designed to combine empirical evidence with the structure of a model to deliver
welfare cost estimates and policy implications. On the empirical side, we …rst quantify cy-
clone impacts on the structural determinants of growth, rather than on growth itself, which
is typically endogenous in macroeconomic climate-economy models. Speci…cally, we esti-
mate cyclone strike impacts on total factor productivity (TFP), capital depreciation, and
fatalities within our global panel. On the modeling side, we present a stochastic endoge-
nous growth cyclone-climate-economy model designed to incorporate both these estimated
damage functions and the broader empirical evidence on cyclones and growth. Structurally,
the model builds closely on Krebs (2003ab, 2006; see also Krebs et al., 2015) who studies
the implications of business cycle and idiosyncratic human capital risks for household in-
vestment, growth, and welfare. One key feature of the model in our setting is that it makes
an explicit distinction between climate and weather: households face repeated risks to their
physical and human capital from cyclone strikes (weather), whose probability distribution
is determined by the climate. This setup enables us to directly calibrate cyclone impacts
to the plausibly causally identi…ed estimates from panel (weather) regressions. In addition,
the model structure enables us to account for some long-run general equilibrium responses
to climate change that panel regressions may not be able to capture, as households respond
to changing cyclone risks (climate) by adapting their savings and asset allocation decisions.
    We then quantify our cyclone-climate-economy model separately for each of 40 cyclone-
vulnerable nations using a combination of data, estimation, matching of moments, and ex-
ternal calibration. The calibration includes country-speci…c probability density estimates of
current and future cyclone risks which we compute based on 68,000 synthetic storm track
simulations from Emanuel et al. (2008) and grounded in historical best track cyclone data.
Comparing steady-state outcomes under the current and future climate, we …nd signi…cant


                                             3
heterogeneity of projected e¤ects, ranging from substantial negative impacts in vulnerable
small island states (e.g., a -5% welfare change in St. Vincent and the Grenadines), to small
welfare gains in countries where cyclone risks are predicted to decline with global warm-
ing (e.g., Australia). The United States stands out among the most negatively impacted
countries, which are otherwise mostly poor and small island states. This result is informed
by prior empirical work identifying the United States as an outlier in cyclone vulnerability
conditional on its income levels and exposure (e.g., Bakkensen and Mendelsohn, 2016), and
highlights the importance of work investigating the determinants of adaptation to storms in
the United States (e.g., Fried, 2019).
    Third, in order to assess the global climate policy implications of changing cyclone risks
and to illustrate the broader applicability of our approach, we integrate our cyclone impact
estimates into the seminal DICE climate-economy model (Nordhaus, e.g., 1992, 2010a).
As damages in DICE are a function of the global climate, we compute expected global
aggregate impacts to TFP, capital depreciation, and human capital losses resulting from
cyclone risk changes, and add dedicated damage functions for each component into DICE.
The results suggest only a modest increase in the optimal global carbon price. That is,
while some countries may su¤er enormous losses from future cyclone risk increases, others
are projected to experience risk declines, so that the aggregate addition to global climate
damages appears modest in our setting. Of course, as further climatological projections and
empirical estimates become available, it will be a rich area for future work to expand upon
these quanti…cations and conclusions.
    These …ndings have important research and policy implications. First, our results re-
contextualize empirical and theoretical understandings of the reduced-form literature on
cyclones and growth. That qualitatively di¤erent results from prior studies survive in a con-
sistent sample suggests that data improvements such as satellite-based storm measures are
not su¢ cient to account for the di¤erence in results.3 Instead, from a theoretical perspec-
tive, we argue that di¤erent empirical speci…cations capture di¤erent elements of the overall
impact of cyclones on growth. By themselves, output growth regressions appear insu¢ cient
to characterize the welfare consequences of cyclone risk changes and to quantify standard
macroeconomic climate-economy models, although they can provide critical insights to guide,
e.g., model structure.
    These …ndings also relate to an important parallel literature on temperature shocks and
economic growth. Several in‡uential empirical studies have documented negative economic
growth impacts due to temperature shocks (e.g., Bansal and Ochoa, 2011; Dell, Jones, and
3
    We do also highlight some di¤erences in results that arise due to data variation across studies, such as
    sample restrictions based on macroeconomic control variable availability.



                                                    4
Olken, 2012, "DJO"; Burke, Hsiang, and Miguel, 2015; Colacito, Ho¤man, Phan, 2018,
etc.). There have been e¤orts to incorporate these …ndings into climate-economic models.
One pioneering analysis by Moore and Diaz (2015) incorporates DJO’s estimates into DICE,
demonstrating the potential of growth impacts to signi…cantly increase optimal climate policy
stringency. As output growth impact estimates do not provide a clear mapping into models
such as DICE, Moore and Diaz (2015) consider multiple pathways, calibrating either TFP
growth or capital depreciation to match DJO estimates.4 A similar issue arises in Fankhauser
and Tol (2005) and Dietz and Stern (2015), who extend DICE to an endogenous long-
run growth framework with capital- or investment-based knowledge spillovers, inter alia.
Absent empirical guidance, they also consider a capital depreciation speci…cation and a
TFP depreciation speci…cation. Notably, the optimal carbon price in 2015 is 55% higher
with the TFP speci…cation, again highlighting the importance of impact channels. In order
to overcome these ambiguities, we propose a joint empirical-structural approach that …rst
estimates cyclone impacts on the determinants of growth relevant for each model (e.g,. TFP,
capital depreciation, fatalities).5;6
    Second, our approach thus highlights opportunities to reduce the "micro-macro" gap be-
tween growing empirical evidence on macroeconomic impacts and the quanti…cation climate-
economy models. On the one hand, we show that only minor extensions of existing em-
pirical approaches yield structurally interpretable impact estimates, such as using growth
decompositions to distinguish TFP from output growth e¤ects. On the other hand, we also
demonstrate how modifying structural models to make weather explicit permits (i) direct
incorporation of plausibly causally identi…ed impact estimates, (ii) accounting for macro-
economic adaptation through endogenous adjustments in savings and investments, and (iii)
computing welfare costs of changes in climatic risks. These three goals match the desirable
properties of climate impact quanti…cation identi…ed by Au¤hammer (2018) and Greenstone
(2016).
4
    More and Diaz (2015) ultimately focus on the TFP pathway. Supplementary results for the depreciation
    pathway suggest broadly similar patterns but a signi…cantly higher social cost of carbon. Gauging
    visually from the relevant graphs, the SCC appears to reach well over $1,500+ per ton by 2080 for
    depreciation damages, compared to around $1,000 per ton for the TFP pathway in the benchmark.
5
    Alternative approaches include, e.g., Bansal and Ochoa (2011) who present a Long-Run Risk model
    calibrated to their own estimates of temperature shock growth impacts. Consumption growth is a given
    process in this model; that is, it is not a production-based growth model, thus side-stepping questions
    of impact mechanisms.
6
    A growing number of studies present climate-economy models with growth impacts but without focus on
    empirical connections. Bretschger and Valente (2011) provide a theoretical foundation for climate change
    growth impacts through multiple channels (capital and TFP depreciation). Lemoine (2019) presents
    an endowment economy-based IAM with temperature impacts on consumption growth to study the
    implications of uncertainty for the SCC. Of course there is also a large general theoretical literature on
    the environment and endogenous growth (e.g,. Bovenberg and Smulders, 1995).



                                                     5
    On the quantitative modeling side, our analysis complements several advancements in the
literature. Perhaps most closely related in methodology, Fried (2019) presents a dynamic
general equilibrium model of the U.S. economy where heterogeneous households face risks
of capital destruction from storms. She presents an original calibration using, e.g., U.S.
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) disaster assistance across regions, and
utilizes the model to quantify adaptation capital, FEMA policy e¤ects, and the role of
adaptation in mitigating welfare costs from future storm intensity increases. Hallegatte et
al. (2007) develop a ‘non-equilibrium dynamic model’(NEDyM) of disasters and apply it to
extreme weather events (albeit not cyclones)7 in Europe. NEDyM builds on a Solow growth
model with limits on reconstruction investment and non-clearing short-run labor and goods
markets. As both our model structure and research goals are fundamentally di¤erent, we
abstract from some of the important nuances featured in these studies, and focus instead on
detailed linkages to empirical reduced-form approaches and long-run growth impacts under
aggregate risk.8 The broader literature also features seminal contributions on rare disasters
in macroeconomics and …nance (e.g., Barro, 2006; Pindyck and Wang, 2013), but cyclones
are typically not examples of such rare disasters.9
    Lastly, we contribute new estimates of the impact of a major climate risk - tropical cy-
clones - on the social cost of carbon. Previously, Narita, Tol, and Antho¤ (2009) used the
FUND model to estimate climate change impacts on direct cyclone damages, fatalities, and
the SCC. Our analysis advances their approach in several ways including by (i) adding TFP
damages, (ii) estimating country-speci…c damage functions over wind speeds, (iii) estimat-
ing country-speci…c cyclone probability distributions based on new climatological research
(Emmanuel et al., 2008) and (iv) formally computing expected damages. Despite these new
features, we ultimately …nd a similar result, namely that cyclones add only modestly to the
optimal global carbon price. This aggregate result masks considerable global heterogeneity,
however, and for many countries - including the United States - cyclone risk changes are
likely to be a …rst-order climate concern.
7
    Hallegatte (2009) combines empirical direct cyclone impact estimates for the United States with esti-
    mates of the relationship between direct and indirect losses (based on a case study applying an Input-
    Output model to Hurricane Katrina’s sectoral impacts) to project total economic losses from hurricanes
    in the United States both with and without climate change-induced hurricane intensity increases.
8
    For example, besides structural di¤erences, Fried (2019) features no aggregate risk from storms which
    are assumed to be evenly distributed across space in the United States. In contrast, we study aggregate
    growth impacts of cyclone risk across 40 vulnerable countries. Similarly, Hallegatte et al. (2007) focus
    on short-run transitional additions to overall disaster costs. While we also depart from the standard
    Ramsey model to capture the persistence of disaster losses, our model allows for long-run growth e¤ects
    through changes in asset allocations and savings rates (exogenous in NEDyM).
9
    Cyclones are common in many countries and physically limited (Emanuel and Holland, 2011). Pindyck
    and Wang (2013) de…ne catastrophic shocks as reducing capital by "more than 10 or 15 percent." In
    our data, even the 95th percentile of capital destruction is only 2.8 percent.

2      Revisiting Empirical Approaches
2.1      Data
The …rst step in our analysis is to compile a harmonized global panel of cyclones and relevant
economic indicators at the country-year level.
    Cyclone Data: Building on best practices in the literature (Hsiang and Jina, 2014), we
gather historical global tropical cyclone tracks from the International Best Track Archive for
Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS; Knapp et al., 2010). Considered the most comprehensive
record of global historical tropical cyclone tracks by the World Meteorological Organiza-
tion, IBTrACS contains best track records of cyclone position and intensity characteristics
collected from meteorological agencies across the world. We focus on 1970-2015, the post-
satellite era for which cyclones have been most reliably tracked. For all 3,346 cyclone landfalls
during this period, we calculate cyclone intensity metrics including annual maximum wind
speed at landfall (in knots) and annual energy (the sum of cubes of wind speeds recorded
within a country), a metric based on the power dissipation index developed by Emanuel
(2008).10 We process the tracks in ArcGIS and aggregate data up to the country-year
level.11 Next, in order to estimate future changes in cyclone risks, we incorporate 68,000
simulated future tropical cyclone tracks based on advancements in climatological research
by Kerry Emanuel and co-authors (Emanuel, 2008; Emanuel, Sundararajan, and Williams,
2008). These synthetic tracks and their usage are described in detail in Section 4.
    Macroeconomic Indicators: We collect annual national-level macroeconomic indicators
including real GDP (2011 $US), physical and human capital stocks, and population from
the Penn World Tables 9.0 ("PWT", Feenstra et al., 2015). We also collect educational
attainment estimates from Barro and Lee (2012). Though not directly used in our analysis,
we further obtain World Bank data (from World Development Indicators) on several other
macroeconomic indicators (gross capital formation and imports, foreign direct investment,
and government surplus all as percentage of GDP) included in analyses such as Noy (2009)
in order to construct a comparable sample based on data availability (described in Section
2:1:2).
    Geography: Country areas and absolute latitudes are collected from the Harvard WorldMap.
10
      Given that some cyclone wind speeds are listed as zero while a cyclone necessarily has non-zero wind
      speeds, we interpolate missing wind speeds from minimum pressure readings following Atkinson and
      Holliday (1977). For a minority of observations missing both wind and pressure, we assume a wind
      speed of 35 knots for categorized cyclones and 25 knots for tropical depressions. Lastly, we convert 1
      minute sustained wind speeds to 10 minute sustained wind speeds for unit consistency.
11
      We process the data without a dedicated wind-…eld model. For recent advancements on such modeling,
      see, e.g., Strobl (2011), Hsiang and Narita (2012), Hsiang and Jina (2014).



                                                     7
We calculate the fraction of a country’s population residing within 100 kilometers of naviga-
ble water (de…ned as a coast, major river, or major lake) in ArcGIS using geospatial shoreline
data from NOAA’s Global Self-consistent, Hierarchical, High-resolution Geography Database
and population data from the Gridded Population of the World v4 produced by the Center
for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN) at Columbia University and
as published through NASA’s Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC). We
calculate in ArcGIS the fraction of a country’s land area in a tropical climate zone based on
Köppen-Geiger climate classi…cation maps provided by Rubel and Kottek (2010). Finally,
we collect information on countries’populations living below …ve meters of elevation from
the Low Elevation Coastal Zone Urban-Rural Population and Land Area Estimates, from
CIESIN and SEDAC.
    Institutions: We consider several measures of institutions across countries, including
the "Statistical Capacity Rating" from the World Bank and the "Corruptions Perception
Index" from Transparency International. In line with the broader disasters literature (e.g.,
Noy, 2009; McDermott et al., 2014), we consider the World Bank’s measure of domestic
credit provided by the …nancial sector (as a percentage of GDP) as a proxy for …nancial
market development. Finally, we obtain estimates of natural disaster insurance rates from
MunichRe’s NatCatService, a leading industry data source on disaster losses. We speci…cally
collect data on insured versus total economic losses from meteorological events from 1998-
2018 by country income group, and compute the average insured fractions.
    Cyclone Damages: Finally, we obtain cyclone damage estimates from two sources. Our
benchmark measure of property damages and fatalities is gathered from EMDAT, the Inter-
national Disaster Database (Guha-Sapir et al., 2016). EMDAT is the most comprehensive
publicly available database on disaster losses and arguably the most widely used in the
literature (e.g., Skidmore and Toya, 2002; Raddatz, 2007; Noy, 2009; Hsiang and Narita,
2012; etc.). At the same time, EMDAT data are subject to certain data quality caveats
(e.g., Hsiang and Narita, 2012). While comparative analyses with proprietary damage data
from global re-insurance companies fail to indicate that these would necessarily dominate
EMDAT data coverage (Guha-Sapir et al., 2002), for robustness, we also consider damage
estimates from MunichRe. We speci…cally use country-year aggregates of total direct losses
from cyclones as computed by Neumayer, Plumper, and Barthel (2014) from the MunichRe
database.

2.1.1   Cross-Sectional Estimates

Conceptually, a natural starting point for exploring the association between the climate and
economic outcomes has been through cross-sectional analyses. As famously noted by Mendel-

                                              8
sohn, Nordhaus, and Shaw (1994) in an early empirical study of agriculture and climate, a
cross-sectional approach enables researchers to study the independent variable of interest
- the long-run climate - and thus impacts net of all relevant adaptation margins. A core
concern with this approach is omitted variable bias, on account of which many scholars have
considered panel and mixed approaches instead (Au¤hammer, 2018). Here, we nonetheless
begin with a discussion of the cross-sectional approach. We argue that, in the context of
natural disasters and economic growth, cross-sectional analyses provide both unique insights
and entail conceptual limitations above and beyond standard econometric concerns which
are important to consider. For example, even a perfectly identi…ed cross-sectional regression
would provide only limited insights into welfare and Integrated Assessment Model (IAM)
quanti…cation, but can inform the structure of IAMs seeking to capture cyclone growth
impacts.
    In the empirical literature, Skidmore and Toya (2002, "ST") present an early and highly
in‡uential analysis which regresses countries’average 1960-90 growth rates on disaster met-
rics such as the average number of climatic events per year in country j in a sample of 89
countries. They document a positive correlation between disasters and growth. This result
di¤ers markedly from subsequent literature which typically …nds negative impacts in panel
analyses, as discussed in Section 2:1:2. Hsiang and Jina (2015) moreover document a neg-
ative cross-sectional relationship between average cyclone-induced capital depreciation and
growth. From an empirical perspective, one may …rst raise questions about Skidmore and
Toya’s results vis-à-vis the literature based on the data di¤erences. For example, ST (2002)
use countries’ reported disaster occurrences in EMDAT to measure general disaster risk,
which are subject to several inclusion criteria and thus constitute a partly selected sample.
More recent work has thus moved towards using meteorological data to measure climatic
events (e.g., Hsiang and Jina, 2014). More broadly, modern data also span a longer time
period (+25 years since 1990) and larger sets of countries.
    To begin our empirical examination, we …rst revisit a cross-sectional speci…cation building
on Skidmore and Toya (2002) in our harmonized global dataset. Speci…cally, we regress each
country j 0 s average growth rate from 1970-2015 (g j ) on di¤erent cyclone risk measures ( ";j )
and a host of control variables (Xj ), including the fraction of land area in the tropics,
absolute latitude, our water access measure, an institutional quality proxy, and initial GDP
per capita.12
                                  g j = 0 + 1 ";j + Xj 0 + j                                (1)
12
     A central challenge in correlating cyclone risk with economic growth is that the climate is not randomly
     distributed across space, and likely correlated with other factors that may in‡uence growth, such as
     geography (Hall and Jones, 1996) and institutions (Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson, 2001). We thus
     include these controls for geography and institutional quality in the cross-sectional speci…cation.


                                                     9
Table 1 presents the results. Column (1) con…rms that a signi…cant positive correlation be-
tween economic growth and ST’s main disaster risk measure, the natural logarithm of disaster
counts (per land area), survives in our extended global sample using modern meteorological
data. Before describing the rest of the results, we discuss their theoretical foundations.
    Conceptually, cross-sectional regressions capture the impact of average storm risk on
average growth. Broadly speaking, a vast literature in macroeconomics analyzes the e¤ects
of di¤erent kinds of (uninsurable) risks on economic growth and welfare (e.g., Bewley, 1977;
Lucas, 1987; Ayiagari, 1994; Krebs, 2003ab, etc.). In recent years, a number of theoretical
analyses have focused on natural disaster risks and growth in particular, including several
studies that allow disaster probabilities or damages to depend on pollution stocks. Examples
of the latter include Ikefuji and Horii (2012), Müller-Fürstenberger and Schumacher (2015),
and Bretschger and Vinogradova (2016); Akao and Sakamoto (2013) characterize the e¤ects
of exogenous disaster risk on growth. The theoretical insights we invoke here are based both
on this literature and can also be shown to hold within our own model (see Section 5 and
Online Appendix).
    From a macro-theoretical perspective, one may expect the relationship between cyclone
risk and long-run growth to be ambiguous in sign as economic risks can a¤ect growth through
numerous channels. Though the details depend on the growth model in question, some gen-
eral mechanisms can be noted. First, an increase in economic risk may generally induce
households to save more, that is, to undertake precautionary savings (e.g., Bewley, 1977).
Ceteris paribus, an increase in savings rates can increase average growth rates across a range
of models, including (i) in a Solow growth model during the transition to a long-run bal-
anced growth path, (ii) in an endogenous growth model with aggregate capital externalities
(see, e.g., Devereux and Smith, 1993), (iii) in an AK-type endogenous growth model (see,
e.g., Krebs, 2006), and (iv) in a Lucas (1988)-style model of human capital-driven growth
(see, e.g., Ikefuji and Horii, 2012). Second, an increase in storm risks can alter growth by
changing households’optimal portfolio choice. That is, to the extent that cyclone risk alters
the relative attractiveness of di¤erent investment options (e.g., human versus physical cap-
ital), an increase in cyclone risk may also alter overall returns by changing the composition
of an economy’s investments. Ceteris paribus, such a portfolio e¤ect could lower average
growth through a ‘‡ight to safety’of lower return assets, or could increase average growth
by increasing human capital in models where it is a driver of growth (as in, e.g., Akao
and Sakamoto, 2013). A third impact channel is that higher storm risk may have a direct
negative e¤ect on growth (ceteris paribus) by increasing average depreciation rates, in line
with Hisang and Jina’s (2015) empirical …ndings, and also by lowering average productivity.
Importantly, from a theoretical perspective, the overall impact of cyclone risk on long-run


                                             10
growth is thus ambiguous in sign. In the context of our model (presented in Section 2), we
further demonstrate how this relationship may speci…cally be non-monotonic even within a
given economy (see Online Appendix).
    In light of these considerations, we next extend the standard cross-sectional speci…cation
(1) à la ST to allow for quadratic e¤ects of cyclone risk on growth. The results in Table
1 Columns (2) and (4) con…rm signi…cant non-monotonicity: cyclone risk is positively cor-
related with economic growth initially, but this association turns negative at higher levels
of risk. As a …nal empirical check on the relevance of the aforementioned theoretical mech-
anisms, we add controls for average savings rates and educational attainment to (1). The
results in Columns (3) and (5) reveal that the initial positive association between cyclone
risk and growth is attenuated in both magnitude and precision once these controls are added,
consistent with the theoretical prediction that higher savings and human capital investment
rates are a part of the underlying mechanism.

Lessons and Limitations: Climate change is altering the distribution of cyclone risks
across the globe (e.g., Emanuel, 2008; see also Section 4). In principle, the coe¢ cients of a
cross-sectional speci…cation such as (1) thus represent the relevant thought experiment for
predicting the corresponding long-run growth impacts of climate change. The results are
consistent with the theoretical predictions that growth impacts may be empirically relevant
and occurring through countervailing channels such as precautionary savings and direct
losses. While the cross-sectional results are thus qualitatively informative, there are at least
two core limitations on their quantitative use in inferring climate change costs. The …rst is
the potential for omitted variable bias inherent in cross-country comparisons. The second

                                                             12
and more fundamental concern is that growth impacts need not be informative about welfare.
It is long known that changes in economic risk can a¤ect growth and welfare in opposite
ways (see, e.g., Devereux and Smith, 1993). For example, if higher cyclone risk increases
growth by increasing precautionary savings, this change is clearly welfare-reducing. The
Online Appendix formally con…rms the possibility of higher growth but lower welfare in
the context of our model. Consequently, even a perfectly identi…ed cross-sectional growth
regression would not be su¢ cient to quantify welfare impacts of cyclone risk changes. In
sum, these results thus highlight the need for a structural approach to capture both the
welfare and general equilibrium e¤ects of climate-induced changes in future cyclone risks.

2.1.2   Panel Estimates

The most common empirical approach to studying natural disaster impacts on growth is to
use panel variation. This literature has documented a range of results, with most …nding
broadly negative e¤ects of varying magnitude and duration (reviewed by, e.g., Kousky, 2014)
but some …nding no impacts in all but the most extreme disasters (Cavallo et al., 2013).
Prior research has already identi…ed several study design features which can contribute to
di¤erences in results. For example, Loayza et al. (2009) document heterogeneous impacts
across disaster types (e.g., earthquakes versus storms). Similarly, di¤erent proxies for disaster
intensity (e.g., property damages versus fatalities) have been shown to yield di¤erent results
(e.g., Noy, 2009).
    Thus, we next consider a panel speci…cation in our harmonized global sample. That is,
we focus on one disaster type (cyclones), meteorological intensity measures (e.g., maximum
wind speeds), and a standard panel …xed-e¤ects speci…cation similar to Hsiang and Jina
(2014):
                                            XL
                  gj;t = j + t + ( j t) +        1+l "j;t l + Int (qj;t "j;t ) + j;t          (2)
                                            l=0

Here, gj;t is a country’s annual real GDP per capita growth rate, j are country …xed-e¤ects,
( j t) are country-speci…c linear time trends, and "j;t l are cyclone realization measures (e.g.,
maximum wind speed) up to lag L: Here we focus on contemporaneous impacts (L = 0), but
consider richer lag structures in our main empirical impact channel estimation in Section
3. The empirical literature has frequently found that disaster impacts vary with country
characteristics, particularly the level of development and the quality of (…nancial) institutions
(e.g., Kahn, 2005; Loayza et al., 2009; Noy, 2009; Raddatz 2009; Fomby, Ikeda, and Loayza,
2013; McDermott et al., 2014). Speci…cation (2) consequently allows for the impact of




                                                  13
cyclones to vary with covariates qj;t ; speci…cally domestic credit or lagged GDP per capita.13
Standard errors j;t are heteroskedasticity-robust and clustered at the country level.
    In reviewing the empirical literature, we document another potential source of variation
in results: sample composition based on macroeconomic control variable availability. That
is, prior studies di¤er in the supplemental controls they include in panel growth regressions
alongside disaster measures. One classic example, Noy (2009), includes a rich set of controls
such as government budget surplus and foreign exchange reserves, permitting a …nal sample
of 109 countries. Numerous other recent studies end up with similar or smaller samples,14
whereas, e.g., Cavallo et al. (2013) use a synthetic controls approach and construct certain
variables permitting a sample of 196 countries. In order to gauage whether such sample
di¤erences may be contributing to di¤erences in studies’ results, we estimate (2) for two
samples: (i) "Un…ltered" includes all available countries (182 countries), whereas (ii) "Has
Controls" includes only country-years for which control variables such as used by Noy (2009)
and others are available in our sample.15 We do not actually include those controls in the
regressions so as to isolate sample e¤ects.
    Tables 2 present the results for landfall counts and maximum wind speed (normalized
by land area) as intensity metrics. Results for energy are presented in the Online Appendix
(Table A1). First, the results generally con…rm that cyclone strikes have a negative e¤ect
on contemporaneous economic growth. That is, in the same global analysis that yields
a positive cross-sectional correlation between growth and cyclone risk, we …nd a negative
e¤ect of cyclone strikes. Second, we note that the statistical precision of these results di¤ers
notably across the un…ltered and data-restricted country samples. In the un…ltered sample,
contemporaneous cyclone impacts are precisely estimated only for energy, whereas they
are generally signi…cantly di¤erent from zero in the data-restricted sample, broadly in line
with some of the underlying heterogeneity in the literature.16 Table 3 compares some key
13
     We lag GDP to avoid endogeneity to the year t disaster realization, but consider contemporaneous
     credit as it reduces impacts precisely through its response to disasters.
14
     For example, Loyaza et al. (2012) have a sample of 94 countries and Fomby et al. (2013) study 84
     countries.
15
     We speci…cally de…ne a sample of country-years that have data on gross capital formation, do-
     mestic credit, imports as percentage of GDP, foreign direct investment, government surplus, and
     countries that have at any point had institutional quality ratings from the International Country
     Risk Guide (ICRG). This sample does not match Noy’s exactly due to changes in source databases
     over time. We also do not purchase the ICRG data and utilize public metadata instead (URL:
     https://epub.prsgroup.com/available-countries). If countries have entered this database since the time
     of Noy’s (2009) analysis, they may also change the relative samples. Importantly, our goal is not to
     replicate Noy’s sample per se, but to demonstrate how a representative example of standard controls
     can a¤ect the sample precision and results.
16
     For example, studies such as Noy (2009) have found signi…cant negative e¤ects of disasters on growth,
     whereas Cavallo et al. (2013) do not except in the largest disasters. Of course, there are many other
     methodological di¤erences across these and other studies, and it is beyond the scope of our study to


                                                    14
attributes of the two samples. We …nd that countries in the typical data-restricted sample
feature signi…cantly higher average Statistical Capacity Ratings, signi…cantly lower volatility
in GDP growth, and signi…cantly larger average populations than the un…ltered sample, likely
contributing to the di¤erence in precision of the estimated results. Finally, in line with prior
studies, we see that these negative growth impacts are generally lower in countries with
better …nancial institutions (proxied by domestic credit, Columns (2) and (5)) and higher
levels of development (Columns (3) and (6)).
    formally decompose di¤erences in results across these factors.

    Lessons and Limitations: On the one hand, panel speci…cations such as (2) are clearly
attractive in terms of econometric identi…cation. Cyclone impacts 1 are identi…ed based on
variation in cyclone realizations across years within each country, and thus plausibly causal.
On the other hand, given the …ndings and theoretical considerations described in Section
2:1:1, we would expect the …xed e¤ects related to countries’average growth rates in (2), j
and j ; to remain endogenous to cyclone risk. This endogeneity becomes important if one
wishes to use panel estimates to predict the growth impacts of climate change. That is, while
some empirical studies have analyzed climate change impacts by evaluating (2) at alternative
potential future storm realizations e "j; (e.g., Hsiang and Jina, 2014), our analysis suggests
that this approach is incomplete as climate change will also alter baseline cyclone risks and
thus average growth rates as in Table 1: In a prior version of this paper (Bakkensen and
Barrage, 2016), we explored a two-step estimator to evaluate cyclone impacts through both
channels; however, this analysis remains subject to the core concern that growth impacts do
not correspond to welfare e¤ects.
    Despite these limitations, panel output growth regressions can provide essential insights
to inform the design of environment-economy models. For example, limited …nancial markets
are clearly an empirically relevant contributor to vulnerability, but not accounted for in many
IAMs. Another common empirical …nding is that negative cyclone strike impacts on output
levels appear persistent (e.g., Raddatz, 2007; Strobl, 2011; Hsiang and Jina, 2014; Elliott et
al., 2015). This stylized fact is at odds with a standard Ramsey model, which would imply
a growth rebound after the initial negative impact, motivating the exploration of alternative
frameworks.

3     Modi…ed Empirical Approach
3.1    Total Factor Productivity
Though the empirical literature frequently focuses on GDP per capita growth as an outcome
variable, these impact estimates are di¢ cult to incorporate directly into macroeconomic
climate-economy models as GDP growth is typically endogenized. In contrast, climate im-
pacts upon structural model parameters are straightforward to interpret and utilize. We thus
begin by conducting a standard growth accounting exercise that decomposes cyclone output
growth impacts into productivity versus factor input changes. The appropriate empirical
speci…cation depends on the structure of the climate-economy model for which the estimates
are intended. First, in the seminal DICE framework, countries produce GDP Yj;t with capital
Kj;t and labor LPj;top (measured by population) inputs via Cobb-Douglas technology:

                                     Yj;t = ADICE
                                             j;t  Kj;tD (LPj;top )1        D
                                                                                                        (3)

Taking logs and rearranging yields:
                                                                                    h            i
                  ln(ADICE
                      jt   ) = ln(Yj;t )          D   ln(Kj;t )     (1         D)    ln(LPj;top )       (4)

Using Penn World Tables (PWT) data on GDP, capital stocks, and populations, one can
thus back out ‘DICE TFP’from (4) given the relevant capital share ( DICE = 0:67).
   For DICE, climate change impacts on human capital factors such as educational attain-
ment should thus be counted in TFP. In contrast, other models may endogenize human
capital accumulation. Indeed, in light of the potential links between cyclone risks and hu-
man capital (e.g., Skidmore and Toya, 2002; Ikefuji and Horii, 2012), our model speci…es
production as a Cobb-Douglas aggregate of physical and human capital stocks:

                                                                1
                                         Yj;t = Aj;t Kj;tj;t Hj;t    j;t
                                                                                                        (5)

For this speci…cation, the appropriate TFP series is given by:
                                                                          h                         i
                                                                                             P op
             ln(Aj;t ) = ln(Yj;t )       j;t ln(Kj;t )     (1       j;t )  ln(hcj;t ) + ln(L j;t  )     (6)

We map (6) into the data following standard approaches (e.g., Hall and Jones, 1999) that
specify human capital-augmented labor Hj;t as the product of the number of workers Lj;t and
human capital per worker hcj;t : The latter, in turn, is provided by PWT based on schooling
data and returns to education estimates (Inklaar and Timmer, 2013). As our model features


                                                      18
inelastic labor supply, we also use LPj;top as a measure of workers. Following Gollin (2002) we
assume common labor shares across countries and set 1           jt = 0:67 8j; t.

    The preferred speci…cation de-trends each TFP series log-linearly through the inclusion
of country-speci…c time trends ( j t) and year …xed-e¤ects t in an estimating equation
which follows the standard panel approach (analogous to (2) but for TFP):

                                                                             X

                                                                                     A
                              ln(Aj;t ) =     j   +   t   +(     j    t) +           1+l "j;t l   +   j;t                  (7)

mated TFP impacts persisting up to around 5 years. The Online Appendix shows results
for alternative lag structures. Additional lags reduces the estimates’ precision, but leave
the magnitudes similar. For completeness, Column (5) presents estimates of the DICE TFP
impacts on the un…ltered sample of available country-years for this indicator. That is, com-
pared to Column (2), Column (5) add 36 countries that lack PWT data on education and/or
employment, which renders the cyclone impact estimates noisy, echoing the results of Section
2:1:2. The Online Appendix shows additional results for speci…cations that (i) de-trend TFP
through HP-…ltering, which leads to broadly similar results, and (ii) use energy as cyclone
intensity measure, which yields somewhat noisier estimates. Overall, the results thus suggest
that one of the channels through which cyclone strikes a¤ect realized growth is by lowering
TFP.17


3.2      Depreciation
While there is limited literature guidance for the estimation of cyclone TFP impacts, nu-
merous studies have quanti…ed cyclone destruction of property and human life as a function
of storm characteristics. Following these studies (e.g., Kahn, 2005; Nordhaus, 2010b; Schu-
macher and Strobl, 2011; Hsiang and Narita, 2012), we specify polynomial damage functions:

      Loayza et al. (2012) consider a productivity impact channel for disasters by including capital investment
      rates in several output impact regressions, but do not estimate a structural damage function for TFP
      impacts.
18
      Since we use the same explanatory variables for physical capital and fatality regressions, a seemingly
      unrelated regression (SUR) approach would not change the results.



                                                                    20
Table 5 displays the results for our preferred cyclone measure of maximum wind speed (per
square kilometer). As expected, depreciation losses are increasing in wind speeds, albeit with
heterogeneous steepness across countries. Column (1) adopts country …xed e¤ects as damage
covariates x0j;t . This speci…cation allows countries to di¤er in baseline damages conditional
on experiencing a cyclone, but with common curvature in wind speed. Given the empir-
ical literature’s …nding that damage curves are considerably steeper in the United States
(e.g., Nordhaus, 2010b; Strobl, 2011) than globally (Hsiang and Narita, 2012; Bakkensen
and Mendelsohn, 2016), Column (2) presents a U.S.-only speci…cation, which con…rms this
pattern.19
    Finally, Columns (4) and (6) allow depreciation damages to vary with countries’levels of
economic development and the population share living below …ve meters elevation in coastal
zones. Importantly, while there are many other potential determinants of countries’cyclone
vulnerability, these are two covariates we would expect to have …rst-order relevance and
for which we can obtain projections of future levels in order to consider potential changes
in countries’ future vulnerabilities. As expected, the results indicate that both physical
and human capital depreciation impacts are signi…cantly larger in countries with larger
population shares in low-lying coastal areas, and signi…cantly mitigated in countries with
higher economic development.
19
     Quantitatively, the results may di¤er from studies normalizing damages by GDP as we study damages
     as a fraction of countries’capital stocks, which are not equiproportional to GDP across countries.

4      Cyclone Risk Changes
The empirical estimates presented thus far quantify the impacts of weather shocks "j;t . Link-
ing these estimates to climate-economy models requires a quanti…cation of how the probabil-
ity distribution of these shocks will change along with the global climate, indexed by global
mean surface temperature T in decade , speci…cally cyclone probability density functions
(pdfs) fj ("jT ): The availability of atmospheric science data to estimate such pdfs was previ-
ously limited, forcing some earlier literature to evaluate damage functions at the projected
future means of cyclone intensity, e¤ectively computing damages at expected intensity rather


                                                              22
than expected damages (e.g., Narita, Tol, Antho¤, 2009; see also review by Ranson et al.,
2014). Of course, if damage functions k ("j;t ) are convex, this approach risks underesti-
mating expected future impacts. In this paper we gratefully take advantage of advances
in climatological research from Kerry Emanuel and co-authors (Emanuel, 2008; Emanuel,
Sundararajan, and Williams, 2008; and as utilized by Mendelsohn et al., 2012) to construct
estimates of cyclone pdf s. Their work generates 68,000 simulated synthetic tropical cyclone
tracks under each of the current (1980-2000) and future climate, speci…cally 2080-2100 under
the IPCC’s A1B emissions scenario and processed through four di¤erent general circulation
models. Our benchmark analysis focuses on results using NOAA’s GFDL model (17,000
simulated tracks; Manabe et al., 1991), but we also consider alternatives in our sensitivity
analysis below. The synthetic cyclone tracks contain parallel information to the historical
record, such as storm latitude, longitude, and wind speeds at points along the track life. Re-
cent literature that has used synthetic tracks to inform both current cyclone risk assessments
(Hallegatte, 2007; Elliott, Strobl, Sun, 2015) and projections of direct cyclone damages from
climate change (Hallegatte, 2009; Mendelsohn et al., 2012).
    In order to estimate cyclone pdfs at the country-year level, we conduct Monte Carlo
simulations based on current and future landfall frequencies and sampling from either the
historical cyclone record (to estimate current risk) or from synthetic tracks (to estimate
future risk) (see Online Appendix). Importantly, this process captures changes in expected
future intensity driven both by changes in the number and characteristics of storms. For
landfall frequencies, we adopt a Poisson distribution (Emanuel, 2013). For our preferred
cyclone measure of maximum wind speeds, the literature has found Weibull distributions
to provide the best …t (Johnson and Watson 2007), which we consequently use to estimate
cyclone pdfs for each country.20 To validate this approach, we compare the expected annual
maximum wind speeds from the Weibull model against empirically observed means in the
data. The Weibull model reproduces the data extremely well, with a correlation coe¢ cient
of 0.9982 (plotted in Online Appendix Figure A1).
    In order to illustrate the potential impacts of climate change on cyclone risks, Figure 1
next compares the current (from data) and projected future maximum wind speed distri-
bution for four example countries. The simulations indicate highly heterogeneous impacts,
with cyclone risk increases in some regions (e.g., United States), but decreases in others (e.g.,
20
     While ‘fat tails’ have been noted as a concern for some climate risks, cyclone wind speeds face a
     physical upper bound (Holland and Emanuel, 2011), and …tting even a log-normal distribution can
     imply "meteorologically unrealistic" upper tail behavior of excessive wind speeds (Johnson and Watson,
     2007). Relatedly, Conte and Kelly (2016) …nd that cyclone damages in the United States follow a fat
     tailed distribution due to the spatial distribution of properties, but that household-level damages and
     the wind speed distribution are thin tailed. We account for uniquely high U.S. damages by utilizing a
     separate capital depreciation elasticity.

Australia). Countries are also predicted to experience heterogeneous changes in the variabil-
ity of cyclone intensity, with tightening distributions in some (e.g., India), but increasing
variability in others. Figure 2 presents results for a broader set of countries, speci…cally by
comparing current annual maximum wind speeds (x-axis) against expected future annual
maximum wind speeds (y-axis). By comparing the location of each point (country) against
the plotted 45 line, we see again some countries are predicted to experience substantial
increases in average risk, whereas others are predicted to see declines in average cyclone
activity.

5    Stochastic Endogenous Growth Cyclone-Economy Model
This section presents our country-speci…c stochastic endogenous growth cyclone-economy
model designed to incorporate the empirical evidence from Section 3. The framework builds
closely on Krebs (2003ab, 2006; see also Krebs et al., 2015), who develops a heterogeneous
agent version of this class of model to study the implications of idiosyncratic human capital
and business cycle risks for household savings, investment, growth, and welfare. We con-
sider a representative agent economy but allow for (i) correlated shocks to both human and
physical capital, (ii) partial insurance availability, and (iii) an application and damage spec-
i…cation to natural disaster risk, speci…cally tropical cyclones. As the prior theory literature
has analyzed disaster impacts in other endogenous growth models (e.g., Ikefuji and Hoori,
2012), our fundamental contribution here is that we bring such a model to the data. That
is, we produce a novel integration of empirical evidence into a structural model, and produce
quantitative estimates of growth and welfare impacts resulting from cyclone risk changes
for 40 countries. In particular, we show that making the econometrically identifying level of
variation (weather realizations) explicit in the structure of model allows for a straightforward
integration of empirically estimated impact functions into an environment-economy model.

of uninsured damages. The representative agent in country j chooses state-contingent plans
for consumption cj;t and investments in human and physical capital (xhj;t ; xkj;t ) to maximize:

     We now suppress the time subscripts on the damage functions hj (:); kj (:) as the model treats these as

     later allow for the possibility that damage functions change along with cyclone risks.

Equilibrium Growth Following Krebs (2003b), it is straightforward to show (see Online
Appendix) that the capital ratio kej and the savings rate sej that solve the household’s problem
in stationary equilibrium (where e kj;t = kej and sej;t = sej ) are jointly determined by:
                                                 1

Intuitively, optimal savings sej follows from the household’s Euler Equation, whereas (18)
expresses a no-arbitrage condition for human and physical capital. Equations (17)-(18) thus
implicitly characterize how cyclone risk a¤ects equilibrium savings and investments which,

    growth rates, the latter measure serves as upper bound on the implications of the lagged model.

Equations (15)-(20) illustrate how the model captures the cyclone-growth impact mecha-
nisms described in Section 2. As these results are qualitatively standard, we relegate their
formal illustration to the Online Appendix, and only summarize the key points here. First,
if households are su¢ ciently risk averse, an increase in cyclone risk may increase the equi-
librium savings rate (17), thus increasing long-run growth (19), ceteris paribus. Second, if
human and physical capital have di¤erent vulnerability to storms ( hj ("j;t ) 6= kj ("j;t )), an
increase in cyclone risk may change the household’s optimal portfolio allocation kej (de…ned
by (18)). In particular, if physical capital is more susceptible to storms, higher cyclone risk
may induce households to invest relatively more in human capital. Third, higher storm risk
increases average depreciation and lowers TFP, thus decreasing average returns and hence
long-term growth (19), ceteris paribus. In sum, an increase in cyclone risk thus has a the-
oretically ambiguous impact on average growth, whereas a cyclone strike unambiguously
reduces realized returns (15) and thus year-to-year growth (20), in line with the empirical
evidence. Finally, the model also captures the empirical stylized facts that cyclone strike
impacts persistently decrease output levels.
    In sum, our parsimonious model thus arguably matches several of the empirical litera-
ture’s key …ndings. Of course it also has some shortcomings that should be noted. Human
capital accumulation does not induce a positive growth externality à la Lucas (1988), so
that the bene…ts of increased human capital may be understated. More broadly, endogenous
growth models di¤er in the underlying source of growth. The present framework features
constant returns to scale in reproducible factors. This class of models is standard in modern
stochastic growth models, including in many analyses of disasters and growth (e.g., Pindyck
and Wang, 2013; Bretschger and Vinogradova, 2016), quantitative models of human capital
risk over the business cycle (e.g., Krebs, 2003ab, 2015) and also leading advancements in
stochastic climate-economy modeling (e.g., van den Bremer and van der Ploeg, 2018). At
the same time, this structure has known shortcomings in matching certain moments such as
on cross-country convergence (Mankiw, Romer, Weil, 1994). While alternative models may
thus better explain advancements in international technology frontiers and the growth of


                                                        28
mature economies, for capturing the marginal e¤ects of cyclone risk changes on growth, we
argue that our model provides a natural starting point …rmly in line with related literature.
We also note that the core contribution of this paper lies in its joint empirical-structural
approach to climate change impact estimation, which can readily be extended to other types
of models. Indeed, Section 6 integrates our damage functions into the seminal DICE model,
a Ramsey growth framework (Nordhaus, e.g., 2010a).

5.0.2    Quanti…cation

We quantify the model for each country using a combination of data, estimation, matching
of moments, and external calibration. Table 6 summarizes the calibration strategy. Initial
capital stock levels (K0;j ) are taken directly from the data (Penn World Tables), with a model
                                                                                       K
base year (indexed by 0) of 2014. Human capital stocks are backed out via H0;j = ek 0;j after
                                                                                        0;j
                                               e
solving for initial asset allocation ratios (k0;j ) as described below. We obtain estimates of
the currently insured fraction of disaster damages from MunichRe’s NatCatService, which
range from 55% in high income countries to only 3.3% in low income countries.24;25 Cyclone
risk pdfs ( fj ("jT )) and damage functions ( kj ("); hj ("); A  j (")) are as estimated in Sections
4 and 3, respectively. Baseline (i.e., non-cyclone) depreciation rates ( k ; h ) are calibrated
at standard rates from the literature, as are the capital share ( ), utility discount factor
( ), and coe¢ cient of relative risk aversion (CRR, ). Finally, our calibration then matches
observed base year GDP per capita growth g0;j (from Penn World Tables) at base year cyclone
realizations "0;j (from IBTrACS) in each country by solving jointly for initial productivity
level A0;j , savings-out-of-wealth rates se0;j ; and asset allocation ratios ek0;j via (17), (18), and
     26
(20).
    We …rst consider the ceteris paribus e¤ect of changing cyclone risks in today’s economy,
with insurance rates and damage functions evaluated at current covariate levels. Welfare
changes are measured as percent change in stationary equilibrium welfare under the cur-
rent versus future climate. Figures 4 and 5 present the results for projected welfare and
growth impacts, respectively (dark bars). The results reveal signi…cant heterogeneity in
24
     In upper middle income countries, the fraction is 11.7%, and in lower middle income countries, 5.2%.
     Income groupings are based on 2017 gross national income per capita as per World Bank classi…cation.
25
     Deryugina (2017) shows that general …scal transfers constitute an important source of implicit disaster
     insurance in the U.S., suggesting that our base insurance measure may be an underestimate in similar
     countries. We consider higher insurance rates based on future income adjustments, as described below.
26
     At this step we drop six countries from the sample that experienced negative growth in 2014, in some
     cases severely so due to warfare or other non-modeled crises (e.g., Yemen, Venezuela). Seeking to match
     their growth rates yields problematic calibration results, such as savings-out-of-wealth ratios in excess
     of unity. The other dropped countries are Oman, St. Lucia, The Bahamas, and the British Virgin
     Islands.

the projected e¤ects of climate-induced cyclone risk changes across countries, ranging from
substantial negative impacts in vulnerable small island states (e.g., a -6% welfare change
in St. Vincent and the Grenadines) to small welfare gains in countries where cyclone risks
are predicted to decline with global warming. The predicted growth impacts mirror this
heterogeneity, but are generally smaller in magnitude. Another striking result is that the
United States stands out among the ‘top 10’of most negatively impacted countries, which
are otherwise mostly poor and/or small island states. This result is in line with empirical
evidence that the United States appears uniquely vulnerable to hurricanes given its levels of
income and exposure (see, e.g., Bakkensen and Mendelsohn, 2016).
    We next consider the combination of future cyclone and vulnerability changes by evalu-
ating damage coe¢ cients at projected future (2095-2105) levels of GDP and the population
share living below …ve meters elevation, respectively,27 and allowing insurance rates to in-
crease along with projected economic development.28 The results are also displayed in Fig-
ures 3 and 4 (light grey bars). We …nd that reductions in future cyclone vulnerability due to
continued economic development may vastly mitigate the potential losses from future cyclone

     GDP projections are based on regionally di¤erentiated business-as-usual per capita GDP growth pro-
     jections from the RICE model (Nordhaus, 2011), applied to each country’s GDP per capita levels in
     2015. Low elevation population projections to 2100 are from CIESIN (2013).

     We assume that the relationship between incomes and insurance remains as currently observed in
     MunichRe data, and assign 2095 insurance rates based on countries’projected future incomes.

risk increases. Indeed, there are a number of cases where the ceteris paribus welfare impacts
of cyclone risk increases may be substantial and negative, but where the combined e¤ect of
future changes in cyclone risk and vulnerability is predicted to be positive (e.g., Comoros,
Belize, Haiti, Mozambique, etc.). That is, in a ‘horse race’, the protective e¤ects of economic
and insurance market development are predicted to outweigh cyclone risk increases in several
countries. Of course we must caution that there are further sources of future vulnerability
change that are not included in our model, such as learning from increased cyclone exposure
conditional on income (which would decrease future vulnerability, ceteris paribus, see, e.g.,
Schumacher and Strobl, 2011; Hsiang and Narita, 2012; and Fried, 2019), or sea level rise
(which will increase future vulnerability to storms conditional on intensity, ceteris paribus).
    We present additional model results for a number of alternative speci…cations in the On-
line Appendix, including for 5-year TFP impacts, three alternative climate models (MIROC,
CNRM, and ECHAM), and for the MunichRe data-based capital depreciation function. As
expected, the cumulative TFP impacts speci…cation generally implies higher welfare losses
associated with cyclone risk increases. For example, Haiti’s predicted welfare impacts of
ceteris paribus cyclone risk changes increase from -0.56% in the benchmark to -1.84% in this
speci…cation. At the same time, cumulative TFP impacts can also increase the welfare gains
associated with cyclone risk declines. For example, Japan’s welfare impacts of ceteris paribus
cyclone risk changes increase from +0.024% to +0.12%. For the other sensitivity runs, we
…nd that the model predictions have mixed sensitivity to these changes. In some countries,
there are qualitative di¤erences across climate models. For example, in Bangladesh, while
the benchmark model implies a cyclone risk decline, other climate models predict increases
in cyclone risk with global warming, and associated negative welfare impacts. Conversely,
in the Dominican Republic, the MIROC climate model predicts a cyclone risk decrease im-
plying a welfare gain, whereas our benchmark scenario implies a cyclone risk increase and
corresponding welfare loss. Similarly, the MunichRe-based damage function increases the
projected welfare costs of cyclone risk changes in, e.g., the United States (from -0.25% to
-0.31%) , but also increases welfare gains in countries predicted to experience cyclone risk
declines, such as Japan (from +0.024% to +0.033%). In other cases, the results appear simi-
lar. We address the overall sensitivity of the results to these variations through an analogous
sensitivity check in the DICE model extension. While individual country predictions may
vary, we …nd that the aggregate costs of climate-induced cyclone risk changes appear broadly
robust to these model variations, as shown in the next section.

6     DICE Model Integration
In order to gauge the aggregate implications of cyclone risk changes for global climate policy,
this section concludes by presenting an integration of our damage functions into the seminal
DICE climate-economy model (Nordhaus, e.g., 1992, 2011). DICE serves as a central bench-
mark across the literature, and is one of three frameworks used by the U.S. government to
value the social cost of carbon (Greenstone, Kopits, and Wolverton, 2013).
    The DICE model is deterministic and speci…es climate change impacts as output-equivalent
loss D(T ) as a function of the mean global atmospheric temperature change T in decade
  . The …rst step in mapping our estimates into DICE is thus to compute expected annual
capital depreciation, fatalities, and TFP losses under di¤erent climates for each country.
Speci…cally, we use our estimates for damage function (8) and cyclone pdfs for each country
to compute:
                                                    Z   1
                                  k                         h
                           Ej [   j;t (")jT   ] =           j;t (")   fj ("jT )d"             (21)
                                                    0
                                                    Z   1
                                  h                         h
                           Ej [   j;t (")jT   ] =           j;t (")   fj ("jT )d"
                                                    0


For TFP impacts, we focus on the cumulative damage speci…cation A ("j;t ; :::"j;t 4 ) = cA 1 "j;t +
cA "           cA
  2 j;t 1 +:::+ 5 "j;t 4 as our aggregate e¤ects ultimately appear to be quite modest. Assum-
ing independence in year-to-year cyclone ‡uctuations, expected annual cyclone TFP impacts
in country j can then be estimated through an analogous speci…cation to (21). As a sec-
ond step, we then aggregate expected impacts across countries, using global GDP shares as
weights for TFP impacts, global capital shares as weights for physical depreciation impacts,
and populations as weights for fatality impacts. Table 8 presents the resulting estimates
of global aggregate expected annual cyclone impacts under the current and future climate,
respectively.
    These results reveal the following insights. First, global heterogeneity in projected cyclone
risk changes across countries nets out to an increase in aggregate expected damages. For
example, annual expected global TFP losses due to cyclones are projected to increase by
around 14% (from 0.0288% to 0.0329%). With …xed damage functions, capital depreciation
is moreover predicted to increase by around 75%; for fatalities, the relevant …gure is 5-11%.
Second, while the levels of estimated losses may appear small, their magnitude is broadly in
line with historical data. While cyclones can be locally extremely destructive, their impacts
are limited both geographically and physically, especially as a fraction of global capital stocks
and populations.

For example, even the $108 billion in damages caused by Hurricane Katrina - the costliest
storm in U.S. history - accounted for only 0.24% of the U.S. capital stock at the time, ($44.4
trillion, $2011), or 0.042% of the global capital stock. A third result to emerge from Table
8 is the critical importance of U.S. cyclone damages for the global aggregate. For example,
if we project future damages assuming that the United States will maintain its separate
damage function (based on Column 2 of Table 5), global capital losses are estimated to be
0.0087% per year. If, instead, we assume that the United States will follow other countries’
pattern of decreasing vulnerability with further economic development (based on Column 4
of Table 5), projected global capital losses are only 0.0016%. That is, limited adaptation
to cyclones in the U.S. could increase global damages by more than a factor of …ve. These
results thus highlight the importance of ongoing research illuminating distinct U.S. cyclone
damage patterns (e.g., Nordhaus, 2010b; Conte and Kelly, 2016; Bakkensen and Mendelsohn,
2016; Fried, 2019).
     The next step in the DICE model integration is to convert our estimates into climate
damage functions, which ought to re‡ect only the additional impacts due to warming T in
decade . The benchmark DICE model aggregates climate impacts into an output-equivalent
loss D(T ): That is, available (net of damages) output in DICE di¤ers from (3) via:

                        Y DICE = (1    D(T ))ADICE
                                              j;t  Kj;tD (LPj;top )1   D




                                             34
We add three cyclone-speci…c damage functions into DICE. First, we integrate cyclone-
induced capital depreciation explicitly into the model’s law of motion for capital by making
the depreciation rate a function of the climate (T ) (and where I denotes investment):

                                      K   +1   = K (1           (T )) + I

Second, for fatality impacts, we introduce an e¤ective labor parameter ZH (T ) designed to
capture the cumulative loss in the e¤ective work force due to climate change up until time
  with T      fT ; T 1 ; :::T0 g.29 Third, for TFP impacts, we also specify an e¤ective (i.e.,
net of cyclone damages) decadal productivity term ZA (T ). The aggregate (net) production
function in our extended DICE model is thus given by:

             Y DICE+Cyclones = ZA (T ) (1         D(T ))ADICE
                                                         j;t  Kj;tD [LPj;top ZH (T )]1         D
                                                                                                         (22)

Given that natural scientists generally project the global cyclone intensity-temperature re-
lationship to be linear (Holland and Bruyere, 2014), and adopting NOAA’s assessment that
anthropogenic warming between pre-industrial and current times has not yet altered tropical
cyclone patterns (GFDL, 2018), we extrapolate linearly to convert the results of Table 8 into
the following damage function parameterizations (see Online Appendix for details). First,
letting denote the benchmark annual depreciation rate assumed in DICE, and adding in
annual expected cyclone damages, the decadal depreciation rate becomes:

                                      (T ) = 1      [(1            ck T )10 ]                            (23)

The e¤ective work force term ZH (T ) is similarly given by:

                                                   Y
                                                                             10
                                     ZH (T ) =      (1           ch T   j)                               (24)
                                                   j=0


Intuitively, (24) equals one minus cumulative cyclone deaths through decade : Finally, the
e¤ective TFP term is given by:

In the aggregate, we …nd only modest increases in the optimal global social cost of carbon af-
ter integrating our estimated damage functions into DICE. Though perhaps surprising from
the perspective of the United States, where cyclone damages are among the world’s largest
and projected to increases signi…cantly with global warming, this result is less surprising in
light of the substantial heterogeneity in expected cyclone-warming impacts around the world
(see Figure 2). In addition, regional cyclone impacts are modest relative to the global econ-
omy. Nonetheless, there are reasons to suspect that our estimates may understate the true
SCC impact of tropical cyclone changes. First, as DICE is deterministic, the welfare costs
of uninsurable risk changes and behavioral responses thereto are not accounted for. Second,
our estimates exclude some cyclone-vulnerable countries due to data limitations, and may of
course be generally attenuated due to measurement error. Third, our estimates also do not
account for potential future cyclone vulnerability increases due to sea level rise. At the same
time, they also do not account for some mechanisms that may decrease future vulnerabil-
ity, such as learning-based adaptation conditional on income, or technological innovations.
Ceteris paribus, these omissions would be expected to bias our SCC estimates upwards. As
a growing empirical literature continues to explore these issues, it would be a rich area for
future work to build on the frameworks presented in this paper to integrate new empirical
evidence into structural environment-economy models.

7    Conclusion
This paper proposes a novel empirical-structural approach to analyze the macroeconomic
consequences of climate change with a focus on tropical cyclones. We …rst empirically and
conceptually review competing approaches to quantifying cyclone impacts on growth. We
highlight that di¤erences in reduced-form …ndings, driven in part by empirical choices, are
maintained using a comprehensive dataset yet can also be reconciled through a theoretical
lens. Importantly, theory also tells us that even perfectly identi…ed reduced-form regressions
of growth on cyclone shocks or risk may not be individually su¢ cient to characterize the
welfare e¤ects of future changes in cyclone risks given broader general equilibrium changes.
    Second, we present our approach to estimating and modeling cyclone impacts designed
to combine empirical evidence with the structure of a model to deliver welfare cost estimates
and policy implications. We propose that empirical research focus on quantifying cyclone
impacts on the structural determinants of growth, and not just growth itself, as the latter
is typically endogenous in macroeconomic climate-economy models. We then present a sto-
chastic endogenous growth cyclone-climate-economy model that we quantify separately for
40 cyclone-vulnerable nations. Important for policy, we …nd signi…cant heterogeneity of pro-
jected climate change impacts, ranging from substantial negative e¤ects in vulnerable small
island states, to small welfare gains in countries where cyclone risks are predicted to decline
with global warming. The United States stands out among the most negatively impacted
countries.
    Third, in order to assess the global climate policy implications of changing cyclone risks,
we integrate our cyclone impact estimates into the seminal DICE model and assess their
impact on the social cost of carbon. More broadly, our approach highlights opportunities to
reduce the "micro-macro" gap between growing empirical evidence on macroeconomic im-
pacts and the quanti…cation climate-economy models. We show that only minor extensions
of existing empirical approaches yield structurally interpretable impact estimates. We also
demonstrate how modifying climate-economy model structure to make weather explicit per-
mits (i) direct incorporation of plausibly causally identi…ed impact estimates, (ii) accounting
for macroeconomic adaptation through endogenous adjustments in savings and investments,
and (iii) computing welfare costs of changes in climatic risks. As frontier advancements in
stochastic climate-economy models are now able to account for multiple sources of uncer-
tainty at high frequency (Cai and Lontzek, 2019), extending a truly integrated assessment
models to explicit consideration of weather impacts may thus be an interesting area for fu-
ture work and facilitate linkages to the empirical literature. Similarly, while our quantitative
results are subject to numerous limitations ranging from our abstractions of advancements


                                              37
in wind-…eld modeling (Strobl, 2011; Hsiang and Narita, 2012) to distinguishing productive
and adaptation capital (e.g., Fried, 2019), our proposed method seeks to complement these
empirical and modeling advancements so as to facilitate the integration of both frontiers and
to improve our understanding of the social costs of climate change.
