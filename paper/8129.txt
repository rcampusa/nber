         Countries have historically rationalized various fixed exchange rate regimes with the

argument that trade would be adversely affected by exchange rate volatility. According to this

view, uncertainty about exchange rate movements makes firms less likely to export or import

goods, and, to the extent that firms engage in trade, makes them incur exchange rate risk. In this

paper we directly examine the relationship between exchange rate movements, firm value and

trade. Specifically, the paper tests whether firm-level exchange rate exposure is related to trade

flows.

I. Explaining Exchange Rate Exposure

         Firms are defined as “exposed” to exchange rate risk if market-adjusted firm returns are

correlated with changes in currency values. We measure exposure in the context of the CAPM.

Firm returns are regressed on the market portfolio and dollar exchange rate changes, and the

coefficient on the exchange rate is the resulting measure of dollar exposure. Estimates of firm-

level exchange rate exposure across eight countries are reported in Kathryn M. Dominguez and

Linda L. Tesar (2001); that paper reports a substantial degree of exposure. The objective of this

paper is to understand the forces underlying this exposure. In particular, the paper tests whether

trade is an important determinant of exchange rate exposure.

         There are a number of hypotheses in the literature concerning the causes of exposure to

exchange rate risk. At the industry level, industry structure may matter most for exposure. For

example, in less competitive industries, prices are elevated above marginal cost, so firms will

have the ability to absorb modest exchange rate changes by adjusting local currency prices and

lowering “pass through”. In more competitive industries we might expect close to perfect pass-

through and therefore larger effects of exchange rate movements on stock returns. On the other




                                                                                                     1
hand, firms in these more competitive industries that understand their vulnerabilities have

incentives to hedge exchange rate risk.

         The same logic applies at the firm level. It may be that firms that are highly international

– in the sense that a relatively large fraction of their business involves foreign trade – are most

likely to be influenced by exchange rate changes. Alternatively, it may be that the more

international is a firm, the more likely that it will have an incentive to hedge exchange rate risk.

Likewise, it may be that larger firms are more likely to be exposed because they are also the

most likely to have international operations, or to compete with foreign companies. Again, on

the other hand, it may be that large firms have better resources to engage in both natural and

financial hedging activities. Surveys of U.S. financial hedging behavior suggests that larger firms

are more likely to engage in hedging activities than are smaller companies (Deana Nance,

Clifford Smith, and Charles Smithson, 1993). Our empirical work tests some of these hypotheses

by examining whether the estimated exchange rate exposure betas can be explained by variables

that proxy for the level of international activity, firm size, industry affiliation and country

affiliation.

         Although theory suggests a number of channels through which firms and industries may

be exposed to exchange rate risk, theory offers few unambiguous exclusion restrictions. Firm

size, industry affiliation and degree of internationalization are all factors that may influence

whether a firm or industry is exposed. However, the precise linkage between those factors and

the direction of the exposure is unclear. As a consequence, our strategy is to take a data-driven

approach to learning more about what are the determinants of firm-level exposure.

         The data used in the study are from Datastream and span eight countries (Chile, France,

Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Thailand and the UK) using a broad sample of firms.




                                                                                                        2
The specific countries were chosen both on the basis of data availability and to include in our

sample both OECD and developing countries. At the firm level we have information on market

capitalization and industry affiliation. And, at the industry level we have information on bilateral

trade flows from Robert Feenstra’s World Trade Flows database, and export, import and

imported input share data from Jose Campa and Linda Goldberg (1997) for Japan and the UK.

For countries with large numbers of publicly traded firms (in our sample these include Germany,

Japan and the UK) we selected a representative sample of firms (25% of the population) based

on market capitalization and industry affiliation. For the remaining countries we include the

population of firms. The samples include an average of 300 firms for each country; Japan

includes the largest number of firms at 488; Chile has the smallest number at 199. Firms with

fewer than six months of data over the period 1980 to 1999 were excluded from the sample.

        The basic regression specification has the firm-level dollar exposure beta as the

dependent variable1 and firm- and industry-level information as explanatory variables.

         β1,i =γ 0 + γ 1Difirmsize + γ 2Dkindustry + γ 3Tradek + ε i

All regressions include dummy variables for firm size. These are based on firm-level market

capitalization where separate dummies are used for large-sized (top-third) and medium-sized

(middle-third) firms(small-sized firms being the excluded category). We also include a measure

of industry affiliation in most of our regression specifications. Datastream provides a fairly

disaggregated set of (4-digit) industry groupings (39 categories), from which we create a set of

dummy variables (the excluded category being industry 52 “general retailers”). Various

measures of industry level trade are also included in the regressions.

    Future work will explore alternative first-stage estimates of the exposure betas.



                                                                                                       3
II. Does Trade Explain Exposure?

        The first cut at the data examines whether (1) the tradability of a firm’s product, (2) the

size of bilateral trade flows in an industry, and (3) industry affiliation help to explain firm-level

dollar exposure. Table 1 presents this first set of results. Each cell in the table summarizes the

results of a different country-specific second-stage regression specification (where the dependent

variable, the dollar exposure beta, is estimated from a first stage augmented CAPM regression).

The first column in the table indicates that knowledge of whether the firm is in an industry

whose products are actively traded between countries is not useful in predicting dollar exposure,

except for the UK. Likewise, information about bilateral trade flows to the US is also not good a

predictor of firm-level dollar exposure except for Japan and the Netherlands. And, with the

exception of Japan and Thailand, the results suggest that knowledge of industry affiliation

reveals little about firm-level exposure.

        The basic second-stage regression specification is somewhat restricted in that it asks not

only whether firm size, industry affiliation, and trade flows play roles in foreign exchange rate

exposure, but it also implicitly restricts the direction of the exposure to be the same within each

of those categories. It is possible, for example, that two firms in the same industry are strongly

affected by exchange rate movements, but one firm benefits from an exchange rate appreciation

while another firm is made worse off by an appreciation. To see whether our right-hand-side

variables contain information about the magnitude of exposure, if not the direction of the

exposure, we include the dollar exposure beta in log-odds absolute value form. 2 The results of

this specification are indicated in the last column of table 1. The fraction of industries with

2
   A number of studies in the literature estimate the second-stage regression using the simple absolute
value of the exposure beta as the dependent variable. This imposes a truncated bias. We include the
absolute value of the exposure beta in log-odds form (ln(|ß|/(1-|ß|) – which allows for both positive and
negative values and therefore leaves the error term normally distributed, but does not restrict the sign on
the exposure variable.


                                                                                                              4
statistically significant exposure rises for some of the countries in this less restrictive

specification.

        Campa and Goldberg (1997) provide another measure of industry-specific trade

orientation for two of our eight countries, Japan and the UK. They provide measures of export

share, import share and imported input shares for a number of manufacturing industries in 1993.

Although these data are not based on bilateral trade with the US, it offers another proxy for

relative levels of trade across industries. The Campa and Goldberg data are included as

explanatory variables in the basic second stage regressions together with the firm size dummy

variables. The results (not reported in the tables) suggest that all three measures of trade shares

are statistically significant for Japan, but not the UK. In the case of Japan, higher export shares in

an industry are positively related to the firm-level dollar exposure betas in that industry, while

higher import shares and imported input shares in an industry are negatively related to exposure

in that industry. Given the caveat that these data are only available for two countries, it is re-

assuring to note that the results for both Japan and the UK are consistent using the bilateral trade

flows and the Campa and Goldberg (1997) trade shares.

                 Although the results reported in Table 1 do not provide strong evidence that trade

flows are an important determinant of exposure, the possibility remains that there are “threshold”

effects for trade. In particular, it may be that only firms in industries that are heavily involved in

international trade are the most likely to be exposed. One way to test this hypothesis is to focus

only on the top export and import industries in each country. Although we find that a number of

firms in these top export and import categories are exposed to the dollar (for example, the

automobile industry for Germany and Japan) industry affiliation generally does not help predict

this exposure. Regardless of how the exposure beta is measured (signed or in log-odds absolute




                                                                                                         5
value form), we find that knowing that a firm is in a “top” trade industry for a country generally

does not help predict firm-level exposure.

        One shortcoming of these tests for the source of exposure is that they do not control for

industry structure. The results in George Allayannis and Jane Ihrig (2001) suggest that

excluding information about the level of mark-ups in an industry will produce less precise

estimates of exposure. Unfortunately we do not have cross-country industry-specific information

about mark-ups. However, if one assumes that industry structure is constant across countries

(which is reasonable in high-trade industries), it is possible to control for mark-ups by using a

cross-country industry-specific regression specification. In other words, looking within an

industry, is it the case that countries with more trade in that industry also have more dollar

exposure?

        The results of this regression are presented in table 2. The dependent variable is the

industry-specific, cross-country firm-level dollar exposure beta and the explanatory variables

include a constant and the average dollar value of trade (exports plus imports) with the US in that

country’s industry over the period 1980-1997. The industries included in the table were chosen

on the basis of availability of Trade Data (from Robert Feenstra’s World Trade Flows database)

and a minimum number of 30 firms in each industry. The results based on the signed exposure

beta specification suggest that industry-specific trade flows help predict cross-country firm-level

exposure in two industries: chemicals and automobiles. When the exposure beta is included in

log-odds absolute value form, the trade flows help predict the magnitude of exposure in five out

of twelve industries. Somewhat counter-intuitively, however, the coefficient on the value of trade

is negative in four out of the five cases in which it is statistically significant. This suggests that

knowing that a firm is from a country where trade is “high” in its industry predicts that exposure




                                                                                                         6
(whether positive or negative) will be lower. This, in turn, suggests that firms in highly

“internationalized” industries are the most likely to hedge exchange rate exposure.

III. Conclusions

        The results suggest that a significant fraction of firms in these countries is exposed to

exchange rate movements but that there is little evidence of a systematic link between exposure

and trade. Indeed, what little evidence there is of a link suggests that firms that engage in greater

trade exhibit lower degrees of exposure. While this result sounds paradoxical, it may simply

reflect the fact that those firms most engaged in trade are also the most aware of exchange rate

risk, and therefore are the most likely to hedge their exposure.

Note: Each coeff-tstat pair in the table reports the results of a different cross-country second-
stage regression specification that includes firm-level dollar exposure betas (in signed and log-
odds form) as the dependent variable and a constant and the average dollar value of trade with
the US in the firm’s industry over the period 1980-1997 as the independent variable. T-stats are
based on robust standard errors.
