DARBY,   M.R.   —   Three-and-a-Half   Million U.S. Employees Have Been Mislaid; Or,

An Explanation of Unemployment, 1934-1941


     A major conceptual error in the standard BLS and Lebergott unemployment

estimates for 1933-1943 is reported. Emergency workers (employees of federal con-

tracyclical programs such as WPA) were counted as unemployed on a normal-jobs-to-

be-created instead of job-seekers unemployment definition. For 1934-1941, the

corrected unemployment levels are reduced by two to three-and-a half million people

and the rates by 4 to 7 percentage points. The corrected data show strong movement

toward the natural unemployment rate after 1933 and are very well explained by an

anticipations-search model using annual full-time earnings.

                    Three-and-a-Half Million U.S. Employees

                           Have Been Mislaid; Or, An

                    Explanation of Unemployment, 1934-1941


     When Keynesian, post-Keynesian, or neo-Keynesian economists denounce the

central monetarist proposition that the economy converges to full-employment in

the absence of shocks, the prime empirical contradiction is the well-known per-

sistence of high (though falling) levels of unemployment from 1934 through 1941.

If convergence to full employment is so slow, it is argued, it might as well be

ignored. So the explanation of this era is the central challenge to monetarist or

dynamic economists. Despite inmense theoretical and empirical effort, no real

answer has been given.

     This paper argues that the inability of monetarist models to explain such

large, persistent unemployment rates is an asset, because those unemployment rates

did not in fact exist. The previously reported unemployment rates include among

the unemployed literally millions of employees on the payrolls of government emer-

gency relief projects such as the Works Progress Administration and the Civilian

Conservation Corps. On neither modern search theory nor Keynesian grounds should

contracyclical government employment be counted instead as unemployment.

     Section I demonstrates that the standard unemployment series1 do indeed count

"emergency workers" as unemployed and suggests the reasoning which led to this mis-

conception. Corrected data for employment, unemployment, and the unemployment rate

are presented in Section II. It is shown in Section III that the corrected data

are consistent with a search approach to unemployment in which deviations of the

actual from the natural level of unemployment are explained by deviations of actual

from anticipated levels of wages and prices. My summary and conclusions follow.
                                                                             2



                1. The Standard Treatment of Emergency Workers


     There are two standard data sets for the labor force, employment, and un-

employment from 1929 through 1943: the official Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)

data and the Lebergott data taken from Stanley Lebergott's book (1964). Either

series could be called the "Lebergott data" since the original presentation of

the BLS data is in Lebergott (1948).2 Though both standard data sets thus can

be attributed to Lebergott, the treatment of "emergency workers" as unemployed

was standard practice in the estimates of that period.3

     Lebergott (1948) — perhaps too inured to the Census Bureau definition —

makes no mention whatsoever of the exclusion of emergency workers from employed

and their inclusion in unemployed. This practice can be confirmed only by tracing

back to the Census Bureau source document for the 1940 to 1946 data to which the

1929-1939 estimates are tied.4 I found only one explicit statement by Lebergott

on the inclusion of emergency workers among the unemployed:

               These estimates for the years prior to 1940 are intended

          to measure the number of persons who are totally unemployed,

          having no work at all. For the 1930's this concept, however,

          does include one large group of persons who had both work and

          income from work—those on emergency work. In the United

          States we are concerned with measuring lack of regular work

          and do not minimize the total by excluding persons with made

          work or emergency jobs. This contrasts sharply, for example,

          with the German practice during the 1930's when persons in

          the labor force camps were classed as employed, and Soviet

          practice which includes employment in labor camps, If it in-

          cludes it at all, as employment.5
                                                                                    3




          If   we exclude the forced analogy of the W.P.A. to Nazi labor
                                                                         camps and sup-

     pose that Lebergott did nothing more than follow conmion practice in the 1930's,

     the question remains whether there is any valid rationale for this treatment.

         The answer appears to depend upon the particular year in question. From 1930

    through 1932, work relief was used as an apparently minor part of the general re-

    lief program of some states and cities6 although this increased in the latter part

    of 1932 under Reconstruction Finance Corporation advances (repayment later waived)

    "for relief and work relief to needy and distressed people and in relieving the

    hardships resulting from unemployment."7 Work under these programs was generally

    for a few hours per week and could hardly be said to constitute employment. So

    it was certainly a reasonable decision to count these recipients of work relief

    as unemployed rather than as government employees. Note however that the national

S   income accounts do treat these as wage rather than transfer payments.

         Substantial federal subsidies for state relief (including work relief) con-

    tinued through November of 1933. State work relief recipients are estimated to

    have averaged 1.72 million people in 1933.8 This implies an annual average wage—

    based on the national income accounts data—of $197.80 or less than 20 percent of

    the average annual earnings per full-time employee. So although enrollment in

    state programs increased in this year from about 1 percent to about 3 percent of

    the labor force,9 the programs could certainly still be classed as government re-

    lief rather than employment programs.

         Various New Deal programs created what is known as the emergency government

    labor force. Broadly speaking, these emergency workers can be divided into two

    classes: (1) Those working in youth (16 to 24 years) programs under the Civilian


•   Conservation Corps (CCC, April 1933-June 1943) and the out-of-school National

    Youth Administration (NYA, January 1936-May 1943) programs. (2) The much larger

    regular program consisting of the Civil Works Administration (CWA, November 1933-

    July 1934), the Emergency Work-Relief Program (April 1934-December 1935) of the
                                                                               4



Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA), and the Works Progress Adminis-

tration (WPA, July 1935-June 1943, titled Work Projects Administration beginning

July 1939). The regular programs, which employed on average 82 percent of the

emergency labor force, were mainly (75 to 85 percent of expenditures) involved

in construction projects. FERA's Emergency Work-Relief Program was operated

through state agencies but the others were directly administered by the federal

government.

     The emergency government labor force worked on qualitatively different terms

than the earlier state work-relief recipients. Jobs were substantially full-time

(24 to 40 hours per week) and at competitive wages)° Preference was given to

those eligible for relief, but this was not a bar to unemployed people. The pro-

grams were mainly aimed at and attractive to unskilled labor. From 1934 through

1940, annual wages were about one-half of the annual average earnings per full-

time employee in all industries, as shown in Table 1. So here, the national income

accountants are undoubtedly correct in treating emergency workers as government em-

ployees receiving payment for labor services.

     From the Keynesian viewpoint, labor voluntarily employed on contracyclical

construction and other government projects should certainly be counted as employed.

On the search approach to unemployment, a person who accepts a job and withdraws

from the activity of search is clearly employed. The contracyclical intent of the

government employer is irrelevant to the definition of unemployment as currently

used by the BLS.

     Besides bureaucratic inertia which carried forward the earlier treatment of

state rk-relIef recipients, the misclassification of emergency workers can be

attributed to an implicit definition of unemployment as the difference between

the normal labor force and those employed in normal jobs. The pioneering esti-

mates by the National Industrial Conference Board (NTCB) aimed at estimating

how many jobs would have to be created in order to get back to a normal situation
                                                                                5




of no depression and therefore no emergency government labor   force.   Measuring

jobs-to-be-created leads to different treatment than measuring people without work

who are seeking it)' Of course, no consideration was given to emergency employ-

ment's crowding-out private employment or the state and local construction work

which it replaced.

     In sununary, counting state work-relief recipients as unemployed was justif led

by the facts12—. they had both time and incentive to search for alternative employ-

ment. Counting members of the emergency government labor force as unemployed re-

presents a major conceptual error)3
                                                                            6




                      It. Corrected Estimates for 1929-1943


     It is straightforward to correct the BLS and Lebergott data for the mis-

classification of emergency workers. Both the standard and corrected data are

presented in Table 2. Comparing the standard'4 and corrected unemployment figures

in cOlumns (12) and (13), it is clear that the misclassification of emergency wor-

kers almost completely masked both the speed and strength of the return of unem-

ployment toward normal, levels in 1934 through 1941. The employment level for 1936

is understated in the standard data by over three-and-a-half million people and by

over two million as late as 1941.                             .




     This difference is seen most clearly in terms of the unemployment rates re-
ported in Table 3. For example, the Lebergott data overstate the unemployment rate

by 0.9 percentage point in 1933. This rises to 4.8 in 1934,4.9 in 1935, and a fu1 6.9

percentage points in 1936. Not until 1941 was the overstatement down to even. 39

percentage points. Put another way, the reported reduction of unemployment from

1932 to 1936 was only about a half of the actual reduction.




                                                                                        S
                                                                                                    7



              III.    An Anticipations-Search Explanation of the Corrected Data


           The corrected unemployment rates for 1934 through 1940 are still high, though

    no longer absurdly so. Since 1900 the unemployment rate shows "no discernible

    trend."5 Except for the 1900's and 1930's, every decade in the twentieth cen-

    tury has shown        an   average unemployment rate of 5 percent'6—about the current

    estimate of the natural rate of unemployment. The question naturally arises

    whether the corrected data are consistent with a model in which the unemployment

    rate tends to the natural rate in the absence of shocks.

           Robert Lucas and Leonard Rapping (1972) have shown that from 1930 through

    1933, their simple search model (1969) does well both qualitatively and quantita-

    tively.17 It does slightly better with the corrected data for 1933. Presumably,

    a similar result would hold for any anticipations-search model which can be ex-
•   pressed as

    (1)                   +
              Ut     a0        a1 log (W/W) + 82 log
    where u is the unemployment rate, a0 is the natural unemployment rate, W and

    are the actual and         anticipated   nominal wage levels and
                                                                        P   and P are the actual

    and anticipated price levels. Lucas and Rapping report that their model fails to

    explain high levels of unemployment from 1934 through 1941 because rapid increases

    in nominal wages imply that the unemployment rate should fall to near the natural

    rate in 1934 or at the very latest by 1937. Even the corrected data show a nnich

    less   rapid fall.
           The main   problem derives from the hourly wage series used by Lucas and Rap-
    ping18 which rises by 12         percent   in 1934.   This   reflects a 4   percent   rise in   annual

    compensation     per full-time employee and a 7.2 percent fall in hours of work. Other

    series on hourly wages show a similar jump in 1934 due to a large decline in re-

    ported hours and a small increase in annual wages.'9 This is extremely peculiar

    behavior for the average hours of rk which is normally a very reliable leading
                                                                              8



                                                                             (1959)
indicator——leading more at peaks than at troughs. Indeed Gerhard Bry's study of the

average work week showed only one cycle in average weekly hours not corresponding to

a reference cycle: the peak of July 1933 and troughof September 1934.

       The explanation for this exceptional behavior of hours and wages is easy to

find: The National Industrial Recovery Act (passed June 16, 1933) and succeeding

legislation. NRA codes and later wage and hours laws, aimed at limiting the hours

of work and increasing hourly wages. Significantly, Bry (p. 107) reports: "The

sample reporting manhours expanded greatly between 1932 and 1934, large because

of cooperation by the various code authorities of the NRA." Now this reported fall

in average hours and rise in wages could reflect some combination of three factors:

(1) whole-hearted compliance with the law and codes; (2) a change in firms' repor-

ting practices—entirely legal—so as to eliminate inclusion of rest and meal

breaks in reported hours; and (3) falsification of reported hours and wages as

part of an evasion scheme. A cynical economist such as the author might suspect

that the data primarily reflect items (2) and (3), but this is clearly a topic

for detailed historical research.2° If the change in hours is largely spurious,

average earnings per full-time equivalent employee would more accurately reflect

the development of wages in the 1930's.

       In any case, traditional models of search have used "the wage" as a short-

hand expression for total conditions of employment. This concept would appear

 to be better represented by annual earnings of full-time workers—or of all em-

 ployees—in a period in which total hours are being rationed.

       In view of these questions concerning the use of reported hourly wages,

 equation (1) was estimated for 1930 to 1941 using the corrected Lebergott un-

 employment rate, average annual earnings per full-time employee, and the GNP

 price deflator for Ut, W and P, respectively.21 The anticipated levels of

 wages and prices were estimated by a simple adaptive expectations formulation:

 (2)                +   (l..   )   (1+g1)   W1
                                                                                       9



                    +    (1-A   )
                                    (l+g2)   P1
Here ,   is   the coefficient of adjustment and g1 and g2 are the trend growth rates

of wages and prices.22 More elaborate models of anticipations might well yield

better explanations, but were not tried because of the scarcity of degrees of

freedom.      I use the word anticipations instead of expectations by way of reminder

that short-run aggregate supply or Phillips curve reflect past expectations of

current prices, as embodied in contracts, as well as current expectations of

searchers.

      Equation (1) was estimated by a simple maximum likelihood technique. OLS re-

gressions were run conditional upon the value of A for A —          0.0.025,   0.05,....,

0.95,0.975. The maximum likelihood estimate is:23

(4)        u — 8.87      -   22.80 log (Wt/W*) -   57.51 log
                (0.74)       (17.65)               (23.47)
                12.00         -1.29                 -2.45

           SEE.'l.70, R2(cor.)"0.926, D-W1.68, 3—0.l75 (0.075,0.35]

The simple model does rather well at explaining the fluctuations in the unemploy-

ment rate over the period 1930-1941. One suspects that the standard error of esti-

mate and 92 percent R-squared must be overoptimistic. The constant term is well

below the sample mean of the dependent variable (13.9 percent) but s significantly

above the natural rate of unemployment of about 5 percent. The independent varia-

bles are rather collinear and it was observed that higher values of A (within the

confidence interval) increase the relative coefficient and significance of

Log              and conversely for lower values of A •        The A estimate is lower than
      (Wt/W)
Lucas and Rapping estimate which was inferred, however, from the coefficient of the

lagged dependent variable in a Koyck transformation of equation (1).

      These results are best interpreted as negating the view that anticipations-

search models have no role in explaining unemployment during 1934-1941. Only a

much broader study incorporating postwar data and New Deal institutional changes

could provide a clear picture as to the amount of excess unemployment which can

be attributed to normal search behavior versus the amount caused by New Deal programs.

                         IV.   Conclusions   and Summary


    This paper radically alters our empirical conception of unemployment during

the 1930's. The fact that unemployment rose to nearly one quarter of the labor

force in 1932-1933 is unchanged, but that fact is readily explained by the heroic

ineptness of Federal Reserve policy. What is changed is the "un-fact" that re-

covery was extremely slow from 1934 through 1941. From 1933 to 1936, the corrected

unemployment rate fell by nearly 5 percentage points per year and there is every

reason to suppose that the rate would have been about 5 percent by 1938 had the

Fed not doubled reserve requirements between August 1936 and May 1937.

     To be sure, during 1934-1940 between 4½ to 7 percent of the labor force was

employed in contracyclical, make-work public construction jobs, but there is

little empirical evidence in the postwar period that the government spending   mul..


tiplier is much above zero over such a long period as two or three years. Cer-

tainly the unemployment rate behaves as if the federal programs crowded out pri-

vateeiup1oymentpartiCularlY on the state and local construction works which

would otherwise have been required.

     In Section III, it was seen that the utter inability reported by Lucas and

Rapping of anticipations-search models to explain unemployment during the re-

covery period 1934-1941 can be attributed in part to errors in the unemployment

data and in part to the use of an inappropriate hourly wage plagued by the in-

troduction of reporting biases with the advent of the NRA. Only a broader study

over an extended time period can provide a realistic estimate of the residual

increase in unemployment that might be directly attributable to such programs

as the NRA. But It is clear that the cyclical behavior of unemployment in the

 1930's generally conforms to movements in actual versus expected wages and prices

as predicted by modern natural-rate models.
                                                                              11




     In sunnnary, a major conceptual error in the standard BLS and Lebergott data

has been uncovered. Emergency workers (employees of federal contracyclical pro-

grams such as WPA) were counted as unemployed due to the use of an implicit de-

finition of "normal jobs to be created" instead of the standard job-seekers de-

finition. Estimates were affected for 1933-1943 and, during 1934-1941, by huge

amounts—2 to 3½ million unemployed people or about 4 to 7 percentage points on

the unemployment rate. The corrected data reveal a strong movement toward the

natural unemployment rate after 1933. A simple anticipations-search model of the

Lucas-Rapping type explains the corrected date very well when average full-time

earnings are used as the nominal wage, but further research is required on the

possible influence of NRA and similar programs in increasing the unemployment rate.

                                   FOOTNOTES


     'Specific reference is to the series Bl (Lebergott) and B2 (Bureau of Labor

Statistics) reported in Dept. of Commerce (1973).

     2LaWreflce R. Klein was listed as Chief, Office of Publications of the BLS.

     3Most notably, the Bureau of the Census and the National Industrial Conference

Board (NICB). A typical Census publication reads: "On the basis of the answers to

these questions, persons in the labor force were classified into the following em-

ployment status categories: (a) 'Employed (except on public emergency work),' in-

cluding those reported as at work and those with a job but not at work; and (b) un-

employed, including those On public emergency work' and those 'Seeking work."

Bureau of the Census, (1944, p. 2). Similarly, "Unemployment—The difference be-

tween the number of persons in the labor force and the number of persons employed.

Persons on the payrolls of government emergency relief projects, such as WPA, CCC,

and out-of-school NYA, are not considered employed." NICB (1945, p. 389).

     4This is Bureau of the Census (1947). At page 1, it states: "During the

period in which public emergency work projects were being conducted by the Works

Project Administration (WPA), the National Youth Administration (NYA), the Civilian

Conservation Corps (CCC) and State and local work rellef agencies (this period

ended about June 1943), persons at work on, or assigned to, such projects were

also included among the unemployed." I suspect that almost no one currently at

the BLS is aware that they are reporting (for example, Employment and Earniflgs,

April 1975, p. 19) data for 1933-1943 which includes emergency workers among the

unemployed. Certainly the standard explanatory notes (pp. 135-142 for the same

issue) state that   "employed persons comprise (a) all those who during the survey

week did any work at all as paid employees,..." count people currently on similar

government programs as employed, and mention no problems under "Historic Compara-

bility."

      8Dept. of Commerce (1966, P. 98).

      9The Commerce Department (1966, p. 98) estimates of the number of state and

local work relief workers for 1930-1932 are 20 thousand, 299 thousand, and 592

thousand.

      0The conditions of the major programs are summarized in Appendices 2 through

5 of the National Resources Planning Board (1942). Wages were generally set at

"prevailingt' or "fair" levels for the skill class of the work, or at minimum rates

where higher than the market wage.

      1On this view, employment can exceed the "normal" labor force and negative

unemployment is reported as in 1906, 1917-1919, and 1942-1944. NICB (1965, pp. 38-

39). Milton Friedman suggested it might be interesting to compute the unemploy-

ment rate for the postwar era on the definition of unemployment as job-seekers

plus employees of "make-work" jobs. Unfortunately it is much easier to estimate

which make-work employees were counted as unemployed in the 1930's than to esti-

mate the number of postwar government (and private?) employees on make-work jobs.

             a strict application of the modern definition, which Counts part-time

workers, would include these people as employed.

      '3A word of warning should be given about the Census Bureau data on the dura-

tion of unemployment. These too should be taken with a large grain of salt because

"Etihe duration of unemployment represents the length of time   (up   to March 30,

1940) during which these persons had been seeking work or working on public
                                                                             16




emergency projects." Bureau of the Census (1943, P. 7).

     14Lebergott explicitly adopted (1964, pp. 407-408) the BLS figures on unem-

ployment f or 1929-1939 because his revised estimates differed only slightly from

the BLS data already in widespread use. To maintain consistency, Lebergott reported

employment as his revised labor force estimates less the BLS unemployment data.

From 1940 onwards, Lebergott adopted the BLS data without change.

     5Lebergott (1964, p. 188).

     16Lebergott (1964, p. 189) reports a decade average of 4 percent for the

1900's and 18 percent for the 1930's. The corrected data (cols. (16) and (17) of

Table 3) show a 1930's average of 15 percent but 4 percent for the 1940's.

     17Lucas and Rapping used the Lebergott estimates of unemployment. Their dis-

cussion starts in 1930 instead of 1929, apparently because of data availability in

series not considered here. They were fortunate in this regard as no reasonable

model could explain the reported 3.2 percent unemployment rate in 1929—a drop of

1 percentage point from 1928. The 1930 unemployment rate of 8.9 percent seems re-

liable because of the decennial census, but It is incredible that a bit under 10

percent drop In real GNP could be associated with a 5.7 percentage point increase

in the unemployment rate from 1929 to 1930.

     '8This is the Commerce Department (1966) estimates of compensation of employees

In all industries (line 1, pp. 90-93) divided by the product of (a) the number of

full-time equivalent employees in all industries (ibid., line 1, pp. 102-105) and

(b) the average annual hours per employee (Denison, p. 37—not p. 85—column (3)).

Unfortunately Lucas and Rapping (1969, p. 742, n. 27) had misinterpreted their

(secondary) source as reporting "annual hours worked per year by full-time employees"

when it in fact reports "actual average annual hours per employee" as is seen in

the original presentation by James Knowles (p. 26).

     19See for example, series such as D626 and D627 on wages and hours In manu-

facturing in Bureau of the Census (1960, p. 92).
                                                                               17




     20Such as in the thesis of Michael Weinstein, currently underway at M.I.T.

It has been argued, most recently by Robert Hall, that the NRA codes and the suc-

ceeding wage and hour laws raised wages by fiat and so changed the character of

unemployment from search unemployment (1929-1933) to minimum wage unemployment

(1934-1941). This Is a competing but possibly complementary hypothesis to that

in the text. Recent papers by Finis Welch and Jacob Mincer note that the main

effect of such laws would be on the distribution of employment between covered

and uncovered sectors rather than the unemployment rate per se. Further research

on the precise effects of these institutional changes is clearly called for.

     21The Ut data are from Table 3, col. (16). The W series for 1929-1941

are Cotmuerce Department data (series D696, Bureau of the Census (1960), p. 95).

It was extended back to 1924 by using the Kuznets estimates (series D685, ibid.)

and a ratio splice based on the 1929 overlap. This earnings series is $19 to

$21 less than average FTE compensation f or 1930-1935, but this difference rises

to $50 by 1937 and $63 by 1941 because of the inclusion of employer social secur-

ity and unemployment insurance taxes. This increase in. employer taxes would not

represent a wage increase from the point of view of a job-seeking worker; so the

earnings series was used. The     series for 1929-1941 is Commerce Department

data (series B62, Dept. of Commerce (1973), pp. 222-23). It was extended back

to 1924 by using the NBER-Kendrick estimates (series B61, ibid.) and a 1929

ratio splice.

     22The required initial values of W and Pt were taken as equal to the actual

values in 1924, a year in which Lebergott estimates a 5.0 percent unemployment

rate. The anticipated growth rate of prices g2 was taken as 0 which is consonant

with both the gold standard and actual experience from 1921-1941. The correspond-

ing anticipated growth rate of nominal (and real) wages was estimated as 1 l/37

per annum.

       aThe number of state and local work-relief recipients was substantial
        for the year 1933. ClassificatIon of the estimated 1,724 thousand re-
        cipients as employed would decrease the corrected unemployment rates
        further to 20.97. (Lebergott) and 20.67. (BLS). Other years for which
        classification of state and local work-relief recipients as employed
        would reduce the rates reported in cols. (16) and (17) by more than
        0.2 percentage points are 1931 (0.6 reduction), 1932 (1.2), 1934 (1.0),
        and 1935 (1.0).
