                       Alternative Exchange Rate Regimes



                                    ABSTRACT



     A simple analytical framework is used to consider alternative exchange

rate regimes and their bearing on macroeconomic management of a semi—

industrial economy. The emphasis is on the implications of different

degrees of capital mobility. One   of   the topics taken up is the conflict

between the role of the real exchange rate as a signalling device for

long—run resource allocation and the problem of real exchange rate appre-

ciation accompanying the opening up of an economy to short—term capital

inflow. Also discussed is the related choice of exchange rate policy as

an anti—inflation device.

I.     Introduction1
       The semi-industrialized economy to be discussed here mainly imports

raw   materials   and capital goods and is past the stage of using quantita-

tive restrictions for import substitution of consumer goods.            Traditionally

it depended mainly on primary exports and is now rapidly moving into

industrial exports.       While it nay still have a multiple protective tariff

system and thus be more 'closed' in the real sense than some optimum degree

of free trade might dictate, it will rely quite heavily on the use of the

formal   exchange rate system to handle current account problems.
      The typical problem for such an economy, unless it happens to be an
oil exporter, is      how to manage its   exchange rate and internal macro-

policies   over time in face of a large structural deficit, as part of its

long-run trade and development strategy.

      Under reasonable assumptions it will be an optimal strategy for this

economy to borrow abroad to finance a large deficit in the early stages of

industrialization, use these funds to develop its exports, providing the

internal rate of return lies above the marginal social cost of foreign

borrowing.      Subsequently it will pay back these loans as the economy approaches

independence.      In the course of the growth process the real effective ex-

change rate will usually be required to grow over time, and it should do so

at a rate that equals the difference between the internal and external real

rate of return to capital (see Bruno 1976).            This statement must be modified

in the case in which relative technical progress in export - as compared to

home -   industries    (or when the country's relative export price in world

markets) is sufficiently high to make actual growth in the real exchange

rate unnecessary.       Even then it is usually the case that a real exchange

rate level has to be maintained over time.

      Governments, of course, seldom knOw how to sol VC Optimal ty prohl ems,

 'or do   they know the   path   of long-run foreign credit availabilities with
 ny certainty.      1ore often than not, they have to live from hand to mouth.
Yet the logic of theoretical constructs may still be followed in at least
 some respects.     The marginal cost of foreign loans must not exceed the
 internal profitability of the resul ting        i nvestment and the    tar-i ff (or subsidy)
 inclusive   real exchange rate must be related to the sue         of the allowable
structural   deficit.      The main point is that there should be a clear long-

run relationship between the ratio of present and          future real exchange rates
and between the internal and external real rates of interest.                These

simultaneously    affect long—run borrowing, domestic savings and investment

policies as well as the real exchange rate as an allocative device.

     Problems occur when short-term market prices do not give the 'correct'

long-run allocation signals for producers or consumers.                Two major sources

for such discrepancy may arise in the present context, both working in the

same direction.      The world financial market may temporarily register very

low (or even negative) real rates of interest for short and medium run

loans2, as it has done for some time in the 1970s and until very recently.

The other, often more important, problem is that domestic stabilization

policy with its associated restrictive monetary policy, may cause the real

marginal cost of domestic credit to rise considerably above the desired

long-run rate.      Either one of these or.a combined opening up of the gap

between the two interest rate signals will, in the absence of other inter-

vention, cause    substantial short-run capital inflows and a real appreciation
of the exchange rate, depressing manufacturing exports and profits, an
experience recently shared by a number of countries in the Latin American
Continent3 and elsewhere.

     Prolonged periods of real exchange appreciation accompanying short-run
capital   inflow, when    the long-run horizon dictates the converse, may not be
                                               —3-




hainful     from the point of      view   of financial portfolio allocations. These
are easily reversed at the cost of a phone call.              They may, however, be
costly in terms of irreversible production and invesijient decisions, which
by nature have long gestation periods.               This argument, of course, depends
on some myopia in the expectation formation process of investors. Given
the market inperfections in a typical semi-industrialized country this is
a reasonable assumption          to make.

       This type of conflict between short-term and long-term asset pricing

also   raises the     question   of financial openness, as distinct from    real openness
of   a country.       Real openness relates to the degree of substitutability

of goods across borders and the efficiency advantages to be reaped from

reducing intervention in the free flow of real trade.              Financial openness

has to do with the substitutability of foreign and domestic financial assets

and the extent of interference with free capital mobility.              Since the ex-

change rate enters the pricing of both tradeable assets and tradeable goods

conflicts of price signalling may occur when financial openness is pursued

along with real openness.

       We   shall   assume here that the problem of relating long-term borrowing

(and investment) to the development strategy has somehow been taken care of
and we may, for our purposes, consider the long-run capital imports as largely

determined outside the present framework.              This leaves the question of
openness toward the world financial market for short-run capital movements.
Also, how does financial, as distinct from real, openness relate to the

operation of the economy under alternativ exchange rate regimes?

       After laying out a simple analytical framework (Section II) we shall

consider the main alternative exchange rate regimes and their bearing on

macroeconomic management in the light of the extent of real and financial

openness    of the    country.     The regimes to be considered are a fixed peg,

with   or without a 'crawling' commercial policy, the crawling poj, and the
  Iil3naged float (Sections I1I—V).          This being a conference on the capital
  market, we shall put the       na   in eniphasis on the implications      of di fferent

  degrees of capital mobility tinder these regimes.

         There is a separate    question of how       the   extent of real and financial
  openness restricts or enhances         domestic    stabilization policy.       Thus for
  brief transition periods it         nay pay    to use the   exchange rate   as a price
  stabilizing device, even at the         cost   of 'wrong'    long-term   signalling. The
 last   section (VI) considers the two—iay          relationship of exchange—rate
 adjusnent        and the inflationary process.        Should the exchange      rate always
 accommodate to the inflation rate (or overtake it), or can it sometimes

 be used in the opposite direction tornoderate an excessive rate of inflation?

        While this and other problems seem to be a hot subject of debate in

 theLatin American scene, I do not pretend to know enough about the empirical
 background of these countries in order to go into analysis of actual
 examples.        The discussion has partly been inspired by the experiences of
my own country (see also Bruno and Sussrnan,
                                                        1979, 1980) which hopefully may
also    be relevant to a wider set of countries.

 II. Analytical framework

       We   can   represent the general equilibrium of the economy in a diagram
in which the real exchange rate (q = e/p) and real money balances (m = M/p)
appear on the two axes.4  We shall
                                    consider the commodity market, asset
supply and demand, and the balance of payments.

       Suppose the economy produces a composite good (Q), priced p. which is

an imperfect substitute with a world export good priced abroad at p* =

Exports will be a positive function of their relative prices, q(l +
                                                                                    tx),
where q (=    p e/p) is the    real exchange rate and t is a possible export

subsidy.      Imports (N) in this economy are assumed to be an imput into the

productive system, together with labour (L), and capital (K), i.e. we have
                                                     -


Q      Q(L,   N, K).     rhe short-run 5upply function is given by
         q(l + t)p;               where w is the real wye ( W/p),                      is   a tariff
QS[J
rate and p is the relative world price of the import. Domestic absorption
depends on real income, the real morley supply (m = M/p), expected inflation
( and a fiscal impact variable (g).
        Under the usual assumptions we can represent the excess demand for goods
in the form:
()            QdQSf(qm;u)
where    U1 stands for a vector of various exogenous shift factors (g, w,

t, t,         -K).6

       The downward-sloped curve QQ in Figure 1 gives the combinations of real

exchange rate and real balances that keep the comnodity market in equilib-

rium (Qd = QS)•          It will shift inwards with an increase in the government

deficit (g), the real wage (w), expected inflation (r),                      or   any of the other

factors listed under U1.               Above the curve there is excess demand and prices

will tend to increase; below it there is excess supply and prices may or

may not decrease depending on price stickiness.                        Since the price level

appears in the denominator of both variables on the axes, the movement of

prices in this diagram will always take place along a 450 vector, towards

the QQ curve.

The_basic_balance

       The basic balance (T1) will here be defined as the difference between

exports and current import requirements plus exogenously given long-run

capital flows (F).

       The reason for      distinguishing        between current import           rLquir1ents and
what are normally registered as imports is to separate out                        the Irdng
element in imports and add it to the capital account.                        Thus, iiurt
inventory niovements       will    be a form     of aviuys     (

                                                                   n

  and will riot affect private sector wealth
                                             directly, and short-term capital

  flows (and changes in exchange reserves) which are the only ones to be con-

  sidered endogenous here.             For simplicity, we assume F to include foreign

  investment and to be defined netof interest payments on the outstanding

  debt.

          We can now write

  (2)            =
                     11(q,
                        +
                             U2)

 iihcre   U2   is another vector of exogenous shift factors         (F, t, t)
         Current account balance is represented by the         horizontal line in Figure
 1, at    a given real exchange rate q0 = e0/p0.           Below the line there is a
 deficit in the basic balance (T1 <            0), above it there   is a surplus (T >   0).
 The adjustment when out of balance depends on the total balance-of—payment

 position      and the exchange rate regime of which discussion is deferred for

 the moment.         The NX line shifts up with a fall in F or an overall reduction

 in import tariffs and export subsidies.8

Money and other assets

        There are three kinds of privately-held assets in the system in

addition to the capital stock: government bonds (B9) carrying a nominal

interest rate i, domestic money (M), and a foreign currency denominated

asset (Z).        The latter could, in principle, include paper money, an interest-

bearing asset (net of debt and carrying an interest rate i*), or inventories

of imported goods.           For simplicity, we shall ignore the foreign interest

rate and only take into account the expected rate of devaluation
                                                                             (E).

        Money demand (Md) is a negative function of the nominal rate of interest

(1) and is proportional to gross output (Q).              The money market is in

equilibrium with given money supply (11).

(3)        11d1 =    ()Q     =
                                                   -7-




        For high         rates of   expected   inflation         may be substituted for      i in (3).

As    is usually assumed, only drjmestic residents hold M, while both domestic
and foreign residents may hold 7.                 The relative demand for the foreign
asset    (7d) is assumed            to take the following simple form (see 1iles 1978;
Calvo and Rodriguez 1971):

(4)           ezd/Md       qzdimd       k(s)


where q         c/p as     before, and c is the expected rate of depreciation.9                      The

more    elastic      k, the closer substitutes are M and 7.

        If    total short—term foreign exchange assets hold in the economy are
B and Central Bank foreign exchange reserves are A, actual private assets
(Z) will always equal the difference Z =                   B —   A.         B may change only as a

result of an imbalance in the basic account as defined above, thus, it will

be assumed to be given at any moment of time.                             Foreign exchange reserves

(A) may or may not be determined by the Central Bank depending on the

foreign exchange regime (see below).

        If both the markets for .1 and Z are in balance, equation (4) can be

turned into an asset market equilibrium relationship: q =                            mk(E)/(B-A).
This is represented by the line ZM in Figure 1.                             To allow for different

degrees of financial openness we assume that the actual change in the

privately—held foreign exchange asset (AZ) is proportional to the desired

change

  The      balance of ayiiants
            The balance      of payments consists of the sum of the      basic   balance
                                                                                            (Ti)
  and      the    short-r-un capital account,           which in   turn equals the net sale
  of private foreign-exchange assets (-AZ).               The overall BoPsurplus
       =
  (1       1     +    12) must equal the   net accumulation of Bank reserves (AA).          We
 can       thus write:
  (6) 1 = T1(q) + B-                 A - k(c)m/qJ = T(q, m; U3) = AA

 where      U3 includes all the       shift   variables appearing in U2 as well as
 (B0 - A0, —

      The line ZM in Figure 1 represents the short-run capital account
 balance     = 0). Its slope is k(r)/(B0 -          Above it 12 > 0 and below
                                                          A0).
 itT2       <    0.     The curve TI which represents the overall balance (T =
                                                                                       0) must
 lie between the lines NX and ZM.               Below it I < 0 and above it I > 0.

           This two-part graphical representation of the BoP, which was inspired

 by Frenkel and Rodriguez (1980), is also useful for considering different

degrees of capital niobility.1°               A very low level of      (relatively flat TI

curve) would correspond to the case ofrather effective exchange control.

In the extreme case (             = 0),   only the current account matters.        The other
polar extreme (             = ) is   the one in which only asset behaviour
                                                                                       0)

matters.              There is instantaneous adjustment of z to        (as in Dornbusch

1976).

The banking balance sheet

        We end this preliminary description by stating the basic balance-

sheet restriction of the banking system, within which monetary policy

operates.             Denoting Central Bank credit to the government by C9, to the

private sector by C, and private banking credit to the private sector by
  we have:
                                                  -9-.




(1)         M     cA
                           C9 C + C.
       For      subsequent reference we also note that by adding the net foreign
exchange asset eZ to the             LHS of (7)   and    remembering that A + Z   =   B we get
another constraint on the sum of the two assets.

       We   first consider         the process of large step adjustment of the exchange
rate   in response to shifts in the basic balance under a pegged exchange

rate   regime.         An important issue in the present context is the limitation

imposed by the role of expectations of exchange rate change and of short-run

capital movements even when the economy is relatively (though not absolutely)

closed to financial capital movements.                   These pose considerable short—term

stabilization problems, especially for monetary policy.                    Let us discuss

these problems and possible remedies.

       Consider a fixed exchange-rate economy with initial equilibrium at a

nominal exchange rate e0, quantity of money M0, and price level p0 (see

Figure 2).         Cormmodity market equilibrium is given by the curve QQ, the basic

balance is given by NX.              There is limited capital mobility (low ), so that

the balance of payments equilibrium is given by the line TI whose slope is

assumed to be between 0 and 1.              There are given low expectations of exchange-

rate change (                  which may be zero).         Suppose now that for some reason

there is a shift in the basic balance (NX shifts up) which may be due to a

long-term fall in lending (F).              A real devaluation from q0 to q1 is called

for.     For simplicity        assume that the change is confined to the current

account and       QQ is not ininediately affected)2 A possible new equilibrium

for the economy would be at the point               B which is given at the intersection
of   NX' and the old ZM line, assuming that after the change its slope

 ward rigid the same real rovemorit in M/p and c/p could also be achieved by
 a fall in p. keeping M constant     ( Me), coupled with a smaller nominal
 devaluation,     lie ar-c less interested in   the exact final outcome but rather
 in the dynamic sequence of events that may typically occur once the need
for a step devaluation is signalled.
     It is in the nature of a fixed exchange-rate regime that there is a
considerable lag between the first signal of a required change in e and the
actual act of a devaluation, let alone the implementation of the internal
demand restrictions that have to accompany it.         The moment tr shifts towards
if' and   foreign exchange reserves start falling (AA <     0), two processes may
be set in riotion, the one having to do with expectations, the other with

fluctuations    in the money base.    As expectations of a devaluation rise
(c1 > o' there is import hoarding and delayed repatriation of export
proceeds.      The asset equilibrium curve rotates upwards to ZM',      say,   with

the balance of payments equilibrium line shifting to TT".           The result is

a more intensive fall in reserves than would otherwise take place, signalling

a larger devaluation than may objectively be required.

     This can be illustrated as follows: given the expectation of a

devaluation, a new temporary equilibrium could take place at the point H.

One way of exactly reaching H could be a nominal devaluation from A to G

keeping M constant, followed by a price increase (due to an inflationary

gap in the goods market) which is represented by an inward move along a 450

vector from G to H.     Whether the real exchange rate is above or below the

level balancing the new basic account (NX') depends on the extent of the

excessive expectations-induced shift of IT" which, in turn, depends on the

assetdemand response to expectations change (k/3c) and the          effectiveness
                                        —1 I


of foreign exchange    control (E) .      Once a icvlu tion hs t ' en      place,

expectations will stabilize again (at r, or soue lo';ar        rii:ber).      Suppose
ZM    returns back to its previous position and BoP     equilibrium   is repre-

sented by TI'.      At the point H, for example,     there is now   a surplus with

renewed   capital   inflow (repatriation of export proceeds, dishoarding of

import inventories, etc.) which        more than compensates for the remaining
basic deficit, and reserves will start rising again.

       So far we have ignored changes in nominal money which can he assumed

away only if there is Central Bank sterilization of the fluctuations in

exchange reserves.13      This brings us to the sc-cord dynamic process which

nay   take place simultaneously with the previously described one.            Let us

go back to the point A when foreign exchange reserves start falling.

Unless sterilized, there will be a fall in M which in Figure 2 would show

as a horizontal leftward move from A towards D.          Excess supply and unemploy-

ment develop unless prices (and wages) are downward flexible.              Again, a

possible move under price fleibi1ity would be a fall in M by the amount

DA and a reduction of prices along a 450 vector from D to E.            If expecta-

tions of a devaluation are kept at zero, the BoP would have reached temporary

equilibrium at E without a devaluation but through a monetary squeeze and

a forced deflation.

       If prices are inflexible, the monetary contraction and the deepening

slump could in principle continue until an unemployment equilibrium is

reached at F.'4      It is the capital flows in response to the interest rate

gap15 that will finance the basic deficit.         Obviously, this is neither a

sustainable nor a socially desirable equilibrium.         What usually happens is

that the internal pressure on the monetary authorities makes for monetary

expansion to counterbalance the loss of reserves.

       The counterpart of this phenomenon, after an excessive devaluation, is

the reverse upward pressure on the money supply coming from the renewed

capital inflow and the rising reserves.          Suppose we are temporarily at H
                                            -12-


when BoP equilibrium is given by TI'.           tack of monetary   restraint (and

legitimdte pressure on the part of sectors hurt by the real credit squeeze)
will    cause H   to rise.      In terms of Figure 2 there   will be a movement along

a horizontal line from H towards iT1.           At the same time inflationary

pressure    develops causing a rise in prices (move back towards QQ).
        The large swings in short-run      capital movements and in the money pre—
and post- large devaluations are hard to           contain even under exchange control

and    constitute one of their main drawbacks (see Bruno and Sussman        1979, for

an account of the Israeli experience).             The pressure to keep real money

and credit high (e.g. for investment) may cause a continued inflationary

process driving down the real exchange rate to a renewed BoP deficit, unless

the devaluation is coupled         with the appropriate measures that will shift QQ
outwards.16

       If exchange controls are tight ( 0) and            the original level of real
balances is desired,an equilibrium devaluation could be reached at C pro-
viding there is a sufficient accompanying budget cut to move the QQ line

through that point.          If controls are not tight and there are capital flows,

temporary equilibrium could be reached at N, say, with a smaller budget

cut and smaller real devaluation.          This, however, can only be temporary

since the current account deficit will gradually erode foreign exchange assets

and require further cuts in the budget deficit, and an additional increase

in c/p to make room for the expanded production of tradeable goods, as IT'

gradually shifts up.           Only a larger budget cut to QQ' (and/or larger drop

in the real wage, coupled with a rise in m and q) can keep all markets in

new current-account equilibrium at the point B.

       The main problems that arise in the operation of a fixed peg which is

adjusted in large jumps thus center around the sizeable accompanying

fluctuations      in real reserves and in the money supply and the large one-time

adjustments requi rd      in   other expenditure items.      The latter are unavoidable
wdr my chmge rite regime since a rral rce                   teisfer 'ill      alys
be requi red (unless there is a slack in the system which can he diver ted to
the tra'ieable g ods sector).         On the other hand, the monetary upheavals
arid the   real   loss of reserves could in principle be delayed if the real

exchange    rate corrections are     confined to the current account.       Short      of

moving to a regime      of small-step adjustient in the formal rate one nay
operate the fixed formal peg on capital account transactions while correcting
the real effective exchange rate in smaller steps through adjustments in
commercial policy.
        Consider the case in which we have a pure dual rate       on the   two accounts
--a uniform tariff      (tn) on imports   and a subsidy of the same rate (t        =
                                                                                        t)
on    exports.    When F falls,   as in the above discussion, one could in

principle increase t and t so as to keep the N line in place, while

manipulating      the budget so as   to compensate for the loss in revenue (when

the   balance is in deficit).        In that case the economy may stay in equilibrium

at A while at the same time reducing the basic deficit.

       Countries hardly ever operate a uniform tariff rate on imports. However,

a close substitute for the above idea is a flat export subsidy based on value

added.      Israel had operated such a system quite successfully through the

l960s and part of the 1970s.         Large devaluations would take place only once

every few years and in between the rate of export subsidy (and sometimes also

the tariff rate on imports) would be adjusted upwards gradually.             The

problem with such a system is usually twofold.         One is that it tends to get

abused once the subsidy rate reaches high levels.          There is considerable

incentive to cheat in the calculation of value added which leads to trade

distortions and the like.         The other difficulty is that such measures

usually meet with strong disapproval of the       international   agencies (GATT, THE).

It can be claimed that when       used in small measure and with some prudence
such a   system may nonetheless have its merits.       The alternatives, as we
shall see, have their drawbacks too.

 IV.   The rros   aid Cons of a Cra:iing Peg
       We now keep the assumption of a formal peg but assume that the adjust-

 merits are made in very small steps and at frequent intervals.11

       The advantage of a crawling peg over the previous regime lies in the

 two areas where the large-step adjustment regime is weakest.          It usually

 avoids the political and social tabu attached to an act of currency

 depreciation and shifts the exchange rate adjustments from the front pages

 of the newspaper to back-page financial columns.        The major   exchange reserve
crises     and monetary upheavals may be avoided.

       One by-product of the crawling peg is that no major political decisions

or restrictive internal policies have to be taken at each step.           This

apparent advantage of mini-devaluations may paradoxically sometimes also be

a source of major weakness.        In a government-deficit and inflation-prone

economy the operation of the exchange rate is delegated to a ministerial or

Bank committee without the accompanying continuous urge for small-step

fiscal and incomes policy discipline.18         The fact that devaluations now take

on a more continuous form make for built-in inflationary expectations

(i     11 = c = e/e),   thus exacerbating inflationary pressures.

       Under a crawling peg, especially if i.t is predetermined, the capital

account curve no longer fluctuates.       Suppose expectations are fixed at

and the relevant asset demand curve is ZNI' in Figure 2, with equilibrium

momentarily at K.       Say a small step adjustment to a new BoP curve IT" is

required.      The small triangle marked by the points K, L, H marks the policy

trade—offs.       If fiscal policy can be used along with a mini-devaluation we

may move from K to L or at least refrain from getting a fall in real balances

(i.e. maintain real credit levels).       If fiscal or real wage restraint

cannot take place, real money balances will have to fall as we move from K

to H, by a cut in nominal money, by inflation, or by both.           One of the

problems    of the crawling peg is the continuous built-in pressure for monetary
restraint to eep doiestic iriteret rates high reldtive                       to (j* )    .    This
is    shon by the fact that at the             ioint    K on LM' , in has   to be lover than at
N    or   at B.

V.        High Capital Mobility and Flexible Rates

          So far we have considered regimes             in   which the authorities directly

peg the exchange rate in which case the BoP need                   not be in momentary equi]i
brium and foreign exchange reserves are the shortrun buffer.                         In the

Introduction we posed the problem of conflicting longterm and short—term

price      signalling.        This may occur in a situation of relatively high capital
mobility        and exchange rate flexibility, to which we now turn.                 Consider the

case in which the exchange rate automatically adjusts to equilibrate the

exchange market.             It helps to discuss first the case of a flexible rate

under perfect asset niobility ( = 0) and no intervention (AA =                     0).
          In an inflationary situation and when the foreign asset is highly liquid

(k(c) is elastic), it may sometimes be advantageous to use total bank credit

(C =           ÷ C +         rather than M as the financial instrument.              The
          Cg            C)
commodity market equilibrium curve QQ can be expressed in teniis of c                         C/p

(instead of m) and e/p, keeping all other properties as before (see Figure 3).

The asset market curve can be transfonned by substituting from equation (8)

into (4) and writing              = B   -   A to get:




(9)            c/p =   _()
                       B -   [1 + k(c)]A
                                              C/p.


          Equation (9) is represented by the curve ZC in Figure 3 which has

analogous properties to the curve ZM.                    It is a ray through the origin

whose slope increases with c and A and falls with B.                        Equilibrium takes

place at the intersection of the asset market line (ZC) and the com;odity

market QQ (point A).             In case of a disturbance the exchange rate immediately

adjusts to equilibrate the asset market first.                     Consider, as before, the

case in which there is an increase in the basic deficit (NX to NX') and
     for simplicity assuma first that there is no change in the cc nodity market.
     The only channel by which this may have an effect on the economy is              the

     asset   market, through a possible impact effect on expectations (c) and a
     longer-run   effect on the total supply of foreign exchange assets (B).
     Suppose   there is a one-time effect on c rotating LC to ZC'.   The nominal
     (and real) echarge rate         will   overshoot to the point F and may quickly be
     eroded by inflation with real appreciation moving the            economy   from F to G
     along the line ZC' .         At the point G the BoP is in short-run equilibrium,
     but there is     a sustained basic deficit.          This may disappear   over time only
    gradually    as B falls and the ZC curve continues to rotate up;ards.             Final

    equilibrium      will take    place only when the asset equilibrium line and the
    cornmodity market line intersect at the new           basic balance equilibrium (see
    point C).        The story is only slightly modified if we       consider that the
    disturbance      that has    shifted the basic balance (NX) also shifts the

    commodity   market (e.g. shift of QQ to        Q'Q'   as would happen in the case of
    an increase in import prices).
           There are some clear drawbacks to this automatic adjustment process.
    One is that      in   the first stage there may be an excessive       price increase
    with no real benefits to the current account.              This is   only one example of
    the 'overshooting' tendency of an exchange regime in which the asset market
•
    takes a major role in the short-run determination of the exchange rate

    (cf. Dornbusch, 1976, and the related literature).              Similar effects charac-

•   terize the case of unexpected domestic monetary changes.               For example, a

    monetary expansion from A to B raises expectations of a depreciation, causes

    a jump of the exchange rate to the point F on LC', say, followed by inflation

    (more from F to G).          The case of monetary     contraction, from A to H, which
    may be needed to correct a commodity market imbalance (at QQ') leads              to

    an appreciation       (point R) coupled with excessive unemplouent unless prices
    are   downward   flexible.
       The main drawback    of asset market determination in the present context,
quite apart from overshooting, is that the process of adjustiient to a new
long-run situation may be much too slow.             The real exchange rate that is
signalled    by the   asset market (at the point G, say) does not       reflect the true
long—run rate from the      point   of view   of   real resource allocation.   Given

the gestatior lags of exports and of investment in export industries and the

imperfections    in the expectation formation mechanism this would seem to be
the major cost of allowing short-run capital movements to determine the
exchange rate.
       One way of avoiding this signalling problem is to impose a direct tax

on capital imports as was     done in   a recent Israeli episode (see Liviatan

1980; Bruno and Sussman 1980).           In Figure 3 this can be shown by noting

that the imposition of a tax (T) on capital imports is the same as raising

the expected cost of foreign borrowing and thus causing the asset market

curve to rotate in the required direction (say, from ZC' to LCD). This

may not overcome the overshooting problem but may, at least, avoid over-

valuation of the currency.'9 A managed float, which takes the fonu of

intervention in the foreign exchange market, in principle works in the same

direction.     Purchase of foreign exchange by the Central Bank raises foreign

exchange reserves (A) and also rotates ZC anti-clockwise.

       What happens when capital mobility is not perfect and we don't have

instantaneous arbitrage?       Overshooting will clearly be mitigated.         Con-

sider again the case in which the current account flows also play a role in

the market.      Suppose that with the projected increase in the basic deficit

BoP equilibrium is represented by the curve TI' (shifted from TT and

assuming no immediate change in expectations).             Under a float the exchange

rate   jumps to D and then adjusts along TI' to G.            Note that there is less

overshooting (and less inflation) in this case.              If we now also assume a

shift in expectations, the new equilibrium will be at a higher point, G1,
                                              -13-



  on QQ.         Obviously, the    is the TI 1 irie the imre iiiportent is the
                                  flatter

  basic balance in the determination of market signals and the closer will
  a float bring us to the long-run signal.
          Does   this analysis imply that it is always advantageous to control
  capital movements, i.e., limit financial openness for the sake of real
 openness?         One should be careful not to jurip to hasty conclusions.         If
  it were possible to drai        an absolute distinction   between short-run and   long-
 run   capital movements in practice, then such a conclusion         may perhaps be
 justified.         However, we should hear   in mind that the   way we have dis—
 tinguished       between capital movements in terms of exogenously determined
 long-run funds (F) and endogenous short-term capital is          somewhat   artificial.
 Excessive foreign-exchange control could also drive
                                                     away legitimate long-
 run capital, which may thus affect the options for the real
                                                                      economy (i.e.
 shift the NX curve).         The costs and benefits must be weighed against each
 other.      In any case, the argument for financial closedness may often be

 confined to particular short-term situations.

 VI.      Exchange Rate Adjustnent and Inflation: Accommodation versus
         Mdratfôn
       The last issue to be discussed briefly is the
                                                            relationship between ex-
change rate change and inflation.           This brings up the case in which short-

run stabilization may take the lead over long-run objectives in exchange

rate pricing.         Specifically, should the rate of devaluation always be made

to accommodate (or overtake) the inflation rate for the sake of the long-run

external balance?         Or are there situations in which it pays to moderate

exchange rate changes as a short-run stabilization device even at the cost

of a real loss of reserves?

       For simplicity we shall conduct the discussion in terms of steady-

state rates of change, p and e, and assume consistency of expectations,

i.e. n     p and n    = e.

depreciation        in   an open economy can be derived from the coodity             and

indexation.          The intercept            summarizes the role of excess     demand factors

in the     commodity and labour markets as well as autonomous cost-push factors

(world     price    of raw materials, indirect taxes on            consumer goods, etc.).2°

         Equation    (10) appears as the line PP in Figure             4, with intercept ir

on the -axis and slope a < 1.                  Given any rate of depreciation (c)       this
curve gives the implied inflation rate that will be propagated by the real

system     given its underlying behavioural and institutional parameters.                      This

inflation rate can in principle be lowered either by a reduction in the
extent of linkage (a)           or   by fiscal and other stabilization measures, lowering
          In   practice it is unlikely that the slope can be changed much (except

momentarily under special circumstances), while the intercept of the PP line

is more amenable to policy change.

         Line XX in Figure 4         represents the long -run real depreciation that keeps
the current account in balance.                 The intercept 0 (which may be zero or
even negative) reflects the effect of the expected long-run reduction in
capital     flows net of autonomous time-shifts in the basic balance (due to

productivity growth, relative world price changes, etc.).2'

is given at the rate c2, which is consistent with an inflation rate of iT2

(see point A in the diagram).                 More restrictive internal policies (showing

in a lower pp' curve) will allow a lower rate of dereciation, c1, with a

correspondingly reduced inflation rate (cf. point C with A).
         If there    is   a high degree     of capital nobility in th sytern,          the

 numentary equilibrium rate of inflation will rut be given by the line XX,
 ho:ever,    but    rather    by the combination of e and          p that keep the asset

 market in balance over time (line 7Z in Figure 4).

         This can be obtained by time differentiation of equation (9), leading

 to an asset equilibrium rate of real depreciation e — p =                    , where         is

 a positive function of the rate of change of real credit (c), central hank

 inte'vcntion in reserves (LA), and the rate of change of expectations (c)2

and depends negatively on the basic balance                         AB).

         In Figure 4 the intercept of LZ on the p axis measures
                                                                                -.      If   ZZ

happens to coincide with the line XX (ç is then positive), the system is

in full steady state equilibrium at A.                   if LZ lies to the left and above

XX, however, there may be          a difference       between the rate of inflation that

keeps    the asset market in       balance and that which is propagated by the real

economy, at any given announced rate of depreciation (compare the point E

with A).23         If left to itself, the fall in T will gradually shift the U

curve down towards XX.            Now suppose that the ZZ curve is deliberately

shifted up toits position in Figure 4 through a credit squeeze, and by

allowing    reserves to fall       (—AA >     0).     At the same time the authorities

preannounce a lower rate of depreciation (c. <
                                                              c2).        Equilibrium can now
take place at a lower rate of inflation (m <                       at   the point B), providing
these steps are credible.24                If the   stabilization program also affects the
real   economy,           is brought down to          while the crawl and the expected

inflation rate are further reduced (point 0).                     At this stage the economy

may be ready for renewed growth (raise c, E) and a shift to a new long-run

rate of devaluation (c1)         at   C.

       The sequence of steps A-B-D-C may be a more feasible one to achieve

than an attempt at a direct move from A to C.                     The main difference is that

one uses the exchange rate much more                drastically   as a stabilizing device

(at D,      is almost zero), but one pays the cost in terms of short-tern debt
(or loss of reserves).    This is an eple in ihich short-tena capi tal
flows are deliberately used as a stabilizing device at the expense of long-
tenii signalling.   The main problem in practice is the speed at which these
adjustments can be made so as to be credible and the size of the real social
cost in terms of transitional production and employment slodown.

        Helpful

        Conference are gratefully acknowledged.

2       The typical loan in the new post-19/3     private capital market, even if
        taken for a long run investment purpose, is basically short--run in
        nature, in so far as the interest rate has to be renegotiated at

        short--run   intervals.
3       As noted in Diaz-AlejandrO's paper for     this Conference, this problem

        was also relevant in the 1930s.

4       At a later stage we shall put total real banking credit, instead of

        m, on the axis - see Section V.

5       n and iT   enter   firm asset market equilibrium (see below).

6       In this formulation we implicitly assume some i-cal wage (w) rigidity,

        in which case the labour market need not clear.         In a fully flexible

        wage case one should include —      [ as the alternative parameter in U1
        assuming full employment.        The basic form of equation (1) would

        remain the same.        The negative sign placed on K makes the vector U1

-
        consist    only of positive shift factors.

7       For simplicity we ignore the need to modify (2) hen the commodity

        market is not balanced.        Actually the NX line should have a kink at

        the point of intersection with QQ.        When Qd < QS, imports are a

        function of Qd which in turn depends positively on in.

8       When we are in a multiple-tariff world, this need no longer be the

        case.      Sometimes a tariff-cutting process may actually improve the

        current account.        Even the case schematically given here, where

         there may be a common tariff on imports which is different from the

         export subsidy, could lead to this result.

    9    The demand for government bonds (Bg) is not specified separately

         since it can be derived as a residual once total asset demand (supply)

         is given. If the latter is denoted by a, we get from (3) and (4) that

      the deiand for real bonds (bd) is : bd = a         -
                                                             (i)   Q[l + k (c) ].

10    We   differ   from their presentation in using the pair of real variables

      (q, in) on the axes rather than the nominal e and p and having T.

      separate from the goods market.        The capital flow term in their paper
      is written directly as a function of the interest differential
      Li      (j* + c)j.   There is some advantage      in relating the capital flow
      to the underlying asset behaviour.
ii    If   one adds B on the   LHS we   get total financial assets(M +       eZ +
                                                                                    B9)
     as financed from the three major sources: the basic balance (eB), the
     government deficit (Cg + B9), and the banking system finance to the

     private sector (C + Ce).

12   An exactly analogous situation would be created by an inflationary

      shift in the commOdity market.        Suppose we start at B on QQ' and NX'

     and for some reason (e.g. an increase in the budget deficit or in the

     real wage) QQ' shifts inwards to QQ.            Assuming the line AB to be on

     a 450 vector, inflation will move the economy back to equilibrium

     at A.      From here on the analysis is the same.

13   Equilibrium at H or at E here implies a fall in real balances from

              to M0/p1 through a price rise.

14   Strictly speaking equilibrium will probably take place at a point

     right of F (since now Q =          < QS)•

15   This may sometimes take the form       of    active government encouragement

     to firms to take foreign credit which is expensive from a social

     point of view but is relatively cheap given the prevailing higher

     domestic interest rates.

16   The analysis was conducted with a given commodity market curve. When

     QQ shifts inwards due to a rise in inflationary expectations or in

     real ages these problcms are clearly accentuated.

 17    In the    rsrael i   case the crawl irig peg was operated for two years,
       between June 1975 and October 1917, and at              first follo'ed rather rigid
       rules   but then became quite flexible in teniis of size of change and

      allowed    frequency         of adjustment (see Bruno and Sussrrian, 1930).

 18 g.         It may    be    easier to convince the trade      unions of the need to

      forego one step in the indexation mechanism in a national crisis

      situation than          to   reduce indexation on a conti nijous basis.

19    Note, however, that the impos i tion          of a tax on capi tal imports      has

      another    negative      by—product in the form of high domestic interest

      rates    which may harm investment.           The movmrent from A to C obviously

      involves    a real credit squeeze which          may be voluntary, through a fall

      in   C, or involuntary, through inflation.

      where a =    n,          = nrd   + (1    )2j, and     r = Li - (1    -
                                                                                      a     1


      if   and only if y = 1.           This can also be expanded to incorporate real
      balance effects.
21    If we    denote    the autonomous time shift of 11 by               and the elasticity
      of T with respect to q by                 one can show that c              +

22    1A and E    will   be zero in equilibrium, but appear here since they can

      be used as policy instruments, along with c.

23    One could argue that in this case the expected rate of inflation may

      be T3 while the actual rate is 1r2.              If     is maintained and expecta-

      tions play an important role, actual inflation may gradually rise above

      2    (does this accord with developments during a hyperinflation?).
24    Also in line with the previous footnote -              inflation    may for a time

      rise above 2 before it eventually comes down to rr.
