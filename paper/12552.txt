We analyze the development of 49 local bond markets. Our main finding is that policies and laws
matter: Countries with stable inflation rates and strong creditor rights have more developed local
bond markets and rely less on foreign-currency-denominated bonds. The results suggest that
“original sin” is a misnomer. Emerging economies are not inherently dependent upon
foreign-currency debt. Rather, by improving policy performance and strengthening institutions they
may develop local currency bond markets, reduce their currency mismatch, and lessen the likelihood
of future crises.

1. Introduction

         The currency crisis literature has recently focused on the importance of developing

local currency bond markets in order to avoid the financial fragility associated with a

currency mismatch. Such a mismatch arises, for example, if a firm’s assets are in the local

currency but it borrows in a foreign currency. Absent a currency mismatch, a negative

shock in, for example, Brazil that caused investors to sell Brazilian assets would naturally

correct itself; the real would plummet and, in the normal course of events, the depreciation

would be expansionary and would improve Brazil’s external balances (as its products

became more competitive and foreign goods became expensive). But if Brazil had

borrowed heavily in foreign-currency-denominated debt—perhaps because it did not have a

local currency bond market—the depreciation would immediately and severely worsen

government and private balance sheets and greatly increase debt repayment burdens. Firms

would in turn reduce investment and push the country into a recession, generating pressure

for further currency depreciation. The link between this downward spiral of a currency

crisis and the initial currency mismatch has been emphasized in the theoretical and empirical

literature (Goldstein and Turner, 2004).1

         If underdeveloped local currency markets are linked to financial instability, we

should aim to determine the source of this emerging market affliction. The extant literature

does not provide an unambiguous prescription, as bond market development is at the heart

of a current debate in academic and policy circles. Eichengreen and Hausmann (1999)

describe emerging economies as suffering from “original sin,” defined as a situation in

1
 See also Krugman (1999), Jeanne and Zettelmeyer (2002), Schneider and Tornell(2004), and Aghion,
Bacchetta and Banerjee (2004). The literature on currency mismatches, as well as by extension our work, also
has a link to the vast literature on dollarization. For example, Goldstein and Turner (2004) note that a currency
mismatch could ultimately force an emerging economy to dollarize.
which the domestic currency cannot be used to borrow abroad or to borrow long term, even

domestically. The phrase “original sin” itself suggests that emerging markets cannot

overcome this problem on their own. In support of this notion, Eichengreen, Hausmann,

and Panizza (2002), henceforth EHP, find that original sin is exogenous to conditions in

developing countries (such as rule of law and past inflation performance). In contrast, La

Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny (henceforth LLSV) (1997) find that debt

markets (bank debt plus nonfinancial bonds) are larger in countries with better rule of law

and creditor rights.

         Are policymakers in emerging markets truly blameless for their fallen state, as the

EHP findings suggest, or, as the LLSV results imply, are there ways emerging markets can

improve their financial systems? This question is important in academic circles, as some

papers follow EHP’s lead and assume that original sin is exogenous.2 But it is more than an

academic curiosum. If original sin is exogenous, as EHP suggest, international

organizations may have an important role in the relief effort.3 In contrast, the LLSV results

imply that original sin is endogenous (and a misnomer) and that a supranational solution is

only second best; the first best solution would address the source of the problem.

         We weigh in on this debate using data that are more complete than either LLSV or

EHP. Specifically, we present data on the characteristics of bond markets around the world

and analyze factors associated with local currency bond market development. Compiling

data from a number of sources, we first present information on the size and currency

  For example, Jeanne and Zettelmeyer (2002) start from a situation of original sin and examine solutions that
involve international lending

Eichengreen and Hausmann, “How to Eliminate Original Financial Sin.”

composition of bond markets in 49 countries. We then analyze factors associated with local

bond market development.

       Our analysis reveals roles for both creditor-friendly policies and creditor-friendly

laws. Countries with better historical inflation performance (an outcome of creditor-friendly

policies) have more developed local bond markets, both private and government, and rely

less on foreign-currency-denominated bonds. Creditor-friendly laws matter, too; strong rule

of law is associated with deeper local bond markets, while countries with better creditor

rights are able to issue a higher share of bonds in their local currency.

       We also show that the necessary conditions for bond market development are very

similar to those that foster development of the banking system. Countries in which people

are not willing to become creditors—at one extreme this is an unwillingness to deposit

money in banks—will have undeveloped banking systems and underdeveloped bond

markets. This has implications for the literature on financial development and growth [see,

for example, Levine (2002) and Beck and Levine (2004)]; when that literature brings bonds

into the analysis, the debate may well shift from the relative merits of bank-based and

(equity) market-based financial systems to debt (i.e., banking and bonds) versus equity.



2. Bond Markets Around the World

       Unlike equity markets, about which information is readily available, comprehensive

information on the size of the global bond market is not available from any one source.

LLSV (1997) present data on debt finance, but their measure is of private bank debt and




                                                3
nonfinancial bonds. In this section we present information on the size and currency

composition of bond markets in 49 countries.4

        Our estimates of the size of each country’s bond market are derived primarily from

unpublished data from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). For international

bonds (i.e., those in foreign currencies or placed abroad), we use the security-level data

underlying BIS Quarterly Review Table 14B. To form the security-level international bonds

database, the BIS combines information from Capital DATA (Bondware), Thomson

Financial Securities Data (Platinum), and Euroclear; identifies and removes duplicates;

corrects mistakes; ensures a consistent classification of issuers across the different sources;

and performs general quality control. The BIS data on international bonds are likely the

most comprehensive available, but they do not include information on Brady bonds, which

we obtain from Merrill Lynch (2002). For domestic bonds, we rely again on unpublished

data from the BIS, but here we must augment BIS data with data retrieved from Bloomberg.

BIS Quarterly Review Table 16A publishes data on outstanding domestic debt securities, but

combines both short- and long-term securities. In our study we focus on long-term debt

securities—those with an original maturity of more than one year—and so utilize instead the

unpublished long-term component of the domestic debt data. Augmentation is necessary,

because for seven countries in our study—Brazil, India, Ireland, New Zealand, Poland,

Russia, and Turkey—BIS data indicate no domestic long-term debt issued by private

entities. However, a Bloomberg search uncovered private bonds outstanding as of end-2001

for all but Turkey; amounts, which are not large, were added to our data after a cross-check



4
  Another source of information on the size of bond markets across countries had been Merrill Lynch’s Size &
Structure of the World Bond Market, but it was recently discontinued. Other recent discussions of bond
market development include IMF (2002) and Mihaljek, Scatigna, and Villar (2002).


                                                     4
that ensured the bonds were not placed abroad (which would be double counting because

such bonds are in our international debt data).

        The global bond market totaled $31.2 trillion in 2001 (Table 1). The bulk of

outstanding bonds were issued by developed countries (93%), in particular the United States

(46%), euro area (22%), and Japan (16%). Emerging market issuance comprised the other

7% of the global bond market, with issuance much greater in emerging Asia (3.6% of the

global market) than in Latin America (1.9%). Developed country bond markets not only

comprised a large portion of the global bond market, but they were also large relative to the

size of their economies: most developed countries have outstanding bonds that are about

equal in magnitude to the size of annual GDP (third column). For example, the bonds-to-

GDP ratio is 105% for Germany, 116% in Japan, and 141% in the United States. Bond

markets in developing countries are much smaller, averaging just 38% of annual GDP.

                                          <<Table 1 here>>

        Table 1 also provides data on the extent of local currency bond market development

in 49 countries. Local currency bonds are those issued by residents of a particular country

(for example, Chile) in that country’s currency (Chilean pesos), regardless of whether it was

placed in the domestic market or offshore. Local currency bond markets make up the bulk

of the global bond market (right panel of Table 1), totaling $28.7 trillion, or 92% of all

bonds; the other 8% of outstanding bonds were issued in foreign currencies, primarily the

dollar, euro, and sterling.

        Previous studies focused on international bonds (EHP) or bank debt and non-

financial bonds (LLSV). Our more complete bond market data—which includes both

private and public issuance placed both at home and abroad—allow a more comprehensive




                                                  5
study of bond market development. To illustrate some nuances revealed by the data, Table

2 provides a comparison of bond market development in Argentina, Chile, and the UK.

EHP focus on the currency composition of a country’s external bonds (i.e., bonds placed in

external markets); the second column displays (one minus) an EHP measure of original sin,

namely the fraction of each country’s external bonds that is denominated in local currency.

An expanded measure would also include information on the domestic bond market; column

4 shows the local currency share once domestic bond markets are included. Note that

focusing strictly on external bonds would ignore the fact that Chile has a more extensive

domestic bond market than Argentina. Even this expanded currency share measure can be a

bit deceiving, as it places Chile and the UK on equal footing. More informative than the

local currency share of a country’s bond market is the actual development of the local

currency bond market, which we display in the final column, as the size of a nation’s local-

currency-denominated bond market divided by GDP. We believe this last measure gets to

the heart of the issue: It takes a sizeable local currency bond market to be free from original

sin.

3. The Determinants of Local Bond Market Development

       In this section we present our primary regression results, address concerns about

endogeneity, and discuss the similarities of factors that are associated with the development

of banking systems and bond markets.



3.1 Primary Regression Results




                                               6
        In Table 3, we examine the determinants of two general measures of local bond

market development: the ratio of the size of the local bond market to GDP (Local Bond

Market Development) and the share of a country’s outstanding bonds that are denominated

in the local currency (Local Currency Share). To ascertain whether private and government

bond markets differ materially, we will also (in Table 4) separate our Local Bond Market

Development variable into its private and government components. In both tables, we

examine the influence of Rule of Law, Creditor Rights, fiscal balance (calculated as a

percent of GDP and averaged over a 20-year period), country size (as measured by the log

of GDP in 2001), and growth rates (annual GDP growth over the preceding ten years).5

Creditor Rights measures whether the laws of a country are creditor friendly; we also

include another variable, Inflation Variance (the variance of the inflation rate over the past

ten years), as a measure of whether policies have been creditor- friendly. In both tables,

odd-numbered columns present results from parsimonious regressions of 49 countries (42

countries in Table 4); even-numbered columns include other variables that have less

coverage and reduce the sample to 41 countries (37 countries in Table 4).6

                                               <<Table 3 here>>

        All regressions in Table 3 provide strong evidence that countries with better inflation

performance (the result, perhaps, of more stable monetary and fiscal policies) have larger

local currency bond markets and rely less on foreign-currency bonds. The robustness of the

5
   The Rule of Law variable is, as reported in LLSV (1997), an average over 1982-1995 of the International
Country Risk Guide assessment of law and order tradition. We supplement this source with 2000 data from
Gwartney et al. (2003) for five other countries: China, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Iceland.
Creditor Rights, also from LLSV (1997), aggregates the various rights that secured creditors have in
liquidation and reorganization. Fiscal balance data are from the World Bank's World Development Indicators
database, with data from Hong Kong and Taiwan obtained from OECD data and the IMF's International
Financial Statistics.
6
   In even-numbered columns we lose one country that does not have ten years of historical GDP (Czech
Republic) and seven that do not have data on Creditor Rights (China, Hungary, Iceland, Luxembourg,
Morocco, Poland, and Venezuela).


                                                     7
inflation result is supported by two additional tests: Excluding outliers by omitting the four

countries with greatest inflation variance, or replacing inflation variance with the mean of

inflation, does not materially impact the results reported in Table 3.7 In addition to the role

of inflation, our results suggest countries with stronger institutions (high score on Rule of

Law) have broader local currency bond markets, and those with stronger Creditor Rights

rely less on foreign-currency bonds. The importance of institutional and policy settings

suggest that even emerging economies have the ability to develop local currency bond

markets. Emerging market economies are not predestined to suffer from original sin.

           More specifically, our results suggest that countries such as Australia (with a low

score on creditor rights), Indonesia (poor inflation performance), or Peru (poor rule of law)

might increase the breadth of their local currency bond market and rely less on foreign

currency borrowing if they address their deficient creditor laws and policies. To gauge the

importance of various factors, our estimates in column (1) imply that (ceteris paribus) if

Brazil had Denmark’s rule of law, its bond market as a share of GDP would be 43

percentage points higher. If Brazil had Denmark’s inflation history, its bond market would

be 42 percentage points (of GDP) larger. These amounts are both economically

significant—Brazil’s local currency bond market is currently only 22 percent of GDP—and

suggest an important role for creditor-friendly policies in emerging markets.

           In Table 4 we separately analyze the government and private bonds markets. The

results suggest that the determinants of the size of government and private bond markets are

quite similar: Countries with better inflation performance and stronger rule of law have

larger sovereign and corporate bond markets. The main difference is the influence of fiscal



7
    Tables with these robustness checks are available from the authors upon request.


                                                         8
policy. Not surprisingly, a tendency to run fiscal deficits is associated with larger

government bond markets, where much of the deficit financing occurs.

                                               <<Table 4 here>>

        Our results are consistent with the model of Jeanne (2003), which shows an

important role for monetary policy credibility in explaining the currency composition of a

country’s debt. Our results are also largely consistent with those of LLSV, but contrast

sharply with those of EHP, who find that the only determinant of bond market development

is country size.8 The most likely reason that our results contrast with EHP is because their

study includes only bonds that were initially placed abroad or denominated in a foreign

currency. As we demonstrated in Section 2, focusing only on so-called international bonds

results in vastly different country rankings.



3.2 Addressing Endogeneity Concerns

        We take seriously the notion that inflation could plausibly be considered

endogenous. For example, there may be virtuous interactions between the development of

the bond market and future inflation performance. Eichengreen and Hausmann (1999)

suggest that a well-developed domestic bond market may generate a political constituency

opposed to inflationary policies.

        We address concerns about endogeneity in two ways. First, we note that in our

regressions, inflation is already lagged; we examine the influence of inflation over a ten-

year period on the subsequent size of the bond market. If we lag inflation even further to,



8
 Our results are also consistent with the contemporaneous Claessens, Klingebiel, and Schmukler (2003) study
of 36 government bond markets, as well as the more recent work by Eichengreen and Luengnaruemitchai
(2004).


                                                     9
for example, the five-year period ending ten years before our bond market development

data, inflation is still significant.9

           The second method we utilize to address the potential endogeneity of inflation is an

instrumental variables approach. The best instruments will be highly correlated with

inflation, but not with bond market development. Finding such instruments for inflation

variance proved difficult. But there are reasonable instruments for the average mean of

inflation, especially if we limit our focus to private bond markets. Specifically, with respect

to private bond markets, we can instrument for mean inflation using a measure of central

bank independence and fiscal balance.10 Although fiscal balance is clearly endogenous to

the development of government bond markets—larger deficits directly result in more

government bonds outstanding—fiscal balance should impact private bond market

development only to the extent it impacts inflation performance. Similarly, the degree to

which a central bank is independent should not directly impact private bond market

development, but may well through its impact on past and prospective inflation. In addition,

our instrument list includes an interaction term to allow for fiscal balance to have a larger

effect on inflation in emerging markets, where budget deficits might be more likely to be

monetized (and thus inflationary). The fiscal and central bank independence variables

explain roughly 40 percent of the variation in inflation across countries.




9
  These results are available from the authors upon request. A direct test of whether larger bond markets lead
to better inflation performance would involve lagged bond market development. However, data on bond
market development across a range of countries are available only from 1994. We found no evidence
(regression results available upon request) that 1994 bond market development is associated with subsequent
inflation performance.
10
     The Central Bank Independence measure is taken from Cukierman et al (1992) and Cukierman et al (2002).


                                                      10
         In columns (5) and (6) we present the results of instrumental variables regressions.

Instrumenting for inflation reduces the significance somewhat, but the message is still clear:

Countries with poorer inflation performance have smaller local currency bond markets.



3.3 Banks and Bonds

         The similarity of our results to LLSV, who include bank debt in their analysis, leads

us to investigate the relation between bond market and banking sector development.

Column (1) of Table 5 reveals that the conditions necessary for bond market development,

such as creditor-friendly policies and laws, are similar to those that foster development of

the banking system [as measured by the private bank credit to GDP ratio of Beck,

Demigurcic-Kunt, and Levine (1999)]. Countries in which people are not willing to become

creditors—at one extreme this is an unwillingness to deposit money in banks—will have

undeveloped banking systems and underdeveloped bond markets. Following this line of

analysis, when the literature on the relative merits of bank-based versus market-based

financial systems includes bonds, it could be that bonds and banks should be combined.

Indeed, column (2) shows that countries with larger bond markets tend to have larger

banking systems, but not larger equity markets. Because bond market and banking system

development appear to be so closely related, the focus of the financial development

literature might benefit from a shift in focus to debt versus equity rather than the current

focus on bank-based versus market-based systems.11

                                                 <<Table 5 here>>



11
   To be sure, the debate is moving in various directions. Levine (2002) discusses the financial services view
that stresses not bank-based versus market-based systems, but the financial arrangements that arise in the
economy, and a special case, the law and finance view of LLSV (1998).


                                                      11
4. Conclusion

       This paper presents data on the characteristics of the 49 bond markets and analyzes

factors associated with local currency bond market development. We find that countries

with better historical inflation performance and stronger legal institutions have more

developed local bond markets and rely less on foreign-currency-denominated bonds. The

results suggest that “original sin” is a misnomer. Emerging economies are not inherently

dependent upon foreign-currency debt. Rather, by improving policy performance and

strengthening institutions they may develop local currency bond markets, reduce their

currency mismatch, and lessen the likelihood of future crises.

       Our results also indicate that the necessary conditions for bond market development

are very similar to those that foster development of the banking system. This, in turn, has

implications for the literature on financial development and growth [see, for example,

Levine (2002) and Beck and Levine (2004)]; when that literature brings bonds into the

analysis, the debate may well shift from the relative merits of bank-based and (equity)

market-based financial systems to debt (i.e., banking and bonds) versus equity.

       Finally, some limitations of our study should be noted. Some of the domestic bonds

included in our analysis may be indexed to inflation or an exchange rate and thus behave a

lot like foreign-currency securities. Also, we have said nothing about the quality of bond

market development. Historically, an important impetus for financial market development

has been exceptional government financing needs, for example, to finance large budget

deficits that were often incurred to fund a war effort [Rousseau and Sylla (2003)]. We

showed that fiscal deficits are related to the development of government bond markets, and,

indeed, some of the recent bond market development may be financing large budget deficits.

growth of local contractual savings institutions such as pension funds and life insurance

companies. We leave for further work an analysis of the quality of bond market

development.

All data are as of end-2001. Data are from security-level data underlying BIS Table 14B (International Bonds and Notes by Country of Residence)
and the unpublished long-term debt component of BIS Table 16A (Domestic Debt Securities). Local-currency-denominated debt is the sum of
domestic long-term debt (from Table 16A) and the local currency portion of Table 14B. Domestic long-term debt for countries not available on
Table 16A and data for Brady bonds are from Merrill Lynch (2002). Included in the total is $2.5 trillion of foreign currency bonds, denominated
primarily in dollars, euros, and sterling.

                  Multivariate Tests of Bond Market Development: Government and Corporate Bonds
OLS regression estimates of Local Bond Market Development for the components Government and Private (i.e., the size of the government and private local
currency bond markets over GDP). The explanatory variables include Inflation Variance (the variance of the past ten year’s inflation), Rule of Law and Creditor
Rights (from LLSV, 1997), Fiscal Balance (fiscal balance over GDP averaged over a twenty-year period), the log of GDP, and GDP Growth (the past ten year’s
average annual growth rate). In Columns (5) and (6), we instrument for inflation using Central Bank Independence, Fiscal Balance, and an interaction of Fiscal
Balance and an emerging market dummy variable; the instruments explain roughly 40% of the variation in inflation across countries, but are not related to private
bond market development. The p-value, based on robust standard errors, of the two-tailed t-test of equality with zero is reported in parentheses.
