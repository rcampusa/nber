       This paper presents an empirical analysis of the relationship between patenting, innovation,

and federal antitrust enforcement towards firms in the manufacturing sector. I examine whether

the likelihood of antitrust litigation is influenced by patent histories and R&D expenditures, after

controlling for other firm-specific variables including size and likelihood of antitrust charges for

medium and large firms. Smaller firms with faster sales growth are also more likely to be charged

with antitrust violations.

I. INTRODUCTION

The American judiciary in the nineteenth century deprecated monopoly, but celebrated the

grant of property rights in patents.1 Judges did not recognize patents as monopolies,
arguing that patentees added to social welfare through innovations which had never existed

before, whereas monopolists secured to themselves rights that already belong to the public.2

The passage of the Sherman Act in 1890 was associated with a populist emphasis on the

need to protect the public from corporate monopolies, including those based on patent
protection.3 Numerous lawsuits, articles and books since then have debated whether

antitrust policies, which are designed to suppress monopolization, are antithetical to policies

that grant exclusive property rights in inventions.

       Researchers who support the hypothesis of a conflict typically describe antitrust

lawsuits and identify the large number which seem to hinge on patent issues or to involve

corporations regarded as technological leaders. The roster ranges from landmark cases in

the early decades of the 20th century, such as those against American Tobacco, John Deere

& Co., American Can and International Harvester, through to the numerous cases since

1970 against prominent innovators such as IBM, Xerox, Eastman Kodak and, most recently,

Intel and Microsoft.4 Some of the studies in this vein claim that antitrust officials have

evinced "almost unbroken hostility towards patents."5 Others warn of the possibility of

obtaining static (antitrust) gains at the expense of dynamic (technological) efficiency.6
       Proponents of the "no conflict" view specify distinctions between the justifiable

exercise of patent power and unjustifiable misuse that is subject to antitrust action;
countercite other cases upholding patent rights in the context of antitrust charges; or else


                                              2
point to the lack of supporting evidence.7 Ward Bowman refuted the notion of a conflict

on conceptual grounds, arguing that the objective of both policies is to increase social
welfare by providing consumers with the most goods at the lowest cost.8 Federal antitrust

agencies have likewise contended that there is 'no basic incompatibility or irreconciliable

conflict between the patent laws and the antitrust laws," because both have the objective of

promoting competition and enhancing social utility.9    The question of conflict is easy to

dismiss in specific circumstances such as patent misuse and fraud. For instance, in Pfizer

v. FTC 394 U.S. 920 (1969), it was found that Pfizer and American Cyanamid had deceived

the Patent Office and used the patent property to engage in monopolization of the
tetracycline market.   Similarly, the FTC challenged a 1998 merger between Summit
Technologies and VISX because of patent misuse, and proposed that a key VISX patent

should be overturned.'0 Plaintiffs in antitrust disputes can also bring charges based on

'predatory innovation" that has the objective of eliminating competition." However, such

cases involve clearly unacceptable practices associated with patent ownership, and do not

bear on questions such as whether technological innovators may legitimately gain market

power associated with patent ownership, and thus increase the likelihood that complaints

against them are filed under antitrust laws.

       This study considers the question of whether greater technological innovativeness is

associated with closer scrutiny by antitrust enforcement agencies. Specifically, I examine

whether technological innovation influences the probability of an antitrust action. Case

studies and theoretical insights are important and informative, but the issue of the
relationship between patent and antitrust enforcement is only partially illuminated by these


                                               3
methods. Although quantitative data are likely to exhibit other limitations, a systematic

assessment of antitrust charges over time at least provides another perspective that may

shed some light on the patent-antitrust debate. Despite the voluminous literature on
antitrust litigation and its relationship to intellectual property, most empirical work has been

directed towards other antitrust issues and few towards the patent-antitrust interface.
Richard Posner made an important contribution in 1970 when he presented simple
descriptive statistics regarding overall historical trends in antitrust enforcement at the

industry level. Some researchers have used his industry level data to examine the

determinants of antitrust activity, and, apart from sales, found a negligible relationship
between economic factors and numbers of charges brought across industries.'2 This is

hardly surprising, since antitrust charges are brought against firms, and not against
industries. Other studies have analyzed specific antitrust violations such as price fixing and

mergers, or on the political economy of federal agencies such as the FTC.'3

       This paper therefore presents an empirical analysis of the patent-antitrust issue in

the manufacturing sector between 1970 and 1998. I investigate the influence of innovation

on the likelihood of federal government antitrust charges, controlling for firm specific

factors such as firm size, sales growth and advertising intensity. It should be noted that the

underlying concern is not so much to ascertain whether there is an inherent or actual

patent-antitrust conflict. Rather, this study recasts the debate by considering whether
innovative firms that engage in high levels of patenting or research and development
antitrust are more likely to be engaged in federal antitrust litigation. I also assess an
example, in the area of R&D joint ventures, where antitrust policy appears to have


                                               4
influenced the rate and direction of inventive activity.

       The first section of the paper summarizes aggregate trends in antitrust litigation
initiated by the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice between 1970

and 1998. The second section describes a dataset of firms that were involved in federal

restraint of trade lawsuits and a control sample that form the basis for subsequent analysis.

The third section examines patterns of patenting and innovation at the firm level, and

relates these patterns to variation over time, firm characteristics, and interindustry effects.

The data are then used to assess whether innovativeness in the form of R&D and patenting

tends to increase the likelihood of antitrust charges within a given industry, after controlling

for other variables that might affect the tendency to antitrust scrutiny. The final section

discusses whether antitrust policy has influenced firm behaviour, by considering patterns of

filing of joint ventures in research and development, under the National Cooperative
Research and Production Act which provides limited relief from antitrust sanctions.

       Clearly, if finns with more extensive patent portfolios experience a greater likelihood

of antitrust scrutiny, it holds serious implications for the future of the patent system.
Significantly, sanctions under the patent law are far less stringent than those of antitrust:

patentees who are charged under antitrust law may face treble damages, forced divestures

and compulsory licensing, compared to the simple invalidation of the patent grant under

patent laws. Thus, if firms perceive that higher patenting is associated with a higher
likelihood of antitrust charges, a rational response would be to reduce the propensity to

patent, and to attempt to appropriate returns outside of the patent system. It should be
 noted that this study is not intended to prescribe whether optimal policy should be directed


                                               5
towards strengthening antitrust enforcement or towards furthering the rights of patent
holders.   However, legal rules are unlikely to be wealth-maximizing if they create
inconsistent incentives, so the results bear implications for both federal industrial and

intellectual property policies.



II. AGGREGATE ANTITRUST LITIGATION AND THE ANTITRUST DATASET



The major antitrust statutes -- the Sherman Act, Federal Trade Commission Act, Clayton

Act, Hart-Scott-Rodino Act -- have the basic objective of regulating business and controlling

firms which engage in anticompetitive practives, in order to promote social welfare. Figure

1 shows all antitrust cases, both federal and private, filed in U.S. district courts between

1975 and 1997. Both series reveal a precipitous drop in total district court filings, but the

share of government lawsuits increased somewhat after 1985, partly because of more
stringent requirements that the courts imposed on private litigants. I chose to focus on

federal government litigation in this study, because the rationale for private antitrust
litigation is likely to be more difficult to disentangle and interpret. Moreover, private

actions may be related to government charges, as in cases where private plaintiffs use

federal complaints as a signal to free-ride on federal investigation expenditures and to try

to obtain damages or injunctive relief from alleged harm that the federal defendant may
have caused competitors.14

       The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) do not

publish reports of antitrust statistics in a form that can be used for systematic economic

analysis. Instead, these data must be retrieved from the CCH Trade Regulation Reports.

The Reports typically include several entries relating to one action, some of them listed

across several years. The Federal Trade Commission reports summaries of cases in the

"FTC Docket of Complaints" of The Trade Regulation Reports. The Dockets are not veiy

informative, comprising the name of the firm, frequently the good produced, and the
charges. I concatenated these FTC complaints to obtain a list of distinct actions for each

firm. Similary, I compiled the aggregate DOJ information by individual action from 1970

through 1998, categorizing the cases by four-digit SIC code, and noting the issue, outcome

and year of decision when that could be traced. Once the sample was assembled, I obtained

further information about individual cases from the TRADE library of Lexis/Nexis. The

resulting data set can be used to track broad changes in federal antitrust litigation and

policy over time and industry, although the focus of this paper is primarily on the influence

of patenting on antitrust litigation.
       Between 1970 and 1993 the Department of Justice (DOJ) filed 1293 charges.'5 The

majority of cases related to allegations of bid-rigging in the construction industry, with

numerous defendants listed in each charge. In keeping with its stated mission, the DOJ's

second priority is the prosecution of price-related restraints of trade. Almost one half (47

percent) of all non-bidrigging charges deal with pricing issues, especially the per se illegal
criminal price-fixing cases which tend to be charged and summarily decided in the same

year. In contrast, the 1673 FTC consent decrees predominantly involve false advertising and

deceptive business practices.16 The more economically based investigations address issues

relating to mergers, pricing and restraint of trade actions. Some have argued that the work


                                              7
of the two agencies is largely duplicative, but agency employees indicate that they engage

in a division of labour by industry. The consent decrees support this, since the DOJ's cases

focus on construction, the service sector, food, chemicals and the petroleum industries. The

VFC historically charged firms in textiles and financing (such as credit collection
companies), but the agency has recently increased litigation against firms in software,
computers, and high technology, and has sponsored hearings on global and innovation-based

competition.'7

       From these aggregate data I selected my antitrust sample, which comprises all

manufacturing firms that were primary defendants in general trade restraint charges filed

by the FFC and DOJ between 1970 and the present.'8 Figure 2 illustrates the time series

of federal antitrust complaints that I compiled as a subset of the aggregate data described

above. The antitrust sample totals approximately 500 companies involved in 547 cases, and

excludes those charged with "noneconomic" antitrust torts such as deceptive advertising and

misleading trade practices. This number was reduced to 426 actions against publicly traded

firms that were included in the Compustat files, in order to obtain a time series of financial

data such as income, balance sheet and stock market values. The antitrust charge specified

the product market that was the subject of the action, so it was possible to allocate each

charge to an industry at the four-digit SIC level. Each firm in the antitrust sample was then

matched by 4-digit SIC code and the year in which the lawsuit was filed with a control firm

that had not been involved in antitrust litigation between 1950 and 1998 (see Appendix).

III. PA! 1ERNS OF INNNOVATION

In order to better understand the link between antitrust and innovation, this section relates

R&D and patenting to firm level characteristics and to industrial composition.19 The

"Schumpeterian hypothesis" is typically characterized as proposing a positive relationship
between firm size, industry concentration, and innovation.20 In the antitrust dimension,

this model implies that innovative enterprises may attract antitrust attention because they

are more likely to be dominant or large relative to the industry. The concentration of

patenting in large corporations has long been noted, and designated the "monopolization

of patent monopolies."2' Fritz Machlup felt that patent policies by large firms assured
them of "almost unlimited monopoly power." These statements are based on the view

that patents serve to create and preserve market power through barriers to entry, especially

since patenting around the invention and patent litigation by potential entrants can be costly

and risky strategies. Acs and Audretsch tested a modification of the usual Schumpeterian

model and found that large firms tended to have a innovative advantage in capital intensive,

concentrated, and advertising intensive industries, whereas smaller firms had a comparative

advantage in very innovative industries, and in more competitive markets. Some contend

that such research findings highlight the need to strengthen antitrust laws to deal with large

patent portfolios. For instance, it has been suggested that antitrust laws should inhibit firms

from accumulating large stocks of patents through policies such as a progressive tax.
Others have supported the introduction of requirements such as compulsory patent licensing

or working the patent, under the guise of antitrust policy, although historically both the
courts and the makers of U.S. patent policies have resisted imposing restrictions on the


                                              9
rights of the owners of intellectual property.

       In order to examine the relationship between patenting and antitrust, it is useful to

first of all consider the types of firms that engage in patenting. Since there is high variance

in the annual numbers of patents issued to a firm, I use instead the accumulated stock of

patents assigned to the finn in the five years up to and including the year of the antitrust

charge. These included patent holdings by firms such as General Electric (4378 patents

between 1977 and 1981), Westinghouse (1923 between 1981 and 1985), Dow Chemical (1894

between 1983 and 1987), and Alliant Techsystems (82 patents, 1990 through 1994). The

simple statistics presented in Table 1 are consistent with other studies using patent data and

are consistent with the 'Schumpeterian hypothesis." The data indicate that patenting varies

positively with firm size in the antitrust sample as well as the control sample. Patenting by

antitrust firms is significantly higher across all size categories, both in terms of levels and

relative to total assets and sales. However, the summary statistics in Table 1 also indicate

that the antitrust firms tend to be much larger than the control sample. This reflects the

significance of large size (and hence of market share) in motivating antitrust lawsuits: in

some concentrated industries (such as automobiles and rubber tires) it was difficult to find

any firms which had existed in the same period and had not been charged with antitrust

violations after 1950. However, one might be concerned about selection bias in the control

sample. In order to indicate how sensitive the results are to differences in size the analysis

reported below allows coefficients to vary across firm size. I also tested the robustness of

the results by redoing the analysis after eliminating from the dataset the top 100 firms in

terms of size.

       The smaller antitrust firms have a greater patenting intensity relative to total assets

and to research and development than the larger antitrust firms. Both large and medium

antitrust firms tend to have higher research and development and advertising expenditures

relative to total assets and sales compared to the control sample, whereas smaller firms in

both samples were more similar in these dimensions.           Medium and small firms also

reported similar physical capital intensity across samples, but the antitrust firms are
characterized by higher levels of intangible assets relative to total assets, have higher sales

growth, and greater profitability. The control firms tended to have lower excess market

valuations (ratios of market value of the firm to total assets that proxy for Tobin's Q), which

may be interpreted as a crude measure indicating lower market power. The record of

higher intellectual property litigation for antitrust firms is somewhat ambiguous, since it may

reflect higher valued patents, or greater competitiveness in defending or enforcing the firm's

intellectual property. The latter might be related to anticompetitive strategies, but the

negligible simple correlation (Table 2) between the proxy for market power and litigation

does not support the idea that intellectual property litigation is related to market
dominance.

       Figure 3 is consistent with the idea that antitrust firms are more innovative with

regard to patenting compared to the general population of firms, since their record of
average annual patent grants is consistently higher. Although there is still a lot of noise in

the time series of average annual patents granted, a declining trend was followed by a recent

surge in patents granted to antitrust firms charged in the 1990s. This could be due to the

increase in the importance of technology-intensive industries relative to total economic

output, or to greater antitrust attention being paid to firms or industries that are more
innovative. The former hypothesis seems more plausible since the matched sample
experiences similar patterns in patenting. Because firms are matched by industry, these data

reveal within industry variation in antitrust activity rather than intermdustry differences.

However, Table 3 indicates an increase in the number of firms charged with antitrust
violations in the chemical, pharmaceutical, computer and machinery, and professional and

scientific equipment industries, industries which are generally regarded as more
technologically innovative. In order to explore the relationship between patenting and

antitrust, it is useful to further examine the factors that influence patenting at the firm level.

       Table 4 reports the results of OLS regressions with the log of the five year patent

stock as the dependent variable. Patenting shows a downward trend, and is significantly

higher for larger firms and for firms that were involved in antitrust. However, apart from

size, none of the market power variables is significant. Separate regressions for firms of

small, medium and large size (not reported) indicate that much of the patenting by smaller

firms appears to be non-firm specific, for only 10 percent of variation in their patenting is

explained by the independent variables, compared to 55-66 percent for medium firms.
Higher research and development is associated with higher patenting, with significantly

positive coefficients on current R&D and the second R&D lagged term (although the

significance of the second term falls when total assets is included), suggesting that patents

in these firms may tend to arise early in the development stage. The relationship between

patenting and R&D appears to be non-linear, since the coefficient on the squared R&D

term is positive and significant. However, the latter result does not hold when the

regression is estimated over antitrust firms alone. It is interesting that the R&D coefficients

are more important for the control sample, probably due to greater variation across the

non-antitrust firms unobserved by measurement error.

       As is generally found, firms in the chemical, metal, automobile, computer and

communications, and professional equipment industries experience higher patenting relative
to those in traditional industries such as lumber, paper products, food and textiles, but

industry effects do not add much explanatory power to the equation. The second part of

the table reports regressions that allow coefficients to vary across both samples. As
suggested by the simple statistics, the total assets or firm size elasticity of patenting is twice

as high for the antitrust firms. Interindustry differences in patenting are evident across the

samples, since companies in the control sample operating in the petroleum, automobile,
computer and communications, chemical and pharmaceutical industries are not particularly

prolific in terms of patent ownership. In sum, these results are consistent with the idea that

antitrust firms tend to be larger and more innovative than other members of their industry

who were not the subject of antitrust charges. The next section considers whether the
likelihood of antitrust litigation varies with the degree of innovation.



IV. ANTITRUST AND INNOVATION: EMPIRICAL RESULTS

Previous sections presented data and cases that indicate an increase over time in the

importance of federal government antitrust charges relative to private cases. The recent

attention of federal agencies to high technology firms also raised the possibility that the

significance of patent/antitrust issues has increased since 1970. An examination of simple


                                               13
statistics on patenting seems to suggest that firms with higher patenting records are more

likely to face charges of violating antitrust laws. However, these findings did not control for

other factors that might influence antitrust litigation, such as profitability, advertising, and

size of the firm. Therefore, in this section I use the firm level dataset described above to

present multivariate analyses of factors that may influence the probability that a corporation

will be involved in antitrust litigation. The major hypothesis being tested is whether firms

with higher patenting profiles are more likely to experience antitrust litigation after
controlling for other factors that might influence antitrust scrutiny.

       Official reports by the federal antitrust agencies correctly point out that firms have

rarely been charged directly with antitrust violations based on patent issues. However, the

pattern in Figure 4 suggests that the issue is worth exploring further. The data were
obtained from a search of the Lexis-Nexis federal lawsuits files (GENFED/OMNI) and

include both private and federal government antitrust cases. I selected all lawsuits in which

the words patent and antitrust occurred at least six times as an index of patent-antitrust

cases, and computed the ratio of this index to all cases in which "antitrust" appeared at least

six times (the patterns are not especially sensitive to the frequency chosen). The figure

suggests that there was a decline in the importance of patent and antitrust issues until the

middle of the 1970s, and a sharp increase thereafter until at least 1993. This is consistent

with the fact that, at the same time that patent legislation guarded the rights of patentees

against infringing competitors, a number of landmark restraint of trade lawsuits that
involved technological innovators were being brought in these years.27

       Table 5 reports logit regressions that were estimated first across all finns, then by

size of firm. The dependent variable is a binary variable which has a value of 0 if the firm

had not been involved in an antitrust case since 1950, and 1 if the firm had been charged

by federal agencies between 1970 and the present. Coefficients are interpreted as the effect

of a one unit change in the independent variable on the log of the odds of antitrust
litigation. I use the log of R&D and patent stock to investigate the relationship between

innovation and antitrust. Interestingly, research and development expenditures do not affect

the likelihood of an antitrust action being brought against the firm, which suggests that

innovative inputs are not as important as outputs such as patents, perhaps because the
impact on market share of engaging in R&D is negligible or not discernible!

       Antitrust ruling regarding patent stocks is quite clear: "Mere accumulation of patents,

no matter how many, is not in and of itself illegal," United States v. United Shoe Machinery

Corp., 110 F. Supp. 295 (D. Mass. 1953). United Shoe was found guilty because of its

questionable business practices, not because of its extensive patent holdings. In the absence

of anticompetitive behaviour, we should therefore find no relationship between patent stocks

and the likelihood of antitrust charges. However, the patent stock coefficient is consistently

positive and significant, and is likewise not sensitive to outliers, nor to variations in the

sample size or time period. Given the relationship between firm size and patenting, it is

important to control for the former, and several different specifications were tried. When

we control for firm size the magnitude of the patent coefficient falls noticeably, but the

variable remains statistically significant across all alternative specifications.29

       The regressions also attempt to control for the influence of intangible assets and of

market power through a number of proxies. Capital intensity and accounting measures of

intangible assets were not influential, and thus are not included in the reported regression.

A standard proxy is advertising expenditures, which are positively related to the likelihood

of antitrust charges. Firms with faster growth in sales are also more likely to be the subject

of antitrust investigations. Rapid sales growth and excess market value may signal the
presence of market power through innovation or in the form of rents to firm-specific assets.

The results indicate that firms with higher sales growth and excess market values are more

likely to be involved in antitrust, although the inclusion of both variables reduces the overall

explanatory power of the regression.
       The relationship between antitrust and innovation might vary depending on
interactions between independent variables and firm size, but inclusion of interaction terms

reduces the reliability of estimates because of collinearity. The second section of the table

therefore shows separate regressions for smaller firms (those with real total assets below

$500 million) and medium firms (assets between $500 million and $1000 million). Similar

patterns to those reported above hold for medium firms, except for the lack of influence of

sales growth on the likelihood of antitrust charges. Patenting by smaller firms is not related

to antitrust involvement (although this result only holds for a subset of this class).30
Advertising intensity is also not influential, but smaller firms with faster sales growth or

higher excess market values are more likely to attract antitrust attention.

       If it is indeed true that innovative or successful enterprises face a higher likelihood

of antitrust litigation, one might expect that such firms would respond by changing the rate

and direction of their inventive activity. This is a difficult issue to determine empirically,

but some evidence is available in the area of R&D alliances. Thus, the next section provides


                                              16
 another perspective on the relationship between antitrust policies and innovation. For, it
 examines the filing of research joint ventures and concludes that innovative businesses seem

to perceive and even overestimate the likelihood of charges or convictions under antitrust
laws.



V. COOPERATIVE RESEARCH AND ANTITRUST



The National Cooperative Research Act (1984) and the National Cooperative Research and

Production Act (NCRPA, 1993) were approved because policy makers were concerned
about the role of antitrust in the declining competitiveness of American technology relative

to foreign firms that seemed to benefit from research consortia.31 Commentators explicitly

opined that technological innovation would be enhanced if collaboration in R&D
endeavours were freed from the inhibition of possible antitrust liabilities, and pointed to

longstanding Japanese and European laws which grant such joint ventures antitrust
exemptions. Thus, the NCRPA was "designed to promote research and development,
encourage innovation, stimulate trade, and make necessaiy and appropriate modifications in

the operation of the antitrust laws."32 The acts clarified the antitrust implications of R&D

joint ventures, and offered relief from costs and fees in unsuccessful antitrust actions. They

also recommended the application of the rule of reason to all joint ventures, although the

incremental benefit of such a provision is arguably minimal relative to existing policy.

Further, joint ventures that filed a notification with the antitrust agencies were sheltered

from the recovery of treble damages in private and state antitrust lawsuits, because the


                                             17
statute limited liability in such cases to single damages. These modifications were
apparently motivated by the "overdrawn yet real perception in the business community that

the antitrust laws generally discourage all collaborative activity."33 This section considers

the membership of NCRPA joint ventures that registered with the DOJ, and is based on

unpublished reports that the DOJ presents annually to the Committee on the Judiciary.

       A total of 609 joint ventures were filed with the DOJ between 1985 and 1996. Of

these, 124 joint R&D ventures were formed between 1985 and 1988, and some 200 ventures

registered between 1988 and 1993. Approximately 250 R&D cooperative associations

registered under the 1993 statute between June 1993 and 1996. The most recent report for

1996 to 1997 indicates that 63 new R&D joint ventures registered over the period, while 55

existing ventures updated the status of their membership or activities. Thus the NCRPA

has been associated with rapid growth in the formation of research consortia and/or the

propensity to register these associations formally to obtain lower private antitrust damages.

The responsiveness of innovative firms to a statute that in effect only offers protection from

treble damages seems to suggest an extremely high perceived probability of charges and
conviction incident on participation in joint ventures. The number of filings with the DOJ

is therefore consistent with the idea that businesses perceive some degree of conflict
between antitrust and innovation.

       Table 6 presents descriptive statistics for a cross-section of joint ventures filed in

three years, which was assembled as part of a separate and more detailed study of the

effects of the NCRPA. European joint ventures tend to be concentrated in the high
technology areas of chemicals, biotechnology, information technology and new materials

hardware and software). The majority of these NCRPA firms were American corporations

from the Midwest region (in consortia largely related to automotive research) and the West,

although the DOJ reports participation by representatives from over 30 foreign countries.

A number of joint ventures included partnerships between universities and corporations,

such as the 1996 'Blue Band II Consortium" to develop semiconductor laser diodes, which

included among its members Hewlett Packard, Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, SDL mc,

Boston University, MIT, and the Universities of New Mexico, Texas, and Utah.

       It is undoubtedly true that firms collaborate in research for a number of reasons

besides antitrust considerations. For instance, they may benefit from complementarities in

knowledge and other inputs, from economies of scale, the internalization of spillovers, risk

sharing and access to other markets. However, these are reasons for engaging in shared

endeavours rather than for registration with the federal antitrust agencies. It is possible to

gain some insight into the link between antitrust enforcement and the tendency to register

joint R&D activities by considering the antitrust history of member firms. I therefore
analyzed the federal antitrust records of a random sample of member firms that filed under

the NCRPA. As Table 6 indicates, almost one third of the sample had been charged with

antitrust violations by either the DOJ or the FTC. Hence, the perception by innovative

businesses that collaborations would likely attract antitrust scrutiny may not be greatly


                                             19
"overdrawn" given their past experience.
       Antitrust agencies and federal courts over the years have undoubtedly modified their

attitude towards technologically motivated alliances in relation to trade restraint.34
Nevertheless, there have been several prominent cases recently of firms jointly charged with

antitrust violations that are linked to patent based market power and to concerns about

"innovation markets".35 This is most clearly shown in the prominent role that patents and

R&D have played in recent mergers under section 7 of the Clayton Act, administered by

the FTC. The FTC challenged the proposed Roche and Genentech merger in 1990 and

required Roche to license its patents on therapeutics for growth hormone deficiency to third

parties. Similarly, in 1994 the VFC was troubled by the technological implications of a

merger between Sensormatic Electronics and the Knogo Corporation, both of which
produce electronic surveillance source labels to protect against shoplifting.36 The two firms

planned to grant each other royalty free cross-licences and to share trade secrets. The FTC

claimed that the agreement would lessen competition, and the market was unlikely to attract

entry "because of patent protection for important technology and the time required to
develop the requisite technical skills to compete." Moreover, the merger would serve to

"increase the likelihood that firms in the relevant market will restrict output of research and

development both in the near future and in the long term." The consent decree prohibited

Sensormatic from acquiring patents belonging to Knogo, and imposed a ten year ban on

Sensormatic's purchasing similar patents. The Sensormatic case treated patented
technologies as products, without considering the increase in net social welfare that might

accrue if firms formed joint ventures for the purpose of sharing knowledge and expertise,


                                              20
and avoiding duplicative efforts.
       The majority of current patent-antitrust cases arise in the context of proposed
mergers and acquisitions, rather than in the context of predatory behaviour or per se illegal

actions. Consent decrees in these cases typically require a combination of technology
divestures, compulsory licensing, and even the forced sharing of trade secrets to ensure that

competitors are able to acquire the capability to effectively use the technology.37 In Wright

Medical Technology, the VFC ordered the firm to transfer patents, trade secrets and

business know-how related to orthopaedic finger implants to the Mayo Foundation.38 The

agency further stipulated that the latter should be able to sublicense these assets in
perpetuity, and that Wright Medical was then required to provide technical assistance to the

Mayo sublicensee (a future competitor of Wright).



VI. CONCLUSION

The issue of interactions between patenting, innovation and antitrust enforcement has

generated a longstanding debate typically supported by references to case studies. This

paper was motivated by the marked lack of empirical attention paid to the issue of patenting

in relation to antitrust actions brought by federal government agencies. I outlined patterns

of aggregate antitrust activity, which indicated a fall in both private and government

antitrust litigation, but an increase in the relative importance of government actions. A

rough estimate of the frequency of patent-antitrust interactions suggested an increase since

1970, which could be due to the greater economic importance of technology intensive

industries, or to greater government scrutiny of innovative firms. It seems plausible that


                                             21
firm specific effects would explain a greater part of the variation in antitrust charges than

industry effects, so my sample was constructed to examine within-industry variation.

       The major finding of the empirical analysis is that patent stocks are associated with

higher likelihood of antitrust charges for medium and larger firms. Smaller firms with faster

sales growth, possibly an index of greater success, are also likely to sustain greater antitrust

litigation. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that innovative, successful
enterprises are more likely to garner antitrust attention, especially since recent FTC rulings

express concern about protecting competition in the "market for innovation". These findings

may also explain the previous reluctance of firms to engage in research alliances because

of fears of antitrust charges. However, the results do not control for other elements of firm

strategy that might be correlated with patenting behaviour and sales growth. For instance,

the evidence on intellectual property litigation could be taken as an indication that
innovative firms might be more aggressive in their pursuit of market share. Such firms

might also have a greater tendency to engage in anticompetitive behaviour.

       Additional research could be directed towards providing more information on the

nature of the charges brought, since the implications of the findings would differ in the case

of (say) merger challenges relative to price fixing charges. In further work I intend to
consider directly the nature of antitrust cases that involve patent issues, and to examine the

antitrust and innovation implications of NCRPA filings more extensively. It would also be

interesting to exp]ore differences in innovation policies between the FTC and DOJ. For

instance, I conducted interviews with officials at both agencies whose comments implied that

the FTC is more likely to bring a charge at the instigation of market rivals (it was argued


                                              22
that private firms can at times act as surrogate Attorneys General), whereas the DOJ selects

cases that are likely to be economically important and precedent setting.

                                B. CONTROL SAMPLE

The antitrust sample was randomly matched by year and 4-digit SIC code with a control

sample. Each antitrust firm was allocated to an industry based on the product market that

was the subject of the antitrust charge. Hence, the product market was not necessarily the

firm's main line of business. I obtained a list of firms on Compu stat that were in that

product market in the same year as the charge. Next, these firms were checked against

antitrust records on Lexis/Nexis, and those that had been involved in federal antitrust

actions in the previous twenty years were eliminated. The final filter was to exclude those

firms for which Compustat did not have any data for the years in question.

2. "Patentees are not monopolists ... A monopolist is one who, by the exercise of the
sovereign power, takes from the public that which belongs to it, and gives to the grantee and
his assigns an exclusive use. On this ground monopolies are justly odious ... Under the
patent law this can never be done. No exclusive right can be granted for anything which the
patentee has not invented or discovered. If he claim anything which was before known, his
patent is void, so that the law repudiates a monopoly. The right of the patentee rests
entirely on his invention or discoveiy of that which is useful, and which was not known
before. And the law gives him the exclusive use of the thing invented or discovered, for a
few years, as a compensation for 'his ingenuity, labor, and expense in producing it.' This,
then, in no sense partakes of the character of a monopoly." Allen v. Hunter, 6 McLean 303

presumed that such property creates market power of the sort deprecated by antitrust laws;
and they will ratify licensing agreements that generate economic benefits and further
consumer welfare.

11. Predatory innovation can include price fixing, prohibitive clauses in licences,
unreasonable royalty terms, restricting competitors, and tying arrangements; there is some
question as to whether it includes stockpiling patents that were purchased from others
outside the firm in order to deter competitors. Ordover & Willig, An Economic Definition
of Predation: Pricing and Product Innovation, 91 YALE L.J. 8 (1981), p. 8, argue that "even
genuine innovations -- new products that in some ways are superior to existing products in
the eyes of both engineers and consumers -- are in some circumstances anticompetitive."

16. Consent decrees were first used in 1906 to record antitrust settlements. A consent
decree is an adjudicated agreement negotiated by the federal authorities and the defendant
in civil antitrust lawsuits. The decree must be accepted by the courts to be in "the public
interest" and is as legally binding as a judgment after a formal lawsuit. The agreement
typically carries no presumption of guilt on the part of the defendant. The majority of
federal antitrust cases are terminated by a consent decree rather than a judgement froma
formal trial in court.

18. When there were multiple defendants, the sample selected only the first name
mentioned in the list of defendants for each charge. The control sample was inspected to
ensure that it did not include any of these other defendants in the case.

19. Inventive activity is typically measured by inputs into the technology production function
such as research and development, or by outputs such as patented inventions. This is not
identical to the concept of innovation, which refers to commercialization. However, I follow
accepted practice by measuring innovation in terms of R&D and patenting.
20. I enclose this term in quotation marks because the general interpretation does not fully
capture the subtleties of Schumpeter's analysis. For an empirical approach to Schumpeter's
model, see Scherer (1984).

25. See for instance, Dawson Chemical Co. v. Rohm & Haas, 448 U.S. 176, 215 (1980),
which refers to the "long-settled view that the essence of a patent grant is the right to
exclude ohters from profiting by the patented invention." United Shoe Mach. Corp. v.
O'Donnell Rubber Products, 84 F. 2d. 383, 386 (1936): "it has long been settled that ... it
is the privilege of any owner of property to use or not use it without question of motive."
26. Patents are clearly imperfect indicators of both inventive activity and innovation, because
of well known defects such as the fact that many inventions are not patented, variation in
the propensity to patent over time and across industries, fluctuations in the proportion of
applications that are granted, and the high fraction of patents that are useless. However,
many interesting and important findings have been associated with the analysis of patent
data, including a strong relationship between patenting and productivity. See Griliches
(1990) for a comprehensive discussion of the utility of patent statistics in the study of
technological and economic change.

27. Burchfiel (1991) points out that "Significant departures from existing antitrust criteria
have been required both in the definition of substitutes and the relevant product market for
patented technology" and "A common misconception has been that a patent or copyright,
                                             28
 a high market share, or a unique product that competitors are not able to offer suffices to
 demonstrate market power." The DOJ Antitrust Guide stated that patent pools require
 "particular scrutiny under the antitrust laws," (cited in U.S. v. Motor Vehicle Manuf. Assoc.
 of USA, 1982).
28. It might seem plausible to use a direct measure of market share; however market share
data are likely to be of limited use since the data would require information on the share
of firm's sales in the antitrust market, whereas most firms operate in several markets, and
separate data are not available for the firm's sales in each market.

29. This result might valy depending on interactions between patenting and firm size, but
inclusion of interaction terms reduces the reliability of the estimates because of collinearity.
Intellectual property litigation was also significantly associated with higher antitrust
litigation, but was excluded from the reported equations because litigation was coffinear with
the patent stock.

30. The finding that patent stocks are not influential is dominated by firms with assets
between $200-$500 million. For firms with assets below $200 million there is a significantly
positive relationship between patenting and antitrust involvement.
31. See S. Rep. No. 427, 98th Congress, 2d Session 1. The National Cooperative Research
Act of 1984 related to research and development joint ventures [P.L. 98-462, 98 Stat. 1815,
cited in 15 USCS @ 4301]. It was later extended to include production joint ventures.
According to the Act June 10, 1993, P.L. 103-42, @2, 107 Stat. 117, cited in 15 USCS @
4301:
"(1) technological innovation and its profitable commercialization are critical components
of the ability of the United States to raise the living standards of Americans and to compete
in world markets.
(2) cooperative arrangements among nonaffiliated businesses in the private sector are often
essential for successful technological innovation; and procompetitive cooperative innovation
arrangements, and so clarification serves a useful purpose in helping to promote such
arrangements.
(3) Purpose. It is the purpose of this Act ... to promote innovation, facilitate trade, and
strengthen the competitiveness of the United States in world markets by clarifying the
applicability of the rule of reason standard and establishing a procedure under which
businesses may notify the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission of their
cooperative ventures and thereby qualify for a single-damages limitation on civil antitrust
liability."

32. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, 49 FR 50121, December 26 1984 (my
emphasis). The NCRA of 1984 made two primary provisions: "The first is a simple
codification of the consensus view found in existing law that properly structured joint
ventures will be judged under a rule of reason standard ... under the antitrust law... [Second]
parties to a joint venture may disclose the nature of the venture to the antitrust enforcement
agencies and thereby receive reduced damage exposure from civil suits based on the

                                             29
activities disclosed. Compliance with the reporting prcedures would not result in a
"certification" that the venture is legal under the antitrust laws; thus, even with disclosure,
a venture later shown to be anticompetitive could still be challenged through the traditional
dual system of private and public enforcement and be subject to single damages."

of the properties to be divested to utilize the properties to be divested." See also recent
cases involving General Motors, Boston Scientific, Ciba Geigy et al., Upjohn Co., and
Baxter International. A 1995 FTC consent decree related to remedies for alleged abuses
in standard setting by Dell in relation to its 481 patent, without any discussion of Dell's
market power. The consent order prohibited Dell from enforcing its 481 patent for the
remainder of its term. Hoechst's merger with Marion Merrell Dow was only permitted with
the proviso that the firm waived the right to enforce certain of its patents, divested part of
its intellectual property, and licensed others [Hoechst, C-3629, Dec. 1995]. Courts have
generally supported reasonable royalty fees in such cases, but some monopolization suits do
require defendants to issue royalty free licenses. Moreover, defendants in some consent
decrees have accepted royalty-free licensing stipulations.
