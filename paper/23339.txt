                                              ABSTRACT

What accounts for differences in output per capita and total factor productivity (TFP) across countries?
Empirical evidence points to resource misallocation across heterogeneous production units as an important
factor. We study misallocation in a general equilibrium model of establishment productivity where
the distribution of productivity is characterized in closed form and responds to the same policy distortions
that create misallocation. In this framework, policy distortions not only misallocate resources across
a given set of productive units (static effect), but also create disincentives for productivity improvement
thereby altering the productivity distribution and equilibrium prices (dynamic effect), further lowering
aggregate output and TFP. The dynamic effect is substantial contributing to a doubling of the static
misallocation effect. Reducing the dispersion in distortions by 25 percentage points to the level of
the U.S. benchmark economy implies an increasein relative aggregate output of 123 percent, where
54 percent arises from factor misallocation(static effect).

1     Introduction

A crucial question in economic growth and development is why some countries are rich and others
poor. A consensus has emerged in the literature whereby the large differences in income per capita
across countries are mostly accounted for by differences in labor productivity and in particular total
factor productivity (TFP) (Klenow and Rodriguez-Clare, 1997; Prescott, 1998; Hall and Jones,
1999). Hence, a key question is: what accounts for differences in TFP across countries? An
important channel that has been emphasized is the (mis)allocation of factors across heterogeneous
production units.1 We study factor misallocation in a model where establishment-level productivity
is determined endogenously. In this framework, policy distortions not only misallocate resources
across a given set of productive units (static effect), but also create disincentives for productivity
improvement (dynamic effect) thereby affecting the productivity distribution across establishments
and equilibrium prices in the economy, further contributing to lower aggregate output and TFP.

A recent branch of the literature has emphasized the dynamic implications of misallocation by
considering variants of the growth model with establishment-level productivity dynamics.2 We
build on this literature by developing a general equilibrium model of establishment productivity
where the distribution of productivity is characterized in closed form as a function of the economic
environment which is affected by policy distortions. In our framework, not only there is a tight
mapping between abstract policy distortions and the empirical counterparts of dispersion in revenue
products and factor misallocation, but also compared to the model with an exogenous distribution of
productivity, the effect on aggregate output of empirically-plausible policy distortions is substantial.
For instance, in our framework, the output gain from reducing the standard deviation of log revenue
productivity (TFPR) from 0.74 to 0.49 in the benchmark economy is 123%, substantially larger than

the 54% gain from reduced factor misallocation (static effect). These effects in the model compare
to the magnitudes of factor misallocation reported for 1998 China in Hsieh and Klenow (2009) and
the actual gap in productivity between China and the United States. Moreover, our analytical
solution of the distribution of productivity and how is affected by distortions can potentially be
useful in empirical applications of dynamic misallocation across countries using panel micro data,
an essential issue in the misallocation literature (Restuccia and Rogerson, 2017).

We develop a general equilibrium framework with heterogeneous production units that builds on
Hopenhayn (1992) and Restuccia and Rogerson (2008). The framework is a standard neoclassical
growth model with production heterogeneity extended to incorporate the dynamic implications of
distortions on the distribution of establishment-level productivity. We use this framework to study
the impact of policy distortions on misallocation and aggregate output and measured TFP. The key
elements of the model are on the production side. In each period, there is a single good produced in
establishments. Establishments are heterogeneous with respect to total factor productivity and have
access to a decreasing returns to scale technology with capital and labor as inputs. Establishments
are subject to an exogenous exit rate but differently from the standard framework, the distribution
of establishment-level productivity is not exogenous, rather it is determined by establishment’s
decisions. In other words, productivity of establishments is determined endogenously in the model
by the properties of the economic environment such as policy distortions.

Following the literature, the economy faces policy distortions which, for simplicity, take the form
of output taxes on individual producers. That is, each producer faces an idiosyncratic tax and it
is the properties of policy distortions that generate misallocation in the model. Revenues collected
from these taxes are rebated back to the households as a lump-sum transfer. We emphasize that
the output distortions we consider are abstract representations (catch all) of the myriad of implicit
and explicit distortions faced by individual producers. While the literature has made substantial
progress in identifying the specific policies and institutions that create misallocation—as discussed
in Restuccia and Rogerson (2017)—the emphasis in our paper is on the dynamic consequences of
misallocation created by all the distortions on the productivity distribution in the economy. As

                                                 3
a result, our paper represents a general quantitative assessment of the broader consequences of
misallocation.

We provide an analytical solution of this model in continuous time. In particular, we solve in
closed form for the stationary distribution of establishments which is an endogenous object that
varies across economies. We show the equilibrium productivity distribution is a Pareto distribution
with tail index that depends on policy distortions and on the response of incumbent establishments
to distortions when selecting the growth rate of productivity. This allows us to characterize the
behavior of aggregate output and TFP across distortionary policy configurations as well as the
size and productivity growth rate of establishments, the size distribution of establishments, among
other statistics of interest. The analytical solution of the productivity distribution also allows us to
decompose analytically the static and dynamic effects of misallocation.

To explore the quantitative properties of the model relative to the existing literature, we calibrate
the model and provide a set of relevant quantitative experiments. We consider a benchmark economy
with distortions that is calibrated to data for the United States. The key calibrated parameters
in our analysis are the curvature in the cost function for productivity growth, the variance in the
distribution of productivity, and the growth rate of establishment size, which are targeted to data on
the aggregate growth rate of TFP, the average employment growth of establishments, and the right
tail index of the share of employment distribution in the U.S. data. We then perform quantitative
analysis by exploring the implications of increased distortions for aggregate output and TFP.

Our main result is that policy distortions generate substantial negative effects on aggregate output
and TFP, roughly doubling the effect of static misallocation—that is doubling the effect of distor-
tions in a model with an exogenous distribution of productivity. In particular, reducing distortions
in an economy by 25 percentage points to the dispersion in the U.S. benchmark economy, implies
an increase in aggregate output of 123%, where about one half of this increase is due to improved
factor allocation and the remaining half due to an improved productivity distribution. In this econ-
omy, the growth rate of establishment productivity and employment is less than half of that in the



                                                   4
benchmark economy. Hence, reducing distortions to the benchmark roughly doubles the growth
rate of establishments in this economy. These effects are broadly consistent with some evidence
that in more distorted economies the productivity and employment growth of establishments are
lower (e.g., Hsieh and Klenow, 2014) and with some evidence that when distortions are removed,
the growth rate of establishments increases (e.g., Pavcnik, 2002; Bustos, 2011).

Our paper is related to a large literature on misallocation and productivity discussed earlier. The
literature has emphasized various separate channels such as life-cycle investment of plants, human
capital accumulation of managers, experimentation, step-by-step innovation, selection, among many
others; and different contexts such as trade and labor policies, financial frictions, and specific sectors.
We complement this literature by developing a general model of establishment growth featuring a
distribution of establishment productivity that can be characterized in closed form. This theoretical
characterization is important for our quantitative analysis of policy distortions because it allows
us to tractably separate the role of changes in the productivity distribution and equilibrium prices
(dynamic effect) from factor misallocation (static effect) in accounting for aggregate output and
TFP differences. More importantly, our theoretical characterization can be useful in developing
methods to estimate the role of dynamic misallocation using panel data of firms, and hence we
hope our analysis can facilitate more empirical applications.

Two closely related papers to ours are Hsieh and Klenow (2014) and Bento and Restuccia (2017).
Hsieh and Klenow (2014) consider the model of establishment innovation in Atkeson and Burstein
(2010) to emphasize the life-cycle growth of establishments and its response to distortions, whereas
Bento and Restuccia (2017) emphasize both entry productivity and life-cycle growth. We em-
phasize two key distinctions with our work. First, in these papers entering establishments draw
their productivity from an exogenous and constant distribution across countries, whereas the en-
tire productivity distribution is a key equilibrium object in our framework that responds to policy
distortions. Second, we differ in the tools used to characterize the economy, in particular, we solve
analytically for the entire distribution of productivity using continuous time and Brownian motion
processes. These tools are increasingly popular in the growth literature allowing both a tighter

                                                    5
theoretical characterization and more efficient computation (e.g., Lucas and Moll, 2014; Benhabib
et al., 2014; Buera and Oberfield, 2014). More closely linked, these tools were prominently used in
the seminal work of Luttmer (2007) to study the size distribution of establishments in the United
States (see also Da-Rocha and Pujolas, 2011; Fattal, 2014; Gourio and Roys, 2014).

The paper proceeds as follows. In the next section we present the details of the model and Section 3
characterizes the equilibrium solution. In Section 4, we characterize aggregate output and measured
TFP. Section 5 calibrates a benchmark economy with distortions to U.S. data. In Section 6, we
perform a series of quantitative experiments to assess the impact of increased policy distortions on
aggregate output, TFP, and other relevant statistics. We conclude in Section 7.




2    Economic Environment

We consider a standard version of the neoclassical growth model with producer heterogeneity as
in Restuccia and Rogerson (2008). We extend this framework to allow establishments to invest in
their productivity. As as a result, with on-going entry and exit of establishments, the framework
generates an invariant distribution of productivity across establishments associated with the eco-
nomic environment that may differ across countries. Time is continuous and the horizon is infinite.
Establishments have access to a decreasing return to scale technology, pay a one-time fixed cost of
entry, and die at an exogenous rate. Establishments hire labor and rent capital services in compet-
itive markets. New entrants enter with a level of productivity ze which is endogenous. We focus
on a stationary equilibrium of this model and study the effects of idiosyncratic policy distortions
on the allocation of factors across establishments. In this framework, policy distortions also affect
establishment’s decisions regarding their productivity growth, and hence the stationary distribution
of productivity across establishments, aggregate output, and measured TFP. In what follows we
describe the economic environment in more detail.




                                                 6
2.1    Baseline Model

There is an infinity-lived representative household with preferences over consumption goods de-
scribed by the utility function,
                                                  Z   +∞
                                            max            e−ρt u(c)dt,
                                                  0

where c is consumption and ρ is the discount rate. The household is endowed with one unit of
productive time at each instant and k0 > 0 units of the capital stock at date 0.

The unit of production in the economy is the establishment. Each establishment is described by
a production function f (z, k, n) that combines capital services k and labor services n to produce
output. The function f is assumed to exhibit decreasing returns to scale in capital and labor jointly
and to satisfy the usual Inada conditions. The production function is given by:


                  y = z θ(1−α−γ) k α nγ ,   α, γ ∈ (0, 1),      0 < γ + α < 1,   θ > 1,           (1)


where establishment productivity z is stochastic but establishments can invest in upgrading their
productivity at a cost and θ is a scaling parameter for TFP. Note that establishment TFP is
z θ(1−α−γ) and hence θ affects the units in which establishment productivity z is measured. Scaling
productivity by θ is convenient for algebraic manipulations below as this parameter also represents
the curvature in the cost function of establishment productivity growth. Establishments also face
an exogenous probability of death λ.

New establishments can also be created. Entrants must pay an entry cost ce measured in units
of output and as in the literature the expected value of entry satisfies the zero profit condition in
equilibrium. Feasibility in the model requires:


                                            C + I + Q = Y − E,


where C is aggregate consumption, I is aggregate investment in physical capital, Q is aggregate



                                                           7
cost of investing in establishment productivity, E is the aggregate cost of entry, and Y is aggregate
output.



2.2    Policy Distortions

We introduce policies that create idiosyncratic distortions to establishment-level decisions as in
Restuccia and Rogerson (2008). We model these distortions as idiosyncratic output taxes but
none of our results are critically dependent on the particular source of distortions. While the
policies we consider are hypothetical, there is a large empirical literature documenting the extent
of idiosyncratic distortions across countries and our framework allows for a tight mapping between
the distortions and empirical observations (e.g., Hsieh and Klenow, 2009; Bartelsman et al., 2013;
Restuccia and Rogerson, 2017).

In our framework, distortions not only affect the allocation of resources across existing production
units, but also the growth rate of establishment productivity, thereby affecting the distribution of
productive units in the economy. Specifically, we assume that each establishment faces its own
policy distortion (idiosyncratic distortions) reflected as an output tax rate τy . In what follows, for
                                                                                    1
simplicity in our algebraic expressions we rewrite distortions as τ = (1 − τy ) θ(1−α−γ) . Note that this
transformation implies that an establishment with no distortions τy = 0 faces τ = 1, whereas a
positive output tax τy > 0 implies τ < 1 and an output subsidy τy < 0 implies τ > 1.

In order to generate dispersion in distortions across productive units, we assume that τ follows a
standard stochastic process, a Geometric Brownian motion,


                                        dτ = µτ τ dt + στ τ dwτ ,


where µτ is the drift, στ is the standard deviation and dwτ is the standard Wiener process of the
Brownian motion. In this specification στ controls the dispersion of distortions across producers
and hence the dispersion in marginal revenue products that is restricted to data. As noted earlier,


                                                   8
our specification of distortions is reduced form and abstract, simply standing in for the myriad
of policies and institutions that effectively create dispersion in individual producer prices (e.g.,
Restuccia and Rogerson, 2008; Buera et al., 2013).

Establishment’s productivity z follows a Geometric Brownian motion and establishments can invest
in upgrading their productivity by choosing the drift of the Brownian motion µz that is determined
in equilibrium, establishment productivity follows:


                                        dz = µz zdt + σz zdwz ,


where σz is the standard deviation and dwz is the standard Wiener process of the Brownian motion.
We assume that the output tax and productivity can be correlated, that is E(dwτ , dwz ) = ρτ,z ∈
(−1, 0]. Note that a negative value of ρτ,z , corresponds to correlated distortions, as in Restuccia
and Rogerson (2008), whereby distortions impact more heavily on more productive establishments.

At the time of entry, the establishment-entry distortion τe is known and establishments enter with
a productivity ze that is determined in equilibrium and implies an expected value of entrants that
satisfies the zero profit condition. In this economy, the relevant information for establishment’s
decisions is the joint distribution over productivity and distortions. We denote this joint distribution
by g(z, τ ).

A given distribution of establishment-level distortion and productivity may not lead to a balanced
budget for the government. As a result, we assume that budget balance is achieved by either lump-
sum taxation or redistribution to the representative household. We denote the lump-sum tax by
T.



3     Equilibrium

We focus on a stationary equilibrium of this economy. The stationary equilibrium is characterized
by an invariant distribution of establishments g(z, τ ) over productivity z and distortion τ and an

                                                   9
entry productivity ze . In the stationary equilibrium, the rental price for labor and capital services
are constant and we denote them by w and r. Before defining the stationary equilibrium formally,
it is useful to consider the decision problems faced by incumbents, entrants, and consumers. We
describe these problems in turn.



3.1    Incumbent establishments

Incumbent establishments maximize the present value of profits by making static and dynamic
decisions. The static problem is to choose the amount of capital and labor services, whereas the
dynamic problem involves solving for the drift in establishment productivity. We now describe these
problems in detail.


Static problem At any instant of time an establishment chooses how much capital to rent k and
how much labor to hire n. These decisions are static and depend on the establishment’s productivity
z, the establishment’s distortion τ , the rental rate of capital r, and the wage rate w. Formally, the
instant profit function π(z, τ ) is defined by:


                              π(z, τ ) = max(τ z)θ(1−α−γ) k α nγ − wn − rk,
                                         k,n



from which we obtain the optimal demand for labor and capital:

                                              r       w

For future reference, we redefine instant profits as a function of the optimal demand for factors:


                                         π(z, τ ) = m(w, r)z θ τ θ ,                              (4)

on equilibrium prices. Note that since factor demands are linear in (zτ )θ , we find it convenient
to define size s as s ≡ (zτ )θ so that factor demands are proportional to size s. A key insight of
the misallocation literature is that the relationship between size and productivity is fundamentally
affected by distortions.


Dynamic problem Incumbent establishments choose the drift of their productivity µz . The
cost of investing in productivity is expressed in units of output, described by a cost function q(·)
                                                                                                      θ
that is increasing and convex in the productivity drift, specifically we assume q(µz ) = cµ (zτ )θ µθz ,
where θ controls the convexity of the cost function and cµ is a common scale parameter. The cost
function is also scaled by establishment size s which implies that all establishments choose the
same productivity drift as we discuss below. The optimal decision of productivity improvement is
characterized by maximizing the present value of profits subject to the Brownian motion governing

In the following Lemma 1 we characterize formally the endogenous productivity drift.

Lemma 1. Given a distortion τ , a productivity level z, and operating profits m(w, r), the value
function that solves the establishment dynamic problem is given by W (z, τ ) = A(w, r)τ θ z θ , and the
expected growth rate of establishment’s productivity z follows Gibrat’s law:


                                                  1

                                                                                          h
where A(w, r) is the solution of the polynomial in equation (A.1) and µz (w, r) = θA(w,r)  θ − 1.
                                                                                    cµ



Proof See Appendix A.1.

The implication of Lemma 1 is that the growth rate of productivity of individual establishments
does not depend on the intrinsic characteristics of the establishment, that is, it does not depend on
the establishment productivity z or the distortion τ so Gibrat’s law holds. We recognize that there
is some debate as to whether Gibrat’s law holds empirically, however, we note that this implication
of the model implies a more muted negative effect of distortions on output, making our quantitative
results conservative in this context. Atkeson and Burstein (2010) develop a model of firm-level
innovation with the same property, whereas Bhattacharya et al. (2013) and Hsieh and Klenow
(2014) consider environments where distortions create idiosyncratic effects across establishments.
While Lemma 1 implies that the endogenous productivity drift is constant across establishments,
the drift can differ across economies with different policy distortions if distortions affect equilibrium
wages, and this is a key element in our quantitative analysis.

Employment, which is proportional to distortions and productivity n ∝ (zτ )θ , also follows Gibrat’s
law, and the resulting Brownian motion of s = (zτ )θ is given by:

                                                                    

          s                                            2

where the drift µs is equal µs = θ (µz (w, r) + µτ + θσz στ ρτ,z ) + θ(θ−1)
                                                                        2
                                                                            (σz2 + στ2 ). In this environment,

                                                     12
policy distortions affect productivity growth and employment growth differently. Employment is
impacted by distortions directly through the dispersion of distortions στ and its correlation with
productivity ρτ,z , and indirectly through changes in productivity growth µz (w, r).



3.2    Entering establishments

Potential entering establishments face an entry cost ce in units of output and make their entry
decision knowing the output entering tax level τe . For tractability, we assume that entrants enter
with the same level of expected productivity, denoted by ze . The initial level of productivity is such
that the value of entering establishments satisfies the usual zero profit condition:


                                         We = W (ze , τe ) − ce .


Note that such a value of productivity ze exists and is unique which follows from the fact that
the value of entry We inherits the properties of the value of incumbent establishments which is
increasing in productivity z. In addition, in the special case where the model is deterministic, the
value of entering is the same as in Restuccia and Rogerson (2008), which is the establishments’
expected profit.



3.3    Stationary distribution of establishments

Given the optimal decisions of incumbents and entering establishments, we are now ready to char-
acterize the stationary distribution g(z, τ ) over productivity z and distortion τ . The first step to
characterize this distribution is to rewrite the Brownian motions of productivity z and distortion τ
as a function of s as in equation (6). In order to characterize the stationary distribution over size s,
it is useful to rewrite the model in logarithms. Let x denote the logarithm of s, that is x = log(s/se ),
where se is the size in which establishments enter. Now we can rewrite the Geometric Brownian




                                                   13
motion in equation (6) as a Brownian motion in the logarithm of s,


                                        dx = µx dt + σx dwx ,

                   1
where µx = µs − σx2 and σx2 = θ2 (σz2 + στ2 + 2σz στ ρz,τ ) . Let M (x, t) denote the number density
                   2
function of establishments, i.e. the mass of size x establishments at time t. At time t, the total
                                              Z +∞
number of establishments is equal to M (t) =        M (x, t)dx.
                                                −∞

The establishment productivity process can be modeled by a modified Kolmogorov-Fokker-Planck
equation of the form:

                  ∂M (x, t)       ∂M (x, t) σx2 ∂ 2 M (x, t)
                            = −µx          +                 − λM (x, t) + B(0, t),               (7)
                    ∂t              ∂x       2      ∂x2

where λ is the death rate of establishments and the function B(0, t) are the new establishments that
enter at time t and have size 0, after the renormalization. The solution of this problem is discussed
in Gabaix (2009), and we solve by applying Laplace Transforms methods. Da-Rocha et al. (2019)
show that the double Pareto is a particular solution in frameworks with inaction.

We are interested in a stationary distribution for the number density function, i.e. solutions that
are separable in time t and are of the form M (x, t) = M (t)f (x) and B(0, t) = M (t)bδ(x − 0), where
b is the establishment entry rate at point x = 0 and δ(·) is a Dirac delta function which is equal to
1 at the entry, normalized to zero, and is equal to zero everywhere else. Mathematically, we can
express this by using a Dirac delta function that is equal to infinity at the point on which new firms
enter and zero otherwise. Let the function b(0) be described by b̂(0) = bδ(x − 0), where δ denotes
the Dirac delta function:
                                         
                                          +∞
                                         
                                                     if   x = 0,
                                  δ(x) =
                                          0
                                                    if x 6= 0.




                                                 14
Therefore, we can rewrite the modified Kolmogorov-Fokker-Planck equation equation (7) as:

                        M 0 (t)                               σ2
                                f (x) = ηf (x) = −µx f 0 (x) + x f 00 (x) − λf (x) + bδ(x − 0),                          (8)
                        M (t)                                  2

        M 0 (t)
where   M (t)
                  is the growth rate of the mass of establishments denoted by η and M (t) = eηt M (0) in
the balanced growth path. We normalize M (0) = 1. We assume four standard boundary conditions:


                                            lim f (x) = 0,         lim f 0 (x) = 0,                                      (9)
                                        x→+∞                      x→+∞

                                            lim f (x) = 0,         lim f 0 (x) = 0,                                     (10)
                                        x→−∞                      x→−∞



and

                                                             Z   +∞
                                             f (x) ≥ 0,               f (x)dx = 1.                                      (11)
                                                              −∞



The first four boundary conditions (9) and (10) guarantee that the stationary distribution is
bounded, and equations (11) guarantee that f is a pdf. The boundary constraints restrict the
growth rate of the mass of establishments η, by integrating (8) we find:

                  +∞                                             +∞            +∞                   +∞

              Z                                                          Z                    Z
          η            f (x)dx = −µx f (x) + f (x)                    −λ            f (x)dx +            bδ(x − 0)dx,
              ∞
                                            2                    −∞        −∞                   −∞



and applying the boundary conditions and using the Dirac delta function, we find that η is equal
to:
                                                          η = b − λ,

which has a very intuitive interpretation, as it states that the growth rate of the mass of establish-
ments η is equal to the net entry rate (b − λ). After some algebraic manipulation from equation
(8), we find that the stationary distribution must satisfy the following differential equation:

                                            2µx 0       2(λ + η)          2b

                                                                 f (x) = − 2 δ(x − 0),                                  (12)

                                                             15
subject to the boundary conditions and f (·) being a pdf. We can now characterize the stationary
(log) size distribution, which is a double Pareto, with endogenous tail index, ξ, and endogenous net
entry rate, b − λ at x = 0. Formally, Lemma 2 characterizes the stationary distribution.

bution is a double Pareto:

3.4    Household’s problem

The household problem is standard and essentially help us pin down the stationary real interest rate
R. As such, the process for capital accumulation in this model follows the standard neoclassical
growth model. The stand-in household seeks to maximize lifetime utility subject to the law of
motion of wealth given by:
                                  (RK + w + T + Π − bce − c) dt,

                                                  16
where w is the wage rate, R is the is the interest rate which in equilibrium is the rental price of
capital minus capital depreciation (R = r − δk ), T is the lump-sum tax levied by the government, Π
is the total profit from the operations of all establishment, bce is the entry cost and c is consumption.

We assume that households have log utility, u(c) = log(c), and we characterize the equilibrium
interest rate by solving the household’s problem. We define total wealth as:

                                               w T Π ce b
                                     a=K+       + + −     ,
                                               R R R  R

and we rewrite the law of motion of wealth as da = (Ra − c)dt. The household solves the following
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation:


                               ρV (a) = max {log(c) + [Ra − c] V 0 (a)} .

Lemma 3 establishes that in the stationary equilibrium the interest rate R is equal to the discount
rate ρ.

3.5       Stationary equilibrium

Definition A stationary equilibrium is an invariant distribution g(·), a value function for incum-
bents {W (·)}, a policy function for new entrants {ze }, policy functions k(·), n(·), µz (·), c(·), prices
{r, w}, transfer {T }, and aggregate capital {K}, such that:


   i) Given prices and transfer, the households’ policy function {c(·)} solves the household dynamic
      problem.

  ii) Given prices, the incumbents’ policy functions {k(·), n(·)} solve the incumbents’ static prob-
      lem.



                                                   17
 iii) The incumbents’ policy function {µz (·)} together with the value function {W (·)} solve the
     incumbents’ dynamic problem.

 iv) The stationary distribution {g(·)} solve the Kolmogorov forward equation.

  v) The entering establishments’ policy function {ze } solves the free-entry condition.

 vi) Market Clearing:
                            Z   +∞

       b) Labor: 1 =             n(s, w, r)g(s)ds.

 vii) The government budget constraint is satisfied, T =                τy y(s)g(s)ds.
                                                               0


The stationary equilibrium is a fixed point in measure and it is very simple to compute. From
the household’s problem, we solve for the stationary interest rate R and hence pin down the rental
rate of capital r. From the incumbents’ static problem, we solve the labor and capital demand as
a function of prices {r, w} and policies {τ }. Given the solution of the static problem, incumbents
solve the dynamic problem of choosing a productivity drift. The solution to this problem is a
policy function {µz (·)} that determines the Geometric Brownian motion for productivity of the
entire economy. Given the Geometric Brownian motion for productivity, we solve for the stationary
distribution g(·) that solves the Kolmogorov forward equation. After solving for the stationary
distribution g(·), the entry rate at the entry size se must solve the free-entry condition, and the
markets for capital and labor must clear. Formally, µz , A, µs , se , s̄, and w are obtained by solving
the following 6 equations:

4    Aggregate Output and TFP

We characterize the impact of policy distortions on aggregate output and TFP using the well-known
concept of revenue total factor productivity TFPR, which was disseminated in the context of the
macro development literature by Hsieh and Klenow (2009). In our model, an establishment’s TFPR




                                                     19
is given by:

                                                y                 1          1
                         TFPR =                            ∝            =           ,
                                        k α/(α+γ) nγ/(α+γ)   τ θ(1−α−γ)   (1 − τy )

which is equated across all establishments in the undistorted economy. In this context, misallocation
arises from dispersion in TFPR across establishments.

Aggregate output Y is computed by integrating over the distribution of establishment’s output.
Using the establishment production function in equation (1) and substituting the demand for labor
and capital in equations (2) and (3), we obtain:

                                                                 1
                                              h α α  γ γ i 1−α−γ
                                 y(z, τ ) =                                 τ θ(α+γ) z θ ,                       (19)
                                                  r        w

where the term in square brackets is just a constant across establishments that depends on factor
prices and technology parameters. It is clear from this expression that misallocation implies that
establishment size and in particular output are affected by distortions.

Following Lyuu (2002), we use equation (19) to write aggregate output Y as:

                                             1
                          h α α  γ γ i 1−α−γ Z        +∞                Z    +∞
                                                                θ
                   Y =                                         z gz (z)dz             τ θ(α+γ) gτ (τ )dτ,
                             r      w                 0                      0



where z and τ are Geometric Brownian motions with distributions that are double Pareto. Using the
same methodology as in Lemma 2 and imposing market clearing in labor, we obtain the following
simple expression for aggregate output Y :

                                                                                                  
                               η+λ                    1                   η+λ                   se
               Y ∝                                                                                           ,   (20)
                          η + λ − µτ θ(α+γ)       (1 − τy,e )          η + λ − µz θ          s̄γ/(1−α)

where we use the fact that s = (zτ )θ and (1 − τy ) = τ θ(1−α−γ) . The first term in square brackets
arises from the distribution of distortions whereas the second term in square brackets arises from
the productivity distribution and changes in equilibrium prices. Appendix A.3 describes the explicit


                                                           20
steps of derivation.

In equation (20), we associate the expression in the first square brackets with the static output gain
from changes in misallocation, that is changes in TFPR dispersion across establishments (static
effect), and we associate the expression in the second square brackets with the dynamic output
gain from eliminating distortions via changes in the distribution of establishment productivity
and changes in equilibrium prices (dynamic effect). In the quantitative analysis that follows, we
emphasize the relative importance of these terms, static and dynamic effects, in accounting for
income differences in the model. For completeness, we compute measured aggregate TFP following
standard practice as aggregate output per unit of aggregate composite inputs:

                                                   Y
                                   TFP =                         ,                               (21)
                                           K α/(α+γ) N γ/(α+γ)

where aggregate labor N is equal to one by market clearing and aggregate capital is given by
integrating the demand of capital of establishments in equation (3),

                                                  1
                                        α 1−γ  γ γ 1−α−γ

                                        r       w

which is a simple function of prices and average establishment size.




5    Calibration

We study the quantitative impact of policy distortions on aggregate TFP and GDP per capita in
an economy that is relatively more distorted than the United States in the same spirit of Restuccia
and Rogerson (2008) and Hsieh and Klenow (2009). For this reason, we calibrate a benchmark
economy with distortions to U.S. data.

We start by selecting a set of parameters that are standard in the literature. These parameters have
either well-known targets which we match or the values have been well discussed in the literature.


                                                 21
Following the literature, we assume decreasing returns in the establishment-level production function
and set α + γ = 0.85, e.g., Restuccia and Rogerson (2008). Then we split it between α and γ by
assigning 1/3 to capital and 2/3 to labor, implying α = 0.283 and γ = 0.567. We set the annual
exit rate λ to be 10 percent, which is in line to the estimates in the literature, e.g., Davis et al.
(1998). We set the discount rate ρ to match a real interest rate of 4 percent and the depreciation
rate of capital δ to 7 percent to match a capital to output ratio of 2.5. To calibrate the exogenous
growth rate of the mass of establishments η, we use the equilibrium implication of the model that
the aggregate growth rate of TFP over time is proportional to the growth rate of the mass of
establishments. Since the growth rate of TFP in the United States in the last 100 years is roughly
equal to 2 percent, we set η equal to 0.02. We normalize τe = 1 (or τy,e = 0) for the benchmark
economy.

Regarding distortions, we set the correlation between distortions and productivity across establish-
ments to 0, ρτ,z = 0 consistent with the near zero estimates of this correlation for the United States
in Hsieh and Klenow (2014). Since policy distortions follow a Geometric Brownian motion, we can
use the same methodology as in Lemma 2 to find the stationary distribution of τy and consequently
the stationary distribution of TFPR (see appendix A.4) to compute the standard deviation of log
TFPR.

We then calibrate the remaining parameters by solving the equilibrium of the model and making
sure the equilibrium statistics match some targets. The remaining 6 parameters to calibrate are
{σz2 , µτ , στ2 , ce , cµ , θ}. We construct the following 6 statistics in the model and match with the
corresponding targets in the data:


 (1) Standard deviation of log revenue total factor productivity (TFPR):

                                                       η + λ − µs

 (6) Cumulative distribution function (CDF) of establishment size:

                                                                
                                                        −ξ− ξ+
                                 F (s ≤ s) = 1 −                     e−(ξ+ ) log(s/se ) .
                                                       ξ+ − ξ−


The six parameters are selected simultaneously to match six targets for the above statistics, but
since some parameters have a first-order impact on some targets we discuss them in turn. The policy
distortions parameters στ and µτ help matching the standard deviation of log of TFPR in the United
States from Hsieh and Klenow (2009) and the employment growth over the life cycle of plants in
the United States from Hsieh and Klenow (2014). The elasticity of the productivity investment
cost function θ helps matching the annual measured productivity growth rate of establishments

productivity σz is calibrated to match the standard deviation of employment across establishments

establishment size and the share of small establishments in the United States in 1997 from Hsieh
and Klenow (2009). The implied parameters values from this procedure are summarized in Table
1. We next study the quantitative impact of increased policy distortions in this model.




6    Quantitative Experiments

We study the impact of policy distortions on establishment-level productivity, aggregate output, ag-
gregate TFP, and other relevant variables by comparing these statistics in more distorted economies
relative to the benchmark economy. We highlight the impact of policy distortions in our model with
effects on the distribution of establishment-level productivity relative to a version of the model where
the distribution of productivity is exogenous and hence invariant to changes in policy distortions as
in Restuccia and Rogerson (2008). We show that empirically-plausible policy distortions generate
substantial negative effects on aggregate output and TFP. These effects are larger than the static
effect of misallocation estimated in the literature. In our framework, distortions generate dynamic
effects on productivity via two channels affecting the invariant distribution of productivity in the
economy. First, distortions reduce the growth of establishments in both employment and produc-
tivity. Second, the lower growth of establishments make entrants more like incumbent firms altering
the invariant distribution of establishment-level productivity in the economy.

6.1    Changes in policy distortions

We study the impact of changes in policy distortions across economies via changes in three pa-
rameters: the dispersion of distortions στ , the correlation between establishment-level distortions
and productivity ρτ,z , and the distortion of entrants τe which simply determines the level of taxes
in the economy. All other parameters remain the same as in the benchmark economy. We choose
these three parameters to generate economies that differ in distortions, in particular, we target
economies that differ in: (a) the dispersion in distortions, measured by the standard deviation of
the log in TFPR, (b) the static output gain from reallocation, and (c) the establishment growth
rate of employment. We choose a poor economy that has a standard deviation of log TFPR of 1,
that has a static output gain from reducing distortions to the level of the benchmark economy of
a factor of around 2-fold, and that has a zero growth rate in establishment employment. For this
poor economy, the calibrated values are στ = 1.04, ρτ,z = 0.10, and (1 − τe ) = 2.09. While the
particular values for calibration chosen for the poor economy are somewhat arbitrary, we note that
they broadly characterize the empirical pattern of distortions found in the literature (e.g., Buera
et al., 2013; Bento and Restuccia, 2017; Cirera et al., 2017; Restuccia and Rogerson, 2017).

We then linearly interpolate the values of policy distortion parameters between the benchmark
economy and the poor economy to generate economies that feature different magnitudes of dispersion
in log TFPR that are comparable in magnitude to those estimated in the empirical literature. For
instance, a standard deviation of log TFPR of 0.67 for 1991 India and 0.74 for 1998 China from
Hsieh and Klenow (2009), and of 0.85 from the evidence in very poor countries (Chen et al., 2017;
Restuccia and Santaeulalia-Llopis, 2017).

We emphasize that the static gains from reallocation depend not only on the dispersion of log TFPR,
but also on the dispersion of productivity in the economy (more generally, on the joint distribution
of productivity and distortions). For this reason, for example, Hsieh and Klenow (2009) report the
same dispersion in log TFPR for India in 1991 and 1994 of 0.67, yet the resulting static output
gains from reallocation in each case are 41.4% in 1991 and 59.2% in 1994 relative to gains from


                                                25
reallocation in 1997 United States. Hence, we also don’t expect the model to exactly reproduce the
empirical static gains from reallocation.

Table 2 reports the results for economies that differ in policy distortions. The table reports aggregate
output and measured TFP for each economy relative to that of the benchmark economy. Hence,
the results reported are closely linked to the exercise in Hsieh and Klenow (2009) of calculating the
aggregate output gains from reducing the dispersion in marginal revenue products in China and
India to the level observed in the United States. We note that while Hsieh and Klenow (2009) report
TFP gains, in their static setting with constant factors and number of firms, TFP and output gains
are identical.

Notes: Output Y and total factor productivity (TFP) are reported relative to the benchmark economy. Entry size
se /s is defined as the size of entrants relative to the average incumbent. Establishment productivity growth is the
growth rate of establishment productivity and is related to the endogenous drift µz . Establishment employment
growth is the growth rate of establishment employment and is related to the endogenous drift in employment µs .
Hsieh and Klenow (2009) report that the standard deviation of log TFPR is 0.49 for the United States in 1997, 0.67
for India in 1991, and 0.74 for China in 1998.


Our results are quite striking. For instance, the economies with dispersion in distortions of 0.67 and
0.74, as documented in Hsieh and Klenow (2009) for China and India, have aggregate output that is
53.5% and 44.8% of that in the benchmark economy. Economies with larger dispersion in distortions
feature much lower relative output, 34.7% and 21.5% of the benchmark economy. We find similar
quantitative effects for aggregate measured TFP. These results represent substantial decreases in

                                                        26
output and TFP. In more distorted economies, establishment productivity and their employment
size do not grow as much (low µz and µs ) compared to the benchmark economy. Note that while
the implementation of policy distortions in poor economies delivers the fact that productivity and
employment grow less than in the benchmark economy, we emphasize that this may not be the case
in all policy-distortion configurations.

We now comment on the empirical plausibility of these results. The negative effect of distortions on
the life cycle growth of firms is consistent with the evidence in Hsieh and Klenow (2014) where the
employment and productivity growth of firms is found to be lower in more distorted economies such
as India and Mexico than in the United States. We note however that the quantitative magnitude
of the life-cycle effect is not as large as in the data. The low growth in productivity and size imply
that entrants are more similar to incumbents in distorted economies and, as a result, there is a
shift in the distribution of establishment productivity to lower levels. This implication is consistent
with the differences in the productivity distributions of plants in the manufacturing sector reported
by Hsieh and Klenow (2009) for China and India relative to the United States and with empirical
studies of specific policy reforms that find substantial shifts on the productivity distribution, e.g.
Pavcnik (2002) on trade reform in Chile, Kirwan et al. (2012) on dismantling of the Tobacco quota
in the United States, Bustos (2011) on trade reform and technology upgrading, among others.



6.2    Amplification

To illustrate the quantitative importance of the dynamic effects in amplifying the negative impact
of policy distortions on aggregate output and to relate our results with the gains from reallocation
in Hsieh and Klenow (2009), in Table 3 we report the gains in aggregate output that arise in each
economy when eliminating the dispersion in TFPR in the distorted economy relative to the gains
of eliminating distortions in the benchmark economy. We decompose the total effect in aggregate
output between the static gains from factor misallocation and the dynamic gains from changes in
the productivity distribution. This decomposition follows our characterization of aggregate output


                                                  27
between the static effect of factor misallocation and the dynamic effects in equation (20). Hence,
the total output gain in Table 3 is the product of the static gains from factor misallocation and
the dynamic gains from changes in the productivity distribution. To facilitate comparison with the
literature, Table 3 reports the results as the ratio of aggregate output without distortions to output
with distortions relative to the benchmark economy in each case. Hence, the inverse of the total
effect on output coincides with the relative output reported in Table 2 for each economy.

                                                                    SD(logTFPR)

                       reduced distortions:
                         Static effect            1.00 1.38 1.54 1.79 2.13
                         Dynamic effect           1.00 1.35 1.45 1.61 2.18
                         Total effect             1.00 1.87 2.23 2.88 4.65

Notes: Hsieh and Klenow (2009) report that the standard deviation of log TFPR is 0.49 in 1997 United States, 0.67
in 1991 India, and 0.74 in 1998 China. We report the results for two other economies that are more distorted than
China and India. Static gains refer to the output gains from reducing log TFPR dispersion (i.e., factor misallocation)
to the level in the benchmark economy, holding aggregate factors and the productivity distribution of establishments
constant. Endogenous Distribution refers to the change in the endogenous productivity distribution and Total refers
to the overall impact on aggregate output. These terms follow the decomposition of aggregate output in equation
(20). The inverse of the “Total effect” line corresponds to the “Relative output Y ” line in Table 2.


In the economy with dispersion of log TFPR of 0.67, the output gains from eliminating distortions
relative to the gains from eliminating distortions in the benchmark economy is 1.87-fold, that is,
aggregate output in this economy would increase by 87% when eliminating distortions relative to the
corresponding increase in the benchmark economy. Alternatively, this is the increase in aggregate
output that results from reducing the dispersion in distortions in this economy to the level of the
benchmark economy. Notice that the total increase in output is much larger than that reported in
Hsieh and Klenow (2009) for the impact of factor misallocation in India. According to Hsieh and
Klenow (2009, Table VI), the output gains in 1991 India from equalizing TFPR relative to 1997 U.S.
gains is 41.4%. In our model, the corresponding increase in aggregate output of reducing dispersion
in India to the level of the U.S. is 38% (Static gains 1.38 in Table 3). Hence, the increase in output

                                                         28
arising from the reduction in factor misallocation is very close to that estimated empirically. But
in our model the distribution of productivity changes along with changes in general equilibrium
prices, generating a larger increase in output. As a result, the dynamic effect generates substantial
amplification over and above the gains from eliminating static misallocation. This amplification
effect on output is substantial. For the log TFPR 0.67 economy, whereas the static gain from
reducing factor misallocation is 38%, the dynamic effect increases aggregate output by 35%. To
put it differently, the dynamic effect accounts for 48% (log(1.35)/log(1.87)) of the gain in aggregate
output from reducing misallocation to the levels in the benchmark economy.

In the economy with dispersion in log TFPR of 0.74, the total increase in aggregate output from
the reduction in the dispersion of distortions relative to the benchmark economy is 2.2-fold with
the dynamic effect accounting again for 47% of this increase. Economies with more distortions
feature larger increases in relative output and a similar contribution of the dynamic effect. In
these numerical experiments, the dynamic effect of misallocation is as important as the static loss
from factor misallocation, doubling the quantitative impact of distortions on aggregate output and
TFP. Although the purpose of these quantitative experiments is not to account for any particular
country experience, to gauge the relative importance of the amplification mechanism derived from
the dynamic effect in our model, it is useful to recall that Hsieh and Klenow (2009) crudely estimate
the gap in manufacturing productivity between the United States and China and India to be a factor
between 2.3 and 2.6-fold to show that static misallocation is an important component of the factor
difference. Our results indicate that the dynamic effect can potentially account for the bulk of the
remaining difference.




7    Conclusions

We develop a tractable dynamic model of heterogeneous producers to study the effect of distortions
on the distribution of establishment-level productivity across economies. The model tractability
allows us to obtain closed-form solutions that are useful in identifying the response of distortions

                                                 29
on aggregate output via static factor misallocation and dynamic effects. In this framework, pol-
icy distortions not only generate differences in factor misallocation (static effect) as emphasized
in a large literature, but also on the distribution of establishment-level productivity and general
equilibrium prices (dynamic effect). We show that empirically-reasonable policy distortions have
substantial negative effects on aggregate output and TFP in this economy, roughly doubling the
effect of distortions in models with constant exogenous distributions.

It would be interesting to explore specific policies and institutions—such as size-dependent policies,
firing taxes, financial frictions—in the context of our framework with dynamic effects of distortions.
These explorations of specific policies in our framework may help reconcile the empirically large
effects found in the literature relative to models with a constant exogenous distribution. Broadly
speaking, we argue that our dynamic framework is better suited to explore the data. As a result,
further progress aimed at broadening the empirical mapping of the model to the data may provide
useful insights. Our analytical solution of the productivity distribution as a function of distortions
is a critical first step in this mapping. But the mapping requires reliable and comparable panel
data of producers across countries. While these data are increasingly available for some countries,
comparability across countries remains an important limitation. We leave these interesting and
important explorations for future work.

A      Appendix

This appendix presents the proofs of Lemma 1 and Lemma 2, the detailed steps to calculate aggre-
gate output, and the characterization of the distribution of TFPR.



A.1     Proof Lemma 1

From the first order condition for the productivity drift in equation (5), we can solve for the
productivity drift µz as a function of the determinants of costs and benefits such as distortions τ ,
cost scale cµ , and the marginal present value profits Wz0 . In particular, equating the marginal cost
and benefit from productivity growth implies,


                                          cµ (zτ )θ µθ−1
                                                     z   = zWz0 .


By guessing and verifying, we find that the optimal Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation is given by
W (z, τ ) = A(w, r)z θ τ θ , where the constant A(w, r) is the solution of the polynomial:

Given the solution to this polynomial, the optimal productivity drift µz is independent of establish-

The stationary pdf is the solution of the boundary-value problem that consists of solving


                       f 00 (x) − γ1 f 0 (x) − γ2 f (x) = 0                  if x 6= 0,
                       f 00 (x) − γ1 f 0 (x) − γ2 f (x) = −γ3 δ(x − 0)       if x = 0,

where the constants γ1 , γ2 , and γ3 are given by

                                  2µx                 2(λ + η)                   2b̂

We solve the boundary-value problem using Laplace transforms. Laplace transforms are given by


                                   L [f 0 (x)] = sL [f (x)] − f (0),

                                   L [f 00 (x)] = s2 L [f (x)] − sf (0) − f 0 (0).


By applying Laplace transforms in equation (8), we obtain:


               (s2 − γ1 s − γ2 )L [f (x)] − (s − γ1 )f (0) − f 0 (0) = −γ3 L [δ(x − 0)].


Using the boundary condition f (0) ≥ 0 and L [δ(x − 0)] = 1 we find:


                            (s2 − γ1 s − γ2 )Y (s) = f 0 (0) + (s − γ1 )f (0) − γ3 ,


where

                                               f 0 (0) − γ3 + (s − γ1 )f (0)
                                     Y (s) =                                 .

A.3     Derivation of Aggregate Output

Recall that establishment level output is given by the production function,


                                              y = z θ(1−α−γ) k α nγ .


From the static profit maximization problem, we derive the demand of capital and labor for each
establishment, k(z, τ ) and n(z, τ ). After substituting these equations into the production function
we obtain:
                                                                1
                                             h α α  γ γ i 1−α−γ
                               y(z, τ ) =                                     τ θ(α+γ) z θ .     (A.2)
                                                r         w
Note from this expression that output at the establishment level is not just a function of productivity
but also depends on distortions. Because the demand of inputs depends linearly on (zτ )θ we
define size s ≡ (zτ )θ and we can therefore express output as a function of size and distortions.
Note also that the term in square brackets is a constant across establishments that depends on
prices and production parameters. Labor market clearing (aggregating the demand for labor across
establishments and equating to 1) implies,

                                              1
                                       α α γ (1−α) 1−α−γ
                                                         s̄ = 1.
                                       r   w

Then, after a few algebra manipulations, we can express the constant in equation (A.2) as propor-
tional to average size as follows:

                                                    1
                                 h α α  γ γ i 1−α−γ                   1
                                                                  ∝                .
                                       r      w                       s̄γ/(1−α)

The proportionality is because there is a constant term that depends on the real interest rate which
is constant in all our economies. Using this expression into (A.2), output is given by

                                                         1
                                     y(z, τ ; s̄) ∝               τ θ(α+γ) z θ .
                                                      s̄γ/(1−α)


Then aggregate output Y is obtained by integrating over all establishments. Following Lyuu (2002),
