Single Mothers Working at Night: Standard Work, Child Care Subsidies, and Implications for
Welfare Reform

                                            ABSTRACT

Using a data set from the post welfare reform environment (the 1999 National Survey of America’s

Families), this paper investigates the impact of child care subsidies on the standard work (i.e., work

performed during the traditional work hours of 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. through Monday and Friday)

decision of single mothers and tests whether this impact differs between welfare recipients and

nonrecipients. The econometric strategy accounts for sample selection into the labor force and the

potential endogeneity of child care subsidy receipt and welfare participation. Results suggest that

child care subsidies are associated with a 6 percentage point increase in the probability of single

mothers working at standard jobs. When the impact of subsidies is allowed to differ between

welfare recipients and non-recipients, results indicate that welfare recipients are 14 percentage

points more likely to work at standard jobs than others when they are offered a child care subsidy.

Among non-recipients, child care subsidies increase standard work probability by only 1 percentage

point. These results underscore the importance of child care subsidies helping low-income parents,

especially welfare recipients, find jobs with conventional or standard schedules and lend support to

the current practice of states’ giving priority to welfare recipients for child care subsidies. Results

are found to be robust to numerous specification checks.

       I.      Introduction

       Working outside the “standard” weekday hours of 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. between

Monday and Friday is an increasingly common practice in the United States. For

example, 34.3% of all female workers in the United States were nonstandard workers in

1995 (Kalleberg et al. 1997). The investigation of nonstandard work is important for a

number of reasons. First, there is evidence suggesting that workers engaged in

nonstandard work are more likely to be assigned to routine jobs, and to receive less

training and fewer promotions than others (Rothstein 1996; Barker 1993; Tilly 1996).

Consequently, these workers tend to earn less, and are less likely to have health insurance

and pension benefits than standard workers (Hipple and Stewart 1996; Loprest 2002).

Along similar lines, there appears to exist a positive link between the quality of an initial

job and the likelihood of maintaining employment over time (Rangarajan, Schochet, and

Chu 1998; Strawn and Morrison 2000; Cancian and Meyer 2000). Second, nonstandard

work is linked to a number of adverse outcomes for parents and children, such as work

and family conflicts, marital instability, health problems for both parents and children,

and poor educational outcomes for children (Staines and Pleck 1983; Presser 2000;

Heymann 2000). Finally, the majority of nonstandard workers work such schedules

involuntarily and view their employment during nonstandard hours as an accommodation

to labor market needs, not as a personal preference. According to Current Population

Survey, more than half of the workers with nonstandard schedules report the nature of the

job as the reason for their choice. Only about six percent of nonstandard workers report

working such schedules for better pay and only four percent give better child care as their

reason for working nonstandard schedules (Beers 2000).




                                              1
        With the passage of welfare reform in 1996, child care assistance has become a

significant tool for helping welfare recipients move into the workforce and for helping

other low-income families stay off welfare.1 According to the General Accounting

Office, a vast majority of states make welfare recipients and families making the

transition from welfare to work eligible for child care assistance or give them higher

priority than other low-income families when resources are insufficient to cover all who

apply (GAO 2003). Almost seven years after the welfare reform bill, Congress now

debates legislation to reauthorize welfare reform, and child care funding remains a key

issue. However, very little is known about whether child care subsidies have in fact

played a role in increasing employment among welfare recipients, or in general, low

income population in the post-welfare reform period (Blank 2002). Even less is known

about the effect of these subsidies on standard-nonstandard employment decisions of

these individuals. This paper is an attempt to fill this gap.

        Since the passage of welfare reform, the employment rate of single mothers has

risen dramatically (Jones-DeWeer et al. 2003). However, leaving welfare does not

necessarily mean gaining adequate work and increasing economic self-sufficiency. For

example, only eight percent of welfare leavers have been able to sustain employment

over a period of four years (Martinson 2000). Over three quarters (78%) of employed

low income single mothers are concentrated in typically low-wage and low benefit

occupations. (Jones-DeWeer et al. 2003). These occupations typically demand a greater

 The welfare reform legislation combined the previously existing four child care funding programs into the
Child Care Development Fund (CCDF) and increased federal funding for child care substantially. It also
gave states greater flexibility in setting up and administering their programs. In fiscal year 1999, states
spent all of their CCDF allocation of around $5 billion and spent directly on child care or transferred
another $4 billion from the TANF funds. See Blau (2003) for a summary of the system of child care
assistance under welfare reform.

number of hours outside the standard weekday times of 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.2 About one

quarter of all welfare leavers worked night shifts or had irregular schedules on a regular

basis in 1999 (Loprest 2002). Despite gains in employment, about 52 percent of those

who left welfare in 1999 had incomes below the poverty level (Nightingale 2002). In

sum, welfare reform may have been successful so far in helping welfare participants

secure entry-level jobs; however, there is a great deal of concern over the possibility that

many former welfare recipients who have gone to work are having difficulty finding

stable employment and working at jobs with low wages and few benefits. This paper

examines the capability of child care subsidies to help mothers find jobs with

conventional or standard schedules, the kind of jobs that usually pay higher wages,

provide better benefits, and lead to long-term economic well-being of parents.

         A binary model of standard-nonstandard employment is estimated jointly with the

binary models of subsidy receipt and labor force participation to control for endogeneity

and selectivity, using full information maximum likelihood (FIML). In order to test for a

differential effect of subsidy receipt on standard work across welfare recipients and

nonrecipients, the system of equations is re-estimated with the addition of an interaction

of a welfare and subsidy indicator into the standard work model, controlling for the

endogeneity of welfare receipt. Investigation of whether the effect of child care subsidies

differs between welfare recipients and nonrecipients is particularly important because

many states indicate that they give priority to families leaving welfare (Schumacher and

Greenberg 1999).3 The analysis uses data from the 1999 National Survey of America’s

  It is important to note that the term “nonstandard” is not used to describe workers who are employed on a
temporary basis. Rather it refers to the individual’s reported work schedule.

  Prior to 1996, welfare recipients had the priority. This is no longer a requirement under federal law,
although it is still often the case in practice.

Families (NSAF), conducted by the Urban Institute. The NSAF provides the only

available national household data from the post-welfare reform period with information

on child care subsidies.

       The rest of the paper is organized in the following way. Section II reviews the

previous literature. Section III describes the theoretical model and discusses the

econometric approach. Section IV introduces the data. Section V presents the results and

section VI concludes the paper.



       II.     Previous Literature

       Although this is the first paper to examine the impact of child care subsidies on

standard work decision, it is not the first to consider the relationship between child care

subsidies and employment of mothers. However, the vast majority of the literature on the

impact of child care subsidies on employment focuses on the pre-welfare reform period.

Due to the fact that the welfare reform changed the system dramatically, results from the

pre-welfare reform period may be less relevant to the impact of current subsidies (Blau

and Tekin 2003).

       One body of evidence on the association between child care subsidies and

employment comes from several demonstration projects designed to help economically

disadvantaged families. These programs include child care subsidies along with other

benefits and services. Most of these projects were conducted as randomized experiments

prior to the 1996 welfare reform legislation and they typically find that employment

increased as a result of the treatment. However, the child care subsidy is only one of a




                                              4
large number of services and benefits provided to the treatment group, therefore, it is not

possible to isolate the actual subsidy impact from the overall program impact.4

         The largest source of evidence on the effect of child care subsidies on

employment comes from the studies on the impact of the price of child care. These

studies typically use the variation in child care costs across individuals and the

geographic variation in the cost of child care.5 They studies implicitly rely on the strong

assumption that there are no costs to taking up a subsidy either in the form of time costs

required to deal with the bureaucratic system or the stigma of participating a means-

tested program. If this assumption is not true however, then the price effect would not be

a reliable estimate for the subsidy effect and the decision to take up a subsidy must be

treated as an endogenous decision (Blau 2003).

        Research on the impact of actual subsidies has been limited, primarily due to lack

of data. Berger and Black (1992) and Gelbach (2002) examine the effect of child care

subsidies by comparing the employment patterns of two groups of mothers who are

separated from each other using a natural experiment. Both of these studies find positive

impacts of child care subsidies on maternal employment. Meyers, Heintze, and Wolf

(2002) use data from a sample of low income single mothers (current and recent welfare

recipients in California between 1992 and 1995) to estimate the probability of their

receiving child care subsidies and the effect of this probability on labor market activity.

The authors find that the probability of subsidy receipt is associated with an increase in

the probability of employment. Blau and Tekin (2003) analyze the determinants of

Demonstration (Kisker et al. 1998), New Chance (Quint, Bos, and Polit 1997), GAIN in California (Riccio
et al. 1994), the Minnesota Family Investment Program (Miller et al. 1997), and the Florida Family
Transition Program (Bloom et al. 1999).

receipt of child care subsidy and the effect of subsidy receipt on employment,

unemployment, school attendance and welfare participation, using data from the NSAF.

The authors control for the endogeneity of child care subsidy receipt using instrumental

variables. They find positive effects of child care subsidy receipt on employment.

       The information on the link between the standard/nonstandard work and child

care decisions of mothers is very limited and mostly descriptive in nature. Authors

typically consider the impact of standard or nonstandard work on several outcomes such

as modes of child care and the decision to use a child care subsidy (Burstein et al. 2001;

Georges et al. 2001; Presser 1986; Presser 1988; Brayfield 1995; Casper and O’Connell

1998; Chaplin et al. 1999; Kimmel and Powell 2001; Kimmel and Powell 2002). An

important difference between this paper and previous research in this area is that the

focus here is on the standard/nonstandard work decision while previous studies

concentrated on the effect of standard or nonstandard work on some other outcome

measure. With the exception of the two studies by Kimmel and Powell, none of them

addressed the endogeneity of standard/nonstandard work status. Kimmel and Powell

(2001) examine the impact of standard work on the child care choices of single mothers

and find that work patterns play an important role in mothers’ decisions regarding the

mode of child care.



       III. Theoretical Model and Econometric Framework

       The behavioral model developed in this section serves as a guide for the

econometric model used for estimating the impact of child care subsidies on standard

employment. Suppose that a single mother allocates her time between leisure and work.




                                             6
She either works during standard hours or nonstandard hours but not both. If she does

not work, she provides child care during her leisure hours. During her work hours, she

can use market care or receive free care from a relative. The relative allocates her time

between child care and leisure with employment ruled out for simplicity. Although the

choice of paid versus unpaid care or the employment decision of the relative are not part

of the empirical model, they are included in the theory in order to account for the use of

unpaid child care (Blau and Tekin 2003). The mother can receive a child care subsidy if

she is eligible for one. In addition to satisfying the income condition, she must either be

employed or in a work-related activity to be eligible for a subsidy as required by the law.

Furthermore, child care subsidies are conditioned on the use of market care. To the extent

that such arrangements lack flexible hours, they might not be attractive to mothers

working nonstandard hours. This would in fact serve as another factor supporting the

claim that subsidy receipt is endogenous. Finally, it is assumed that the mother may

derive disutility from receiving a child care subsidy as a result of stigma.

        Under these assumptions, a mother maximizes her utility subject to her budget

and time constraints, which can be expressed as follows:


        U = U(C, dstHst+(1-dst)Hnst, Lr, qss)

        Lm + dstHst + (1-dst)Hnst = 1,          Lr + J = 1,

        M + J = dstHst + (1-dst)Hnst,           JM = HstHnst = 0

        C + pM = Y + [dstHst + (1-dst)Hnst]w                  if s=0

        C + (p-r)M = Y + [dstHst + (1-dst)Hnst]w(1-ts),       if s=1, Y + hw ≤ Es, and Ts=1

where

U      =       utility
C      =       consumption
dst    =       binary indicator of standard work
Hst    =       work hours during standard hours
Hnst   =       work hours during nonstandard hours
Lr     =       relative’s leisure hours
qs     =       the disutility of receiving a subsidy
s      =       binary indicator of subsidy receipt
Lm     =       mother’s leisure hours
J      =       hours of free care received from the relative
M      =       hours of paid care purchased in the market
p      =       price of child care per hour
Y      =       nonwage income
w      =       hourly wage rate
Es     =       the income eligibility limit for child care subsidy
r      =       the subsidy rate per hour of child care if income is zero
ts     =       the rate at which child care assistance is reduced as earnings rise
Ts     =       a binary variable indicating whether an eligible mother actually received a
               subsidy in a state

       Assume also that the disutility derived from working during standard hours is less

than the disutility derived during nonstandard hours, i.e., |dU/dHst|< |dU/dHnst|. The

mother chooses C, dst, Hst, Hnst,w, Lr, s, Lm, J, and M to maximize her utility subject to

her constraints. The set of alternative available to a single mother are displayed in Table

1. A single mother chooses the alternative that gives her the highest utility.

       Let Vi be the indirect utility associated with alternative i, which can be derived by

solving the optimization problem. The value of receiving a subsidy can be written as

       Vi(s=1) = max{Vi3(Y, p), Vi6(Y, w, p, r, Es, qs, ts), Vi9((Y, w, p, r, Es, qs, ts)}.

Similarly, the value of not receiving a subsidy is

       Vi(s=0) = max{Vi1(Y), Vi2(Y), Vi4(Y, w), Vi5(Y, w, p), Vi7(Y, w), Vi8(Y, w, p)}.

       A single mother will receive a subsidy if Vi(s=1)>Vi(s=0), Y + hW ≤ Es, and

Ts=1. Thus, a reduced form model of subsidy receipt is a function of non-wage income,

prices, all the exogenous variables in the model, and the Ts.




                                               8
       si = si(Y, p, r, w, qs, ts, Es, Ts)                                                 (1)

       Let Pr(dsti=1|si=1, Ei=1) be the probability of standard employment conditional on

receiving a subsidy and being employed, where E is a binary indicator of employment.

Then

       Pr(dsti=1|si=1, Ei=1) = Pr(Vi6(Y, w, p, r, Es, qs, ts) > Vi9(Y, w, p, r, Es, qs, ts))

Similarly, the probability of standard employment conditional on not receiving a subsidy

but being employed is

       Pr(dsti=1|si=0, Ei=1) = Pr(max{Vi4(Y, w), Vi5(Y, w, p)}> max{(Vi7(Y, w), Vi8(Y,

w, p)}).

       Therefore, the probability of standard employment conditional on subsidy status

can be expressed as

       dsti = dsti(s, E, Y, p, r, w, Es, qs, ts)                                           (2)

       According to (1) and (2), the only valid identifying instrument for s is the vector

Ts. Note that Ts is a binary variable indicating whether a single mother who is eligible

for a subsidy actually receives one. It can be assumed that the state’s number of eligible

children served by child care subsidies and the average amount of CCDF funds spent per

child in a state are positively related to Ts. Also, an eligible mother is more likely to

receive a child care subsidy in states where mass media are used as a consumer education

strategy in child care because she is more likely to be informed about the bureaucratic

process, application procedures, and the various opportunities for child care assistance.

Based on the theoretical model, these factors should not influence equation (1). One may

argue that the parameters of the state child care subsidy system, such as r, ts, and Es

would serve as identifying instruments by affecting whether a mother receives a subsidy,




                                                   9
but conditional on receiving a subsidy, not affecting the standard employment decision.

However, as indicated by the model and expressed by equation (2), these variables affect

the standard employment decision. This is because the parameters that determine

eligibility for a child care subsidy affect how much a mother can earn and thus the value

of being employed and receiving a subsidy (Blau and Tekin 2003).

       Econometric Framework

       The objective of the paper is to evaluate the impact of child care subsidy receipt

on standard employment. Based on the theoretical model, the econometric model can be

expressed by the following equations:

       Si = Xiβ + Ziδ + Tsiµ + εi                                                      (3)

       STi = αSi + Xiγ + Ziζ + νi      if      Ei=1                                    (4)

where Si is a binary indicator of subsidy receipt for mother i, STi is the binary outcome of

standard employment, Xi is a vector of family characteristics, Zi is vectors of policy

variables and other characteristics of the location of the residence of the family, ε and ν

are disturbances, and β’s, δ’s, α, γ’s, and ζ’s are parameters. As the theoretical model

implies, the demand for child care subsidies is determined by the price of child care, the

mother’s wage rate, nonwage income, preferences for consumption relative to leisure, the

parameters of the subsidy program, the stigma of participating in a means-tested program,

etc. These factors are determined in turn by family characteristics (X), the observed

features of the state child care subsidy system (Z and Ts), and unobserved family and

state characteristics (ε). Since equation (3) is a reduced form, it is not possible to identify

the supply and demand effects of X, Z, and Ts. Therefore, β’s, δ’s and µ’s are the net

effects of demand and supply forces on the subsidy receipt.




                                              10
       Identifying the causal impact of child care subsidy receipt on work schedule in

equation (4) is complicated by the possibility that ε and ν are correlated. For example, a

mother who is strongly motivated to work during standard hours may also be motivated

to seek a child care subsidy in order to better accommodate her child care needs,

generating a positive correlation between εi and νi. Alternatively, administrators of the

subsidy system may give priority to the least employable mothers (Blau and Tekin 2003),

imparting a negative correlation. The theoretical model implies that the vector Ts is a

valid identifying instrument since it can be appropriately excluded from the standard

work equation. Therefore, the factors that determine Ts are treated as identifying

instruments. As mentioned earlier, these characteristics include the average monthly

number of eligible children served in the state, the average amount of CCDF funds spent

per child in the state, and a binary variable indicating whether the state uses the mass

media as a consumer education strategy. These are valid instruments assuming that they

influence whether a parent receives a subsidy, but do not influence the

standard/nonstandard work decision conditional on receiving a subsidy.

       Another complication arises from the fact that ST is observed only for workers

(i.e., for those with E=1). Thus, the estimates of equation (3) are subject to bias because

of selection into the labor force. To overcome this problem, equations (3) and (4) are

estimated jointly with an employment equation. The employment equation can be

obtained from the theoretical model similar to the way the standard employment model is

derived and can be denoted as

       Ei = E(S, Y, p, r, w, Es, qs, ts)




                                             11
Substituting equation (3) into S and specifying a linear equation, Ei takes the following

fully reduced form

        Ei = Xiξ+ Ziπ + Tsiφ + ηi                                                              (5)

        Estimation of (3), (4), and (5) jointly using full information maximum likelihood

requires calculating a trivariate integral. I use a random effects estimator with discrete

factor approximation, also known as discrete factor method, to estimate the empirical

model. The discrete factor method is well suited for this study because it is flexible

method in the sense that it eliminates the need to evaluate multivariate normal integrals.6

Using Monte Carlo methods, Mroz (1999) shows that the random effects estimator with

discrete factor approximation is more robust to deviations from normality and quality of

implements than two-stage methods.

        To implement the discrete factor method, I impose the following structure on the

disturbances in equations (3)-(5):

        εi = ρ1u + λ1i,

        νi = ρ2u + λ2i,

        ηi = ρ3u + λ3i,

where λ1, λ2, λ3 and u are independently distributed errors and with equation specific

factor loading parameters ρ1, ρ2, and ρ3. This structure places the restriction that all

heterogeneity or the correlation among the error terms enters the model through the

common factor u that is assumed to have a discrete distribution (Heckman and Singer

1984). The discrete factor method assumes that the distribution of heterogeneity can be

approximated by a step function and “integrates out” through a weighted sum of

probabilities. Specifically, Pr(u = ωk) = pk ≥ 0 for k = 1,….,K and ∑K pk = 1. The

number of points of support K, the location of the support points ωk and their

probabilities pk are called incidental parameters and are estimated jointly with the other

parameters of the system of equations.7 Then the likelihood function for the system of

equations can be written as

L = ∏N ∑K pkФ(Xiξ+ πZi + Tsiφ + ρ1uk)Ei(1-Ф(Xiξ+ πZi + Tsiφ + ρ1uk))1- Ei

      Ф(αSi + Xiγ + Ziζ + ρ2uk)Ei STi (1 - Ф(αSi + Xiγ + Ziζ + ρ2uk)) Ei(1 –STi) Ф(Xiβ + Ziδ +

      Tiµ + ρ3uk)Si (1- Ф(Xiβ + Ziδ + Tiµ + ρ3uk)) (1 – Si)

where Ф is the cumulative normal density function.



IV.       Data

          The data used in this paper are drawn from the second round of the National

Survey of America’s Families (NSAF). It was conducted by the Urban Institute between

February and October 1999.8 The NSAF sample is representative of the United States

civilian, non-institutionalized population under age 65. Residents of 13 states (Alabama,

California, Colorado, Florida, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New

Jersey, New York, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin) and households with income

below 200 percent of the federal poverty line were over-sampled. The over-sampled

states contain more than half of the United States population. Interviews were conducted

with over 42,000 households.

  The location and the scale of the distribution of u are not identified. Because each model contains an
intercept and the factor loading parameters ρ1, ρ2, and ρ3 are estimated in the parameterization, ωk is
restricted to be between 0 and 1 (Picone et al. 2003). Further parameterization is implemented as follows:
ωk = exp(ak)/[1 + exp(ak)], k=2,….,k-1, and ω0 = 0 and ωK=1. pk = exp(bk)/ [1+ΣK-1exp(bk)] , k=1,…., K-1,
and pK = 1/[1+ΣK-1exp(bk)]. a’s and b’s are free parameters to be estimated. The likelihood function is
maximized with respect to all the parameters including those describing heterogeneity.

  The first round of the NSAF was conducted in 1997 with a different sample.


                                                    13
         The NSAF is an ideal data source for the purpose of this study for several reasons.

First, it was specifically designed to analyze the consequences of devolution of

responsibility for social programs from the federal government to the states. Second, the

NSAF is unique in the sense that it provides the only nationally representative household

data on child care subsidies. Previous studies have relied exclusively on administrative

data to evaluate the impact of child care subsidies. However, there is no appropriate

control group for administrative data since they usually contain information only on

subsidy recipients. Third, the second round of the NSAF was conducted three years after

the welfare reform legislation. In this respect, it presents a more comprehensive picture

of the post-welfare reform environment. Finally, the NSAF provides a large sample of

single mothers. I limit the sample to single mothers because the standard/nonstandard

work behavior of married mothers may be quite different from that of single mothers as

fathers are likely to be the primary child care provider when their spouses are at work.

Also, single mothers are the primary target for aid under welfare law. For example, they

accounted for over 90 percent of TANF cases in 1998 (Committee on Ways and Means,

2000).

         The sample used in the analysis includes 4,405 single mothers with at least one

child under age 13. The NSAF contains information on child care subsidy receipt for

children under age 13, which is the cut-off age for eligibility under CCDF. The mother is

asked whether she receives any assistance paying for child care, including assistance

from a welfare or social services agency, her employer, and a non-custodial parent. I

code a mother as receiving a child care subsidy if she reports that a welfare or social

services agency pays for all or part of the cost of child care for any of the children in the




                                              14
family. A mother is coded as working at a standard job if she reported performing her

work during traditional hours of 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. during business days (Monday to

Friday). Those who perform their work outside of those traditional hours are coded as

working at nonstandard jobs. This group may include mothers who work weekends,

evenings, split shifts, or irregular daily or weekly schedules since the NSAF does not

distinguish between various types of nonstandard hours.

        Definitions and the descriptive statistics used in the analysis are presented in

Table 2. Column I shows the means for the whole sample and the column II shows them

for workers only. Columns III and IV display the means for standard and nonstandard

workers, respectively. Column V displays the means for standard workers who are

subsidy recipients and column VI displays the means for standard workers who are non-

recipients. As shown in column I, 11.6 percent of the sample receives a child care

subsidy. The Administration for Children and Families (2000) predicts that between 12

and 15 percent of all eligible families received a CCDF subsidy in 1998-1999. The

sample in this study includes all single mothers regardless of their income and some of

these mothers are certainly ineligible for subsidies as their incomes exceed the threshold

level.9 Thus, 11.6 percent subsidy coverage rate is not unreasonable. The employment

rate in the sample is 71.1 percent. Among those who are employed, 20.7 percent work

nonstandard hours. Among workers, the subsidy receipt is higher for those who work

standard hours than those who work nonstandard workers (13.1 percent versus 10.8

percent).




9
 By including all single mothers, I avoid conditioning on income from employment, which constitutes the
majority income for the sample. See Blau and Tekin (2003) for a similar approach.


                                                  15
        Under the new welfare system, parents are required to work or participate in work

related activities (such as education, training, and job search) to be eligible for child care

subsidies. Therefore, we would expect subsidy recipients to have a higher employment

rate than non-recipients. For the full sample, the employment rate is 77.1 percent among

subsidy recipients and 70.3 percent among non-recipients (not shown in the table).

Similarly, standard work is more common among subsidy recipients than nonrecipients

(82 percent versus 89 percent). These are statistically significant, but relatively small

differences, suggesting that many non-working subsidy recipients may be attending

school, training, or searching for employment. The NSAF reports the reasons offered by

mothers for not working while receiving child care subsidy. A tabulation of these

reasons indicate that over 90 percent of nonemployed subsidy recipients have a plausible

reason for receiving a subsidy despite not being employed, such as attending school and

actively seeking work.

        Welfare recipients constitute 15.8 percent of the full sample. This figure matches

perfectly with the Current Population Survey, which suggests a 15 percent welfare

utilization rate for 1999 (Grogger 2003). A higher percentage of nonstandard workers

receive welfare than standard workers (14.2 percent versus 9.3 percent). This is

reasonable given that standard workers have higher nonwage income and education than

nonstandard workers on average. Furthermore, among standard workers, child care

subsidy recipients are much more likely to be on welfare than nonrecipients, 29.4 percent

versus 7.6 percent. Given the emphasis of the CCDF that gives priority to welfare

recipients, the size of the gap is not surprising.




                                               16
       A full description of the occupational indicators is provided in Table B1. As

Table 2 illustrates, there are major differences in occupations between standard and

nonstandard workers. Nonstandard workers are concentrated mostly in sectors with high

demand for off-hour services. For instance, standard workers are more likely to be

employed in managerial, professional specialty, and administrative support occupations

than nonstandard workers. On the other hand, they are less likely to work in sales,

protective services, service occupations, and occupations such as machine operators,

assemblers, inspectors, handlers, helpers or cleaners. The percentage of single mothers

with less than a high school degree is approximately 8 percent for standard workers and

15 percent for nonstandard workers. This pattern is entirely reversed for college

graduates with 8 percent of nonstandard and 17 percent of standard workers holding a

bachelor degree or more. These patterns are consistent with those documented in

previous studies using different data sources (e.g., Presser and Cox 1997; Kalleberg et al.

1997). Finally, blacks constitute a much larger portion of subsidy recipients among

standard workers compared to whites (41 percent versus 28 percent).

       In formulating equations (3), (4), and (5), I condition on a number of

characteristics of the mother that reflect both demand and supply factors. These include

her age, ethnicity, health status, education, presence of children, family structure,

nonwage income, and region of residence. In addition to these variables, the occupation

fixed effects are included in the nonstandard employment equation in order to control for

any unobserved differences in demand for standard workers across different occupations.

The models also include state’s median income, unemployment rate for females, state’s

percentage of female-headed households with children living under poverty, state’s




                                             17
maximum amount of cash assistance for welfare recipients, state’s earnings eligibility

limit for child care for a single parent family of three, and monthly maximum income

allowed for eligibility for a child care subsidy.



         V.       Results10

         The results of the employment equation estimated to control for selection into the

labor force are displayed in Table A1. Virtually all variables either affect employment in

the expected direction or are not related to employment. Since this equation is not central

to the paper, the results will not be discussed in the text.

         Table 3 presents estimates of the model for child care subsidy receipt. The first

column presents the marginal effects and the second column displays the coefficient

estimates. The standard errors are in the third column.11 Blacks are more likely to

receive a child care subsidy than both whites and other races. The likelihood of subsidy

receipt also increases with the number of children ages 0-5 and 6-13 and the effect is

stronger for the younger age group (4.9 percentage points versus 1.7 percentage points).

High school graduates and those with some college degree are 3.3 and 5.5 percentage

points more likely to receive a child care subsidy than high school dropouts, respectively.

10
   The results presented in this paper are taken from a model estimated with four points of support. A
model with five points of support did not provide a significant improvement in the likelihood over a model
with four points of support. Although there is no standard theory about how to select the number of points
of support in a finite sample, the consensus is to add points of support until the likelihood fails to improve
significantly (Blau and Hagy 1998; Heckman and Singer 1984; Mocan and Tekin 2003). Mroz (1999)
shows that the likelihood ratio test performs well when determining the number of points of support. The
estimates of the heterogeneity parameters are presented in Appendix Table C1.
11
   Note that the majority of the explanatory variables are dichotomous. The marginal effects for these
variables are calculated as 1/nΣ[Φ(Ci|Xi=1) - Φ(Ci|Xi=0)], where Φ is the standard cumulative normal
distribution and Φ(Ci|Xi=1) is the predicted probability of standard employment for the ith mother given
that the dichotomous variable X is equal to 1 and Φ(Ci|Xi=0) is her predicted probability given that the X is
equal to 0. The marginal effects for the continuous variables are calculated based on infinitesimal changes.
Calculating all the marginal effects for the dichotomous variables based on the latter approach did not
change the results.



                                                     18
Mothers with higher nonwage income are less likely to receive a child care subsidy than

others. A one thousand dollar increase in non-wage income results in a 3 percentage

point decrease in the probability of receiving a child care subsidy. The presence of an

additional relative in the household decreases the probability of subsidy receipt by 1.7

percentage points. The pattern of these findings is fully consistent with that of Blau and

Tekin (2003) who investigate the determinants and consequences of child care subsidies

using data from the NSAF.

        It is important to note that the coefficients of the variables used as identifying

instruments have the expected signs. As displayed in Table 2, a single mother is about 3

percentage points more likely to receive a child care subsidy in states where mass media

are used as a consumer education strategy for child care than other states. A one

percentage point increase in the number of eligible children served by child care

subsidies in a state increases the likelihood of subsidy receipt by a single mother by 0.89

percentage points. An increase in the CCDF funds per child by 1,000 dollars is associated

with only a 0.26 percentage point increase in the probability of subsidy receipt, but the

coefficient estimate is statistically insignificant. A specification test rejects the

hypothesis that the coefficients of these three variables are jointly zero with a p-value of

less than 0.01. The coefficients on the parameters of the state’s subsidy program (co-

payment, reimbursements rate, and income eligibility limit) also have the expected signs,

however, none of the coefficients is statistically significant.

        Table 4 displays the results of the model for standard-nonstandard employment

equation. The variable of the primary interest, the receipt of a child care subsidy, has a

positive and significant coefficient. Single mothers who receive a child care subsidy are




                                               19
6.1 percentage points more likely to work standard hours than nonstandard hours, all else

equal. This finding underscores the importance of child care subsidies on facilitating the

transition from nonstandard work to standard work for single mother.

         Mothers with at least a bachelor’s degree are more likely to work at standard jobs

than nonstandard jobs. This is consistent with the fact that standard jobs are more human

capital demanding than nonstandard jobs. Whites are about 4 percentage points more

likely to work at standard jobs than are blacks and other races. The number of children in

a household is associated with a decrease in the likelihood of standard work, although the

effect is significant only for younger children. This is consistent with Presser and Cox

(1997) and Kimmel and Powell (2001) who suggest that given the decision to work,

mothers with more children may use nonstandard work as a means of juggling work and

family

         As displayed in Table 4, occupational status is a strong determinant of a single

mother’s work schedule. Mothers working in technical, sales and support occupations, as

well as protective services, precision production, craft, repairs, farming and fishing; or as

machine operators, assemblers, handlers, equipment cleaners and helpers are less likely to

work standard schedules, compared to the omitted categories (executive, administrative,

managerial occupation), all else equal. This result is not surprising because these are the

types of occupations in which the demand for nonstandard hours is usually high (Presser

and Cox 1997).

         As the descriptive statistics indicate, welfare recipients are more likely to work at

nonstandard jobs than nonrecipients. This may have unintended consequences in long

run as welfare recipients try to advance in their careers over time. This is because it is




                                              20
usually the standard jobs that lead to permanent employment. Therefore, it is important

to consider whether the impact of subsidy receipt differs between welfare recipients and

non-recipients. Normally an indicator for mother’s welfare receipt and its interaction

with the subsidy receipt variable included into the standard/nonstandard work equation

would provide the answer to this question. The differential impact of subsidy receipt on

standard work is captured by the interaction term. However, welfare receipt is likely to

be endogenous to both subsidy receipt and the standard work decision.12 Therefore,

including welfare receipt as an explanatory variable in the standard work equation might

introduce bias to the estimates. In order to avoid this problem, the predicted probability

of welfare receipt is constructed from a first stage regression. Then the predicted

probability and its interaction with the child care subsidy receipt are included in the

standard work equation, which is estimated jointly with the labor force participation and

child care subsidy receipt equations using the discrete factor method explained

previously. A better alternate would be to estimate an equation for welfare receipt jointly

with the system of three equations. However, this alternative is not chosen due to the

sensitivity of results to heterogeneity specification and failure in convergence. The

state’s earnings eligibility limit for TANF for a single parent family of three is used as an

identifying instrument in the first stage.

        The results of the first stage welfare equation are reported in Table A2 and they

behave as one would expect. For example, less educated parents and parents with young

children are more likely to use welfare than others. Whites, Hispanics, parents with better

health and higher nonwage income are less likely to receive welfare than others. The

12
   However, the problem of endogeneity may be less severe once the model is conditioned on employment.
One can argue that once someone decides to work, whether she works standard or nonstandard hours is less
likely to be correlated with the unobserved factors that are also correlated with welfare.


                                                  21
identifying instrument, the state’s TANF earnings eligibility for a single parent family of

three is a positive and significant determinant of welfare receipt. A one hundred dollar

increase in the earnings eligibility limit for a single parent applicant increases her

probability of welfare receipt by 0.92 percentage point.

        The results of the standard work equation with the welfare variable and its

interaction with subsidy receipt are presented in Table 5. The coefficient estimates on

welfare and its interaction with subsidy receipt reveal something important about the role

of child care subsidies on standard work. In particular, the findings indicate that child

care subsidies serve as a major incentive for welfare recipients to work at standard jobs,

but have a very small impact on nonrecipients. A subsidy-receiving mother is only 1.1

percentage points more likely to work at a standard job than a nonreceiving mother if she

is not on welfare. This is a particularly small effect. However, if the mother is on

welfare, she is 13.9 (1.1 + 12.8) percentage points more likely to work at a standard job

when she is offered a child care subsidy. Similarly, welfare recipients are 15.6

percentage points less likely to work at standard jobs than nonrecipients if they are not

offered a subsidy. However, the effect goes down to 3.8 percentage points if they are

offered a subsidy. It must be noted that the model in Table 5 restricts the effects of

variables other than the subsidy receipt to be the same between welfare recipients and

nonrecipients. However, models allowing different effects for age, race, and education

variables did not change the implication of the finding in any significant manner. These

results suggest that child care subsidies induce welfare receiving mothers to work at

standard jobs, but have much less impact for those who do not receive welfare. Most




                                              22
notably, this finding supports the states’ current practice of giving priority to welfare

recipients for child care subsidies.



        Specification Checks

         Occupation Indicators

        As discussed earlier, the set of occupation dummies are strong determinants of

standard work decision. These dummies are included in the analysis in order to control

for the variation in the demand for standard hours and variability in the labor market

conditions among occupations. 13 To ensure that the coefficient estimate of the child care

subsidy receipt is not influenced by the possibility of occupation indicators being

endogenous, the system of equations is estimated with the omission of these indicators.

Once these indicators are dropped, the coefficient estimate on the child care subsidy

becomes for the model in Table 4 becomes 0.280, which is identical to the present

coefficient. Therefore, the effect of child care subsidy receipt is not sensitive to the

omission of occupation indicators.

        Parameters of the state’s child care subsidy system

        According to the theoretical model, the parameters of the state’s subsidy program

(reimbursement rate, co-payment, income eligibility limit, etc) must enter all the

equations. However, it can be argued that these parameters are endogenous. To entertain

the possibility that the child care subsidy coefficient is contaminated by the endogeneity

of the parameters of the state’s subsidy program, the system of equations is estimated

with the omission of these parameters in all three models. In a fully-reduced form model,

13
  Kimmel and Powell (2001) argue that occupations and industries are choices made more in a lifecycle
context, and therefore one would expect more transitions between standard and nonstandard work than
across occupations and industries over an immediate time period.


                                                  23
these parameters are determined by observed parent characteristics, observed features of

the state economy, and unobserved parent and state characteristics. Dropping these

variables had no substantial effect on the estimates. Once these variables are dropped,

the coefficient estimate and the marginal effect on the child care subsidy coefficient for

the model in Table 4 are 0.232 and 0.046, respectively. This result is not surprising since

none of coefficients of these variables was statistically significant when included in the

model originally.

        Identifying instruments

        The choice of identifying instruments for the coefficient of child care subsidy

receipt can theoretically be justified by the model presented earlier. The statistical

support for these variables is verified first by testing whether the coefficients of these

variables have a statistically significant effect in the subsidy equation. As mentioned in

the results section, the p-value from this test is less than 0.01, indicating that they are

jointly significant. This is not surprising given the fact that two of the three coefficients

are highly significant individually in the subsidy equation as displayed in Table 3. The

second step is to verify that these three variables are not improperly excluded from the

standard employment equation. Thus, the system of equations is estimated with the

inclusion of the three variables into the standard employment equation. A likelihood

ratio test failed to reject the hypothesis that the effects of the three instruments are jointly

zero, providing further support that the three variables do not belong in the standard

employment equations.

        Childless women




                                               24
       As a final attempt to investigate the identification issue further, I implemented an

exercise following Blau and Tekin (2003). Specifically, I created a sample of childless

women from the NSAF. Since these women are ineligible for child care subsidies by

definition, a predicted subsidy receipt for a woman with no child should not have any

impact on the probability of her standard work. I constructed a predicted subsidy for a

sample of 4,582 childless women using the coefficients from a subsidy receipt regression

estimated by probit. After the predicted probability of subsidy receipt was constructed

for each woman, I assigned a 1 to a woman’s status of child care subsidy status if her

probability is greater than 0.50 and a 0 if the probability is less than 0.50. Then I

estimated the system of three equations, subsidy receipt, standard employment, and labor

force participation, using FIML. The coefficient estimate on the predicted subsidy

receipt turned out to be, although positive, small in magnitude (0.022) and statistically

insignificant (with a standard error of 0.262). Therefore, the subsidy receipt has no

impact for a group of mothers for whom no such effect is expected.



       VI.     Conclusion

       The evidence linking the quality of the initial job to the probability of maintaining

employment and promoting career advancement suggests that finding a job itself may not

necessarily result in moving single mothers toward economic self-sufficiency in the long

run. It is therefore important to encourage low-income parents to get jobs, which have

the potential to move them up the income ladder. This paper considers child care

subsidies as a policy strategy for accomplishing this goal. Child care subsidies are an

integral part of the new welfare system. Though subsidies are not usually limited to




                                             25
parents who are on welfare, they are especially vital for the success of welfare reform

because of their role in helping parents make the transition from welfare to work and

staying off welfare.

       This paper provides evidence on the relationship between child care subsidies and

standard work using data from the 1999 National Survey of America’s Families. The

findings suggest that child care subsidies induce mothers to work at standard jobs.

Specifically, single mothers with a child care subsidy are 6.1 percentage points more

likely to work standard hours than others, all else being equal. When the impact of

subsidy receipt is allowed to differ between welfare recipients and non-recipients, results

indicate that subsidies generate a relatively substantial incentive (about 14 percentage

points) for single mothers to work at standard jobs while they have a much smaller

impact (about 1 percentage point) on non-recipients. These results underscore the

importance of child care subsidies in helping low income parents, especially welfare

recipients, find jobs with the potential for long term economic self-sufficiency. These

findings are particularly meaningful given the states’ efforts to prioritize TANF recipients

for child care assistance. For example, during 1999, 27 states guaranteed child care

assistance to families transitioning from TANF to work, and 15 gave priority to those

families (State Policy Demonstration Project 1999). However, according to the General

Accounting Office, 23 states made changes to their child care assistance programs and

decreased the availability of assistance since January 2001, mainly because of the

financial crisis they were facing and the exhaustion of TANF surplus from prior years

(GAO 2003). Given these facts, results presented in this paper point to the need for a

substantial increase in the amount child care funding in the new welfare reform bill in




                                            26
order to enable TANF participants to achieve real economic security in the long term.

Prospects of such expansions are not promising however; instead cuts in child care

assistance are more likely in the current debate (Parrott and Mezey 2003).

  A single mother can still receive a child care subsidy even if she does not work if she is engaged in work
related activities, such as training, going to school, etc. Although, I do not analyze the decisions on work-
related activities, this alternative is added to the choice set to account for those mothers.
