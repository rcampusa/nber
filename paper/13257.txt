Does the Minimum Legal Drinking Age Save Lives?

                                            ABSTRACT

The minimum legal drinking age (MLDA) is widely believed to save lives by reducing traffic fatalities
among underage drivers. Further, the Federal Uniform Drinking Age Act, which pressured all states
to adopt an MLDA of 21, is regarded as having contributed enormously to this life saving effect.
This paper challenges both claims. State-level panel data for the past 30 years show that any nationwide
impact of the MLDA is driven by states that increased their MLDA prior to any inducement from the
federal government. Even in early adopting states, the impact of the MLDA did not persist much past
the year of adoption. The MLDA appears to have only a minor impact on teen drinking.

1. Introduction

        The Federal Uniform Drinking Age Act (FUDAA), signed by President Ronald Reagan

on July 17, 1984, threatened to withhold highway construction funds from states that failed to

increase their minimum legal drinking age (MLDA) to 21 by October 1, 1986. Some states

complied without protest, but many states balked and sued the federal government to prevent

implementation of the Act. In South Dakota v. Dole (1987), however, the U.S. Supreme Court

ruled the Act constitutional. The Court decided that the “relatively small financial inducement

offered by Congress” was not so coercive “as to pass the point at which pressure turns into

compulsion.” The Court argued, in particular, that reducing traffic fatalities among 18-20 year

olds was sufficient reason for the federal government to intervene in an arena traditionally

reserved to states.1

        Research subsequent to the Court’s decision appears to confirm that raising the MLDA

saves lives, and much of it points to the FUDAA in particular. Relying on this research, the

National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) attributes substantial declines in

motor vehicle fatalities to federal and state traffic-safety policies, particularly the MLDA21. For

example, NHTSA estimates the cumulative number of lives saved by the MLDA21 at 21,887

through 2002 (U.S. Department of Transportation, March 2005).

        We challenge the view that MLDAs reduce traffic fatalities, based on three findings.

First, the overall impact estimated in earlier research is driven by states that increased their

MLDA prior to any inducement from the federal government. Second, even in early adopting

  In her dissent, Justice Sandra Day O’Connor expressed skepticism that a uniform drinking age
of 21 across the United States would have the “life-saving’ effects that might justify federal
encroachment on rights afforded to states under the 10th Amendment to the Constitution (South
Dakota v. Dole, 1987). The 10th Amendment states, “The powers not delegated to the United
States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States
respectively, or to the people. At least one of the authors believes that, even if the MLDA saves
lives, the FUDAA is not constitutional.

states, the impact of the MLDA did not persist much past the year of adoption. Third, the MLDA

has at most a minor impact on teen drinking.

        The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines the history of the

MLDA and reviews the pre-existing literature. Section 3 examines the aggregate trends in the key

variables. Section 4 describes the state-level data set and presents panel estimates of the relation

between the MLDA and traffic fatalities. Section 5 investigates the effects of the MLDA on teen

drinking.


2. Historical Background and Prior Literature

        When the United States repealed Alcohol Prohibition in 1933, the 21st Amendment left

states free to legalize, regulate, or prohibit alcohol as they saw fit. Most legalized but also

enacted substantial regulation. This new regulation typically included an MLDA.

        Table 1 gives the MLDA set by each state after Prohibition ended.2 State reactions to

federal repeal varied, from Alabama maintaining state-level prohibition to Colorado legalizing

alcohol without a minimum drinking age. In general states set an MLDA between 18 and 21. In

1933, 32 states had an MLDA of 21 and 16 had an MLDA between 18 and 20. With few

exceptions, these MLDAs persisted through the late 1960s.

        Between 1970 and 1976 thirty states lowered their MLDA from 21 to 18. These policy

changes coincided with national efforts toward greater enfranchisement of youth, exemplified by

the 26th Amendment giving 18-20 year olds the right to vote. The reasons for lowering the MLDA

are not well understood and may have varied by state. Perhaps the changes reflected Vietnam-era

logic that a person old enough to die for America is old enough to drink (Asch and Levy 1987,

Mosher 1980). Whatever the reasons, the lower MLDAs “enfranchised” over five million 18-20

year olds to buy alcohol (Males 1986, p. 183).

2
  This table indicates the MLDA for beer with greater than 3.2% alcohol content. The previous
literature has generally ignored that different alcohol types have different MLDAs. We consider
this issue below.
                                                                                               4

        Soon after the reductions in the MLDAs, empirical studies claimed that traffic collisions

and fatalities were increasing in states that lowered their MLDA. Most prominently featured in

congressional discussion were two comprehensive, multi-state studies on the “life-saving” effects

of raising the MLDA—the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) study and the National

Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) study. According to Males (1986), both studies were

referred to more than 50 times in the House and Senate debates, “almost to the exclusion of other

research on the question” (p. 182). 3 These research findings played a key role in reversing the

trend toward lower MLDAs. The justification for the FUDAA, espoused by organizations like the

Presidential Commission on Drunk Driving, the American Medical Association, and the National

Safety Council, was that higher MLDAs resulted in fewer traffic fatalities among 18-20 year olds

(Males, 1986).

        After passage of the FUDAA, all states adopted an MLDA21 by the end of 1988. Table 2

gives the most recent date each state switched to an MLDA21. Several states were early adopters

(Michigan, Illinois, Maryland, and New Jersey), increasing their MLDAs before passage of the

FUDAA. Other states were less eager to change. Colorado, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana, South

Dakota, Texas, and West Virginia passed MLDA21 legislation, for example, but each provided

for repeal if the FUDAA were held unconstitutional (DISCUS, 1996). Texas and Kansas enacted

“sunset provisions” allowing the MLDA to drop back to 18 once federal sanctions expired

(DISCUS, 1996). When the Supreme Court upheld the legality of the FUDAA, states faced a

strong incentive to maintain an MLDA21. Nevertheless, the differences in how states responded

suggests a policy endogeneity that needs to be addressed.

        Several authors have recently summarized the MLDA literature, so we do not review

specific papers in detail (see Shults et al. 2001, Wagenaar and Toomey 2002). Overall the

existing research finds a negative relationship between the MLDA and traffic fatalities, but most

3
 Males (1986) argues that the two studies suffered from methodological and data limitations and
had undeserved influence over the federal decision to intervene in state drinking age laws.
                                                                                                   5

studies omit key variables and mainly analyze either cross-sectional data from one year or time-

series data in one state (Ruhm 1996).

          The most important exception to this summary is Dee (1999), who uses state-level panel

data and controls for state fixed-effects, state trends, year dummies, and other variables. Dee's

estimates “suggest that the movement to [a] higher MLDA reduced … traffic fatalities by at least

9%” (Dee, 1999, p. 314). Dee’s analysis forms the starting point for the empirical work below.

          In addition to considering the impact of the MLDA on traffic fatalities, earlier literature

also considers how the MLDA affects teen drinking.4 Kaestner (2000) explains that most studies

use cross-sectional data and fail to control for unmeasured state characteristics affecting both

alcohol consumption and minimum drinking ages. Again, Dee (1999) is an exception. Using the

same techniques just described, Dee concludes that moving away from an MLDA of 18 is

associated with a reduction in heavy teen drinking of 8.4%. More recently, Carpenter et al.

(2007) replicate Dee (1999) and extend his sample to include 11 more years of data.5 They find

that “exposure to an MLDA of 18 was associated with a statistically significant increase in

drinking participation and heavy drinking of about 4 and 3 percentage points, respectively” (p.

21).6     They acknowledge, however, that adoption of the MLDA21 might have increased

underreporting.


3. An Overview of the Aggregate Data

          Before examining state-level regressions that relate traffic fatality rates (TFR) to

MLDAs, we examine aggregate plots of the key variables. The reason is that state-level data on

traffic fatalities are not available until the mid-1970s, but aggregate data on total and 15-24 year


4
 These studies rely on self-report of alcohol consumption. Outlawing a behavior, however,
might reduce the degree of self-reporting.

    An MLDA of 18 is the most permissive MLDA in the sample.
                                                                                                   6

old fatalities exist back to 1913. The 18-20 year old population is most relevant for the issues in

this paper, but data for this age range are not available until 1975. The 18-20 fatality rate and the

15-24 fatality rate are highly correlated, however, as shown in Figure 1, so examination of the 15-

24 TFR is likely informative.

          Figure 2 presents the TFR for the total population and for 15-24 year olds for the period

1913-2004. These two series follow similar patterns over the past ninety years. Both TFRs

increased from 1913 to 1969 and then decreased thereafter.        This similarity fails to suggest a

major impact of the MLDA, which should have affected the 15-24 TFR more than the total TFR.

The marked decline in the TFR during this period also contravenes claims of a rapid increase in

traffic fatalities after several states decreased their MLDAs between 1970 and 1973. The declines

in the total and 15-24 TFR that began around 1969 long precede the adoptions of an MLDA of 21

in the mid-1980s.

          The data in Figure 2 do not control for the vehicle miles traveled (VMT) each year,

which have increased enormously over the past century (National Safety Council, 2004). Figure

3 shows that fatalities per VMT exhibit a persistent downward trend over the entire sample

period. The 15-24 TFR does seem to increase slightly beginning in the 1960s, even when

controlling for VMT, but the decline returns around 1969, prior to passage of the FUDAA.

          Figure 4 plots the average MLDA for all 50 states against the (VMT-based) TFR for the

15-24 year old age cohort.7 While the average MLDA remained at approximately 20 between

1944 and 1970, traffic fatalities continued to decrease for years and then increased. Then in the

early 1970s, several states lowered their MLDAs, reducing the average to below 19. Yet the brief

increase in traffic fatality rates that occurred in the latter half of the 1970s looks modest in

comparison to the larger, downward trend that preceded these changes to the MLDA. Previous

studies that focused on the late 1970s and the early 1980s were unlikely to see this longstanding


7
    We obtain similar results with a population-weighted, average MLDA.
                                                                                                  7

trend. Overall, the TFR has been decreasing steadily since 1969, but most of the variation in the

MLDA occurred in the 1980s. The one major increase in traffic fatalities, from 1961-1967,

occurred while the average MLDA remained constant.

        The key fact about TFRs, therefore, is that they have been trending downward for

decades and have been poorly correlated with the MLDAs. Moreover, several others factors

likely played a role in this downward movement. These factors include advances in medical

technology, advances in car design (air-bags, anti-lock brakes, seat belts, safety glass), and

improved education about driving strategies and the risks associated with motor vehicles

(Houston et al., 1995).8

        The aggregate data thus provide little confirmation that MLDAs reduce traffic fatalities.

These data also suggest the importance of controlling for pre-existing trends. We address this

concern in the analysis that follows.



4. Data and Results

        We next examine the relation between MLDAs and traffic fatalities using state-level

panel data. This approach is better targeted than the aggregate approach considered above, since

it allows us to compare fatalities within each state to changes in the MLDA in that state.

        We measure traffic fatalities using the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS).

FARS contains the characteristics of vehicles, drivers, occupants, and non-occupants involved in

all recorded fatal motor vehicle accidents in the United States. Dee (1999) uses the FARS to
                                                                                             9
construct a panel data set for the 48 contiguous states over the period 1977-1992.               We

reconstruct Dee’s (1999) data set and extend it to include Alaska, Hawaii, and Washington DC


8
  Harris et al. (2002) find that “the downward trend in lethality [of criminal assault] involves
parallel developments in medical technology and related medical support services.” These appear
to have brought down the homicide rate even as aggravated assault rates remained constant.

 We thank Thomas Dee for generously providing us with some of the data used to replicate his
1999 paper.
                                                                                                            8

and the years 1976 and 1993-2005. We focus on 18-20 year–old fatalities because this group is

most directly affected by changes in MLDA laws.             Robustness checks reported later examine

younger and older age groups.

         We merge the FARS data with population information from the Census Bureau to

construct age-specific vehicular fatality rates. We also include the unemployment rate, real per

capita personal income, a binary indicator for whether a state has a mandatory seat belt law, the

blood alcohol concentration (BAC) limit for legal driving, beer taxes, and total vehicle miles

traveled. The last variable is a proxy for the vehicle miles traveled by 18-20 year olds, as mileage

data are not age-specific. Table 3 presents summary statistics.

         We omit several potentially relevant policies, in part to conform with Dee (1999), in part

because of data availability, and in part because previous studies have found limited evidence of

any impact on traffic fatality rates. These variables include dram shop liability laws, mandatory

sentences for driving under the influence (DUI), sobriety check points, anti-plea bargaining

statutes, changes in tort liability laws that place greater responsibility with intoxicated drivers,

happy-hour regulations, and alcohol education programs.

         Using this data set, we estimate

         ln(TFRst/(1-TFRst)) = β1MLDAst + β2Controlsst + β3 (state trend) + us + vt + est             (1)


where β1 is the point estimate of how MLDA laws influence traffic fatalities, β2 is a vector of

determinants of traffic fatalities, β3 is the linear trend for each state, us is a state fixed-effect, vt is

a year-effect, and est is a mean-zero random error. We choose this form for the dependent

variable to follow Dee (1999). We estimate this specification using weighted least squares. If

TFRst is the traffic fatality rate, and the regressand is ln(TFRst /(1- TFRst)), then the error term is

heteroscedastic, with variance (TFRst (l - TFRst)nst)-1, where nst is the age-specific population for

the fatality rate (Ruhm 1996). In contrast to Dee, we cluster standard errors by state, although
                                                                                                  9

this makes little difference to the results. As in Dee, we initially model the MLDA using separate

variables for an MLDA of 19, 20, or 21 (all other states have 18).

        Table 4 reports estimates of Equation (1).10 Model (1) uses Dee’s sample and replicates

his results closely. In this specification an MLDA21 reduces traffic fatalities by 11.7%.11 The

insignificant coefficients on an MLDA19 and an MLDA20 are in accordance with Dee’s findings.

Model (2) extends the sample to include Alaska, Hawaii, and the District of Columbia, as well as

the years 1976 and 1993-2005. This confirms Dee’s findings that an MLDA21 reduces total

traffic fatalities among 18-20 year olds by about 11%. Model (3) adds VMT, one variable that is

available by state but that Dee did not include, and a dummy for whether the state has a BAC .08

per se law. This reduces the magnitude of the coefficient on MLDA21 to roughly 8%, but the

significance remains. Models (2) and (3) report standard errors clustered by state. The

significance of MLDA21 persists, though neither MLDA19 nor MLDA20 is significant.

        The small and insignificant coefficients on MLDA19 and MLDA20 present a mild

challenge to the claim that the MLDA reduces traffic fatalities. If restricting access to alcohol

works as typically assumed, then though the MLDA21 should have the largest impact, the

MLDA19 and MLDA20 should also reduce fatalities if restricting access works as typically

assumed. This anomaly is not decisive because few states utilized an MLDA of 19 or 20, so the

weak results might just reflect noise. Nevertheless, the coefficients are not always negative and

never significant.

        The results so far support two claims. Panel-data estimates suggest a substantial and

statistically significant impact of the MLDA21. Aggregate data, however, make at most a weak

case, so the overall conclusion is not clear. To reconcile these different estimates, we conduct a

state-by-state analysis of how the MLDA affects traffic fatalities.

        Figure 5 graphs TFR18-20 in several states, along with an indicator for whether the state

adopted an MLDA21. In South Carolina, TFR18-20 was increasing rapidly prior to adoption and

then began a marked decline, consistent with an effect of the MLDA21 in reducing 18-20 year

old fatalities. In California, however, TFR18-20 also declined dramatically even though the

MLDA was 21 throughout.         In South Dakota and Louisiana, TFR18-20 declined prior to the

increase in the MLDA and seems to have decreased at a slower rate after MLDA21 adoption.12

These four graphs, therefore, show a wide range of “impacts” of the MLDA. Plots for all 50

states confirm substantial heterogeneity in MLDA21’s effect.

        To examine this in more detail, Table 5 presents state-by-state estimates of the effects of

the MLDA. Of the 38 states that increased their MLDA over the post 1975 time period, the

MLDA21 reduced fatalities in six at the 5% level and in nine at the 10% level. At the same time,

however, the MLDA21 increased fatalities in four states at the 5% level and in five at the 10%

level. In eleven states the coefficient on MLDA is positive but insignificant while in thirteen it is

negative but insignificant.

        This heterogeneity suggests Dee’s results are driven by a few states in which the impact

is sufficiently negative to outweigh the positive or small impact in most states. The question is

whether this heterogeneity is just sampling variation or something more systematic. We show

below that the overall negative impact results from states that adopted the MLDA21 before

1984—that is, before the FUDAA.

        Table 6 presents evidence for this claim. Model (1) repeats Model (1) from Table 4 for

ease of comparison. Model (2) restricts the sample to those states that adopted the MLDA21 after

1979; this eliminates all states that had an MLDA21 prior to when FARS began collecting data.

12
 South Dakota and Louisiana were two states that challenged the constitutionality of the Federal
Uniform Drinking Age Act.
                                                                                                   11

The results are robust across this change in specification. Model (3) restricts the sample to those

states that changed to an MLDA21 during or after 1983.13 Again the MLDA 21 is significant,

with a point estimate of -.07.

           Model (4), however, which restricts the sample to states that changed their MLDA to 21

during or after 1984, results in a lower point estimate (-.04) that is not significant at even the 10%

level. Model (5), which restricts the sample to those states that changed the MLDA after 1984,

produces a coefficient on MLDA21 near zero with a t-statistic of -.21.14 Model (6) excludes

Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, and New Jersey, the four earliest states to change their MLDA back

to 21, each doing so on or before January 1983. When the sample excludes these states, the

significance of MLDA21 disappears and its magnitude drops to -0.035.15

           The year 1984 is when the federal government became directly involved in state-level

MLDA legislation. The federal government’s threat to withhold highway funding from states is

arguably an exogenous shock to state-level MLDA policy. Thus if causality is to be attributed to

the MLDA, inference should focus especially on states that increased their MLDAs in response to

this (arguably) exogenous pressure. Yet the results for these states show virtually no effect of the

MLDA21. Those states driving the relation between MLDA21 and TFR18-20 are the ones that

proactively changed their MLDA legislation prior to federal involvement.

           These results suggest that, at most, the MLDA21 reduced TFR18-20 in states that

adopted on their own. This raises the question of endogeneity. The MLDA21 in these states may

have been enacted in response to grassroots concern against drunk driving or implemented

alongside other efforts to reduce traffic fatalities.


13
     No states changed their MLDA to 21 in 1981 or 1982.
14
  The MLDA laws were coded such that a year cell has an MLDA21 indicator of 1 if the MLDA
of 21 was in effect for at least half that year. As the FUDAA was passed in July, Model (4)
includes states that adopted an MLDA21 before its passage. Model (5) differs in including states
that adopted an MLDA21 after 1984.
15
     These results are robust across specifications that allow for quadratic state trends.
                                                                                                 12

        To address the possible endogeneity of MLDA legislation, we modify the specification of

the MLDA variable. Instead of a dummy for years in which it is in effect, we include several

binary variables representing an interval of time in relation to the date a state enacted an

MLDA21. For example, the binary variable “5-6 Before” is equal to 1 for every state-year that is

5-6 years before a state adopted an MLDA of 21. The other intervals included in the regressions

are “3-4 Before,” “1-2 Before,” “Year of Enactment,” “1-2 After,” “3-4 After,” “5-6 After,” “7-8

After,” and “9-10 After.” This empirical strategy improves on the approach in Section 4 because

the time pattern of policy effects informs both the extent of policy endogeneity and the

persistence of the policy’s effect.

        Table 7 gives estimates of this alternative specification; figures 6-9 plot the coefficients

and standard error bands on the MLDA21 variables. Model (1) supports the claim that the

MLDA legislation was not a significant determinant of traffic fatality rates, as none of the

coefficients is significant at even the 10% level. The pattern of coefficients mildly suggests that

the MLDA reduces TFR18-20, but the pre-adoption coefficients are positive, and the effect

approaches zero in the years following enactment.

        In Model (2), which includes only the states that adopted their MLDA21 during or prior

to 1983, there does seem to be a significant and large drop in fatalities during the year of MLDA

increase. Though not significant, this decrease predates the adoption of the MLDA21 across

states, as illustrated by the negative coefficients on the binary indicators dating back six years

before policy enactment. In the year of adoption, fatalities declined 16.7% at the 5% significance

level. Yet as early as 1-2 years after enactment, the MLDA is no longer significant and the point

estimate increases from -16.7% to -5.4%. More interestingly, the MLDA21 seems to increase

fatalities from three to six years after enactment, although the result is not significant. This

suggests the fatality-reductions due to MLDA21 policies were transient or even perverse.

        Model (3) restricts the sample to those states that enacted an MLDA21 during or after

1984. Those states experienced increases in 18-20 year old fatalities leading up to enactment of
                                                                                                   13

an MLDA21; upon the adoption, there was no significant decrease in fatalities, and as soon as 1-2

years after adoption the increase in traffic fatalities became significant at the 10% level. As with

the early adopters, the coefficient on MLDA21 approaches zero five years beyond adoption.

           Model (4) restricts the sample to states that adopted the MLDA21 after 1984. The

estimates suggest that 1 to 2 years after adoption, states experienced a 10% increase in 18-20

traffic fatalities, significant at the 1% level. The effect persists at the 10% significance level 3-4

years after the adoption. In these states the traffic fatality rate of 18-20 year olds seems to have

been increasing prior to the adoption of the MLDA 21. In states that were pressured to change

their MLDAs, the changes were likely inconsequential or even counterproductive.16

           Several additional findings are also inconsistent with the claim that the minimum legal

drinking age reduces traffic fatalities. Table 8 presents regressions analogous to those in Table 6,

but using the 17 year old driver fatalities as the dependent variable, find that MLDA19,

MLDA20, and MLDA21 all increase traffic fatalities at the 5% level of significance.              One

explanation is that when the MLDA is 18, more high school students have access to alcohol

through peer networks, including 18 year olds. When the MLDA is higher, these peer networks

are less effective at obtaining alcohol, so individuals younger than 18 feel pressure to drink

intensely at each drinking occasion. Alternatively, when the MLDA is 18, law enforcement

monitors the drinking behavior of individuals aged 17 and younger. When the MLDA is 21, this

monitoring is spread more thinly, resulting in more drinking among 17 year olds.

           A final result concerns construction of the MLDA variable. Many states employ different

MLDAs for different categories of alcoholic beverages. For example, as of October 1983, North

Carolina had an MLDA of 19 for beer and table wine but an MLDA of 21 for fortified wine and

distilled spirits. Historically, states have been most willing to lower their MLDAs for beer. When

it happens that only one alcohol category has an MLDA below 21, the MLDA variable used in



16
     These results are robust across specifications that allow for quadratic state trends.
                                                                                                   14

earlier literature and our regressions has been set to that value. This might provide a misleading

picture of the MLDA’s impact.

         To address this we estimate models that include an MLDA variable for strong beer, weak

beer, fortified wine, table wine, and spirits. Table 9 presents results. In this specification none of

the coefficients on an MLDA variable is significant, and no single coefficient has an absolute

value greater than .03. The coefficients on the MLDA for strong beer and fortified wine are

positive, while the coefficients on the MLDA for weak beer, table wine, and spirits are negative.

This lack of consistency reaffirms the tenuous relationship between the MLDA and traffic

fatalities.


5. The MLDA and Teen Alcohol Consumption

         The final question we address is why the MLDA does not appear to have had much effect

on traffic fatalities. One possibility is that although the MLDA reduces 18-20 year old drinking,

it does so mainly for those who drink responsibly. Another possibility is that the MLDA does not

reduce drinking to a substantial degree. The previous literature has suggested that the MLDA

does reduce teen drinking. We revisit that question here.

         We utilize data from Monitoring the Future, an annual survey of high school seniors that

contains measures of drinking habits. We employ the two specific measures common in the

literature, “drinker” (having any drink of alcohol in the last month), and “heavy episodic drinker”

(having five or more drinks in a row at some point in the last two weeks). We also examine the

number of motor vehicle accidents that respondents report as occurring after consuming alcohol.

We estimate regressions similar to those considered above but with these dependent variables.

The measure of the MLDA is identical to that used in previous literature, a dummy for having a

drinking age of 18.

         Tables 10 and Table 11 give results.        Though we use slightly different data than

Carpenter et al. (2007), we approximate their findings. Models (1) and (2) in Tables 10 and 11
                                                                                                  15

show an MLDA18 is associated with an almost 4% increase in drinking participation rates, and

approximately a 3% increase in heavy episodic drinking rates, both significant at the 1% level.

        Model (3) and (4), however, suggest that these reductions derive mainly from states that

adopted the MLDA21 before enactment of the FUDAA.17 Model (3) shows that in the early-

adopting states, the MLDA 18 is associated with a 5% increase in drinking participation and a

3.7% increase in heavy drinking, both significant at the 1% level. In later-adopting states,

exposure to an MLDA of 18 has a weaker and insignificant effect on alcohol consumption.

        Two interpretations of these results are possible. The absence of any effect of MLDA18

in reducing drinking in the coerced adopters is consistent with the absence of any effect of

MLDA21 on traffic fatalities. The negative effects found for early adopters might reflect a true

reduction in alcohol consumption and also explain a reduction in fatalities in these states.   Yet

these negative effects might also reflect an increase in underreporting in the MTF data due to

enactment of MLDA21.

        One mechanism for resolving this is to examine the number of alcohol-related traffic

accidents reported by MTF respondents. If the MLDA works as predicted and underage persons

are deterred from drinking, the number of accidents post-alcohol consumption should decline

when a state adopts an MLDA21. The results in Table 13 are telling. The panel estimates reveal

that movement away from an MLDA of 18 is associated with a statistically insignificant

-.0007 change in reporting of alcohol-related traffic accidents. Given these findings, it is not

surprising that Higson et al. found that “although the modes of procuring alcohol changed, no

significant changes were observed in Massachusetts relative to New York in the proportion of

surveyed teenagers who reported that they drank or in the volume of their consumption” (p. 163).




17
   The relevance of the MLDA of 21 to consumption patterns among high school seniors is that in
a large number of states, movement away from a drinking age of 18 was brought about by the
adoption of an MLDA of 21.
                                                                                                16

7. Conclusion

        The MLDA21 is predicated on the belief that it reduces alcohol-related teen traffic-

fatalities. We challenge that claim, showing that the MLDA fails to have the fatality-reducing

effects that previous papers have reported.

        If not the MLDA, then what might explain the drastic reductions in traffic fatalities over

the past half century? Figure 2 suggests that the decline began in the year 1969, the year in which

several landmark improvements were made in the accident avoidance and crash protection

features of passenger cars. Table 13, taken from Crandall et al. (1986) shows just how many

federal safety standards were introduced in the 1968 model year. They explain that “most of these

standards for new automobiles were in place by 1970,” which allowed for improvements in over

three dozen safety measures not previously found in automobiles (Crandall et all, 1986, p. 47).

Further research might operationalize these advancements in vehicle safety as they are likely to

be major determinants of the declining traffic fatality trends.

        The same effort should be made to measure and control for advances in medical

technology. In this way, researchers can ascertain whether traffic fatalities are declining because

traffic crashes are becoming less frequent or becoming less lethal. Future studies estimating the

relationship between the MLDA and traffic fatality rates might use as control variables the

number of blood banks, the number of hospital admissions, the number of hospitals that provide

open-heart surgery, the number of hospital affiliated physicians, or the number of hospital beds in

the state (Harris et al., 2002).

        In arguing against an MLDA of 21, this paper also challenges the desirability of coercive

federalism. The case of the drinking age informs several other public policy debates, including

the appropriateness of the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB). When the governor of Utah

attempted to ignore NCLB’s provisions that conflicted with Utah’s own education policy, the

Department of Education threatened to withhold federal education funding (Fusarelli, 2005).

Fusarelli (2005) argues that such actions demonstrate that in just “a few short years, federal
                                                                                          17

education policy had shifted from minimal federal involvement (President Reagan wanted to

abolish the U.S. Department of Education) to the development of voluntary national standards

(under President Clinton) to the new law mandating testing of all students in Grades 3–8” (p.

121). Whether Congress has violated the 10th amendment with NCLB is a question left for the

Supreme Court. Nevertheless, the empirical strategy employed in this paper might tease out

whether the successes attributed to the NCLB are similarly driven by states that proactively

adopted its standards of education reform prior to the federal mandate.

The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of TFRst /(1-TFRst ) where TFRst is the 18-20 year
old total fatality rate for state s at time t. The estimations are weighted by n(TFRst )(1-TFRst )
where n is 18-20 year old population in state s at time t. Dee’s results, as well as Models (1) and
(2) include variables controlling for the state unemployment rate, state average per capita
personal income, the beer tax rate in the state, and a binary indicator for any mandatory seat belt
law. Additionally, Model (3) controls for whether the state has a BAC .08 law and vehicle miles
traveled within the state. Robust standard errors are reported below point estimates for Models (1)
– (3). Standard errors clustered by state are reported for Model (2) and Model (3). Dee’s original
results were reported with t-statistics instead of standard errors, and are reproduced as such.

The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of TFRt /(1-TFRt ) where TFRt is the 18-
20 year old total fatality rate at time t. States with black cells are ones that had already
had in place an MLDA of 21 before 1976, and thus had no variation in MLDA over
the last 30 years. Red indicates a coefficient is negative and significant at least at the
10% level. Blue indicates a coefficient is positive and significant at least at the 10%
level. The regressions include controls for the state unemployment rate, state average per
capita personal income, the beer tax rate in the state, total vehicle miles traveled in the
state, the BAC limit for driving in a state, and a binary indicator for any mandatory seat
belt law. Newey-West HAC standard errors are reported.

     Carpenter et al. (2007) includes controls for demographic covariates, including: age, a male
     indicator, an indicator for Hispanic ethnicity, an indicator for African American race, and an
     indicator for “other race,” as well as levels of the beer tax and presence of Zero Tolerance laws in
     a state-year. My controls include presence of BAC .08 per se law, state unemployment rates, per
     capita personal income rates, beer tax rates, and age of respondent. Robust standard errors are
     reported below point estimates for Models (1)-(4). The results in Carpenter et al. (2007) were
     reported with t-statistics instead of standard errors, and are reproduced as such.

The model includes variables controlling for the age of the respondent, the state
unemployment rate, state average per capita personal income, the beer tax rate in the state,
vehicle miles traveled within state, the BAC limit for driving in a state, and a binary indicator
for any mandatory seat belt law. They also allow for linear state trends. Robust standard
errors are reported below point estimates.
