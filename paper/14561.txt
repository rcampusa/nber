We investigate inflation targeting (IT) in emerging markets, focusing on the role of the real exchange
rate and the distinction between commodity and non-commodity exporters. IT emerging markets appear
to follow a “mixed strategy” whereby both inflation and real exchange rates are important determinants
of policy interest rates. The response to real exchange rates, however, is more constrained than in non-IT
regimes. We also find that the response to real exchange rates is strongest in those countries following
IT policies that are relatively intensive in exporting basic commodities; and present a theoretical model
that explains these empirical results.

       Inflation targeting is becoming a standard operating procedure for central banks

around the world. By mid 2008, most central banks in the OECD countries1 and a

growing number of developing economies had adopted inflation targeting. There is no

international coordination to promote this monetary regime change, and countries do not

join an internationally recognized monetary system nor follow common “rules of the

game.” Adopters of inflation targeting do so primarily because of the framework’s

perceived success in delivering low and stable inflation.

       Despite its popularity, there is substantial controversy and mixed empirical

evidence in the evaluation of the inflation-targeting framework. There are two main

empirical approaches. The first approach focuses on the macroeconomic outcomes of

countries following inflation-targeting regimes as compared to non-targeting countries.

Although few argue that inflation targeting has harmful effects, there remains a vigorous

academic and policy debate over whether the adoption of this monetary regime in

advanced industrial countries has contributed to substantial declines in average inflation,

lower inflation volatility and general macroeconomic stability compared to those

countries not following inflation-targeting rules.2

       The second empirical approach evaluating inflation-targeting (IT) policies focuses

on central bank behavior under inflation targeting and non-targeting and how they

operate in an IT environment. Even in this strand of the literature there is mixed evidence

over whether formal adoption of an inflation targeting regime substantively changes the

behavior of central banks, and in particular their responses to inflation and output gaps.




                                              1
       This paper investigates the empirics of inflation targeting in emerging market

economies within the context of the second strand of the literature—central bank

operating behavior. We focus in particular on emerging-market central banks’ responses

to inflation, output gaps and real exchange rates using Taylor rule models (as in Clarida

et al., 1998). Our aim is to distinguish between episodes when central banks are

committed to an explicit inflation-targeting monetary regime and those periods of time

when they are not (including central banks that have never followed inflation targeting).

We focus on two factors critical to the conduct and control of monetary policy in

emerging markets—wide swings in the real exchange rate and the extent to which the

countries are concentrated in commodity exports. We demonstrate, in the context of a

simple illustrative model, that these distinguishing characteristics are in principle

important in designing the form of the monetary policy rule. For a commodity exporting

country that is vulnerable to terms-of-trade shocks, in particular, when experiencing large

real exchange rate shocks that can affect potential output a modified version of inflation

targeting dominates a pure inflation targeting strategy.

       Our empirical work is based on panel-data so as to distinguish between group

characteristics, respectively, of the inflation-targeting and non-targeting central banks in

emerging markets and further between commodity exporting inflation targeters from

other IT regime countries. We characterize inflation targeting strategies in the context of

a modified Taylor rule operating procedure, and demonstrate that this rule varies

markedly from non-targeting emerging markets (as well as inflation-targeting industrial

countries). Moreover, our focus is on the role of the real exchange rate in the policy rule




                                              2
and how this is affected by the countries’ exposure to commodity-intensive production

(and, hence, terms-of-trade shocks).

       Four factors motivate our empirical research. Firstly, the great bulk of the

research in this area is concerned with inflation targeting in advanced industrial countries

and relatively less research addresses the particular features of inflation targeting in

emerging markets3. There are many reasons that emerging markets may differ from

industrial countries in the approach to inflation targeting. These reasons include different

institutional arrangements, especially those relating to the credibility and political

independence of the central bank, different inflation and macroeconomic histories,

different exposures to terms-of-trade shocks, and different levels of financial

development. Aghion et al. (2006) demonstrate that countries with relatively less

developed financial sectors are more likely to suffer output losses associated with

exchange rate volatility. In this case, greater concern for real exchange rate volatility may

lead central banks in emerging markets—countries with lower levels of financial

development than industrial countries—to follow a monetary policy rule (Taylor rule)

that captures some form of target inflation, output deviations from the natural rate and

real exchange rate fluctuations.

       Secondly, our emphasis is on introducing real exchange rate fluctuations into the

inflation-targeting framework. Real exchange rates are likely to play an important role in

the formulation of optimal monetary policy in emerging markets, as shown theoretically

in our illustrative model (appendix A), and we examine this connection in our estimations

of de facto policy rules.




                                              3
       Thirdly, the distinction between heavily concentrated commodity-exporting

emerging markets and non-concentrated emerging markets is potentially important in

how inflation targeters work in practice. This difference accounts for different

vulnerability to terms-of-trade shocks. We explore this distinction.

       Fourthly, we follow a panel methodological approach in examining these issues.

Most other studies in this area have relied upon individual country time-series analysis. A

panel analysis provides some advantages since it allows clear focus on characteristics of

policy rules common to inflation-targeting countries treated as a group and allows us to

distinguish them from non-inflation targeting countries.

       Our results indicate that the publically announced adoption of inflation targeting

strategies by central banks in emerging markets, often with much fanfare, is a substantive

deviation from past monetary policy formulation and sharply different from non-targeting

emerging markets. As our theoretical model predicts, however, inflation targeting

emerging markets are not following “pure” inflation targeting strategies. Rather, we find

that external variables play a very important role in the policy rule— inflation-targeting

central banks in emerging markets systematically respond to the real exchange rate. Of

the inflation targeting group, those with particularly high concentration in commodity

exports change interest rates much more pro-actively to real exchange rate changes than

do the non-commodity intensive group. Overall, our results are robust to a variety of

model formulations and estimation strategies.

       The next section discusses the inflation targeting literature as it applies to

emerging markets, and highlights the gap in the empirical literature which we address in

our contribution. Section 3 presents the data, descriptive statistics and empirical model.

theoretical model that motivates our empirical formulation of the policy rule equations.

          2.      INFLATION TARGETING IN EMERGING MARKETS

       There is a large empirical literature on inflation targeting, most of which focuses

on advanced industrial countries. These studies generally take one of two approaches.

The first approach measures the effects of inflation targeting on inflation, inflation

volatility, and other macroeconomic variables. The second approach focuses on

characterizing central bank operating procedures, attempting to distinguish between

policy functions of inflation targeting countries and those not targeting inflation. Studies

in the first strand of the empirical literature employ both individual country time-series

and multi-country panel methods, while the second strand of literature is almost

exclusively focused on individual country time-series.

                       (a) Macroeconomic effects of inflation targeting

       Empirical studies generally find mixed results on the effects of inflation targeting

on inflation and other macroeconomic variables. For example, Johnson (2002) undertakes

a panel study consisting of five IT (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Sweden and the

United Kingdom) and six non-IT advanced industrial countries. He finds that the

announcement of inflation targets materially lowers expected inflation (controlling for

business cycle effects, past inflation and fixed effects). Also in the context of a panel

regression framework, Mishkin and Schmidt-Hebbel (2007) similarly conclude that

inflation targeting does make a difference in advanced industrial countries by helping

them achieve lower inflation in the long run and have smaller inflation responses to oil

and exchange rate shocks. However, the results for advanced country inflation-targeters


                                              5
are very similar to their high-performing country control group.4 Rose (2007) argues that

inflation targeting is a very durable (long-lasting) regime compared to other monetary

regimes and that inflation targeters have both lower exchange rate volatility and less

frequent “sudden stops” of capital flows. By contrast, Ball and Sheridan (2005), in a

cross-section investigation, reject any long-term differences between advanced industrial

inflation targeters (seven countries) and non-targeters (thirteen countries).

       The experience and relative success of emerging markets with inflation targeting

is somewhat more supportive, although this remains controversial. Mishkin and Schmidt-

Hebbel (2007) find that inflation targeting in emerging countries performs less well than

in advanced industrial countries, although the pre- and post-inflation targeting reductions

in inflation in emerging markets are substantial.5 The IMF (2005), using the methodology

of Ball and Sheridan (2005), presents results of a study focusing on 13 emerging market

inflation targeters compared with 29 other emerging markets. They report that inflation

targeting is associated with a significant 4.8 percentage point reduction in average

inflation, and a reduction in its standard deviation of 3.6 percentage points relative to

other monetary strategies.

       Gonçalves and Salles (2008) and Lin and Ye (2009), using different

methodologies, reach similar conclusions to the IMF study; they find that adoption of an

inflation targeting regime leads to lower average inflation rates and reduced volatility

compared to a control group of non-targeters. A recent edited volume on inflation

targeting in emerging markets, focusing mainly on individual country case studies, also

finds quite positive outcomes associated with the adoption of IT regimes (De Mello,

2008). In contrast, a more recent paper argues that once common time trends are



                                              6
accounted for, this positive benefit of IT regimes disappears and even argues that the

disinflation period is potentially more recessionary under IT (Brito and Bystedt, 2010).

                               (b) Policy functions in IT regimes

   In terms of central bank policy functions, Clarida, Gali and Gertler (1998) focus on

six major industrial countries and suggest that the G3 (Germany, Japan and U.S.) have

followed an implicit form of inflation targeting since 1979. The main evidence for this

conclusion is that these central banks are forward looking, and respond to anticipated as

opposed to lagged inflation. Clarida et al. (1998) argue that the success of the G3 in

lowering inflation and keeping inflation at a low level may be attributable to this implicit

inflation-targeting policy. They conclude that inflation targeting may be superior to fixing

exchange rates as a nominal anchor (as was prevalent in their sample period for the G3

countries of France, Italy and the United Kingdom). They found the response to real

exchange rates is significant and of the expected sign, but small in magnitude for

Germany and Japan.

   Other studies have investigated differences in IT and non-IT policy regimes by

explicitly estimating “Taylor rule” equations for individual countries. A number of

studies in this genre, focusing on advanced industrial countries, find some evidence that

countries are following significantly different policy rules in IT regimes (e.g. Mohanty

and Klau, 2005; Edwards, 2006; Corbo et al., 2001). For example, Corbo et al. (2001)

find somewhat mixed evidence for seventeen OECD countries estimated individually.

They find that inflation targeters exhibit the largest inflation gap coefficient (response to

inflation) relative to the output gap coefficient (response to output), although in most

cases the coefficients are not statistically different from zero. Lubik and Schorfheide


                                              7
(2007) estimate a calibrated small-scale GE model for a small open economy using data

for Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom over 1983 to 2002

(quarterly data). They consider Taylor-type rules, where the authorities respond to output,

inflation and exchange rates. They find that Australia and New Zealand change interest

rates in response to exchange rate movements, but that Canada and the United Kingdom

do not respond to exchange rates.

   Dennis (2003) investigates several models for the Australian experience and finds

that the authorities should optimally focus not just on inflation but also on real exchange

rate fluctuations and terms of trade when they set interest rates to the extent that import

goods are consumption goods (and enter into CPI). Ravenna (2008) considers the

Canadian case with IT targeting. He estimates a DSG model and is able to determine

whether the good inflation performance of Canada since adopting an IT regime is due to

the IT policy or to “good luck.” He finds that low average inflation since adopting the IT

regime is associated with the credibility of policy under this regime. However, the lower

volatility of inflation is mainly associated with “good luck” in that few major adverse

shocks have impacted the Canadian economy during this period.

   Other studies suggest that monetary policy operating procedures do not

fundamentally change with the move to an IT regime. Drueker and Fischer (2006), for

example, find “no difference” in the monetary policy rules followed by IT countries and

comparable non-IT countries in their own empirical work, and at best mixed evidence

supporting any substantive difference in numerous studies in their survey of the subject.

They estimate individual country time-series regressions and compare high-performing

advanced industrial countries that are following an IT regime and those that are not. A




                                              8
more recent contribution that attempts to explain this indifference, concludes that

inflation targeting is not a binary choice and develops an index for measuring the ‘extent’

of inflation targeting pursed by the monetary regime (Miao, 2009).6

          (c) Policy rules, real exchange rates and commodity export concentration

        Only a few empirical studies focus on central bank reaction functions in emerging

markets, and this is done on a case by case basis. Schmidt-Hebbel and Werner (2002)

apply common empirical framework (VAR models) to compare the experiences of Brazil,

Chile and Mexico with inflation targeting. They estimate Taylor rule equations for each

country with the real interest rate as the dependent variable. Only for Brazil is the

expected inflation gap statistically significant, whereas only for Chile is the output gap

statistically significant. They do find that the trade surplus (lagged) enters negatively and

significantly in most cases (i.e. trade surplus leads to decline in real interest rate) and that

this effect dominates all other variables. They find that these countries continue to

respond to exchange rate changes in the short-term, if not the medium-term, and

characterize them as “dirty” floaters.7

        Corbo et al. (2001) estimate Taylor-rule type equations for eight emerging-market

economies over 1990-1999 using quarterly data. They classify countries during the 1990s

as IT, potential IT and non-IT.8 Two emerging markets are in their IT category (Chile and

Israel), five are in the potentially targeting category (South Africa, Brazil, Colombia,

Mexico and Korea) and one is in the non-IT category (Indonesia). In the IT and potential

IT categories, four (two) central banks appear to respond to inflation (output) deviations

from target in setting interest rates. The authors do not test, in their Taylor rule estimates,

whether central banks in emerging markets consider external variables.


                                               9
       Mohanty and Klau (2004) estimate modified Taylor rules for 13 emerging market

and transition economies, complementing inflation, the output gap and lagged interest

rates with current and lagged real exchange rate changes. They find that the coefficients

on real exchange rate changes are statistically significant in ten countries (OLS

estimates), with the significant contemporaneous effect ranging from -0.33 (Brazil) to

0.35 (Chile). The policy response to exchange rate changes is frequently larger than the

response to inflation and the output gap. They conclude that this supports the “fear of

floating” hypothesis. Mohanty and Klau (2004) do not explicitly address the inflation

targeting issue in this context, but it is apparent that these countries, whether or not they

profess to follow an IT regime, are attempting to stabilize real exchange rates as well as

control inflation and stabilize output.

       Edwards (2006) investigates the determinants of the exchange rate response in the

Taylor-rule regressions, building on the work by Mohanty and Klau (2004). He runs

cross-country regressions of the exchange rate coefficient on several explanatory

variables (each regression with 13 observations). Edwards (2006) finds that countries

with a history of high inflation, and with historically high real exchange rate volatility,

tend to have a higher coefficient (response) to the real exchange rate in Taylor rule

equations, yet he does not distinguish the degree of exposure to terms-of-terms shocks

that is especially large for commodity exporting countries.

       De Mello and Moccero (2008) estimate interest rate policy rules for four Latin

American emerging markets—Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico—characterized by

inflation targeting and floating exchange rates in 1999. They estimate an interest rate

policy function in the context of a New Keynesian structural model with equations for



                                              10
inflation, output and interest rates. They find inflation targeting, in a post-1999 regime,

has been associated with stronger and persistent responses to expected inflation in Brazil

and Chile. Mexico is the only country they find where changes in nominal exchange rates

were found to be statistically significant in the central bank’s reaction function during the

IT period.

       Taking a different approach, Ball and Reyes (2004 and 2008), compare IT

regimes to the Fear-of-Floating policy pursed by many countries. They conclude that

these are distinctly different regimes and that the IT regimes are more similar (in terms of

the behavior of interest rates, exchange rates, and other variables) to floating regimes

than to the fear-of-floating ones.

                     (d) Importance of real exchange rates for IT regimes

       The theoretical importance of the real exchange rate to the conduct of monetary

policy in an IT regime is presented in appendix A. We illustrate these considerations in a

simplified version of Ball (1999), where the policy maker is concerned about real

exchange rate volatility.9 The wish to mitigate exchange rate volatility follows the logic

of Aghion et al. (2009), who show that exchange rate volatility reduces productivity in

developing countries, attributing it to financial channels. Aghion et al. (2009) find that

the adverse effects of exchange rate volatility are larger for the less financially developed

countries. These adverse effects are significant for practically all the emerging markets

and developing countries, which are the focus of our paper.10 Importantly, their study

used data prior to the 2008-9 crisis, a crisis that vividly illustrated that even emerging

markets with high levels of financial development (as measured, for example, by the ratio




                                              11
of private credit to GDP) have been heavily exposed to the adverse repercussions of

exchange rate volatility.11

        The adverse effect of volatility may be the outcome of increasing the expected

cost of funds in circumstances where agency and contract enforcement costs are

prevalent, the financial system is shallow, and trade openness is significant.12 These

conditions tend to be exacerbated in developing countries relying heavily on mineral and

other commodity exports. Our simulated model, as presented in figure 1A of the

appendix, confirms that a greater weight on mitigating exchange rate volatility tends to

increase the responsiveness of the policy rule to exchange rate changes, possibly with

sizable welfare effects.13

       Our focus is on the short run stabilization of the real exchange rate, where the

policy maker presumes, short of better information, that the equilibrium REER is highly

persistent, thus most of the short run shocks may reflect transitory disturbances. This

presumption reflects both the persistency of the REER, and the wide standard errors

associated with predicting equilibrium exchange rates (see further discussion in

Eichengreen, 2007).

       There are, of course, other possible reasons why a central bank pursing an IT

strategy will choose to also concern itself with the exchange rate. This is true especially

in emerging markets given their shallow currency markets, their short-history of stable

inflation, the importance of the exchange rate as an anchor for expectations and the

possibility of currency mismatch exposure in strategically important sectors (see Amato

and Gerlach, 2002). In a recent more analyitical work, Pavasuthipaisit (2010) develops a




                                             12
DSGE model that also concludes that IT regimes should respond to the exchange rate

shocks under certain conditions that the paper outlines.

       Given these considerations, we test the degree to which the policy rule adopted by

IT commodity-intensive developing countries differs from that of the IT non-commodity

exporters, finding support to the greater sensitivity of commodity IT countries to

exchange rate changes.14

                                         3. DATA

       As we detail in the introduction, our focus is on emerging markets. We classify

emerging markets using the list of countries included in Morgan Stanley’s MSCI

Emerging Markets Index. The 16 countries in our dataset are: Argentina, Brazil,

Colombia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, Jordan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico,

Morocco, Peru, Philippines, Poland and Thailand (Appendix B)15. The data sample was

restricted by using quarterly data (annual data provides a much larger group of countries)

and by countries that use nominal interest rates as a primary operating instrument of

monetary policy.

       We rely on Mishkin and Schmidt-Hebbel (2007) to identify the monetary regime

and the exact start date of inflation targeting though the IT start dates given by Rose

(2007) are almost identical. We collect quarterly data for these 16 emerging market

countries for 1989Q1 to 2006Q4 - transition economies only have available data starting

in the beginning of the 1990s. We delete from our dataset hyperinflationary periods

(annual inflation higher than 40%). Our primary source for data is the IMF’s International

Finance Statistics CD-ROM, more details are provided in the data appendix (Appendix

C).

                                     (a) Preliminaries

       Table 1 describes the main variables we examine and their descriptive statistics

for our sample of emerging markets. The first column shows the mean and standard

deviation for those country-quarter observations in which an inflation-targeting regime

was in place. The second column includes the sample of observations consisting of

countries who never adopted an IT regime and IT countries before their adoption of an IT

regime.

                                           [table 1 here]

       GDP growth is virtually the same in the IT and non-IT samples, while inflation is

about half of the level on average in IT regimes (5.4 percent) compared to non-IT

regimes (9.6 percent). The average level of nominal interest rates is 3.7 percentage points

less in the IT sample compared with the non-IT sample, a somewhat smaller difference

than the 4.2 percentage point difference in inflation rates between the two regimes,

indicating somewhat higher average short-term real interest rates in the IT sample.

       The external variables indicate that IT emerging markets appear to experience a

substantially higher rate of average depreciation of the real exchange rate and lower rate

of international reserve accumulation. This suggests less exchange rate management on

the part of the IT countries. Due to the large variability of the sample observations,

however, none of these differences are statistically significant using standard thresholds.

       In order to examine the time-series properties of our data and assess the

appropriate estimation methodology we conduct panel unit root tests (Appendix D). We



                                             14
employ the panel unit root tests described in Levin et al. (2002) and Breitung (2000) and

reject unit roots for all of our time series using at least one or both of these tests.16

                                          (b) Taylor Rule Regression Results

           Following an extensive literature that originates from Taylor (1993), we assume a

monetary policy reaction function of the following form:

it = ρ it −1 + α ( yt − y * ) + β (π t − π * ) + γ X t                         (1)


As is standard in this literature, we assume the authorities, in setting the policy interest

rate, react to both the output gap and the inflation gap. In addition, following English et

al. (2002), we assume a policy smoothing goal that manifests in a lagged interest rate on

the RHS. The main focus of this paper, however, are a set of possible external variables

( X t ) that may also be part of the policy reaction function. Our estimation equation for a

panel of 16 emerging-market countries is:

ii ,t = μi + ρ ii ,t −1 + α ( yi ,t − yi ) + βπ i ,t + γ X i ,t + ε i ,t       (2)


The inflation target variable ( π * ) is assumed to be time invariant for each country and is

subsumed in the country fixed-effect ( μi ) parameter.


           Table 2 presents the estimates for the benchmark Taylor rule regressions

employing a fixed-effects least-squares estimation procedure (LSDV).17 Column (1) and

(4) presents the benchmark model without external variables for the IT and non-IT

samples, respectively. The other columns extend the benchmark to the external variables.

Columns (2) and (5) combine the benchmark model with the percentage change in the




                                                                    15
real exchange rate, and columns (3) and (6) combine the benchmark model with the

percentage change in international reserve holdings.

                                            [table 2 here]

       The model explains much of the variability in interest rates, with explanatory

power ranging from 73-80% (adjusted R2). The degree of persistence, measured by the

lagged interest rate coefficient, is quite high. The persistence in the IT group is

marginally higher than in the non-targeting group. The coefficient on inflation is highly

significant, large and stable (with a narrow 0.22-0.29 range) in the inflation-targeting

regime but not generally in the non-IT regime. Given the estimated impact effects and

persistence, the long-term response for the IT targeters to a one percentage point rise in

inflation is to increase interest rates by between 1.4-1.7 percentage points. Non-IT

policymakers do not respond to inflation rates in the same pronounced and significant

way that their IT counterparts do, i.e. the impact response of 0.15 implies a 0.58

percentage point long-term response in the non-IT group. The output gap is not

significant in any of the regressions.18

       The external variables are also very important in distinguishing the operating

procedures of the IT and non-IT groups. Both IT and non-IT emerging market central

banks respond to real exchange rates in setting interest rates-- the coefficients are large

and highly statistically significant. It is noteworthy, however, that the real exchange rate

response is much smaller in the IT countries (0.07) compared to the non-IT countries

(0.13). The IT group attempts to “lean against the wind” and stabilize the exchange rates

by increasing interest rates in response to real exchange rate depreciation, but their

actions are apparently more constrained by the commitment to target inflation than the


                                              16
non-IT group in how proactively this objective is pursued. In a similar vein, it is only the

non-IT group that takes into account changes in international reserves in setting interest

rates. In particular, a one percent increase in reserves leads to a 6 basis point decline in

domestic short-term interest rates for non-IT countries (23 basis point long-run effect).

Only the non-IT group eases policy in response to international reserve inflows.19

                                  (c) Commodity Exporters

        Our theoretical discussion emphasizes the critical role of “external vulnerability”

in the setting of policy interest rates in emerging markets. External vulnerability in turn is

likely to be magnified if countries are significant commodity exporters. These countries

are much more vulnerable to terms-of-trade shocks and real exchange rate shocks,20 and

would presumably place greater emphasis on stabilizing the real exchange rate when they

set interest rates.

                                            [table 3 here]

        To address this issue, we divide our IT sample into commodity exporters and non-

commodity exporters. Summary statistics for the commodity exporting and non-

commodity exporting IT countries are reported in Table 4 and policy equations are

reported in Table 5. Average inflation is higher and interest rates are substantially higher

in the commodity-exporting group, while the other variables of interest are quite similar

to the non-commodity exporting group. In particular, the mean GDP gap and mean real

exchange rate changes are not significantly different between the two groups.

                                            [table 4 here]




                                              17
        The interest rate policy equation estimates, as theory suggests, are very different

for the commodity and non-commodity IT countries. In particular, shown in Table 5, the

commodity-intensive exporting countries follow a much stronger leaning-against-the-

wind exchange rate policy.21 The real exchange rate response (point estimate) is

statistically significant and positive only in the commodity-intensive countries; and the

degree of response is almost twice as large as in the non-commodity group. In particular,

ten percent depreciation in the real exchange rate causes the commodity-intensive central

banks to increase short-term interest rates by 130 basis points, while the non-commodity

central banks increase interest rates by 80 basis points.

                                             [table 5 here]

        Surprisingly, only the commodity-intensive countries appear to be following an

IT policy—despite the two samples including only IT observations. In particular, the

response to inflation is only significant in the commodity-intensive group equation. The

point estimate indicates that a one percent rise in inflation leads to an 92 basis point

increase in the nominal interest rate. The response of the non-commodity exporting group

to inflation, despite an official IT policy regime, is not statistically significant.

        It is noteworthy that the strong response to inflation of the commodity-intensive

IT group, and apparently weak response of the non-commodity intensive group, is

probably not because they have radically different histories of inflation or credibility.

That is, we do not think the differences in results are because the non-commodity IT

group are “superior” inflation targeters, with so much credibility with the public that

they do not need to respond to short-term fluctuations in inflation. In particular, the




                                               18
inflation rate of the non-commodity IT group is 4.8 percent, lower than the commodity IT

group average but nonetheless substantial.22

    Several recent papers have pointed out that estimations of fixed-effects panels should

also consider more robust ways to estimate the standard errors in finite samples (e.g.,

Petersen, 2009). Since table 5 presents our key results, we follow the suggestions in

Kézdi (2004) and Petersen (2009) and estimate the model with clustered standard

errors.23 Petersen (2009), however, also finds the Newey-West estimator to be superior in

some models. In order to establish the robustness of our results, we therefore estimate the

specifications in table ) with both these standard-errors estimators. We present these

results and show that while the standard errors indeed increase (and statistical

significance therefore decreases), our conclusions regarding the tendency of IT

commodity intensive emerging markets to respond to the changes in exchange rate when

setting the interest rate as robust.

                         (d) Simultaneity and Varying Inflation Targets

        Policy-rule estimation in a panel-setting with lagged dependent variables may

lead to estimation bias. We deal this issue by following the Hausman and Taylor (1981)

estimation procedure. This procedure takes into account bias in estimation of panels with

predetermined and/or endogenous variables.

        Moreover, the estimates of equation (2) that we have presented thus far have

implicitly assumed that that the inflation targets were constant in every IT country. Since

in many cases the inflation target was reduced over time, this may lead to biased

estimates. We address this issue by substituting inflation by deviations of inflation from

the actual inflation target as stated by the monetary authority.24


                                             19
       The Hausman-Taylor (H-T) three-step estimation methodology is an instrumental

variable estimator that takes into account the possible correlation between the disturbance

term and the variables specified as predetermined/endogenous. The methodology requires

distinguishing between those control variables that are assumed to be (weakly) exogenous

and those that are assumed to be predetermined/endogenous and thus correlated with the

country specific effects. We assume that only the GDP gap variable is exogenous.

       In the first step of the H-T estimation, estimates from a country-fixed-effects

model are employed to obtain consistent but inefficient estimates for the variance

components for the coefficients of the time-varying variables. In the second step, an

FGLS procedure is employed to obtain variances for the time-invariant variables. The

third step is a weighted IV estimation using deviation from means of lagged values of the

time-varying variables as instruments. The exogeneity assumption requires that the

means of the exogenous variables will be uncorrelated with the country effects.25

       Under the plausible exogeneity assumption described above, the H-T procedure

provides asymptotically consistent estimates for dynamic panels, but it is not the most

efficient estimator possible. More efficient GMM procedures rely on utilizing more

available moment conditions to obtain a more efficient estimation (e.g., Arellano and

Bond, 1991). These, however, are typically employed in estimation of panels with a large

number of individuals and short time-series and in our case of small-N large-T the

number of instruments used will be very large (and the system will be vastly over-

identified; see Baltagi, 2005). This will make the results unstable and difficult to interpret

(see Greene, 2007).

                                            [table 6 here]


                                             20
        Columns (1) and (3) of Table 6 reports the results using the H-T estimation

procedure and using deviations from the time-varying inflation target for the IT

commodity and IT non-commodity countries. (These equations are analogous to Table 5).

Firstly, it is noteworthy that estimates for the inflation gap from target response in Table

6 for the IT commodity and IT non-commodity countries are larger than inflation

response reported in Table 5. The impact (long-term) response of inflation from target for

the commodity IT countries is to raise interest rates by about 0.88 (4.9) percentage points

in Table 6 and 0.88 (2.8) percentage points in Table 5. These estimates suggest

substantial short-run and long-run responses in nominal interest rates, and a substantial

long-run response in real interest rates, to an increase in inflation in the IT commodity-

intensive countries. Secondly, the output gap is highly significant in columns (1) and (3),

contrasting sharply with the results presented in Table 5. Thirdly, the real exchange rate

change variable coefficient is highly statistically significant and almost identical in

magnitude in columns (1) and (3). This differs from Table 5 where the estimated

response in the commodity IT countries is much larger in magnitude compared to non-

commodity IT countries.

        Finally, we include changes in international reserves in the second and fourth

columns of Table 6. The change in international reserves is only significant in the non-

commodity IT countries, suggesting that a rise in reserves is associated with a rise in

interest rates.

     (e) Are IT countries using the real exchange rates as an indicator of future inflation?

        Our results suggest that external factors are important even for inflation targeting

policymakers. Central banks operating under inflation targeting regimes in emerging


                                             21
markets react to current monetary conditions and current inflation as well as to changes in

real exchange rates. However, this observation does not necessarily imply that IT

policymakers have policy targets other than inflation, such as the setting of a specific real

exchange rate. It is possible that policymakers observe changes in current real exchange

rate as an indicator of future inflation and therefore react to it contemporaneously.26

       In a previous draft, we included a section that estimates a reduced-form panel

VAR model (Aizenman et al., 2008). We failed to find any impact from real exchange

rate depreciation to higher future inflation. However, inflation does appear to lead to

future exchange rate changes in both the IT and non-IT samples. From these findings,

there is no evidence that real exchange rates are a good predictor of future inflation and

therefore should not in principle enter a forward-looking IT strategy policy equation if

inflation is the target for policymakers. The significant responses to real exchange rates in

the estimated policy equations, presented in Tables 2, 3, 5 and 6, appear to reflect a

separate policy target beyond an inflation target.

                                    5. CONCLUSION

       In this paper we explore the nature of inflation targeting in emerging market and

transition economies. In the context of an estimated panel data for 16 emerging markets

over 1989Q1 to 2006Q4 (using both IT and non-IT observations), we find clear evidence

of a significant and stable response running from inflation to policy interest rates in

emerging markets that are following publically announced IT policies. By contrast, we

find that non-IT central banks place much less weight on inflation in setting interest rates.

       We emphasize that external considerations should play an important role in

central bank policy in emerging markets, and further identify countries that are more



                                             22
vulnerable to terms-of-trade shocks as ones who respond more aggressively to

movements in the real exchange rates. Emerging markets generally have a low level of

financial market development, characterized by few instruments and thin trading, which

in turn are not able to play a significant role in stabilizing domestic output in the face of

external shocks (Aghion et al., 2006). To motivate our empirical findings, we present a

simple model that illustrates the linkages between external vulnerability and the role of

the real exchange rate in optimal policy rules.

       We test whether emerging markets are following “pure” IT rules, or are also

attempting to stabilize real exchange rates. We find strong evidence that IT emerging

markets are following a mixed-IT strategy whereby central banks respond to both

inflation and real exchange rates in setting policy interest rates. The response to real

exchange rates is much stronger in non-IT countries, however, suggesting that

policymakers are more constrained in the IT regime—they are attempting to

simultaneously target both inflation and real exchange rates and these objectives are not

always consistent.

       We also find that the response to real exchange rates is strongest in those

countries following IT policies that are relatively intensive in exporting basic

commodities. This is not surprising since this group is the most vulnerable to terms-of-

trade and real exchange rate disturbances. Moreover, the real exchange rate stabilization

objective does not appear to be influencing central bank interest rate-setting indirectly

because it is a good predictor of future inflation (as would be the case if inflation is a

good predictor and the central bank is forward looking), i.e. the real exchange rate is not

a robust predictor of future inflation in emerging markets. Consistent with our model’s




                                              23
predictions, real exchange rate stabilization in commodity-intensive countries appears to

be related to adverse real output effects associated with real exchange rate volatility.

Appendix A: Inflation targeting in the open economy: economic structure and the
real exchange rate.

This Appendix illustrates conditions that may lead the policy maker to adopt IT rule that
would include exchange rate in the policy rule. We focus on the simplest set up that
illustrates this point. A well know benchmark paper is Ball (1998), studying inflation
targeting in the open economy, where setting the interest rate and the exchange rate
impacts future output and inflation. Assuming that the inflation target and potential
output ( π% and y% , respectively) are exogenously given, the IT rule is designed to
minimize the loss function [equivalently, minimizing L = V (π − π% ) + μV ( y − y% ) ]:
L = V (π ) + μV ( y )                                   (A1)
where y is the log of real output (measured as deviations from average levels), π is
inflation, μ is the relative weighted attached to output versus inflation objectives, and
V(x) is the variance of x. In Ball’s set up, the exchange rate (e) plays a role in the IT
setting if it affects inflation or output, leading to the conclusion that “…if the authorities
have modeled the economy correctly (and, in doing so, have incorporated the effects of e
on π and y), there is no need to include an exchange rate term in (the IT) equation” (see
Edwards, 2006). Edwards (2006) also notes that “If, however, there is a lagged response
of inflation and output to exchange rate changes, the central bank may want to preempt
their effect by adjusting the policy stance when the exchange rate change occurs, rather
than when its effects on π and y are manifested.”27
        In this Appendix we show that the role of the exchange rate and economic
structure is more involved in circumstances where potential output is affected by
exchange rate volatility.28 To illustrate this point, suppose that potential output, y% ,
depends negatively on exchange rate volatility, y% = y% (V (e));   y% ' < 0 . The modified loss
function facing the policy maker would be
 )
 L = V (π ) + μV ( y ) + φV (e)                         (A2)
where φ reflects the welfare cost associated with the drop in potential output induced by
exchange rate volatility. To simplify the discussion, we modify Ball’s model into a set




                                               37
up where the adjustment to shocks happens within the period, without persistence.29
Applying Ball’s notation, the base system we consider is:
a.        y = −β r − δ e + ε
b.       π = α y − γ e +η                                                   (A3)
c.       e = θ r +υ
where all parameters are positive, all variables are measured as deviations from average
levels, y is the deviation of output from the trend “potential output,” r is the real interest
rate, e is the real exchange rate (a higher e means appreciation), π is inflation, and ε , η ,
and v are white-noise shocks. Equation (A3a) is an open-economy IS curve. Output
depends on lags of the real interest rate and the real exchange rate, and a demand shock.
Equation (A3b) is an open-economy Phillips curve. The change in inflation depends on
output’s deviations from “potential output”, the exchange rate, and a shock. The change
in the exchange rate affects inflation because it is passed directly into import prices.
Equation (A3c) links the interest rate and the exchange rate, assuming that a rise in the
interest rate makes domestic assets more attractive, leading to an appreciation. The shock
v reflects other considerations impacting the exchange rate (investor confidence, foreign
interest rates, risk premium, etc).
          Suppose that the central bank chooses the real interest rate r applying a modified
inflation targeting rule:
r = aπ + by + ce                                                                       (A4)
Applying (A4) to (A3), we solve for the implied inflation, output and the exchange rate
volatility as a function of the shocks and the IT parameters <a, b, c>. It can be shown
that
a. V (e) = ⎡⎣ (b + aα ) 2 θ 2V (ε ) + [1 + β (b + aα )]2 V (υ ) + ( aθ ) 2 V ( μ ) ⎤⎦ / D
b. V ( y ) = ⎡⎣ (1 + θ ( aα − c)) 2 V (ε ) + [ β ( aα − c) − δ ]2 V (υ ) + ( aB) 2 V ( μ ) ⎤⎦ / D                     (A5) ,
c. V (π ) = ⎡⎣ (α (1 − cθ ) − bγθ ) 2 V (ε ) + [ β (α c + bγ ) + δα + γ ]2 V (υ ) + (1 − cθ + bB ) 2 V ( μ ) ⎤⎦ / D

where D = [1 + B(b + aα ) + θ (aα − c)]2 , B = β + δθ .
Feeding (A5) to the loss function (A2), the optimal IT rule is inferred by minimizing the
loss resultant function [i.e., the <a, b, c> that minimize the loss function (A2)].
Note that (A5a) implies that a negative weight on the exchange rate parameter (c < 0)
tends to reduce exchange rate volatility. This will be the with a policy rule where


                                                               38
exchange rate depreciation would increase the interest rate. Indeed, simulations confirm
that greater weight attached to reducing the costs of exchange rate volatility tends to
increase the responsiveness of the interest rate rule to exchange rate depreciation (further
lowering c), with sizable impact on the loss function. Figure A1 overview this effect.
The size of the welfare gain associated with changing c can be shown to be larger; the
greater is the welfare cost of exchange rate volatility, φ. Comparing the two panels of
Figure A 1 suggests that the cross effect of changing c on <a , b > are small (they can be
shown to be ambiguous, depending on the economic structure).




                       c=0                                         c=-1
       Figure A1: On the gains of policy rule responding to exchange rate changes.
The simulation assumes:
V (v) = V (ε ) = 1;V ( μ ) = 0.3; φ = 1; B = 1, θ = 2, δ = 0.2, β = 0.6, α = 0.4
The contours show the loss function. The two lines correspond to <a, b> configurations
associated with first order conditions for optimal values of a (the steeper curve) and b
(the u shaped curve), respectively, for a given value of c. The left panel corresponds to c
= 0, the right panel corresponds to c = -1.

rejection of the common unit root null hypothesis at 5% and 10% significance level, respectively. As is true
for all other panel unit root tests, these tests should be interpreted with caution since both tests assume a
common process. Any deviation from that assumption will entail a rejection of the null, even if some
country time-series do have a unit root. Individual country unit root tests will have weak power with
quarterly data. For a summary of the difficulties with panel unit root tests, see Enders (2003, chapter 4.11).

1
    Fourteen of the 30 OECD countries have explicit inflation targets. However, twelve of the countries

without an explicit target are in the EMU and operate under a single central bank (ECB). Hence, fourteen

of the 19 “operational” central banks in the OECD target inflation.
2
    This debate has recently subsided as a result of the global financial crisis. It will surely re-emerge once the

anticipated recovery takes hold and inflation fears will resurface again
3
    Some exceptions are IMF (2005), Conçalves and Salles (2008), Schmidt-Hebbel (2002), Mishkin and

Schmidt-Hebbel (2007), Corbo et al. (2001) and Edwards (2006) in empirical work and Reyes (2007) in

theoretical modeling.
4
    Thirteen advanced industrial countries that “…are at the international frontier of macro-economic

management and performance.” (p. 4)
5
    The authors do not consider a control group of emerging countries that are not targeting inflation.
6
    Carare and Stone (2006) is an earlier contribution that also empirically examines the range of inflation

targeting possibilities.
7
    One drawback of these time-series regressions is the very short sample periods. The authors use monthly

data for Brazil and Mexico, and quarterly data for Chile.
8
    They estimate one equation for each country over the 1990s. Hence, in most cases, their estimated

coefficients average periods of both inflation-targeting and non-targeting for countries that eventually

adopted an IT regime.
9
    The specification of the model shares the characteristics of the benchmark literature. Even though the real

exchange rate is beyond the control of the policy maker in the long-run, in the short and intermediate-runs a

significant share of the GDP is transacted at pre-set prices. Consequently, in the short-run, nominal

exchange rate changes impact the real exchange rate. This is evident in the higher short run correlations

between the nominal and the real exchange rate than the one observed in the intermediate and long-runs.



10
     They found that the adverse effects of exchange rate volatility become insignificant for countries at the

financial development level of Euro area, the U.K., Switzerland, Finland, Sweden, the US, and Australia.




                                                         42
11
     For example, Korea’s ratio of private credit to GDP was 101% in 2007 – by far the highest in our

emerging market sample, and not very different from most other OECD members (data from Beck and

Demirgüç-Kunt, 2009). However, during the recent crisis, Korea appeared very vulnerable to exchange rate

volatility (Korea’s experience during the crisis is overviewed in Park, 2009).
12
     A growing literature has identified financial intermediation, in the presence of collateral constraints, as a

mechanism explaining the hazard associated with credit cycles induces by shocks. The prominent role of

bank financing in developing countries suggests that balance sheet valuation problems associated with

shocks may lead to higher cost of borrowing, reducing average growth, and possibly to recessions in the

aftermath of adverse shocks. In these circumstances, real exchange rate changed induced by adverse terms

of trade shocks or contagion may impose adverse liquidity shocks, propagating lower output growth. This

channel is of greater potency in countries where most financial intermediation is done by banks, relying on

debt contracts. Less efficient judiciary, higher monitoring and enforcement costs tend to magnify the

adverse impact of real exchange shocks on the costs of credit; for further references and models of the

credit channel in developing countries see Aghion et al. (2006) and Aizenman (2008).
13
     Another possible motivation for the policymaker’s decision to respond to the exchange rate may be

related to the fear-of-floating findings reported by Calvo and Reinhart (2002) and the pass-through from

exchange rates to domestic inflation.
14
     Aizenman and Riera-Crichton (2008) argue that an IT rule responding to the exchange rate may be

supplemented by a corresponding international reserve policy. Our empirical specification also considers

this possibility by controlling for changes of international reserves.
15
     Chile was excluded from the data set because the country’s policy functions appear anomalous to the

other IT countries in the sample. Corbo et al. (2001) estimate Taylor rules for 25 countries and only in the

case of Chile do they estimate a real interest rate equation. We similarly find Chile to be an outlier in our

panel-data Taylor rule regressions, even when including fixed effects in the estimation procedure.
16
     As documented by Enders (2003) and others, panel unit root tests are quite sensitive to a number of data

characteristics and are difficult to interpret.
17
     It is well known that the LSDV estimation with a lagged dependent variable is biased when the time

dimension of the panel (T) is small. Nickell (1981) shows that this bias approaches zero as T approaches


                                                         43
infinitely. Judson and Owen (1999), in a Monte Carlo study, shows that the LSDV estimator performs well

in comparison with GMM and other estimators when T=30. In an unbalanced panel with T=30, LSDV

performs best. T is equal to 68 on our study and the bias is presumably small.
18
     For robustness, we also estimated the benchmark regressions using the Clarida (2001) specification that

includes both contemporaneous and lagged inflation as independent variables. Results on the magnitude of

the effect of inflation on the interest rate are practically the same.
19
     In results not reported, we also included a trade openness measure (exports plus imports as % of GDP).

We find that the interest rate response to real exchange rates of the IT group does not appear to be affected

by the degree of trade openness and the estimated coefficients on the other variables are nearly identical to

the specifications reported in Table 2.
20
     In preliminary work, we also considered policy rules with terms-of-trade shocks entered explicitly into

the estimation equation. The difficultly was in obtaining an accurate terms-of-trade measure. We

considered three measures of terms-of-trade: From the International Monetary Fund’s International Finance

Statistics, from Datastream, and a TOT measure used by International Monetary Fund staff internally for

the calculations presented in the World Economic Outlook. These measures were not significantly

correlated with each other, despite purporting to measure the same phenomenon. None of these measures

were statistically significant when included in the interest rate policy equations. We have little confidence

in the reliability of these terms-of-trade measures, although all are derived from official sources, and do not

report statistical results where they are included.
21
     The basic Taylor equation model is estimated with the addition of real exchange rates in Table 5 for IT

countries, separating the sample into commodity-intensive and non-intensive countries. Reserve changes

for the IT countries were not significant in Table 3 or Table 5, and are not reported for brevity.
22
     All inflation data are annualized quarterly rates.
23
     In Monte Carlo studies Kézdi (2004) and Petersen (2009) conduct, they both find the bias associated with

estimations of the fixed effect model with clustered standard errors to be small in finite samples.
24
     The data on the explicit inflation target, for each central bank, was collected from the central bank’s

country-specific publications.

25
     Identification in the Hausman-Taylor procedure requires that the number of exogenous variables be at

least as large as the number of time-invariant predetermined/endogenous variables.
26
     Clarida (2001) discusses this issue in the context of a forward-looking IT regime.
27
     Taylor (2001) and Wollmershäuser (2006) are also relevant models.
28
     Aghion et al. (2006) showed that exchange rate volatility reduces potential output (or output growth rate)

in developing countries, attributing it to financial channels. The adverse effect of volatility may be the

outcome of increasing the expected cost of funds in circumstances where agency and contract enforcement

costs are prevalent, the financial system is shallow, and trade openness is significant.
29
     This may be the case if all the nominal contracts are re-set at the end of each period.
