Disequilibrium Growth Theory: The Kaldor Model


Abstract

     Disequilibrium macroeconomic theory [e.g. Clower, and Barro
and Grossman] is extended to deal with capital accumulation in

the long run. A growth model a la Kaldor is chosen for a frame-
work. The real wage is supposed to be adjusted slowly, therefore
there may be excess demand or supply in the labor market. The
transaction takes place at the minimum of supply and demand.
Since income shares of workers and capitalists depend on which

regime the labor market is in, different equations are associated

to different regimes. Local stability of the steady state by the
disequilibrium dynamics is demonstrated.

    Disequilibrium Growth. Theory




1. Introduction

     Disequilibrium macroeconomics has been one of the active areas
of research for the last ten years. After Clower (1965) and

Leijonhufvud (1968) proposed a new definition of the effective demand,

Barro and Grossman (1971, 1976), Malinvard (1977), Hildenbrand and
Hildenbrand (1978), and Muellbauer and Portes (1978) showed a static

quantity-constrained equilibria for simple macroeconomic models. In
those models, the price and the wage are rigid, therefore the aggregate

demand is not necessarily equal to the aggregate supply. Depending
on the direction and size of disequilibrium of both markets, one can

trace a dynamic path of static quantity-constrained equilibria, such
as Bohm (1978) and Honkapohja (1978). However, those models do not
incorporate     endogenous capital accumulations. In this paper, we
will introduce capital accumulation into a disequilibirum macroeconomic

model, where capital accumulation is determined by the saving decision
of households, like neoclassical growth theory.

    We develop disequilibrium growth theory as follows: we
take a one—sector neoclassical growth mode1 but do not assume
perfect flexibility of the real wage. If the wage is fixed at
the moment (or for a certain period) by a lazy invisible auc-

tioneer or by the visible government, then the labor market is
under a regime of excess supply (unemployment), excess demand
                               —2—



 (overemployment), or (exact) full employment. The actual trans-
 actions are assumed to take place at the minimum of demand and
 supply of labor force. In the regime of unemployment,--workers

 cannot satisfy their notional wage income, while in the overem—
 ployment regime, owners of firms cannot fulfill the notional plan

 of production and profit. Therefore, the amount of saving depends
 not only on the wage rate but also on which regime the labor mar-
 ket is in. The amount of saving determines a path of capital

 accumulation, while the wage rate may be partially adjusted

 according to a regime of the labor market. Movements of capital
 per capita and the wage rate will trace the disequilibrium path of

 a growing economy.

     We will face a question of the stability for a differential

equation systems with switching regimes, each regime being associated
with a different set of differential equations. This kind of "patched-

up system of differential equations has not been investigated much.
We will give a simple conditions for local stability of a two-dimentional

patched-up system.

     To sum up, a framework to deal with capital accumulation is
inherited from neoclassical grwoth theory, while the short-run rigidiry

of prices and the minimum transaction rule of demand and supply in

non-market-clearing prices are adopted from disequilibrium macroecono-
mics. Therefore the present model is differenciated from the earlier

models of "disequilibrium growth" oi "unemployment in a theory of
growth.
                                      —3—




      I demonstrated the above idea in a special example in Ito
 (1978), where the Diamond model (1965) of overlapping generations

was chosen for a framework. Since I employed in the note the
Cobb-Douglas functions for utility and production and optimistic ex-

pectations about future, the model implied that workers (i.e.,
the young generation) save a constant fraction of realized in-

come. Moreover, the two—period overlapping generations model
without bequests implies that capitalists (i.e., the older gener-
ation) never save. It would be most desirable to generalize the
Diamond model to the n-period overlapping generations model witha

general utility and production function. However, it would be
extremely difficult. Instead, I adopt a neoclassical model where the
saving rates, from the wage income and from the profit income are
               3
different.

     In the next section, we describe the model. In Section 3,
we will examine the stability of the model over time. It will
be shown that a disequilibrium dynamic path fluctuates between

the unemployment and overemployment regimes, exploding away or
converging to the neoclassical long—run steady state. We will
prove a new theorem on stability of a dynamic path with switching

regimes. An alternative wage adjustment scheme is examined in
Section Li..       Section 5 will be devoted to the stucy of the implicaitons
of the results obtained in the earlier sections, and concluding
remarks are given in Section 6.

2.    The Model


        We assume a neoclassical well—behaved production function.
The (flow of) output at time t, X' is determined by the (flow

of) labor force at time t, Lt, and the (stock of) capital,
                                                                                     Kt.
The production function, F, is assumed to be twice differentiable

and homogeneous of degree one, i.e.,

                    =
                        F(Kt,       Lt)                      for Kt   0,   Lt   0,


and           XF(Kt, Lt) = F(XKt,                            for A > 0.
                                                ALt)

We can write in the intensive form due to the homogeneity:

(2.1)         Yt/Lt =         f(Kt/Lt)

        Assume that the production function is "well-behaved":

              f(0) =      0


(2.2)         f'(.) > 0         and f''() <          0

              urn       f'(.) =           and       urn f'(.) = 0
             K/L÷0

At each moment of time, the capital stock is historically

given and the wage rate is also fixed. The (representative)
firm maximizes the (flow of) profit, ll, with respect to the

labor input.


        Max lltEYt_wtLt
        Lt

The labor demand, Ld            ,   is    the level of labor input which satis—
                                — 5_




fies

(2.3)        w = FL(Kt,   Lt)

where FL F/L. Since F is homogeneous of degree one,
                                                        FL
is homogeneous of degree zero. Therefore we have a separable
form:


(2.4)        L = c(wt)     Kt                    <   0


We assume, for the sake of simplicity, that the labor supply

per capita, 2, is inelastic± Therefore, the aggregate labor
supply, L5, is

(2.5)        L =

The transaction rule in disequilibrium is a usual minimum of
demand and supply.


(2.6)       Lt =   min[L, LI
        We here introduce several notations for convenience. First,

we define capital per capita by kt     Kt/Nt. Note that this
variable does not depend on the current wage rate or the actual
level of employment. Secondly, we set Q = 1 by choosing an

appropriate unit of measurement. Thirdly, we introduce the

desired capital/labor ratio, k Kt/L =      i/(wt).       This variable
is a function of the current wage rate, although capital per

capita is not. Using (2.3) and the Euler equation for a
homogeneous function, we have
                                                  —6—


(2.7)        w =       f(k)        —
                                       kf'(k)
We are going to describe our economy by two state variables,

kt and w. But keep in mind in the following discussion that
 d
kt does not depend on kt but on wt.

        There are three possible regimes in the labor market.
We say that the labor market is under full-employment, unem-
                                d = s
                                   L , Ld < Ls and Ls < Ld
                                              •
ployment and overemployment, if L

respectively.

        It is easy to see the following relations:


(2.8)        Kt = kd                              in the full employment and un-
                            (we)                  employment regimes; and
              t

(2.9)
             Kt =
              t
                       kt                         in the full employment and over-
                                                  employment regimes.

        Hereafter we omit a subscript t, when it is possible.

Capital accumulation is solely determined by the savings
decision asina         neoclassical         growth model. In the Kaldor
model, the increase (flow) of capital is the sum of workers'

saving and capitalists' saving:

                                   sK(Y
               =
                   5KF,                + (s -
                                                      sK)WL
               =
                   5KLf                +          -
                                                       sK)WL

where K =    dK/dt,         0 <
                                   s   <   1, and 0 <          SK
                                                                    <   1. We take those saving
rates    as constants.
                                                 —7—




         One of the characteristics of disequilibrium growth model is

that the capital accumulation equation, (2.10), is different for
each regime. This is clear from the relations (2.8) and (2.9).

         The population is assumed to grow at a constant rate, n, i.e.,
N/N       n.   Since there are only two commodities in an economy, we
can take the price of output as numeraire. Moreover, the demand

and supply for output is always balanced, because output which is
not consumed becomes saving which is equivalent to investment. We
now consider the nominal wage (which is also the real wage) adjust-
ment equation.

         First, we take a simple scheme of wage adjustment. Assume the
law of supply and demand, i.e.               ,   the   wage increases in the overemploy-

ment regime and goes down in the                       unemployment regime.
Moreover, we assume that the wage adjustment is proportional
to the rate of unemployment or overemployment                            ,       but   the
proportion may be different in the positive direction or the
negative direction.

                                Ld — L s                . Td T ,
                           "1                          lJ    .LJ   .LI                     > U,

                       —
                                  L
                                                       if    Ld < Ls         ,             >0


or rewriting using the established notation

(2.12)             =
                       kd(w)         — 1)                =           if L5                 Ld

                                                                     if Ld             >   LS
                                     —8—




     We will see that the above equation does not keep an economy on

the neoclassical capital deepening with full employment since it

requires the wage rate go up as capital deepens. We may want to
use a wage adjustment scheme which would keep an economy on the
neoclassical path once it is on it. Therefore the wage adjustment
consists of the effect of change in productiviey and the effect
of disequilibrium:


(2.12)     w =   - f"(k)      kk +    (k/kd(w)   -   =l   if L < Ld
                                                     =    if LS >   Ld.

A contrast of (2.11) and (2.12) will be seen in the following
subsections.



Full Employment Regime


      First, we start by examining a regime where the current
combination of the capital per capita and the wage rate gives
a state of full employment. That is, from (2.4), (2.5) and
2.
     1,

                     =
                         Nt

Solving this equation for w, we have "the full employment wage
rate" denoted by w , depending on the capital per capita:


          w =
                                            —9—




Since kt =
                kd(wt) in the full employment regime, we know by
 (2.7),


 (2.13) w =               (kt)    =
                                      f(kt)   —
                                                  ktf'(kt)
        In other words, a full employment regime is defined as a

set RfC]R

               Rf
                     = { (k,w) 1R       I
                                            w =   f (k) — kf'   (k) }.



We    know that the full employment wage rate is an increasing

function with respect to the capital per capita, because of

assumption (2.2)


 (2.14)               =   ' (k)   =   -kf'    (k) >   0.

 Since the full employment wage rate is a function of the capital
 per capita, we have a dynamic equation of capital accumulation

 per capita, substituting (2.9) and (2.13) into (2.10)

 (2.15)        kEk(k/K-/N)
                    = s f(k) — (s —s )kf' (k) — nk
                       w         w K
Note that the increase in capital per capita does not depend

on the wage rate any more. Since the labor market is in equilib-
rium, the wage rate does not change at the moment


                kt
                      =
                          sf(kt) -                         (kt) - nkt,
(F)                                                                      for (kt,wt)cRf
                      = 0,
           H
                                   —10—




The dynamic equations of (F) implies that (kt,wt) will not be
in (F) at the next moment unless kt is a special value so that
k =   0.     It is heuristically interesting to consider the neo-

classical model in our framework. Full employment is assumed
over time in the neoclassical models by instantaneous adjust-
ment of the wage rate. Therefore the dynamic equation of the

 neoclassical model is equation (2.15) only.



(N)
              kt =      sf(kt)    w            (kt) - nkt,   Vkt > 0

while   the wage        rate is adjusted to the labor productivity:
                    =
               f(kt) kt f'(kt)
               w.
                              —



This wage rate is guaranteed to be achieved if the wage is adjusted
according to (2.12) and the initial state is full employment.
        In   the next two sections, we assume that the wage adjustment
follows (2.11). In section Li, we will come back to the implicaitons

of the wage adjustment of (2.12).

        We introduce a notion of "neoclassical_steady states,":
                                         —11 -




output   and inputs are growing at the same rate, or the natural

rate, n. Let us denote tIsteady state capital per capita by
k and the associated wage rate by w.


(2.16)      k =   {ksf(k)        —   (S — sK)kf' (k)          —   nk = o}

(2.17)      w =   f(k)    —   kf'(k)
     Note that k gives the steady state to system (F), too.

     We know that a neoclassical growth model is globally
stable under plausible assumptions. Our concern here is how the
conclusion may change when we allow short—run disequilibria.
Therefore a strategy of research is that we take for granted
the stability of theneoclassical model. It is well known
that the Kaldor hypothesis, i.e., 5K                      5w' is a sufficient
condition of stability in the two-class model. We, however,
are also interested in a case of s                   >   s K which is implied
                                                 w
by the life-cycle hypothesis. We introduce a concept of the

elasticity of substitution, o, of a production function:

            a
                  dIog(K/L)/dloq(F/F).

It is easy to verify that a is described in terms of the inten-
sive forms:5

            a —
                      f' k) {f (k) — kf' (Ic)        >o
 2 18)            —
                          kf(k)f'' (k)
The sign comes from assumption (2.2)
                                   —12—




Theorem 2.1

     The neoclassical model is defined by (2.1), (2.2),

and (N). There exists a unique equilibrium (steady state) value
of the capital per capita, and it is globally asymptotically
stable, if


(2.19)       a > (1 — —.) kf'(k)                        k   >    0


A proof is given in Appendix 1.

Remark 1


     (2.19) is satisfied if SK       s, that is the original Kaldor
hypothesis, since the RHS      0 and a >   0.

Remark 2


     (2.19) is satisfied if a production function is of the

Cobb-Douglas type, f(k) = Aka, even if s > SK. Since
kf'(k)/f(k) = a < 1 and {l — (sK/s)} < 1, the RHS < 1.      It
is easy to see that a = 1 for a Cobb—Douglas production function,
therefore the LHS = 1.

Remark 3


     With the same logic, (2.19) is satisfied When we have
any production function With the more-than-one elasticity of
substitution for k > 0, in addition to assumption (2.2).

Remark   4



       The above remarks imply that the only chance that the
neoclassical model is unstable is in a case where a is
sufficiently less than 1 and s
                                     w
                                         >   s
                                              K
                                                  .     It is a well known
proposition that a < 1 implies the wage share {f(k)-f'(k)k}/f(k)

increases as k increases. Since the saving rate from wage
income is larger, it is plausible that k                  increases   as k

increases. This means the steady state is unstable.

       In the following we assume (2.19). Now let us go back
to the full employment regime of the disequilibrium model.
From (2.15) and (2.16), we have the following sign condition


                    0,                       if k <       k,   (k,w)ERf
(FS)           =    0,                       if k         k, (ic,w)6Rf
                >   0,                       if k <       K, (i,w)ERf


Unemployment Regime

       We now turn to the unemployment regime. The current
wage rate is higher than the full employment wage rate,
w* =
       (kt),   therefore Ld < LS.        The unemployment regime set
on the (k,w) plane is denoted as R,

               =
                    {(k,w)cIw   >    f(k)     -       kf'(k)}.
Since the firm's demand for labor is satisfied, the marginal

condition (2.3) is attained. In other words, the capital-
                                                  —1

employment ratio is determined by (2.8), and equal to the

demand capital-labor ratio, kd(w):

(2.20)            w = f(kd(w))           -
                                             kd(wt)fI(kd(wt)).
Using (2.20), the rate of capital accumulation is simplified
as follows:


(2.21)                =      f(kd)   +   (S       —s
                  K        K kd              w         K)

                      =    sf(kd)/kd     ÷         -
                                                        s)ft(kd).
TI-i   ere fore

                       =                                    +         -                  -
(2.22)
                           kt[sf(kd(wt))/kd(wt)                           s)ft(kd(wt))
Let      us denote [.1        in   (2.22) by h(wt). Note that k                  0 as

h(wt)        0, respectively. However, h(wt) is independent of kt.
This is resulted from a homogeneous production function. Since

the labor demand is multiplicatively separable with respect to
the wage rate and the total capital stock, the capital per the

employed is independent of the total capital stock, but only
the ratio between the capital stock and employment matters.
          For the dynamic equation for the wage rate, assume (2.11).

Therefore (2.11) and (2.22) give a system of equations which
describes the motion in the Ru and its boundary R

                                                                          s)f(kd(wt))    -

Note that (U) coincides with (F) at (k,W)ERf. Now we check
the sign of k in the unemployment regime. First note that
   = 0 at (k,w). Secondly,


             dw                _k/Bk
                               —                                 —o

                  1=0


since   k(wt) in equation (2.22) is independent of kt. Thirdly

                  =   _kt
                                                     {kdf,(kd)       -    f(kd)   -   (kd)2f,t(kd)}

gives                      the directions of state variables.



Overemployment Regime

       Lastly, we examine a case of the overemployment regime,
where LS <   Ld, or equivalently w. <                   w    = (k). A set of corn-

binations,         (k,w),which gives the overemployment regime is
denoted by R0,


       R0 =   1.   (k,w)        I w <           f(k)       —       kf' (k) }.
Since    the actual employment is determined by the supply side,
substitute (2.9) into (2.10) to obtain the following equation:

              fK

              K
                   =              +       (5 -        SK)
                                                                   w
                           kt
or in terms of the intensive form


(2.23)        k =                 +       (S — S}()W•                —
                                                                             nkt.

Since the demand for labor is quantity—constrained, the marginal

condition of (2.3) is not satisfied. That is
                                                                                         w f(kt) -         kf (kt).
Take    equation        (2.11) as the wage adjustment                                   in the
ment regime. Therefore (2.11) and (2.23) give                                                a system of
equations which describes the motion in the R and its boundary

Rf.

Note that (0) coincides with (F) at (k,w)eRf. Next we check
the signs of time derivatives. First, from (2.23) we know
that

     The full employment regime is described by a curve (k)
in Figures 1 and 2. The neoclassical growth model, (N), is
a special case here in that it is restricted to a curve (k)

The unemployment regime is anywhere above the curve, and the
overemployment regime is anywhere below the curve. The dotted
curves are a combination of (k,w) which gives k = 0.



     In the following sections, we will examine the stability

of the disequilibrium system of (U) (F) and (0), and discuss
the implications of the model.

3.     Stability

       We have started with a question of how a model changes
when we allow disequilibria while the equilibrium (neoclassical)

path shows the global stability to the long-run steady state1k.
We are now ready to answer the above question. Our disequilib-
rium system consists of two different sets of differential

equations, (U) and (0). They give the same values at their
common boundary. (F). Since the domain is divided into two

different regions, the usual theorems of the local or global

stability cannot be applied without modification and restriction.

Especially note that the global stability in each set of
differential equations (assuming it is defined for ]R)does

not guarantee the global stability of a 'patched-up" system.
However, we can assert the global, therefore local, stability
in the case of SK < Swl by just looking at the Figure 1. Notice

that the region between (k) and (k); k < k has a property to
"lock in" the solution path, once it comes in the region. Since
 ÷ 0 as k ÷ 0,     a solution path never hits the vertical
axis even if w > w. It   is   clear from the diagrams that a solution

path does not approach to the horizontal axis. Therefore a solu-
tion path has to converge to the steady state eventually.. The
case can be extended to a special case SK = s
       Therefore we have the following thçorem

Theorem 3.1


         In the case of SK s, a disequilibrium system of (U) and
(0) has the unique steady State (k,w) and that is globally

asymptotically stable.

         In the case of s <          it is a complicated matter to
establish the local stability, and the global stability depends

on the wage adjustment speeds. First, we prove that for the
local stability of a patched-up system, (U) and (0), it is
sufficient to prove the local stability for each (U) and (0)
around the steady state point, given the boundary can be
approximated by a linear line?


Theorem

         In   the case         <_S<, a disequilibrium system defined by
(U) and (0) is locally stable at (k,w), in the sense that
     >   0, such that

A proof is given in Appendix 3.

         It is clear from Figure 2 that the disequilibrium system may

oscillate to the limit cycle, or explode cyclically. Since the

system defined by (U) and (0) with                                   <_SK   is   globally

Proof

        It is a well-known theorem that if there is a Lyapunov

function, V             0, such that V = 0 at the unique equilibrium

point and            < 0 anywhere else where it is defined, then the

equilibrium point is globally asymptotically stable.

       Let us define a function V(k,w) as follows


      V(kt,wt) =                             —
                                                 (kt))2   +
                                                              (kt   —   k)2}
      V(k,w) =          0, and V(kt,wt) >                 0   if (k,w)           (k,w).

        7   =
                'Y(wt
                        -       c1(k))       - '(k)kt(wt      -     1(k))   + (k -   k)k

It   is immediately resulted from (FS) (US) and (OS) that


      V(ktwt) <             0                if (i) w.

                                                 and (kt,wt) RUURf/(k,w)
                                             if (ii) (kt)           w.
                                                 k
                                                     kt, and (kt,wt)EROURf/(k,w).

Therefore we can choose 2 sufficiently large so that
                             —2 3—

and we can also choose    sufficiently large so that

       Alternative Wage Adjustment

         We showed an alternative wage adjustment ahcme, (2.12), which
consists of the productivity effect and the disequilibrium effect.

Then the wage adjustment equations for the regimes (F), (U), and

(0) are given by (-i.l), (1i.2), and (14.3),            respectively.

         It is easy to see that the phase diagram now looks like
Figures 3 and Li.

         Unlike an economy with (2.11) illustrated in Figure 1 and 2,
and economy with (2.12) shown in Figures 3 and 14 never switch

regimes. Therefore an question of stability becomes simple,while
the model loses its endogenous force for a business cycle. Noting
that a trajectory never crosses the full-employment regime,

the following theorem is obvious from examining Figures 3 and Li-.
Theorem 14.1

         A disequilibrium path described by (U), (F), and (0) with
(14.1) (14.2) and (14.3) replacing the wage adjustment equations,

i.e., (2.19) is satisfied.

5.   Disequilibrium   Dynamics and Comparative Statics

      In this section, we study the implications of the results
we had in the previous sections.


Short-run and Long-run Stability


     A disequilibrium growth path in a stable case can be
viewed as "a sequence of short—run quantity-constrained

equilibria toward t1-1ong-run market-clearing equilibrium."
In a general (dis)equilibrium framework, a quantity-constraint
in a market (the labor market in our model) forces constrained

agents to spill-over unsatisfied demand or supply into other
markets (the goods market in our model) to form the "effective"
demand (a Keynesian consumption function in our model). If the
number of markets in an economy is more than two, the existence

of a quantity-constrained (fixed-price) equilibrium is not
a trivial question, but a proposition to be proved.9     However,
our model is so simple that a spill—over from the labor market

is always completely absorbed in the goods market. Therefore
there is always a unique quantity—constrained equilibrium for the

arbitrary wage rate and the arbitrary capital per capita. The
stability of a sequence consisting of (short-run) quantity-
constrained equilibria is a long—run phenomenon in the sense

that the model incorporates the capital accumulation
                              -27-


Business Cycles and a Stable Corridor

     In the case that s <   sKth     the   simple wage   adjustment   of (2.11)
we showed that a disequilibrium path may oscillate around the equilibriui

before the path, if ever, converges to the equilibrium. This is
observed as business cycles over unemployment periods (i.e.,

depressions) and overemployment periods (i.e., booms). In
each type of period, there are two Sub—periods; one is the

"capital-deepening" period and the other is the "capital-

shallowing" (or slower—capital—deepening in the case of Harrod

neutral technological progress) period. Stability theorems
in the preceding section suggest that a small displacement
of the real wage rate or the capital per capita from the long-
run steady state results in short—run disequilibrium in the

labor market; but eventually the long-run equilibrium will be

resumed. Suppose an imaginary experiment of letting the dis-
placement larger. Then it may be the case that there is a

bound, depending on F's, beyond which a path may diverge away.
Then thebounded neighborhood of the long run equilibrium may
be regarded as the stable neighborhood or "a stable corridor'°
if we recall that the long-run equilibrium in which the capital

stock and the production are growing at the natural rate.



Long-run Fixed Price Equilibria

     We explained that any point in Figures 1 and 2 is viewed

as a quantity constrained equilibrium given the fixed real wage
                                      -2w-



in the short-run. It is of interest to study a case that the real wage
is fixed in the long-run as well as in the short—run. We may
assume that the government or the powerful trade union impose
the fixed real wage for a certain period. Suppose that the real
wage is fixed less than the long—run steady state value, i.e.,
w < w, where        is the fixed real wage. Holding w. =              , for
t > 0, the economy will converge to some k which induces no

change in the capital per capita, i.e., k             = 0.        Such k is

calculated as        =       (ii).   We find the long-run fixed wage

equilibrium,              in the overemployment regime. In the case

of      <
            s,   we learn, from Figure 1, that 1 <           k,    i.e., the
capital accumulation is short of the neoclassical long—run

capital per capita. In the case                       SK Figure 2 tells
us that k <      1, i.e., the capital is over—accumulated relative
to the neoclassical long—run capital per capita. By a similar
exercise, we find that if W > w, then the capital is shallowing
forever. The most interesting case occurs when the real wage
rate is set to the long—run equilibrium rate "prematurely" in the

sense that the capital per capita is still below its long-run

steady state value, i.e.,              w, kt <   k.    Then the economy is

stuck at the current capital per capita, i.e.,                      = 0 for all

kt <   k if i = w.       Since it is under the unemployment regime, we

observe that the steady state price signal, w, may cause the

quantity-constrained (underemployed) equilibria, (w,1O, 1 <
as well as the full employment equilibrium.19 Let us state this
proposition formally.
                              — 2'!—




Proposition 4.1

     There are    unemployment equilibria, if the real wage rate
is fixed at the steady state rate in the long-run and if the

capital per capita is below its steady state level.


Comparative Statics


     We examine shifts of the steady states responding to changes

in parameters. First, suppose that the saving rates from wage
income and/or from profit increased. The full employment wage
rate curve,   (kt), does not change, although the steady state
(k,w) shifts to the north-east on the            curve. Therefore
an economy will be in the overemployment capital-deepening regime

in the transition period from the old to new steady states. A
decrease in either one or both of the saving rates causes

a symmetric change in the position of the steady state. However,
the transition period should be in the unemployment capital

shallowing regime. Cyclic behaviors may occur in both directions
of changes in t1savings rate, if       <
                                           SK
                                                and the adjustment
speeds of the wage rate is sufficiently small.

     Secondly, suppose that there is a once—and—for—all shift

in the production function. Assume that sudden manna is given in a

multiplicatively separab].eform, i.e., f(k) becomes Af(k), A>1.
Then the full employment wage rate curve shifts upward, while the
steady state shifts to the north-east. The transition period
should be in the overemployment regime.

5.   Concluding Remarks

     We have demonstrated an idea of disequilibrium growth

theory in a simple one—sector model. It has several attractive

features: explicit analysis of spill-over effects in the

general (dis)equilibrium framework; simultaneous adjustment
of prices and quantities in the long-run as a sequence of short-

run fixed price equilibria. However, the power of analysis is
severely limited by the fact that there is only one malleable

commodity. The model is philosophically classical (or anti-
Keynesian) in the sense that the supply side determines output.
The disequilibrium labor market determines the actual employment
at the minimum of demand and supply. This in turn determines

actual output, which is exactly absorbed either as consumption

or capital accumulation. This story is clearly what Keynes
and his "faithful" followers attack. This may seem paradoxical

because disequilibrium macroeconomic models are praised mainly

because they claim their restoration of "Keynes's economics"

as opposed to "Keynesian economics."
      The present disequilibrium growth model is a hybrid of a

neoclassical growth theory and a disequilibrium macroeconomic
model, and the anti-Keynesian nature is inherited from a neo-

classical growth theory, i.e., a one-sector model without money.
                          -31-




    i-Growth theory is a much exp1ored field which studies

an economy with accumulating capital, increasing population,
technological progress, and changes in factor shares. For
best surveys, Hahn and Matthews (1964) and Burmeister and
Dobell (1970) should be consulted. We have two different

breeds of growth theory: First, Keynesian growth theory,
started by Harrod (1943) and Domar (1957), emphasizes the in-

stability of the warranted growth rate. Secondly, neo-
classical growth theory, initiated by Solow (1956) and Swan

(1956), shows the stability of the steady state. Keynesian

instability essentially comes from non-substitutability, i.e.,
fixed coefficients, of factors for production. The Keynesian
growing economy will find itself in either chronic inflation

or persistent unemployment, while factors are always fully

employed by the assumption of perfect price flexibility and
smooth factor substitutions in the neoclassical growing
economy. Since substitutions between labor and capital seem
plausible in the long run, the neoclassical models outnumbered

the Keynesian models during the most fruitful period of research.
But neoclassical models could not account for unemployment or

inflation.
                               —32—




        2There have been several works on "disequilibrium growth"
    or "unemployment in a theory of growth." Tobin (1955) showed
    that when the nominal wage is inflexible downward, an economy

    may experience cyclic fluctuations or stagnation depending upon
    whether the short—run adjustment is unstable or stable, respec-
    tively. Although the ideas are similar, our model benefits from
    several features derived from the modern disequilibrium macro—

    models, such as ability to trace disequilibrium dynamic paths
    of the capital per capita. Rose (1966, 1967) constructed a model

    to incorporate unemployment. However, he merely replaces some
    equalities of the equilibrium conditions by lagged adjustment
_equations. Hadjimichalakis' model (1971) also adopts lagged
    adjustment equations instead of instantaneous equalities of

    Tobin's monetary growth model. Hahn (1960) studied seemingly
    disequilibrium models where lagged adjustments are introduced
   both in prices and the capital-labor ratio. In his model A,
    the real rental rate is not always equal to the marginal pro-

   ductivity of capital while the instantaneous adjustment of the

    nominal wage makes the real wage equal to the marginal produc-
    tivity of labor. Model B is a case where both marginal produc-

    tivities may deviate from the real input price. However, if both

   real input prices are higher than their corresponding productiv—

    ities, then firms are making negative profit. Our approach will
   be different from the above works by two features: We employ the

   minimum transaction rule in the disequilibrium market: and un-

    satisfied demand or supply spills over to the other markets.

    These features are inherited from disequilibrium macroeconomic
                               —33—




       3mis is similar to Kaldor's (1960) hypothesis. However,
the original Kaldor hypothesis was that the
profit savingrate is not only different but higher than the wage

saving rate, although the Diamond model, or the life-cycle hy-
pothesis in general, implies the opposite. Modigliani (1975)
discussed theoretical and empirical comparisons between the Kaldor
hypothesis and the life-cycle hypothesis. Since we take the
Kaldor model where the saving rate of workers is higher than

that of capitalists as an approximation of an overlapping gener-

ations model, we do not worry about the Pasinetti paradox.


           The qualitative nature of the model would not change even
if the labor supply per capita depends on the wage rate. Assume
that 9(0) = 0, urn 2,(w) <
                  W°
                              °, and   £.'(w) > 0 for 0     w   <   . Then
almost all the analysis except in the case of overemployment with
SK >   s goes through, by replacing k by k/9(w) in the fol1owing

       6
           Suppose that we have two systems of differential equations.

Both have the stable elliptic solution paths around the equilibrium.
However, one has a major axis horizontally, while the other vertically.
Patch these systems in such a way that the solution path always goes

from a point on a minor axis to that of a major axis, then the

patched-up system is globally unstable.

   -    Veendorp (1975) faced a similar problem of stability in
switching regimes. The sufficient condition he used cannot be

applied in our problem, since the ]=O line in the unemployment
regime is horizontal. Our condition for local stability cannot be

applied to Veendorp's problem, either, because he has four regimes
instead of two.

        (3.1) gives the following:

             [' ()   (w-(k)) - (k_k)]/[(k/kd(w)            -   1) (w-(k))]

       (3.2) gives the following:

         >             + (s   —          — nic]   [' (k)   (w—(k)) — (k—k)]

             [(k/kd(w) - 1) (w-(k))]

Note that k      k'(w) and w        (k) by definition of regimes.
Moreover if w - (k), which may occur when k < k in the unem-
ployment capital-shallowing regime and when k < k in the over-

employment capital-deepening regime, T               < o independent of the
magnitude of a positive speed of adjustment.

        See Benassy (1975) and Drze (1975)

        Leijonhufvud (1973) proposed an idea of a corridor in

which "the market system tends to move 'automatically' towards

a state where all market excess demands and supplies are eliminated."

Outside the corridor, counter—acting tendencies become "weaker as

the system becomes increasingly subject to 'effective demand

Appendix 1

     A proof of Theorem 2.1 is                 routine in a neoclassical
growth model. Note that

          k=O                iff

Since N/N =   n, a constanbwitha finite value , the following
condition is enough to assert the existence, uniqueness, and

globally asymptotic stability of the steady state:


             (i) lim (K/K) =
                   k÷O


             (ii) urn (K/K) < n



             (iii) d K
                                 exists and is strictly negative for k >          0.


Now recall that K/K =
                             sf(k)/k       + (sK -
                                                         Sw)f'(k)
          lim (k/K) =        S lim
          k÷c                      k+0

                         —          urn f'(k)

                         = 0,                                   (ii) is proved.


To prove (i), we rewrite k/K as follows:


              =   s{f(k)     —   kf' (k)   }/k +
                                                   sKf    (k)
                                         —39—


             urn (k/K) = s
                            w k÷O
                                  urn —    f''(k)•k         +        =         ,   (i)    is proved.
             k÷O
                                  Iim          1
                                  k-*O



it is obvious that K/K is differentiable by an assumption on F.

     d   K     = s   [—k2f' (k) —        {f(k)     —   kf' (k)                 +             (k)




              <0     iff
                               —{f(k) —      kf'(k)} —1           > — SK
                                                                      —
                                         k2f''(k)                          S
                                                                            w


                     or       —    f' (k) {   f (k) — kf'       (k) }
                                                                          >(l — 5K            kf'(k)

Appendix 3

       First, we establish a theorem on the (global/local) stability

of linear differential equations on a two dimensional Euclidean

space.

       Suppose that two sets of linear differential equations are
                  2
defined on JR


(*1)                                               (x,y)E]R2

              \yJ \c d1 \y)

(*2)
              (x'\(a2   b2\ (X\                    (x,y)
              \yJ \C2   d2)y)
A "patched-up" system with a linear boundary is defined by the

following:


(*)                                                i=l if (x,y)ER1
              (x\(a b1\(x\
                                                   i=2 if (x,y)cR11
              \y) c1 d)yJ
       R1 = {xEJR2 Ihx + ky            O}

        R11    {xEJR2 Ihx +   ky   <   O}


        There exists at least one solution path for (*),        if solution
paths    are connected properly over the boundary, hx +        ky   =   0: a
solution path at a point on the boundary coming from one region
has to go out to the other region. In other words, the direction
of solution curves on the linearized boundary relative to the

direction of the boundary itself should agree for both systems

of differential equations. Existence of such a path is guaranteed

by Henry (1972).

Proof of Theorem A

       First, note that the i-th system of differential equations
is symmetric about the origin:


(Y)
               Ia. b.\/—x\
               11  1I    i
                             =
                                  Ia.
                                  ,i  b.\/x\
                                      it,
               c. d)_y)          ic.   d.,J\Y)
                                                              i=l,2


Secondly, a system is homogeneous:

(H)
                             ) = m( )C)
       Now consider a solution path starting from (x0,y0) , a point

on the boundary. Let us define a solution path of (*) as

                                    where        =
                                                     x(t(x0,y0))
                                              yt =   y(t(x0,y0))
                                 such that hx
                                            0
                                              + ky0 = 0.

since a solution path of either (*1) or (*2) alone must converge

to the origin, the solution path (xt,yt)i(x0,y0)}must either
converge to the origin without switching regimes, or intersect
the boundary to switch regimes. We claim that (xt,yt) (xOLO)
must intersect somewhere in the interval, ((—x0), (0,0))
before thefirst switching, if any, of regimes.

       Once the above claim is proved, we know that every time

regimes switch one from another, the distance of switching point

from the origin shrinks. Moreover, by the homogeneity the ratio

of shrinking (of every two switchings) stays constant, so that
{
    (xt,yt) (x0,y0) } does
           j
                             converge to the origin.
                                 —45—




     The solution path { xt,yt) (x0,y0) } is directed (i) toward
the origin staying on the linearized boundary, (ii) away from the
origin staying on the linearized boundary, or (iii) toward the

interior of one of the two regions, say, R1 without loss of gen-

erality. In a case of (ii) ,   it violates the stability of each
system itself, (S). In case of (i), the solution path converges
to the origin whenever it starts at the linearized boundary. It
implies that a solution path starting at an arbitrary initial

point stays on the same region forever (because solution paths
cannot "meet or "cross") .     Therefore   (S) is enough to assert

that ()   is   locally asymptotically stable. In a case of (iii),

we need a careful examination.      By homogeneity, (H), directions
of solution paths starting at all points on a linearized boundary

on the side of (x0, y0) are proportional. Therefore a solution path
starting from (x0, y0) cannot intersect that side of the linearized

boundary as the first switching point. Next suppose that the solution

path overshoots the origin and intersects the linearized boundary
further than the symmetric initial points

If the I-st system of differential equations is defined for the
entire   plane, the solution path starting at (-x ,-y0) according
                                                 0
to   (*]J-       must
                    have a symmetric path to the one starting from
(x0 ,y0) by (Y), and must intersect the linearized boundary
beyond (x0,y). This implies the I-st system        of   differential
                                    —46—



      equations has instability, and contradicts assumption (S). The
      above examination leaves the possibilities that the solution

      path must intersect somewhere in [(0,0), (-x01-y0)) after

      travelling in R1.                    In a case of arriving at

      the origin,other solution paths starting anywhere in ((0,0),
      (x0,y0)) should arrive at the origin by homogeneity. Now suppose
      that the solution path arrives at (-x11-y1)E((-x0,-y0), (0,0)),

      where the system switches to 11-nd set of differential equations.
      However, the parallel argument to the above applies to a solution

      path starting at (-x1,-y1), so that it must intersect somewhere
      in [(0,0), (x11y1)). We repeat this process and have the con-

—verging path to the origin obeying the 'patched-up" system of
      differential equations. It is obvious, by homogeneity, that any
      solution path starting from a point in ((0,0), (x,y0)) should

      proportionately shrink its distance from the origin everytime it

      crosses the boundary of (x, y0) side. Finally, we note that any

      path starting at an interior point of a region should converge
      to the origin travelling only within the region or intersect
                                                            --      the
      boundary to go into the other r'eEion, since otherwise it contradicts
      (S).
                                       _L7_


For the latter case, examine the behavior after the intersecting

point at boundary and it has been proved to converge to the

origin.



                                                              Q.E.D.



        Next we show the local stability of a "patched-up" system
of non—linear differential equations.


        Suppose that 1R2 is art±icred into two regions, R1 and R11

in such a way that R1 U R11 2 and S = R1 U R11 is a
connected line. In each phase a system of differential equa-

tions which satisfy the Lipschitz condition is defined:

(N*) (c,y) =     (f(x,y),   g(x,y)), i =            I    if (x,y)ER1
                                              i =   II   if (x,y)ER11


where       and R11 are open neighborhooclsof R1 and R11, respectively,
an f1 and g. are of Cl class.

     Note that at any point on the boundary which separates two
regions, a solution path traveling over the two regions is

connected smoothly, i.e.,           and       are continuous over the two

regions:


        (f1 (x,y), g1 (x,y) =   (f11 (x,y),   g11 (x,y))
                                              V   (x,y) ES

Suppose also that both systems of differential equations have a

unique commOn equilibrium poinL;
