Impact of China's Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance on Health Care Expenditure
and Health Outcomes

JEL No. I11,I13

                                              ABSTRACT

At the end of 1998, China launched a government-run mandatory insurance program, the Urban Employee
Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI), to replace the previous medical insurance system. Using the UEBMI
reform in China as a natural experiment, this study identify variations in patient cost sharing that were
imposed by the UEBMI reform and examine their effects on the demand for health-care services. Using
data from the 1991-2006 waves of the China Health and Nutrition Survey, we find that the increased
cost sharing is associated with decreased outpatient medical care utilization and expenditures but not
with decreased inpatient care utilization and expenditures. Patients from low- and middle-income households,
or in less-serious medical situations are found to be more sensitive to prices. We observe little impact
on patient health, as measured by self-reported poor health status.

1. Introduction

The effect of health insurance on health care and health has been one of the most
important and heated debate topics in health economics for decades. The majority of
studies focus on the effect of health insurance provision per se (extensive margin) on the
demand for health care and health outcomes2.

Nonetheless, relatively few studies focus on the changes of cost sharing of the health
insurance (intensive margin). One possible reason is the difficulty to identify the causal
effects of cost-sharing without a controlled experiment due to unobserved characteristics
in the presence of self-selection (for a review see Baicker and Goldman, 2011). The most
influential RAND Health Insurance Experiment (1974-1981) offers the best experimental
evidence on the effect of demand-side cost sharing on utilization and health outcomes
(Manning et al., 1987; Newhouse, 1993; Aron-Dine et al., 2013), but such experiments
are rarely available.

Subsequent work have sought to utilize the quasi-experiments to draw causal inferences
on the effect of cost sharing (Chandra et al, 2010; Skipper, 2013; Shigeoka, 2014;
Chandra et al, 2014). For example, Chandra, Gruber and McKnight (2010) analyzed the
effects of an increased co-payment for supplemental insurance for retired public
employees in California, but the change in co-payments that was studied was small and
restricted to office visits and prescription drugs. Shigeoka (2014) used a reduction in cost
sharing for patients older than 70 years of age in Japan to examine the causal effect on
utilization, patient health and financial protection against risk. While the studies primarily
focus on the developed economies, little is known on the effect of cost sharing in
developing countries.

This study will provide insights into the sensitivity of medical consumption to its price in
a developing country. In this paper, we use Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance


2
  Many studies, including studies that have investigated the effects of Medicare and Medicaid coverage
expansion in the US (Card et al., 2008; Finkelstein and McKnight, 2008; Cutler and Gruber, 1996; Currie
and Gruber, 2001; Finkelstein et al., 2012) and of National Health Insurance (NHI) in Taiwan (Cheng and
Chiang, 1997; Chen et al., 2007; Chang, 2012), as well as the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS)
(Lei and Lin, 2009; Chen and Jin, 2012) and Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance (URBMI) in
mainland China (Lin et al., 2009; Liu and Zhao, 2014), have evaluated the effects of health insurance
provisions per se (i.e., the extensive margin) on the demand for health care and on health outcomes.


                                                   2
(UEBMI) reform in China as a natural experiment to identify large variations in patient
cost-sharing and to investigate their effects on the demand for health care services. Prior
to the reform, China’s previous medical insurance system for urban employees provided
comprehensive benefits with minimal cost sharing (Liu, 2002). Nearly full insurance
coverage led to health care services being over-utilized (Yip and Hsiao, 1997). To contain
medical costs and widen the coverage, the Chinese government launched a reform of the
health insurance system in 1998. This reform increased the cost sharing for patients
through a combination of deductible, coinsurance and individual medical savings
accounts (MSAs). Therefore, the UEBMI reform provides a unique opportunity to
examine the price sensitivity of health care consumption behavior in China. To our
knowledge, this study is the first to investigate how increased patient cost sharing in
UEBMI affects utilization, expenditures and health among urban employees.

Few empirical studies have focused on the UEBMI reform since its inception in 1998
(Yip and Hsiao, 1997; Liu et al., 2002; Dong, 2003; Liu and Zhao, 2006; Ding and Zhu,
2007). The existing studies have limitations that must be considered. First, the UEBMI
reform may have increased the health care access and expenditures for the uninsured
because of the coverage expansion; in addition, the reform may also have decreased the
demand for health care from former enrollees because of increased patient cost sharing.
Failing to disentangle these two effects could lead to ambiguous results. Second, a simple
pre-post comparison analysis could not identify the true effects of the UEBMI reform,
because the results of such an analysis are confounded by other supply-side interventions.
Finally, some previous studies have examined relatively small pilot areas or used short
observation periods, and hence, the results of such studies may not be nationally
representative.

This study offers several advantages over previous empirical studies. First, we use the
uninsured population over the reform period as the control group to eliminate the
potential influence of other changes during the same period. Second, to estimate the
effects of cost sharing, rather than of new insurance provision, we restrict our treatment
group to respondents who were UEBMI enrollees after the reform and previous insurance
beneficiaries before the reform. We exclude individuals who were covered by UEBMI
after the reform but who were previously uninsured. Third, the China Health and


                                             3
Nutrition Survey (CHNS) was not updated to incorporate “UEBMI” as a new insurance
option until the 2006 wave. Thus, we are unable to determine when the transition from
previous system to UEBMI occurred for each individual. We employ two complementary
methods to address this problem: first, we impute the probability of UEBMI enrollment
for each individual based on geographical and time variations in enrollment, and second,
we exclude the data from 2000 wave for individuals with ambiguous insurance status in
that year. We find broadly similar results using these two methods. Finally, we use a
nationally representative longitudinal data from CHNS and fully exploit the information
from the pre-UEBMI period (from the 1991, 1993 and 1997 waves of CHNS) and the
post-UEBMI period (from the 2000, 2004 and 2006 waves of the CHNS) so that we are
able to provide more generalized evidence of the UEBMI reform.

We have two main findings. First, we find that increased cost sharing in UEBMI is
associated with decreased medical utilization and expenditure. Examining the patterns of
access and expenditures in more detail, we find that the probability of utilizing outpatient
care decrease 6.9-7.0% and that the outpatient expenditures decline by 35.2-35.4% due to
the UEBMI reform. In contrast, the effects of UEBMI on inpatient care utilization and
expenditure are consistently insignificant and small, due to either smaller cost-sharing
changes in inpatient care or to smaller response to cost-sharing for more serious medical
conditions. This findings suggest that moral hazard has a great impact on the demand for
health care in China, and that overuse has been mitigated by the UEBMI reform via the
introduction of a cost sharing-mechanism to some extent. Second, we do not find that the
greater patient cost sharing significantly affects health outcomes, measured by
self-reported health status. Because health is a stock, it might still be too early to evaluate
the long-term effects of cost sharing on self-reported health status.

The remaining sections are organized as follow. Section 2 briefly introduces the
institutional background; Section 3 describes the data and presents the identification
strategy; and Section 4 discusses the main results of our study. The final section discusses
several policy implications of our findings.




                                               4
2. Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance



Before the reform, China’s previous medical insurance system for urban employees
primarily consisted of the Government Insurance Scheme (GIS) and Labor Insurance
Scheme (LIS). Both schemes provided comprehensive benefits with minimal cost sharing
for employees in public-sector, state-owned, and collectively owned enterprises and
partial coverage for their dependents.

The nearly full insurance coverage of GIS and LIS coupled with a fee-for-service
payment method on the supply side led to health care services being over-utilized,
resulting in excessive escalation of health care costs and inefficient resource allocations.
Although these two programs covered only 15 percent of the total population, by 1993,
they accounted for 36% of total health spending and approximately two-thirds of all
public spending on health (World Bank, 1996).

To contain medical costs and widen insurance coverage, the Chinese government
launched a health insurance reform in 1998 by merging the GIS and LIS systems into the
new UEBMI system. UEBMI is a government-run mandatory insurance program based
on employment. UEBMI began as a pilot program in 1994 and rapidly expanded from 40
of 349 prefecture-level cities in 1998 to 339 cities in 2001 and to most cities in 2002. By
the end of 2002, 69.3 million workers were covered by UEBMI; this number is
equivalent to 96% (72.1 million) of the urban employees in the enterprise sector3.

The UEBMI is the largest among social medical insurance plans in China and primarily
financed by payroll taxes paid by both employers (6%) and employees (2%). The
contributions of employers are divided into two accounts: 70% goes into a social pooling
account (SPA), and 30% is deposited into individual medical savings accounts (MSAs).
The funds paid by employees are deposited into their MSAs.

The SPA is primarily used for inpatient services and outpatient services for catastrophic
illness and administrated by the local government. MSAs are primarily used for
outpatient services, as well as for drug purchase from contracted providers. Before the

3
    Data resource is China Labor and Social Security Yearbook, 2000-2006. See Table 1 for more information.


                                                         5
SPA pays inpatient expenditures, however, patients must first pay a deductible
(approximately 10% of annual wages) and coinsurance (usually 20-30%). When the
maximum benefit (four times the average annual wage of a local urban worker) has been
paid by an SPA or an individual’s MSA is exhausted, then the individual must pay his or
her expenses out of pocket. Unspent funds in MSAs can be carried over to the next year.
Any remaining of an individual’s MSA balance at death can become part of the person’s
estate.

MSAs were initiated in Singapore and then experimented in the United States, China,
South Africa (Hanvoravongchai, 2002). MSAs can reduce the waste from the excessive
use of generously insured care by providing incentives for patients to be more
cost-conscious in their consumption of medical services (Keeler et al., 1996). Compared
with the GIS and the LIS, UEBMI increases cost sharing for patients through a
combination of deductibles, coinsurance and individual medical savings accounts
(MSAs). As the real coinsurance rate raises the effective price of medical care, insured
individuals paid more out of pocket for medical services after the reform; thus, the
utilization of medical services, and hence health outcomes, will change. However, few
studies are available concerning how patient cost sharing in UEBMI affects utilization,
costs and health.

In Figure 1, we plot the cost sharing changes that occurred during the reform period using
CHNS data. Before the reform, approximately 30-40% of outpatient medical
expenditures were paid out of pocket by LIS beneficiaries. After the reform,
out-of-pocket payments accounted for a greater proportion of spending; this proportion
was as high as 93% in 2006. In contrast, the share of inpatient expenditures paid by
patients increased only modestly, from 20 to 30%, over the same period. Thus, MSAs,
together with higher deductibles and coinsurance payments, increased the real level of
patient cost sharing, particularly for outpatient care, and thereby created strong incentives
for patients to save their own money by choosing health care services in a cost-conscious
manner.

[ Figure 1] (to be inserted here)

The LIS was replaced by the new UEBMI a decade ago. Nonetheless, the integration of


                                              6
GIS is not yet complete. Some central government agencies and several provincial
government agencies have not participated in the UEBMI simply because government
civil servants would prefer to enjoy nearly free medical care under the GIS (Xu, et al.,
2007). Although cost sharing for GIS beneficiaries has increased slightly since the
UEBMI reform and the out-of-pocket spending has also increased, the GIS remains the
most generous public health insurance program.

Although UEBMI has expanded the coverage for employees, there are still a large
number of uninsured urban residents due to no formal employment. To provide health
protection for those people, the government launched an Urban Resident Basic Medical
Insurance (URBMI) program in 2007. For uninsured rural residents, the New
Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) was implemented in 2003.

So far, China has achieved nearly universal health insurance coverage. In 2011, 1.28
billion people, which are more than 95% of the population of China (National Bureau of
Statistics of China, 2012), were covered by public health insurance, namely, the UEBMI,
URBMI and the NCMS. As stated by Yip et al. (2012), accomplishing nearly universal
insurance coverage in such a short period of time is commendable, but transforming
insurance coverage into cost-effective services is difficult. It is a real challenge for
policymakers to develop a fair, affordable and sustainable system of social health
insurance.

3. Data and Identification

3.1 Data

CHNS data used in this study are provided by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and
Prevention and by the Population Research Center of the University of North Carolina in
the USA. The first round of the CHNS was conducted in 1989. Eight subsequent waves
followed, in 1991, 1993, 1997, 2000, 2004, 2006, 2009 and 2011. The household and
individual survey includes modules on respondent demographics, health, nutrition and
income. Since 1991, detailed information has been collected on health care utilization and
health-related behaviors. In this study, data from six CHNS waves surrounding the
UEBMI reform are examined, including data from the 1991-1997 waves, which are



                                               7
collected before the reform, and data from the 2000-2006 waves, which are collected
following the enactment of UEBMI.

The UEBMI reform may have impacted the medical care utilization and health outcomes
differently in different population groups. After the reform, UEBMI provided insurance
coverage for the previously uninsured and reduced their out-of-pocket spending.
However, for individuals with former generous GIS or LIS coverage, the reform
increased their cost sharing through coinsurance and MSAs. The aim of this study is to
estimate the effects of increased cost sharing that occurred as a consequence of the
UEBMI reform; therefore, we exclude individuals who were covered by UEBMI in wave
2006 but were uninsured before that time. The final sample consists of 1764 urban
respondents in each pre- and post-UEBMI period. A total of 382 respondents who
initially enrolled in GIS or LIS but switched to UEBMI in 2006 are classified as the
treatment group, and 1382 respondents who never enrolled in any public health insurance
throughout the entire study period are classified as the control group. The respondents in
our sample were interviewed at least twice, i.e., at least once in each period, yielding an
unbalanced panel of 7065 observations. The main variables and summary statistics are
presented in Table 2.

3.2 Dependent Variables and Key Independent Variable

The main dependent variables in our study are medical utilization and medical
expenditures. The utilization variables take a value of one when total spending, outpatient
spending or inpatient spending is positive and take a value of zero otherwise. The
expenditure variables are the amount of annual medical spending (in 2011 RMB).

The goals of the UEBMI reform were to curb the overutilization of health care services
and to improve the efficiency and equity of medical resource allocation. Nonetheless,
medical costs should not be contained at the expense of appropriate health care utilization
and population health. However, defining appropriate care requires detailed information
of the clinical situation and its intervention for each patient (Sanmartin et al., 2008),
which is not available is CHNS data. Thus, we make a crude assumption that if patients
are more likely to experience adverse health consequences after the reform, they may
suffer from the lack of provision of necessary care as a result of increased cost-sharing; if


                                              8
not, they may just reduce the use of inappropriate care. For this purpose, we examine not
only the effects of UEBMI on medical utilization and spending but also on health
outcomes, which are measured using self-reports of poor health status.

The key explainable variable is whether an individual is enrolled in UEBMI. Ideally, after
the enactment of UEBMI in 1998, the CHNS would have added UEBMI as a new
medical insurance option4. Unfortunately, however, the survey did not update this
question until the 2006 wave, nearly 8 years after the inception of UEBMI. Thus, we do
know that all the treated were switched from the previous GIS/LIS system to the new
UEBMI system by 2006, but we do not know when these transitions occurred. In 2000
and 2004 wave, urban employees who were actually covered by UEBMI could not
indicate this in the CHNS; instead, they probably misreported to have their previous
insurance plans.

We employ two complementary methods to correct for UEBMI misreporting. First, we
follow Brown and Goolsbee’s (2002) procedure by imputing the probability of UEBMI
enrollment for each individual using geographical and time variation in the UEBMI
coverage. We use official statistics to compute this measure. The numbers of UEBMI
enrollees for each province in each year were published in the China Labor and Social
Security Yearbook 2000-2006. As shown in Table 1, we calculate the coverage as the ratio
of workers covered by UEBMI to total urban employment in an enterprise or an
institution in a given province. We then match the UEBMI coverage data to the CHNS
data and use this measure as the probability that the individual had transitioned from the
previous GIS/LIS to the current UEBMI. For example, for those individuals in our
treatment group from Liaoning province, the key independent variable UEBMI takes a
value of 0.1662 for the 2000 wave and a value of 1 for the 2004 wave.

[Table 1] (to be inserted here)



The other approach we use is to exclude the observations with ambiguous insurance

4
 Beginning in the 1991 wave, CHNS respondents were asked whether they had any medical insurance. If
they answered yes, the respondents were then asked which of the following types of medical insurance they
had: GIS, LIS, Cooperative insurance, and other insurance. In 2006 wave, the UEBMI replaced LIS as an
option.


                                                   9
status. As previously mentioned, UEBMI expanded rapidly, from being implemented in
40 cities of a total of 349 prefecture-level cities in 1998 to 339 cities in 2001. As shown
in Table 1, all surveyed provinces (except for Guizhou) have more workers covered by
UEBMI than the reported local urban employment in 2004. Even in Guizhou province,
the coverage rate is greater than 95%. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the vast
majority of urban employees with previous GIS/LIS had transitioned into the new
UEBMI by this time5. For all treated individuals, the key independent variable UEBMI
takes the values of 1 in the 2004 wave. However, the year 2000 is in the middle of the
transition, and the extent to which individuals were enrolled in UEBMI at that time is
unknown. Thus, we exclude all observations in the 2000 wave and instead use data from
2004 and 2006 wave for the post-UEBMI period. This exclusion causes our sample to
shrink to 5013 observations. Moreover, this specification provides assurance that our
results are not be driven by patients stockpiling drugs or seeking care in anticipation of
the policy change. Such behavior may magnify the reduction in utilization and
expenditures after the UEBMI reform and hence, lead to an upward bias. Therefore, we
prefer this specification as our baseline model.

Following the literature (Chen et al., 2007; Ding and Zhu, 2007; Chang, 2012; Liu and
Zhao, 2014), we also control for a set of demographic, socioeconomic and health
characteristics in the model. The demographic characteristics that we consider are age,
gender, marital status and residential area; the socioeconomic characteristics that we
control for are education and household income level; and health status are measured by
self-reporting, as well as chronic diseases (as measured by a diagnosis of hypertension,
diabetes, heart disease and stroke).



3.3 Descriptive Statistics

Table 2 illustrates the outcomes and characteristics of the UEBMI beneficiaries (treated)
and the non- beneficiaries (control) before and after the enactment of the UEBMI reform
5
  It is true that the coverage above 100% does not necessarily mean that every worker with LIS has
transitioned into UEBMI because UEBMI also increases the coverage to the previously uninsured.
However, it is much easier to persuade an employer to transition from self-insurance to social insurance
and harder to ask an employer to provide new benefits. Thus, in the early stages, most UEBMI enrollees
were former GIS/LIS enrollees


                                                    10
was enacted. There were differences in health utilization and expenditures between the
treated and control group before the reform, but the gaps narrowed after the reform.
Before the reform, the enrollees were 3.2% (0.089-0.057) more likely to use medical care
and had 86% ((0.067-0.036)/0.036) higher total spending. After the reform, these
numbers declined to 1.7% (0.144-0.127) and 44% ((0.196-0.136)/0.136), respectively.
These expletory results are supported by the regression analyses discussed in next
section.

Compared with the treatment group, respondents in the control group were more likely to
be female, younger, and less educated and have lower household incomes. They were
also less likely to suffer from chronic disease (e.g., hypertension and diabetes) but more
likely to report poor health status. It is not surprising that individuals in disadvantageous
socioeconomic conditions were more likely to be uninsured, because the urban public
health insurance programs were primarily employment-based during the study period.



[Table 2] (to be inserted here)

3.4 Identification Strategy

The UEBMI reform in China aims to address the moral hazard by establishing a
cost-sharing mechanism for patients, particularly through individual saving accounts that
can be used to pay for outpatient treatment. To evaluate whether the reform has resulted
in expectable achievements, we must investigate whether the reform has reduced the
overuse of medical resources.

However, a simple pre-post comparison analysis could not identify the true UEBMI
reform effects because the results were confounded by other supply-side interventions,
such as changes in provider payment methods and price regulations. To isolate the
insurance effect from the effects of other policies, we specify a reduced-form relationship
and conduct a difference-in-difference (DID) analysis, with the uninsured as the control
group and the insured as the treatment group. This strategy compares the post- and
pre-reform changes in medical utilization and expenditures for the treatment group to the
corresponding changes for the uninsured over the same period. These two changes



                                              11
produce a negative difference-in-difference if the UEBMI reform effectively controls the
overuse of medical services. Unlike the voluntary URBMI and NCMS, UEBMI
enrollment is mandatory, and individual choice has little influence on the UEBMI
enrollment decision after an individual accepts a job. Therefore, it is reasonable to
assume that the UEBMI reform is exogenous to individuals. To control for time-invariant
unobservable, we take advantage of the longitudinal data and specify the individual fixed
effects. We denote an individual by i, the residential province by s, and the year by t.
Following the literature (Chen et al., 2007; Aron-Dine et al., 2013; Liu and Zhao, 2014),
the baseline difference-in-difference model takes the following forms:



where an outcome         (i.e., medical utilization or expenditure) is the dependent variable.
We transform the medical expenditure data, which were skewed, by taking the natural
logarithm. The key explanatory variable                  indicates individual i’s UEBMI
enrollment status at time t (specifically, an interaction between an indicator variable for
being in the treated group, who experience a substantial increase in cost sharing, and an
indicator variable for being in the post-UEBMI period ).           is a vector of individual
observable characteristics. We include year fixed effects ( ) and a full set of
province-by-year interactions (       ) to account for any effects of time trends or
province-specific time trends. We also include individual fixed effects ( ) to control for
time-invariant unobservable confounders. In all of our analyses, we cluster the standard
errors on the household identifier.

The key identifying assumption here is that other factors exert the identical influences on
the control group and treatment group so that all the changes in utilization and
expenditures can only be attributed to the UEBMI reform. However, it has been reported
that in Zhenjiang City, where the UEBMI is strictly regulated by local social insurance
agency, hospital profits from insured patients are limited; thus, hospitals turn to the
uninsured patients to increase their profits and give such patients unnecessary checkups
and drugs (Development Research Center of the State Council, 2005). Such different
influences alone will also lead to relative reduction in care use and costs for the insured,
thus will cause us to overstate the effect of cost sharing. In contrast, a recent study by Lu



                                               12
(2014) examines doctor’s prescription decision using a field experiment in China and
finds that when expecting revenues from drug prescription, doctors write 43% more
expensive prescriptions to insured patients than to uninsured patients. Such behavior will
then cause us to underestimate the effect of cost sharing. Taken together, the impacts of
supply-side on utilization and expenditures are ambiguous and may offset each other.



4. Empirical Results

4.1 UEBMI effects on health care utilization and expenditure
Table 3 shows the treatment effects of the UEBMI reform on several measures of
health-care utilization and expenditures. Each cell reports a coefficient of UEBMI and its
standard error (in parentheses). Column 1 shows the fixed effects estimates of the
intent-to-treat (ITT) effect of UEBMI for the target population. Columns 2 and 3 report
the impact of the UEBMI reform using provincial UEBMI coverage data or dropping
observations with ambiguous insurance status to correct for UEBMI misreports.

[Table 3] (to be inserted here)



In table 3, panel 1 examines the impact of UEBMI on medical utilization. The results
indicate a 5.1-9.2 percentage point decrease in the probability of individual’s utilization
of formal medical services due to the UEBMI reform. As expected, the ITT estimate
tends to underestimate the true effect of the reform because the ITT estimate assumes that
all individuals in the treatment group had been treated since 2000. In fact, the UEBMI
system was not available in all the cities until the end of 2002. Therefore, the ITT
estimate mixes the effect of the new UEBMI with the effect of previous GIS/LIS.
Because the CHNS questionnaire was not updated until several years after the launch of
UEBMI, we could not determine from the survey exactly when the GIS/LIS enrollees
became UEBMI enrollees. Thus, to clearly identify the impact of the UEBMI reform, we
employ two complementary strategies. First, we use provincial UEBMI coverage to
proxy the possibility of UEBMI enrollment for each individual in that province for that
year. The other approach we use is to exclude the observations with ambiguous insurance



                                             13
status. Thus, we exclude all observations from the 2000 wave and instead use 2004 and
2006 wave as the post-UEBMI period. We find broadly similar results using these
plausible alternative models: the possibility of formal health care utilization decrease
8.7-9.2 percentage point because of the UEBMI reform.
Panel 2 and 3 show the results for outpatient care and inpatient care separately. As noted
above, the UEBMI reform primarily increased the cost-sharing of outpatient care; in
contrast, the cost sharing of inpatient care remained relatively stable. The results for
outpatient care exhibit the same pattern as those for all health care. The probability of
outpatient care utilization decreases by 6.9-7.0 percentage point due to the UEBMI
reform. In contrast, the effects of UEBMI on inpatient care utilization are consistently
insignificant and small, suggesting either there were smaller cost-sharing changes of
inpatient care or smaller responses to cost-sharing for more serious medical conditions.
Panel 4-6 report results for logged medical expenditures. The ITT estimate suggests a
21.3% decline in average total medical spending for UEBMI target population. After
correcting the misreports, there is a sizeable and statistically significant reduction of
35.7-39.1% total medical expenditures. A similar pattern is again observed for outpatient
expenditures but not for inpatient expenditures. The UEBMI reform significantly
decreases the outpatient expenditure by 35.2-35.4%. The increased cost-sharing
associated with UEBMI has no impact on inpatient expenditure; this finding is consistent
with the results of a study by Aron-Dine et al. (2013) using RAND health insurance
experiment data.

Table 4 shows the estimation of the UEBMI reform and other characteristics’ effect on
health-care utilization and expenditures using the baseline specification (with 2004 and
2006 wave as post-UEBMI period). The estimation results of control variables are
consistent with the literature. For medical utilization and expenditures, the most
predictive variables have been reported to be self-perceived health status and the presence
of any chronic disease (Chen at el., 2007). Using the worst self-evaluated health status as
a reference, all other health dummy variables have highly significant negative
coefficients in the model, which means that better health leads to decreased medical
utilization and expenditures. Studies have shown that chronic diseases greatly increase
the utilization of medical services (Liu et al., 2003). We find that the total medical


                                              14
expenses of people with high blood pressure and heart disease are 55.4% and 160%
greater, respectively, than those of people without these diseases. Finally, a 10% increase
in household income results in a 0.58% increase in total medical expenditures.

[Table 4] (to be inserted here)



4.2 Heterogeneous effects of UEBMI
Table 5 shows the treatment effects of the UEBMI reform for different subgroups using
the baseline specification. As shown above, the sensitivity of medical consumption to its
price varies with patient’s health conditions. If cost-sharing mechanisms in the UEBMI
system lower the actual reimbursement rate, then insured patients reduce their excessive
demands, we should find that such effect is stronger for less serious medical conditions,
such as common cold. We further restrict the sample to those individual who ever had
symptoms, e.g., fever, sore throat or cough during the previous four weeks. As shown in
column 1, patients suffered from such less serious medical condition are more responsive
because they are more likely to take some unnecessary care or drugs under such situation.
In column 2, we focus on working age adults and exclude the data for people older than
60 years of age. People are still covered by UEBMI when they retired but they are not
covered when they become unemployed. We find that the UEBMI reform has broad
negative effects on total and outpatient utilization and expenditure for working age adults,
and their probability of outpatient care utilization decreases 6.6 percentage point and their
outpatient expenditure falls by 25.4%. The results suggest that although working age
adults may be less price sensitive than the elderly, the baseline results in Table 3 could
not be driven only by the elderly. These findings are consistent with Skipper (2013) on
the price elasticity of demand for prescription drugs in Denmark, which the elderly are
more price sensitive in his study.
In column 3-5, we examine the differential effects of the UEBMI reform for low-income
(30th percentile or below), meddle-income (between the 30th and 70th percentile) and
high-income (70th percentile or above) households. The results show that the increased
cost-sharing of UEBMI has stronger negative impacts for low- and meddle-income
groups: their probabilities of utilizing outpatient care decrease 23.4 and 6.5 percentage



                                             15
point and their outpatient spending decline by 63.5 and 41.4%, respectively. However, the
UEBMI reform has no significant effect on the outpatient care utilization and
expenditures for high-income households. The MSA balances, which are mainly used for
the outpatient services, are typically proportional to wages, and the low- and
meddle-income groups are likely to use up their MSA funds more quickly and to incur
larger out-of-pocket payment, as a result, the low- and meddle-income groups are more
sensitive to changes in cost sharing. These findings are consistent with those of Liu and
Zhao (2014), who investigate the effects of URBMI and find that the high-income group
is less responsive to price changes.

4.3 UEBMI effects on health outcome
We find that the UEBMI reform reduces health-care utilization and expenditures and
reliefs moral hazard through cost-sharing mechanisms. Nonetheless, little is known about
whether the reform has any detrimental effect on health status. To answer this question,
we investigate the effects of the reform on health outcomes, as measured by self-reported
poor health status. For the precision of dependent variable, we exclude all observations
for which self-reported health status is unavailable6.

In contract to the effects on utilization and expenditures, we do not find any evidence that
the UEBMI reform affects health outcomes. As shown in Table 6, the UEBMI reform has
a consistently negative but statistically insignificant association with self-perceived poor
health status in different specifications. Nonetheless, the long-term health consequences
of increased cost sharing are unclear. The RAND experiment also finds that a higher
patient payment significantly reduces medical care utilization, without any adverse health
outcome on average (Newhouse, 1993).



    [Table 6] (to be inserted here)

  We create a binary variable indicating whether the self-reported health status is missing and we control
this variable in previous analyses.


                                                    16
Taken together, these results suggest that greater patient cost-sharing instituted by the
UEBMI reform has significantly reduced both the medical care utilization and
expenditures, without any adverse health outcome. Much of the savings may be derived
from reduced use of expensive high-tech diagnostic procedures or drugs, according to the
observation by Yip and Hsiao (1997) from Zhenjiang, one of the polite cities of UEBMI.
Hence, the increased cost-sharing can help reduce the scope for moral hazard and control
the excessive medical demands to some extents.

5. Conclusion Remarks

It is difficult to identify the causal effects of cost-sharing without a controlled experiment
due to unobserved characteristics in the presence of self-selection. This paper attempts to
contribute to the literature by the UEBMI reform in China as a natural experiment to
identify variations in patient cost sharing and examine its effect on demand for health
care services. We exploit the changes in health care consumption and health status both
across groups (treated vs. control) and across time (before and after the UEBMI reform)
to estimate the causal effect of UEBMI reform.

There are two main findings of this study. First, we find that increased cost sharing in
UEBMI is associated with decrease in medical care utilization and expenditures. After
examining the patterns of access and expenditures in more detail, we find that the
probability of utilizing outpatient care decreases by 6.9-7.0 percentage point and that
outpatient expenditures decline by 35.2-35.4% due to the UEBMI reform. In contrast, the
effects of UEBMI on inpatient care utilization and expenditures are consistently
insignificant and small either because cost-sharing changes for inpatient care are smaller
than those for outpatient care or because people exhibit smaller sensitivity to cost sharing
for more serious medical conditions. These findings suggest that moral hazard has greatly
impacts on the demand for health care in China and the overuse that occurred before the
UEBMI system was implemented has mitigated to some extent after its implementation
by the introduction of a cost-sharing mechanism.

Second, we do not find that the greater patient cost sharing significantly affects health
outcomes, measured by self-reported poor health. Since health is a stock, it might be still
too early to be able to determine the long-term effects of cost sharing on health outcomes.


                                             17
The study also has strong policy implications. According to an article published in The
Lancet (Hu et al., 2008), the most important health-related challenges that will be faced
in the 21st century are how to finance, provide and organize health care. China has
preliminarily established a social health insurance system that covers the largest
population in the world. The development of a fair, affordable and sustainable system of
social health insurance offers real challenges for policymakers. Our study indicates that a
restraint mechanism of the public medical insurance with appropriate supply-side
controls may be an effective method of mitigating the overconsumption of medical
services and promoting the efficiency of medical resource allocation.

The results of this study should be interpreted with caution because they are subject to a
number of limitations. First, we could not directly measure the coinsurance rate using
CHNS data. Thus, in contrast with previous literature (Manning, 1987), we could not
precisely estimate the price elasticity of health-care demand. Second, because UEBMI
only began 16 years ago, it may still be too early to assess its long-term effects on health.

In each cell, we report the effect of UEBMI reform. Other control variables include individual characteristics such as
age, marital status, education, household income, disease history and self-reported health status. We also control for
province by wave dummy variable, year fixed effects, as well as individual fixed effects. Cluster-robust standard errors
are reported in parenthesis.
