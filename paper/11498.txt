                                              ABSTRACT

Which commercial bank supervisory policies ease            or intensify    the degree to which bank
corruption is an obstacle to firms raising external finance? Based on new data from more than 2,500
firms across 37 countries, this paper provides the first empirical assessment of the impact of different
bank supervisory policies on firms’ financing obstacles. We find that the traditional approach to bank
supervision, which involves empowering official supervisory agencies to directly monitor, discipline,
and influence banks, does not improve the integrity of bank lending. Rather, we find that a
supervisory strategy that focuses on empowering private monitoring of banks by forcing banks to
disclose accurate information to the private sector tends to lower the degree to which corruption of
bank officials is an obstacle to firms raising external finance. In extensions, we find that regulations
that empower private monitoring exert a particularly beneficial effect on the integrity of bank lending
in countries with sound legal institutions.

1. Introduction

         Banks provide a substantial proportion of external finance to enterprises around the globe.

Yet, there have been no previous studies of whether international differences in bank supervision

influence the obstacles that corporations face in raising external finance. Furthermore, the Basel

Committee, International Monetary Fund and World Bank promote the development of powerful

bank supervisory agencies with the authority to monitor and discipline banks. Yet, there exists no

cross-country evidence to support these recommendations, nor is there evidence on the general

question of which bank supervisory policies facilitate efficient corporate finance.

         This paper provides the first assessment of the relationship between bank supervisory

policies and the degree to which corruption in lending impedes the ability of firms to raise external

finance. Theory provides conflicting predictions about the impact of bank supervisory policies on

the extent to which corruption of bank officials impedes the efficient allocation of bank credit.

Thus, by examining the integrity of bank lending, we distinguish among different approaches to

supervision as well as more general theories of the role of government in the economy.

         Indeed, general theories of government regulation provide a natural framework for assessing

bank supervision. When information costs, transactions costs, and government policies interfere

with the incentives and abilities of private agents to monitor banks, strong official supervision of

banks can improve the corporate governance of banks (Stigler, 1971).1 This “supervisory power

view” holds that private agents frequently lack the incentives and capabilities to monitor powerful

banks. From this perspective, a powerful supervisory agency that directly monitors and disciplines

  Also, see Becker (1968) and Becker and Stigler (1974). Furthermore, some may reject the importance of market
failures in banking. In a world with (i) no information or transactions costs, (ii) governments that maximize social
welfare, and (iii) well-defined and efficiently enforced property rights, market participants will achieve efficient
outcomes (Coase, 1960). If the prerequisites for this laissez-faire – invisible hand – theory hold, government supervision
of banks would be at best irrelevant and potentially harmful to social welfare (Stigler, 1975). The empirical evidence
below also provides evidence on this laissez-faire view.
                                                                                                        2
banks can enhance the corporate governance of banks, reduce corruption in bank lending, and

thereby boost the efficiency with which banks intermediate society’s savings. The official

supervision theory assumes that governments have both the expertise and the incentives to

ameliorate market imperfections and improve the governance of banks.

       An alternative to the supervisory power view also draws on core theories of public policy

and regulation. The “political/regulatory capture view” argues that politicians and supervisors do

not maximize social welfare; they maximize their own private welfare (Hamilton, et al., 1788;

Buchanan and Tullock, 1962; Becker, 1983; Shleifer and Vishny, 1998). Thus, if bank supervisory

agencies have the power to discipline non-compliant banks, then politicians and supervisors may

use this power to induce banks to divert the flow of credit to politically connected firms (Becker and

Stigler, 1974; Stigler, 1975; Haber et al., 2003). Under these conditions, banks do not only allocate

capital based on risk-return criteria. Rather, when supervisory agencies have the power to influence

the distribution of bank loans, then corruption and political ties may shape the allocation of bank

credit. This theory suggests that strengthening the power of the supervisory agency may actually

reduce the integrity of bank lending with adverse implications on the efficiency of credit allocation.

Logical extensions of the political/regulatory capture view imply that powerful supervisory agencies

will have less of a tendency to abuse their power for private gain in countries with sound institutions

that constrain exploitative behavior by government officials. We test this hypothesis below.

       Finally, the “private empowerment view” argues that bank supervisory policies should

focus on enhancing the ability and incentives of private agents to overcome information and

transaction costs, so that private investors can exert effective governance over banks. The private

empowerment view simultaneously recognizes the potential importance of market failures, which

motivate government intervention, and political/regulatory failures, which suggest that supervisory
                                                                                                      3
agencies do not necessarily have incentives to ease market failures. Consequently, the private

empowerment view seeks to provide supervisors with the responsibility and authority to induce

banks to disclose accurate information to the public, so that private agents can more effectively

monitor banks (Hay and Shleifer, 1998). This view also holds that many empowered private bank

creditors will be less susceptible to capture by politicians and banks than a single supervisory

agency. Furthermore, the private empowerment view stresses that transparent information will help

private investors exert effective corporate governance over banks only when sound legal institutions

operate in the country. Thus, the private empowerment view holds that corruption of bank officials

will be less of a constraint on corporate finance in countries that foster public information disclosure

and have well-functioning legal institutions than in countries that rely on powerful official

supervisors.

       This paper is further motivated by recent trends in corporate finance and public policy

debates. First, an enormous theoretical literature examines the role of banks, along with

shareholders and other financiers, in easing financing constraints and exerting corporate governance

(Shleifer and Vishny, 1997; Morck, Wolfenzon, and Yeung, 2005). Based on some of these models,

empirical research examines how laws concerning shareholders influence corporate finance (Beck

and Levine, 2005). Yet, there exists no corresponding work that examines how bank supervision

influences corporate finance. This paper is an initial attempt to better understand how different

supervisory policies influence the obstacles faced by firms in raising external finance.

       Second, influential international institutions, such as the Bank for International Settlements,

the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank, are encouraging countries to strengthen bank

supervision. Although these recommendations are frequently discussed in the context of avoiding

banking crises, crises cannot be the only criterion because policymakers can essentially eliminate
                                                                                                         4
banking crises through a 100 percent reserve requirement. Thus, an important, if often under-stated,

objective of bank supervision is to foster efficient capital allocation; i.e., to finance worthy firms

based on market – not corrupt -- criteria. To provide information about which types of bank

supervisory strategies work best to promote efficient corporate finance, this paper assesses the

impact of different bank supervisory policies on the degree to which bank corruption impedes firms

from obtaining external finance.

       This paper uses firm-level data on more than 2,500 firms across 37 countries to examine the

impact of bank supervision on the obstacles that firms encounter in raising external capital. The

firm-level data come from the World Business Environment Survey (WBES), which was conducted

in 1999. This dataset includes information on firm characteristics, including the degree to which

bank corruption is important to raising capital. These data are based on survey questions in which

firms rank the impediments on a scale from one to four, with larger values implying that bank

corruption is a greater obstacle.

       The bank supervisory data come from Barth, Caprio, and Levine (2004, henceforth BCL).

These data include information on official supervisory power, such as the ability to intervene in

banks, replace managers, force provisioning, stop dividends and other payments, acquire

information, etc. BCL also collect information on the degree to which supervisory authorities

facilitate private monitoring of banks by not reducing the incentives of the private sector to monitor

banks through deposit insurance and by forcing accurate information disclosure. Specifically, BCL

assemble data on whether bank directors and officials face criminal prosecution for failure to

disclose information accurately, whether banks must disclose consolidated accounts, whether

international accounting firms audit banks, whether there is implicit or explicit deposit insurance,

etc.
                                                                                                      5
       Econometrically, we use ordered probit and probit procedures because of the discrete nature

of the dependent variable. The dependent variable is the measure of the degree to which corruption

of bank officials is an obstacle to firms raising external finance. The main explanatory variables are

measures of (1) supervisory power and (2) the degree to which regulations require information

disclosure by banks and give private creditors incentives to monitor banks. We also control for a

range of firm-specific and country-specific characteristics. We also use instrumental variables to

control for potential endogeneity.

       The results are inconsistent with the traditional supervisory power view and provide

qualified support for the political/regulatory capture view. Specifically, we never find that

supervisory power lowers corruption in bank lending. Indeed, even in countries with highly

developed institutions (e.g., effective governments and adherence to the rule of law), we do not find

that supervisory power improves the integrity of bank lending. Thus, while the BIS, the IMF, and

the World Bank are pushing countries to strengthen direct official oversight of banks, the evidence

does not support this recommendation. Rather, supervisory power is positively associated with

corruption in bank lending. We also find that supervisory power is strongly linked to poor legal

system development, low levels of government effectiveness, and high levels of national corruption.

Thus, the positive relationship between supervisory power and corruption in bank lending becomes

insignificant when we control for these other country characteristics.

       The paper also presents evidence that supports the private empowerment view. The data are

consistent with the view that policies that force accurate information disclosure and provide

incentives to private investors to monitor banks lower the importance of bank corruption in raising

external finance. In extensions, we test whether empowering private monitoring only works in

particular institutional settings. We find that supervisory practices that force the disclosure of
                                                                                                      6
accurate, transparent information on banks work best to promote integrity in lending in countries

that adhere to the rule of law. Thus, empowering private monitoring of banks has the largest,

positive effect in countries with well functioning legal systems.

       This paper is related to recent research. BCL conduct a pure cross-country analysis and find

that financial development is (1) positively associated with supervisory approaches that force

information disclosure and (2) negatively associated with powerful supervisors that directly monitor

and discipline banks. In this paper, we use microeconomic data to examine the channels running

from bank supervision to corporate finance, rather than examining cross-country connections

between bank supervision and banking system size. In a cross-country analysis, La Porta, et al.

(2005) find that securities market regulations that induce information disclosure promote stock

market development, while securities regulations that rely on official oversight of markets only

boost equity market capitalization in countries with efficient government bureaucracies. In this

paper, we focus on bank supervision and use firm-level data in assessing the impact of different

bank supervisory practices on firms’ financing obstacles.

       A number of methodological concerns need to be noted. First, individual firms subjectively

report financing obstacles. Thus firms facing the same obstacles in two different countries may

report different obstacles for reasons that do not depend on actual constraints. Although it is not

clear that this would bias the results in any particular direction, we provide evidence on the validity

of the survey information below. Second, the supervisory variables might proxy for other country

specific factors. Importantly, however, we get the same results when including the official

supervisory power and private monitoring variables simultaneously. Thus, supervisory power and

private monitoring are not proxying for the same unspecified factor. Also, the results hold even

when controlling for many country-specific factors, such as the level of economic development,
                                                                                                     7
economic growth, macroeconomic stability, overall financial development, differences in political

systems, state-ownership of banks, regulatory restrictions on bank activities, the laws governing the

rights of creditors and shareholders, and the overall level of corruption in the economy. Third,

banking crises may both intensify financing obstacles and boost official supervisory power,

producing a spurious relationship between supervisory practices and firm financing obstacles. When

we control for crisis, however, the results do not change.

       Finally, some may view the paper as an atheoretical exploration of the relationship between

bank supervisory practices and the integrity of bank lending. It is true that we do not estimate a

single model that explicitly links bank supervisory practices to bank behavior, and then to the

corporate financing decisions of firms. We do, however, evaluate broad theories of government

regulation along with influential approaches to bank supervision. Also, given the central importance

of bank supervisory policies and bank financing around the world, this paper provides initial

documentation of the relationships between bank supervision policies and corporate financing

constraints that we hope motivate additional theoretical and empirical work.

       The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the data and the

methodology is described in Section 3. Section 4 gives the results and Section 5 concludes.



2. Data, Summary Statistics, and Links to Theory

       a. Corruption as an obstacle to firms obtaining external finance: Definitions

       To examine the relationship between bank supervisory strategies and corporate financing

obstacles, we use data from two main sources: the World Business Environment Survey (WBES)

for firm-level data and BCL (2004) for country-level data on bank supervision.
                                                                                                                       8
         From the WBES, we use information on over 2,500 firms across 37 non-transition

economies. While the WBES comprises 80 countries and the BCL database includes data on 107

countries, the limited overlap reduces our sample. The WBES surveyed firms of all sizes; small

firms (between 5 and 50 employees) represent 40% of the sample, medium-sized (between 51 and

500 employees) firms are 40% of the sample, and the remaining 20% are large firms (more than 500

employees). The survey comprises mostly firms of the manufacturing, construction and services

sectors. We also have information on whether these are government-owned, foreign-owned, or

privately-owned firms. The data indicate whether the firm is an exporter and provide information on

sales, growth, financing patterns, and the number of competitors.

         Bank Corruption equals the response to the question: “Is the corruption of bank officials an

obstacle for the operation and growth of your business?” Answers vary between 1 (no obstacle), 2

(a minor obstacle), 3 (a moderate obstacle), or 4 (a major obstacle)?” Thus, bigger numbers imply

the corruption of bank officials is a bigger obstacle to obtaining financing. Overall, 7.7% of the

firms in our sample report bank corruption as a major obstacle, 7.8% rate bank corruption as a

moderate obstacle, 19.5% respond that corruption is a minor obstacle, while 65% report that the

corruption of bank officials is not an obstacle to firm growth. Given this distribution of responses,

we sometimes divided the responses into those with a value of one (65% of the responses) and all

others. This allows us to use a comparatively balanced distribution of responses, reduce the possible

influence of outliers, and use instrumental variable procedures that are available for probit analyses

but not ordered probit regressions. The perceived degree to which the corruption of bank officials is

an obstacle to efficient corporate finance not only varies across firms within countries, but also

across countries.2 For instance, the average firm in Thailand reports that the corruption of bank

 The overall standard deviation of the bank corruption variable is 0.93, while the between country standard deviation is
0.49, and the within country standard deviation is 0.82.
                                                                                                         9
officials is a substantial obstacle to obtaining external finance (3.14), while the average firm in

Canada or the United Kingdom reports a very high degree of integrity in bank lending (1.03).

       b. Obstacles to firms obtaining external finance: Justification

       We use a unique database to investigate the impact of bank supervision on the integrity of

bank lending. The WBES survey provides information on the degree to which corruption in lending

represents an obstacle to firms. Thus, unlike other general measures of firm financing obstacles

(Fazzari, Hubbard, and Petersen, 1988; and Demirguc-Kunt and Maksimovic, 1998), the WBES

survey provides direct information from firms about specific perceived obstacles and therefore does

not infer the existence of general financing constraints from other information. Furthermore, the

WBES database has excellent coverage of small and medium size firms (as well as large firms),

while other cross-country studies of corporate finance focus almost exclusively on large, listed

corporations. Moreover, the WBES has very broad country coverage that is important for linking

the firm-level data with the bank supervision data. Finally, we stress that these survey data are

conducted at the firm-level. While we examine the relationship between firm-level responses and

national supervisory policies, it is inappropriate to aggregate the firm-level survey responses and

conduct pure cross-country comparisons because the composition of firms differs markedly across

countries. To draw appropriate inferences about the relationship between bank supervisory

practices and corruption in lending from this database, one needs to control for firm-specific traits.

       As noted in the Introduction, there are good reasons for believing that these self-reported

data are not biasing the results in favor of this paper’s findings. First, if a firm facing the same

obstacles will respond to questions differently in different institutional and cultural environments,

then, to the extent that this represents pure measurement error, it would bias the results against

finding a significant relationship between bank supervision and firm financing obstacles. Second,
                                                                                                                         10
we obtain the same results when controlling for many country-specific traits. Third, additional work

suggests that the survey data are closely associated with other measurable outcomes. Hellman et al.

(2000) show that in a sub-sample of 20 countries there is a close connection between responses and

measurable outcomes, and they find no systematic bias in the survey responses. Also, reported firm

financing obstacles are highly, negatively correlated with firm growth (Beck, Demirguc-Kunt, and

Maksimovic, 2005). Furthermore, we examined the connection between reported firm financing

obstacles and Wurgler’s (2000) measure of the efficiency of investment flows.3 We find the

reported financing obstacles are negatively and significantly correlated with this efficiency of

investment indicator. Finally, we studied the link between survey responses regarding firm

financing obstacles and industrial expansion. Based on Rajan and Zingales (1998), we examine

whether industries that are naturally heavy users of external finance grow faster in economies where

firms face lower reported financing obstacles. We find that externally dependent industries grow

faster in countries where firms report the corruption of bank officials is less of an obstacle to firm

growth. Thus, firms’ responses to the survey on financing obstacles are capturing more than

idiosyncratic differences in how firms rank obstacles; the survey data are associated with

measurable outcomes.

         As an additional robustness check on the usefulness of firm responses to the question

regarding the degree to which corruption of bank officials is an obstacle, we re-do all of the

analyses controlling for each firm’s response to the following question: “How problematic is

financing for the operation and growth or your business?” If a particular firm is particularly

pessimistic or is simply blaming other factors on its performance, this should be reflected in both its

response to this general financing obstacle question as well as is its response to the more specific

 This is an investment elasticity that gauges the extent to which a country increases investment in growing industries
and decreases investment in declining ones.
                                                                                                                   11
question on the corruption of bank officials. By incorporating this additional variable in the

regressions, we lower the likelihood that idiosyncratic firm responses are biasing the results. Thus,

if we obtain the same results even when controlling for each firm’s response to this general

financing obstacle question, this strengthens the interpretation of an independent relationship

between the bank supervision indicators and the degree to which the corruption of bank officials is

an obstacle to firms obtaining external finance.

        c. Firm-specific traits

        In our analysis of bank supervision and corporate finance, we control for several firm

attributes such as ownership. Government takes on the value one if the government owns any

percentage of the firm, and Foreign takes on the value one if foreign entities own any fraction of

the firm.4 Our sample includes 6% government owned firms and 25% foreign firms.

        We also control for each firm’s business, competitive environment, and size. The

regressions include dummy variables for whether the firm is an exporting firm (Exporter), whether

it is a manufacturing firm (Manufacturing) or a service sector firm (Services). The analyses also

include the log of the number of competitors that each firm faces (Number of Competitors). In

sum, 39% of the firms in our sample are in manufacturing and 46% in service, and on average they

face 2.1 competitors. Finally, we include the log of sales in USD as indicator of size (Sales).

        The correlation analysis in Table I Panel B indicates that non-exporting firms, domestically

owned firms, smaller firms (as measured by sales), and firms with more competitors suffer more

from bank corruption.



4
  While these simple zero-one indicators of ownership may not capture the varying degrees of influence that arise from
different levels of government or foreign ownership, information on the percentage of ownership is available for less
than 10 percent of the sample. However, among the firms for which we have data on the percentage of foreign and
government ownership, more than two thirds of firms with foreign ownership are majority foreign owned and more than
60% of firms with government ownership are majority state-owned.
                                                                                                                   12
        d. Bank supervisory policies

        We use two indicators of supervisory practices to test the empirical validity of the

competing hypotheses outlined in the Introduction. These indicators and other key country

characteristics are listed in Appendix Table I.

        Supervisory Power is constructed from 14 dummy variables that indicate whether bank

supervisors can take specific actions against bank management, bank owners, and bank auditors

both in normal times and times of distress. This includes information on whether the supervisory

agency can force a bank to change its internal organizational structure, suspend dividends, stop

bonuses, halt management fees, force banks to constitute provisions against actual or potential

losses as determined by the supervisory agency, supersede the legal rights of shareholders, remove

and replace managers and directors, obtain information from external auditors, and take legal action

against auditors for negligence.5 Supervisory agencies can use these powers to improve the

governance of banks as emphasized by the supervisory power view. The supervisory authority can

also use these powers to induce banks to funnel credit to favored ends as emphasized by the

political/regulatory capture view. The exact definition of Supervisory Power is provided in the data

appendix. We use the first principal component indicator of these variables, which varies between –

3.05 (Singapore) and 1.14 (U.S.) with a mean of –0.11, and higher values indicating wider authority

for bank supervisors.6

        The Supervisory Power variable relates to the theoretical debate discussed in the

Introduction. The supervisory power view predicts that strengthening official oversight of banks

  Note, we obtain the same results when using a proxy for supervisory power that only includes information on the
power of the supervisory agency over the bank and excludes the power of the supervisory agency over external auditors.
We prefer the broader measure because the supervisory power view holds that only a supervisory agency that has both
the information and the power can improve the corporate governance of banks.

  The mean is not exactly equal to zero because we use the raw data from Barth et al. (2004) on the supervisory
indicators. These data are available for more countries than the corresponding data on firm obstacles.

(increasing Supervisory Power) will improve the governance of banks and increase the likelihood

that bank allocate capital based on sound risk-return tradeoffs, so that Supervisory Power will be

negatively associated with Bank Corruption.7 In direct contrast, the political/regulatory capture

view predicts that Supervisory Power will be positively associated with Bank Corruption. In

particular, the political/regulatory capture view holds that increases in the power of the official

supervisory agency to discipline and replace bank directors and managers gives the agency grater

influence over the allocation of bank credit. If official supervisors have the incentives and ability to

use this power to promote private interests rather than the public good, then credit allocation will

potentially reflect political ties, bribes and more subtle emoluments such as family connections and

future employment opportunities. In this environment, firms will perceive that credit is not simply

allocated based on risk-return criteria and will therefore be more likely to respond that corruption in

bank lending hurts the operation and growth of their businesses. Below, we also discuss and test

more subtle versions of the political/regulatory capture view which stress that in countries with

sound legal and political institutions, supervisory power will not be abused. From this perspective,

the impact of supervisory power on the integrity of bank lending depends on institutional

development.

        Private Monitoring is designed to measure the degree to which bank supervision forces

banks to disclose accurate information to the public and induces private sector monitoring of banks.

Private Monitoring is constructed from nine dummy variables that measure whether bank directors

and officials are legally liable for the accuracy of information disclosed to the public, whether banks

must publish consolidated accounts, whether banks must be rated and audited, whether banks must

 See Polinsky and Shavell’s (2000) review of the theory of public enforcement and the discussion in Coase (1988).
Also, Spiller and Ferejohn (1992) note that lawmakers do not have sufficient information to anticipate all possible
circumstances. Thus, there may be efficiency gains to delegating power to a supervisory agency that has the expertise
and resources to set and change the specific rules as events evolve.
                                                                                                       14
be audited by certified international auditors, whether subordinated debt is allowable (which may

create a class of private monitors), and whether there is both no explicit deposit insurance and no

actual insurance was paid the last time a bank failed (as a measure of the existence of an implicit

deposit insurance regime). The Private Monitoring Index is constructed as a principal component

indicator, with higher values indicating more tools and incentives for private bank creditors to

monitor banks, ranging from –1.56 (Ghana) to 1.46 (United Kingdom).

       In terms of theory, the private empowerment view holds that supervisory policies that force

accurate information disclosure and give private creditors appropriate incentives can ameliorate

market failures without increasing the likelihood of political/regulatory capture. According to this

view, forcing banks to provide transparent comparable information to the public enhances private

sector oversight of banks and reduces the degree to which bank allocate credit on non-market terms.

Thus, the private empowerment view holds that Private Monitoring will be negatively associated

with Bank Corruption. As we develop further below, this private empowerment view presumes that

the private agents have a sufficiently well-functioning legal system at their disposal so that they can

exert effective corporate governance over banks when supervisory practices force the disclosure of

accurate information. Thus, more sophisticated versions of the private monitoring view predict that

enhancing information transparency will only improve the integrity of bank lending in countries

with sufficiently well-functioning legal systems. We test this below.
                                                                                                       15
       e. Country-level control variables

        To assess the robustness of the relation between bank supervision and firms’ access to

external financing, we include other country-level variables. We include the growth rate of GDP per

capita (Growth) since firms in faster growing countries may face lower obstacles. We use the

inflation rate (Inflation) to proxy for monetary instability, conjecturing that firms in more stable

environments face fewer obstacles (Boyd, Levine, and Smith, 2001).

       We also include the level of overall banking sector development (Priv), which equals credit

by banks to the private sector as a share of GDP, since we want to assess the impact of supervision

on corporate finance independent of overall bank development. Bank development is positively

associated with economic growth (King and Levine, 1993; Levine and Zervos, 1998; Levine,

Loayza, and Beck, 2000). Demirguc-Kunt and Maksimovic (1998) argue that financial development

influences growth by easing the external financing constraints faced by firms. Thus, we examine the

independent impact of bank supervision on the financing obstacles faced by firms after controlling

for overall financial development and conditions in the macroeconomic economy. As shown in

Table I, Panel C, firms in poorer countries with higher inflation, lower bank development, and less

information disclosure report higher financing obstacles (Table II Panel C).

       In our sensitivity analyses, we include a variety of country controls. Specifically, we control

for (i) GDP per capita, which measures the overall level of economic development, (ii) State

Ownership, which equals the share of a country’s bank assets that are held by banks that are more

than 50 percent government owned; (iii) Banking Crisis, which equals one if the country has

experienced a systemic banking crisis during the 1990s and zero otherwise; (iv) Shareholder Rights,

which is a measure of the legal rights of minority shareholders vis-à-vis management and large

shareholders; (v) Corruption, which is a measure of the absence of corruption of government
                                                                                                        16
officials, so that larger values signify less corruption, (vi) Rule of Law, which measures legal

system efficiency, and (vii) Government Effectiveness, which is a measure of bureaucratic quality.

The Appendix defines these variables and we discuss them further when we present the sensitivity

analyses.



3. The Empirical Model

       To examine bank supervision and corporate finance, we assume that the enterprise’s

underlying response can be described by the following equation:

Bank Corruptionj,k = α + β1 Governmentj,k + β2 Foreignj,k + β3 Exporterj,k + β4 No. of Competitorsj,k
+ β5 Manufacturingj,k + β6 Servicesj,k + β7 Sizej,k + β8Inflationk + β9 Growthk + β10Privk +β11
Supervisionk + εj,k.                                                          (1)

       The j and k subscripts indicate firm and country respectively. The variable Supervision in

equation (1) represents one – or more – of the various supervision variables discussed earlier. These

supervisory indicators change across the different specifications as we discuss below.

       Unlike the underlying variable, the observed variable Bank Corruption is a polychotomous

dependent variable with a natural order. Specifically, the enterprise classifies the degree to which

bank corruption is an obstacle with k = 1, 2, 3, or 4 if the underlying variable is between αk-1 and

αk+1, with the α-vector being estimated together with the coefficient vector β. We therefore use the

ordered probit model to estimate equation (1). We use standard maximum likelihood estimation

with heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors. Furthermore, we allow for clustering within

countries to allow for possible correlation of errors. Specifically, we do not require that the error

terms are independent across firms within the same country; rather, we require that error terms are

independent across countries. The results hold when we do not allow for clustering and simply run a

standard ordered probit under the assumption of independent observations. The coefficients from
                                                                                                       17
the estimation (with or without clustering), however, cannot be interpreted as marginal effects of a

one-unit increase in the independent variable on the dependent variable, given the non-linear

structure of the model. Rather, the marginal effect is calculated as φ(β’x)β, where φ is the standard

normal density at β’x. We also include the Pseudo R2, a measure of goodness of fit, which is

computed as one minus the ratio of the log likelihood of the full model to the log likelihood of the

“constant-only” model.



4. Results

   A. Findings

       Table II presents regression results where the dependent variable is Bank Corruption. In

every regression we control for the array of firm-specific traits discussed above as well as the

macroeconomic controls: Inflation, Growth, and Priv. To this set of control variables, the first

regression adds Supervisory Power, and the second adds Private Monitoring. The third regression

adds Supervisory Power and Private Monitoring simultaneously.

       The final regression in Table II includes all the firm-specific variables, the macroeconomic

controls, the two supervisory indicators and also includes as an additional control variable, General

Financing Obstacle, which equals each firm’s response to the question: “How problematic is

financing for the operation and growth of your business?” Controlling for this general question

about firm financing obstacles reduces the likelihood that reporting biases or interpretational

differences across firms drive the results on the relationship between bank supervisory approaches

and the degree to which bank corruption impedes efficient corporate finance. While including this

firm-specific response may induce simultaneity bias by adding a regressor that is a priori likely to

be highly correlated and co-determined with the dependent variable, adding this control variable
                                                                                                      18
should clearly bias the results against finding any relationship between bank supervisory policies at

the country level and firms’ responses regarding bank corruption. Thus, we include it as a

robustness test.

         The results in Table II are inconsistent with the supervisory power view. The supervisory

power view emphasizes that information costs, transaction costs, and other government policies

interfere with the ability of private agents to monitor banks. Thus, powerful supervisory agencies

can improve the governance of banks and thereby minimize the degree to which bank corruption

represents an obstacle to firms raising external finance. Contrary to the predictions of the

supervisory power view, however, Supervisory Power never enters negatively in any of the

regressions. This suggests that powerful supervisors, i.e., supervisors that have the power to oversee

and discipline banks do not lower the importance of corruption. Indeed, rather than entering

negatively, Supervisory Power enters positively and significantly in all of the regressions.

         The Table II regression results support the political/regulatory capture view. The

political/regulatory capture view holds that politicians or banks will capture official supervisors and

thus increase the importance of corruption in obtaining bank credit and thereby intensify the

financing obstacles faced by firms. In fact, Supervisory Power enters significantly and positively in

all of the Table II regressions, which confirms the core predictions of the political/regulatory

capture view. These results are robust. Even when controlling for the degree to which policies

emphasize Private Monitoring, Supervisory Power enters positively and significantly. Furthermore,

when we include information on each firm’s view of the degree to which General Financing

Obstacles hinder its growth, the results still yield a significant, positive coefficient on Supervisory

Power.
                                                                                                      19
       The Table II results also support the private empowerment view. The corruption of bank

officials is less of a constraint on the operation and growth of firms in countries where the

supervisory agency forces banks to disclose information to the private sector. This is not an

argument for laissez-faire. Rather, the Private Monitoring variable is a conglomerate indicator of the

degree to which supervisory policies force banks to disclose accurate information to the public and

the degree to which deposit insurance reduces the incentives of private agents to monitor banks.

Thus, the results suggest that supervisory authorities that actively promote accurate information

dissemination and do not distort the incentives of depositors to exert corporate governance over

banks tend to promote the efficient corporate finance. In sum, the Table II results are strongly

supportive of the private empowerment view: corrupt bank officials are less of a barrier to raising

capital in countries where supervisory policies force banks to disclose accurate information and give

private creditors the appropriate incentives.

       The effect of supervisory practices on firms’ financing obstacles is not only statistically

significant, but also economically relevant, and the econometric model fits the data well. We

compute the change in the probability that a firm rates the corruption of bank official as a major

obstacle (i.e., the probability that a firm rates bank corruption as a four) when changing bank

supervisory policies based on the coefficients in the last regression of Table II (column 4). For

example, the estimates imply that if a country moves from the 25th percentile of Supervisory Power

to the 75th percentile, the probability that a firm rates bank corruption as a major obstacle increases

from 6.8% to 9.2%. This 2.4 percentage point increase is quite large given that less than eight

percent of the firms in the sample report that bank corruption is a “major” obstacle. Even more

substantially, the probability that firm reports bank corruption as a major obstacle decreases from

11.1% to 4.9% if a country moves from the 25th percentile of Private Monitoring to the 75th
                                                                                                                    20
percentile. As another example, consider Chile and Canada. The Table II, column 4 regression

estimates indicate that if Chile had the Supervisory Power of Canada (-2.15) instead of its own level

(0.05), there would be a 2.5-percentage point decrease in the probability that Chilean firms rank

bank corruption as a major obstacle. Also, the coefficient estimates on Private Monitoring indicate

that if Chile had the Private Monitoring values of Canada (1.05 instead of 0.29), there would be

almost a three-percentage point drop in the probability that Chilean firms rank bank corruption as a

major obstacle. Taken together if Chile adopted the supervisory power and private monitoring

policies of Canada, there would be a 5.3 percentage point drop in the probability that Chilean firms

report bank corruption as a major constraint on their performance and growth.8 In terms of the fit,

the Pseudo R-squares range between five and nine percent, which is high for these types of cross-

firm empirical studies (e.g., Beck et al., 2005)

    B. Robustness to controlling for other country factors

        Although the Table II results hold when controlling for an array of firm-specific and

country-specific traits, there may exist concerns that the supervisory variables are proxying for

other country-specific factors. Countries with different characteristics may choose different

supervisory practices. At the same time, these different country-specific traits may drive the

integrity of bank lending. Thus, we need to assess whether some third factor is driving both the

selection of the supervisory policies and the financing obstacles reported by firms.

        The robustness checks in Table III indicate that data are (i) inconsistent with the supervisory

power view, (ii) consistent with the political/regulatory capture view, and (iii) supportive of the

private monitoring view. Specifically, when we control for the overall level economic development

by including real per capital GDP (column 1), Supervisory Power enters positively and significantly

8
 Note, we include these examples for illustrative purposes only. These conceptual experiments do not explain how to
convince countries to change supervisory policies, and the reforms to Chilean policies contemplated in the experiments
                                                                                                                       21
at the five percent level while Private Monitoring enters negatively and significantly at the ten

percent level, which reflects the very strong, positive correlation between Private Monitoring and

GDP per capita (a correlation coefficient of 0.69). Moreover, even when controlling for (1) the

percentage of the banking industry owned by the government (State Ownership), (2) a dummy

variable of whether the country recently experienced a systemic banking crisis (Banking Crisis),

(3) the degree to which laws protect shareholder rights (Shareholder Rights), the data continue to

indicate (i) a strong positive relationship between Supervisory Power and Bank Corruption and (ii)

a strong, negative relationship between Private Monitoring and the degree to which corruption of

bank officials hinders firm performance (Table III, columns 2-4).9

         Furthermore, we were concerned that an individual firm’s response to a question about the

degree to which bank corruption hinders that firm’s access to credit would simply reflect beliefs

about the overall level of corruption in the country and not specific information about the integrity

of bank-firm relationships. Thus, in column 5 of Table III, we control for the overall level of

corruption in the economy by using the ICRG indicator of corruption, where higher values indicate

less corruption. While (a) Corruption enters significantly and (b) the very strong correlation

between Corruption and Supervisory Power (correlation coefficient of 0.60) drives out the

significance of Supervisory Power, we continue to find that (1) Supervisory Power does not enter

with a negative coefficient, which contradicts the supervisory power view and (2) Private

Monitoring exerts a negative impact on corruption in lending.

         To control for the general institutional environment, we include indicators of both legal

system and government effectiveness. In particular, Rule of Law measures the quality of contract



are not marginal changes.
9
  We also controlled for (1) a measure of the level of legal protection of creditors from La Porta et al (1998) and (2) a
measure of regulatory impediments on banking operations from the Heritage Foundation. Controlling for these country
traits does not change the results.
                                                                                                                         22
enforcement and the court system. Government Effectiveness is based on survey information on the

competence and efficiency of the bureaucracy and public sector. Again, the data are inconsistent

with the supervisory power view: Supervisory Power does not enter negatively in either regression

6 or 7. As reported in Table I, however, there is a strong negative correlation between Supervisory

Power and both the Rule of Law (-0.45) and Government Effectiveness (-0.47). This drives out the

independent significance of Supervisory Power when these institutional variables are included in

regressions 6 and 7. Nonetheless, while Supervisory Power tends to be higher in countries with low

levels of the Rule of Law and low levels of Government Effectiveness, Supervisory Power does not

have a positive influence on the integrity of bank lending. Thus, Supervisory Power is not

beneficial; rather, it is associated with higher corruption in lending and lower levels of institutional

development. Furthermore, the results support the private monitoring view. Even though Private

Monitoring is highly, positively correlated with the Rule of Law (0.58) and Government

Effectiveness (0.59) (Table I.C), Private Monitoring enters the bank corruption regression

negatively and significantly when controlling for the Rule of Law at the 10 percent level (regression

6) and negatively and significantly at the five percent level when controlling for Government

Effectiveness (regression 7). Thus, even when controlling for firm specific traits, economic growth,

overall financial development, the power of the supervisory agency, and measures of institutional

development, the regression results indicate that Private Monitoring lowers the degree to which firm

report that corruption in lending hinders firm operations and growth.10




10
  We also conducted robustness tests controlling for the overall political environment. Specifically, we included an
indicator of the degree to which citizens can select, monitor, and remove the executive and legislative officials (Voice
and Accountability). We also controlled for (i) the degree of checks and balances in the political system by including
the number of veto players in the political decision process and (ii) competitiveness of legislative elections. This paper’s
conclusions are robust to the inclusion of these political variables.
                                                                                                     23
       C. Nonlinear Effect: Interaction Terms

       Some versions of the political/regulatory capture and private monitoring views suggest a

nonlinear relationship between corruption in lending and supervisory practices. Specifically, the

private monitoring view holds that when supervisory agencies force banks to disclose accurate

information to the public, then private investors can use this information to exert effective

governance over banks with positive implications for the integrity of bank lending. This view,

however, presumes that private investors have a well-functioning legal system at their disposal so

that they can use this information to improve bank operations. Furthermore, this view presumes that

the government is effective at forcing banks to disclose accurate information. That is, the

government not only has statutes requiring banks to disclose accurate information, it successfully

induces banks to disclose this information to the public. From this perspective, improvements in

information disclosure rules will only improve the quality of bank lending when the legal system

and government work effectively. We test this. Furthermore, the political/regulatory capture view

holds that powerful supervisors may use their positions to alter the flow of bank credit for private or

political reasons. International differences in legal and government institutions, however, may alter

the degree to which supervisory agencies abuse their powers. That is, effective institutions may

reduce the ability of supervisory agencies to promote private, rather than public, interests. From this

perspective, increases in supervisory power may only hurt the quality of bank lending when

institutions do not work very effectively. We examine whether the impact of both Supervisory

Power and Private Monitoring on corruption in lending depends on national institutions.

       In Table III (regressions 8 and 9), we include interaction terms to test for possible nonlinear

relationships between supervisory policies, institutional development, and corruption in lending.

More specifically, in regression 8, we include two interaction terms: the interaction between the
                                                                                                        24
Rule of Law and Supervisory Power and Private Monitoring. In regression 9, we include two

different interaction terms: the interaction between Government Effectiveness and Supervisory

Power and Private Monitoring. Since these indicators are principal components indicators, we add

five to Supervisory Power, Private Monitoring, Rule of Law, and Government Effectiveness in

regression 8 and 9 so that none of the observations is zero or negative, which makes it possible to

interpret the coefficient on the interaction term and assess the possible nonlinear impact of the

supervisory indicators on corruption in lending. These regressions include each of the supervisory

indicators, the institutional indicator, and two interaction terms. Since these are all highly correlated

country-specific traits and there are only 37 countries in our panel of firms, it may be difficult to

identify the individual effects. Nevertheless, it is valuable to assess whether supervisory practices

operate differently in different settings.

        We find that (1) Private Monitoring increases the integrity of bank lending in countries with

sufficiently well developed legal and government institutions, but has no significant effect in

countries with poor institutions and (2) Supervisory Power never has a significant, positive effect on

the integrity of bank lending, even in countries with highly developed legal and government

systems. More specifically, consider regression (8) in Table III, which includes the Supervisory

Power, Private Monitoring, the Rule of Law and both the interaction between the Rule of Law and

Supervisory Power and the Rule of Law and Private Monitoring. Note that Private Monitoring

enters with a significant, positive coefficient while the interaction between Rule of Law and Private

Monitoring enters with a significant negative coefficient. While the significant positive coefficient

on Private Monitoring suggests that Private Monitoring increases corruption in lending, this is more

than balanced by the negative coefficient on the interaction term between Private Monitoring and

the Rule of Law. The derivative of regression 8 with respect to Private Monitoring equals 1.38 -
                                                                                                                        25
0.34*(Rule of Law). This is only positive for the three countries with the lowest values of the Rule

of Law (Kenya, Guatemala, and Nigeria) and for these countries we cannot reject the null

hypothesis that the effect of a marginal increase in Private Monitoring has no effect on corruption in

lending. For the next 12 countries with low levels of the Rule of Law, the marginal effect of Private

Monitoring is negative (i.e., it lowers corruption) but again we cannot reject the null hypothesis that

the effect is statistically insignificant. For the 22 countries with the highest levels of the Rule of

Law, we find that a marginal increase in Private Monitoring exerts a significant, negative impact on

corruption in lending. In regression 9, which focuses on Government Effectiveness, we find the

same result and similar cut-offs. Critically, a marginal increase in Private Monitoring never

significantly increases corruption in lending. Rather, Private Monitoring significantly reduces

corruption in lending in the 22 (out of the 37) countries in our sample with the highest levels of

Government Effectiveness and the Rule of Law.

         In terms of Supervisory Power, the results confirm that Supervisory Power does not increase

the integrity of bank lending, even when accounting for cross-country differences in institutional

development. First, note that Supervisory Power and the interaction terms between Supervisory

Power and the Rule of Law never enter significantly. Second, while the individual coefficients are

insignificant, it is still possible to compute whether the joint effect of a marginal increase in

Supervisory Power exerts a significant impact on bank corruption at different levels of the Rule of

Law and Government Effectiveness. When we do this, we never find that an increase in Supervisory

Power exerts a significant negative impact on bank corruption. Thus, the results are clearly

inconsistent with the supervisory power view: The marginal impact of official supervisory power on

corruption in lending is either positive or insignificant.11


11
  In terms of the Rule of Law and Government Effectiveness, note that the direct effect of these two institutional
indicators is positive in regressions 8 and 9, but one must also account for the indirect effects associated with the
                                                                                                                      26
         The results using interaction terms stress three hypotheses. First, there is no evidence that

empowering official supervisors improves the integrity of bank lending. Second, for the bulk of the

sample, promoting the dissemination of transparent information about banks reduces corruption in

lending. Third, the positive impact of Private Monitoring on the integrity of lending depends on

legal institutions and government effectiveness: Private Monitoring exerts a more positive impact

on lending integrity in better functioning institutional settings.



         D. Endogeneity, the distribution of responses, and outliers

         We were concerned that since we do not have a balanced distribution of responses across the

four categories of answers regarding corruption of bank lending, that this might invalidate the

ordered probit estimator or that a few outliers in one of the categories with a small number of

responses could exert an undue influence on the results. As mentioned, 65 percent of firms

responded that corruption in bank lending is not a significant barrier to firm growth, while 35

percent indicated that bank corruption is an obstacle with some indicating it is a minor, moderate, or

major obstacle. Thus, we did two robustness checks. First, we omitted each country one-at-a-time to

see if firm responses from any single country drive the results. The results hold. Second, we

employed a probit estimator, where we simply designate the bank corruption variable as equal to

zero when firms respond that corruption is no obstacle and give the bank corruption variable a one

for all other responses. This produces a comparatively balanced sample of responses for the probit

estimation.




interaction terms. When doing this, two results are important from the parameters estimates in equations 8 and 9: (1) for
no country in the sample does an increase in the Rule of Law or Government Effectiveness imply a significant increase
in corruption in lending and (2) for 11 countries in the sample, an increase in the Rule of Law or Government
Effectiveness implies an significant reduction in corruption in lending after controlling for all of the other control
variables listed in Table III.
                                                                                                             27
        As shown in regressions 1-4 of Table IV, this paper’s results hold when using the probit

estimator. Again, note that in regression 4, we control for individual firm responses to the question,

“How problematic is financing for the operation and growth of your business?” By controlling for

each firm’s views on the degree to which general financial obstacles hinder firm growth, we

identify the specific link between supervisory practices and corruption in bank lending and abstract

from the possibility that particular firms are simply pessimistic about their financing and growth

opportunities. In regression 1-4, Supervisory Power never enters negatively; rather, Supervisory

Power enters with a positive and significant coefficient. These findings are inconsistent with the

supervisory power view and broadly supportive of the predictions from the political/regulatory

capture hypothesis. Moreover, Private Monitoring always enters negatively and significantly, which

indicates that supervisory policies that force the accurate disclosure of information by banks to the

public enhance lending integrity. We also find that the probit model performs relatively well,

correctly predicting at least 65% of all observations.

        Next, we were concerned about possible endogeneity. This is less of a concern than in pure

cross-country analyses because we are examining the impact of policies on individual firms. It

seems unlikely that an individual firm’s views about corruption in lending will influence national

bank regulatory policies. Nonetheless, there may be feedback from the corporate sector to policy or

some third factor may be driving the results. Thus, regressions 5-8 of Table IV present instrumental

variable probit analyses.12 We base the selection of instrumental variables on the theory and

empirical work in Barth, Caprio, and Levine (2004, 2005), who study the determinants of

international differences in bank supervisory and regulatory policies. In particular, we include the

absolute value of a country’s latitude, ethnic fractionalization, and the length of time it has been

  Note, instrumental variable estimators have not been developed, to our knowledge, for the ordered probit
specifications used in earlier tables.
                                                                                                              28
independent. We include latitude because a growing body of work suggests that the geographical

endowments encountered by Europeans as they colonized much of the world shaped the

construction of institutions and policies that endured after countries gained their independence.13 In

particular, Europeans frequently did not settle in large numbers in tropical climates, so they tended

to form extractive regimes where small elites developed institutions and policies that facilitated

their ability to extract natural resources or grow cash crops. These extractive regimes tended to

create powerful administrative structures that protected the elite. In contrast, more temperate

climates with greater numbers of European settlers tended to create more egalitarian policies. We

include ethnic fractionalization because research indicates that more ethnically diverse economies

tend to choose policies that allow those in power to expropriate resources from others (Easterly and

Levine, 1997). Thus, ethnically diverse countries tend to choose policies associated with slower

economic growth. Finally, we include the percentage of years that the country has been independent

since 1776 because countries that gained their independence in the 18th or 19th centuries had more

opportunity to modify colonial institutions and policies and adopt policies more conducive to broad-

based economic growth (Easterly and Levine, 1997). These instruments explain cross-country

differences in Private Monitoring and Supervisory Power, i.e., we reject the null hypothesis at the

five percent level that the instruments do not explain the supervisory policy indicators. We do not

claim that these instruments are the only, or necessarily the best, exogenous explanations of bank

supervisory practices. Rather, we hold that the instruments are reasonably exogenous, past

theoretical and empirical work suggests that these instruments will explain policies today, and the

first-stage results confirm that these are worthwhile instruments.

                                                                                                      29
       The instrumental variable regression results suggest that (1) Supervisory Power exerts a

positive – not a negative – effect on corruption in lending and (2) Private Monitoring lowers the

degree to which firms respond that corruption in bank lending hinders firm operations. As shown in

regressions 5 – 8 of Table IV, Supervisory Power enters positively and significantly at the one

percent level in all of these regressions which control for potential simultaneity bias. Furthermore,

Private Monitoring enters negatively and significantly at the one percent level in all of the

specifications. Thus, even when using instrumental variables and while controlling for firm specific

traits and country characteristics, such as inflation, economic growth, financial development, the

level of economic development, the extent of national corruption, the results are consistent with the

private monitoring view, inconsistent with the supervisory power view, and generally supportive of

the political/regulatory capture view of bank supervision.



       E. Different samples and estimation procedures

       This sub-section presents robustness checks using different sub-samples and estimators.

       First, we test whether the results are robust to only including the sub-sample of firms that

actually receive bank financing. The full sample might contain firms that have not applied for bank

credit, either because they feel discouraged or because they do not need it. The results hold with this

sub-sample (Table V, column 1).

       Second, we also tested whether the results are robust to only including the sub-sample of

firms that do not receive bank financing to see if they have a different perception of the importance

of the corruption of bank officials in raising capital. Again, we obtain very similar results with this

sub-sample. (Table V, column 2).
                                                                                                                     30
         Third, the number of firms varies substantially across countries. Though we use an ordered

probit estimator with robust standard errors and allow for clustering within countries, we assess the

robustness of the results using a weighted ordered probit. The weights are the inverse of the number

of firms.14 The results are robust to this estimation procedure (Table V, column 3).



5. Conclusion

         This paper (1) documents the relationship between bank supervision and the degree to which

bank corruption is an obstacle to firms raising external finance and (2) provides evidence on

different theories of bank supervision. The results support three conclusions about which bank

supervisory practices work best to ease the external financing obstacles faced by firms.

         First, the data are strongly inconsistent with the view that powerful supervisory agencies

with the authority to directly monitor and discipline banks facilitate efficient corporate finance. The

results indicate that countries with stronger supervisory agencies – countries where supervisory

agencies can intervene banks, replace managers, force provisioning, stop dividends, etc. – tend to

have firms that face greater obstacles to obtaining bank loans because of corrupt bank officials than

firms in countries where the supervisory agency is less powerful. The results are inconsistent with

theories that hold that powerful official supervisory agencies promote social welfare by overcoming

information and enforcement costs and efficiently monitoring banks.

         Second, the results provide some support for the political/regulatory capture view, which

emphasizes that powerful supervisory agencies are prone to capture and manipulation by politicians,

regulators, or both. Specifically, we find that powerful supervisory agencies tend to lower the


14
  Note, it is not appropriate to run a pure cross-country regression while averaging across the financing obstacle
variables for each country because (i) the composition of firms varies substantially across countries and (ii) the
polychotomous nature of the financing obstacles data suggest the use of an ordered probit, while controlling for
individual firm traits.
                                                                                                          31
integrity of bank lending. This conclusion needs to be tempered, however. Powerful supervision is

so strongly correlated with poor national institutions (government ineffectiveness, the absence of

the rule of law, high national corruption) that it is difficult to identify an independent relationship

between supervisory power and bank corruption when controlling for these institutional traits.

       Third, the analyses are consistent with the private monitoring view. In particular, bank

supervisory strategies that focus on forcing accurate information disclosure and not distorting the

incentives of private creditors to monitor banks facilitate efficient corporate finance. These findings

are consistent with approaches that simultaneously recognize that private agents face substantive

information and enforcement costs when monitoring banks, while also recognizing that politicians

and regulators will act in their own interests and not necessarily act to reduce market frictions. In

extensions, we find that private monitoring exerts a particularly beneficial effect on the integrity of

bank lending in countries with sound legal and bureaucratic institutions. These results on private

monitoring support the Basel Committee’s recent emphasis on the importance of private sector

monitoring of banks (Basel II’s third pillar).

       At a very general level, these results emphasize the importance of both market and political

failures. Bank supervision clearly matters. Bank supervisory policies that ameliorate market failures

by forcing the accurate disclosure of information reduce the obstacles that firms face in raising

external finance. This is not a laissez faire finding. This result suggests that active bank supervision

can help ease information costs and improve the integrity of bank lending. Just as clearly, however,

the results highlight the importance of theories that emphasize political and regulatory capture and

suggest that powerful supervisory agencies too frequently do not act in the best interests of society.

Summary statistics are presented in Panel A and correlations in Panels B and C, respectively. Bank Corruption is the response to the question “How
problematic is corruption of bank officials for the operation and growth of your business?” General Financing Obstacle is the response to the question
“How problematic is financing for the operation and growth of your business?” Answers vary between 1 (no obstacle), 2 (minor obstacle), 3
(moderate obstacle), and 4 (major obstacle). Government and Foreign are dummy variables that take the value 1 if the firm has government or foreign
ownership and zero if not. Exporter is a dummy variable that indicates if the firm is an exporting firm. Manufacturing and Services are industry
dummies. Sales equals the logarithm of sales in US$. Number of Competitors is the logarithm of the number of competitors the firm has. Growth is
the growth rate of GDP. Inflation is the log difference of the consumer price index. Priv is claims on the private sector by deposit money banks as
share of GDP. Supervisory Power is a principal components indicator of the power of supervisory agency to discipline and monitor banks. Private
Monitoring is a principal components indicator of the degree to which regulations force banks to disclose accurate, transparent information to the
public and whether regulations facilitate and encourage private sector monitoring of banks. GDP per Capita is in PPP adjusted dollars and averaged
over 1995-99. Corruption is a survey indicator of the absence of corruption in a country. Rule of Law and Government Effectiveness are principal
component indicators of survey indicators of the legal system effectiveness and bureaucratic efficiency in a country, respectively. Shareholder Rights
measures the rights of minority shareholders vis-à-vis block holders and management. State Ownership indicates the share of banks owned by the
government. Banking Crisis indicates whether a country suffered a banking crisis during the 1990s. Detailed definitions and the sources are in the
data appendix. *,**,*** indicate significance levels of 10, 5, and 1 percent, respectively.

The underlying model is: Bank Corruption = β1 Government + β2 Foreign + β3 Exporter + β4Manufacturing + β5 Services + β6 Sales +β7 Number
of Competitors +β8 Inflation + β9 Growth + β10 Priv + +β11 Supervision + ε. Bank Corruption is the response to the question “Is the corruption of
bank officials an obstacle for the operation and growth of your business?” General Financing Obstacle is the response to the question “How
problematic is financing for the operation and growth of your business?” Answers vary between 1 (no obstacle), 2 (minor obstacle), 3 (moderate
obstacle), and 4 (major obstacle). Government and Foreign are dummy variables that take the value 1 if the firm has government or foreign
ownership and zero if not. Exporter is a dummy variable that indicates if the firm is an exporting firm. Manufacturing and Services are industry
dummies. Sales is the logarithm of sales in US$. Number of Competitors is the logarithm of the number of competitors the firm has. Growth is
the growth rate of GDP. Inflation is the log difference of the consumer price index. Priv is claims on the private sector by deposit money banks as
share of GDP. Supervisory Power is a principal components indicator of the power of supervisory agency to discipline and monitor banks. Private
Monitoring is a principal components indicator of the degree to which regulations force banks to disclose accurate, transparent information to the
public and whether regulations facilitate and encourage private sector monitoring of banks. The regressions are run with ordered probit. Detailed
variable definitions and sources are given in the appendix. P-values are reported in parentheses. *,**,*** indicate significance levels of 10, 5, and

The underlying model is Bank Corruption = β1 Government + β2 Foreign + β3 Exporter + β4 Manufacturing + β5 Services + β6 Sales +β7 Number of
Competitors +β8 Inflation + β9 Growth + β10 Priv + β11X +β12 Supervision + ε. Bank Corruption is the response to the question “Is the corruption of
bank officials an obstacle for the operation and growth of your business?” Answers vary between 1 (no obstacle), 2 (minor obstacle), 3 (moderate
obstacle), and 4 (major obstacle). Government and Foreign are dummy variables that take the value 1 if the firm has government or foreign ownership
and zero if not. Exporter is a dummy variable that indicates if the firm is an exporting firm. Manufacturing and Services are industry dummies. Sales
is the logarithm of sales in US$. Number of Competitors is the logarithm of the number of competitors the firm has. Growth is the growth rate of
GDP. Inflation is the log difference of the consumer price index. Priv is claims on the private sector by deposit money banks as share of GDP.
Supervisory Power is a principal components indicator of the power of supervisory agency to discipline and monitor banks. Private Monitoring is a
principal components indicator of the degree to which regulations force banks to disclose accurate, transparent information to the public and whether
regulations facilitate and encourage private sector monitoring of banks. X is one of seven variables; GDP per Capita is in PPP adjusted dollars and
averaged over 1995-99. Shareholder Rights measures the rights of minority shareholders vis-à-vis block holders and management. State Ownership
indicates the share of banks owned by the government. Banking Crisis indicates whether a country suffered a banking crisis during the 1990s.
Corruption is a survey indicator of the absence of corruption in a country. Rule of Law and Government Effectiveness are principal component
indicators of survey indicators in the respective category, measuring legal system effectiveness and bureaucratic efficiency, respectively. In columns 8
ands 9 we interact (5+Private Monitoring) and (5+Supervisory Power) with (5+Rule of Law) and (5+Government Effectiveness), respectively. The
regression is run with ordered probit. Detailed variable definitions and sources are given in the appendix. P-values are reported in parentheses.
*,**,*** indicate significance levels of 10, 5, and 1 percent, respectively.

      Supervision and Bank Corruption – Controlling for Sampling and Endogeneity Biases
The underlying model is: Bank Corruption Dummy = β1 Government + β2 Foreign + β3 Exporter + β4 Manufacturing + β5 Services + β6 Sales +β7
Number of Competitors +β8 Inflation + β9 Growth + β10 Priv + β11X +β12 Supervision + ε. Bank Corruption Dummy is the response to the question “Is
the corruption of bank officials an obstacle for the operation and growth of your business?”, where “no obstacle” is equal to zero and “minor”,
“moderate” and “major” is equal to one. Government and Foreign are dummy variables that take the value 1 if the firm has government or foreign
ownership and zero if not. Exporter is a dummy variable that indicates if the firm is an exporting firm. Manufacturing and Services are industry
dummies. Sales is the logarithm of sales in US$. Number of Competitors is the logarithm of the number of competitors the firm has. Growth is the
growth rate of GDP. Inflation is the log difference of the consumer price index. Priv is claims on the private sector by deposit money banks as share of
GDP. Supervisory Power is a principal components indicator of the power of supervisory agency to discipline and monitor banks. Private Monitoring
is a principal components indicator of the degree to which regulations force banks to disclose accurate, transparent information to the public and
whether regulations facilitate and encourage private sector monitoring of banks. GDP per Capita is in PPP adjusted dollars and averaged over 1995-
99. Corruption is a survey indicator of absence of corruption in a country. General Financing Obstacle is the response to the question “How
problematic is financing for the operation and growth of your business?” Detailed variable definitions and sources are given in the appendix.
Regressions in columns (1) – (4) are run with probit with clustered errors, while regressions in columns (5) - (8) are run with IV probit, where the first
stage regressions use ethnic fractionalization, percentage of years in independence since 1776 and a country’s absolute value of latitude as
instrumental variables. P-values are reported in parentheses. *,**,*** indicate significance levels of 10, 5, and 1 percent, respectively. % correctly
defined is the percentage of observations, for which the predicted value is greater (lower) than 65% if Bank corruption dummy is equal to one (zero).

The underlying model is: Bank Corruption = β1 Government + β2 Foreign + β3 Exporter + β4 Manufacturing + β5 Services + β6 Sales +β7 Number of
Competitors +β8 Inflation + β9 Growth + β10 Priv + +β11 Supervision + ε. Bank Corruption is the response to the question “Is the corruption of bank
officials an obstacle for the operation and growth of your business?” Answers vary between 1 (no obstacle), 2 (minor obstacle), 3 (moderate
obstacle), and 4 (major obstacle). Government and Foreign are dummy variables that take the value 1 if the firm has government or foreign ownership
and zero if not. Exporter is a dummy variable that indicates if the firm is an exporting firm. Manufacturing and Services are industry dummies. Sales
is the logarithm of sales in US$. Number of Competitors is the logarithm of the number of competitors the firm has. Growth is the growth rate of
GDP. Inflation is the log difference of the consumer price index. Priv is claims on the private sector by deposit money banks as share of GDP.
Supervisory Power is a principal components indicator of the power of supervisory agency to discipline and monitor banks. Private Monitoring is a
principal components indicator of the degree to which regulations force banks to disclose accurate, transparent information to the public and whether
regulations facilitate and encourage private sector monitoring of banks. The regression in column 1 is for a sample of firms that received bank finance,
while the regression in column 2 is for a sample that excludes firms that received bank finance. The regression in column 3 is weighted with the
inverse of the number of firms in the country. Detailed variable definitions and sources are given in the appendix. P-values are reported in
parentheses. *,**,*** indicate significance levels of 10, 5, and 1 percent, respectively.
