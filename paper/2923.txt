                    THE INTERNATIONALIZATION OF PRODUCTION


                                   ABSTRACT




    The degree of internationalizaton of the enterprise or business Sectors

of many countries, as measured by the ratio of direct investment abroad to

domestic wealth or assets, or of assets or employment abroad to that at home,

has been growing over the last twenty years or more. The exception to this

trend is the United States, in which the extent of internationalization, after

growing until the 1970s, has stagnated or decreased somewhat.

    The level of internationalization of U.S. firms in the 1970s and 1980s was

above that of Germany and especially above those of Japan and Korea. Canada

was close to the U.S. and UK firms were by far the most internationalized.

The differences among the country levels and trends seem to reflect country

size and divergences between the competitiveness of countries and of their

companies, including those that result from exchange—rate movements.

                   IKE INTERNATIONALIZATION OF PRODUCTION



     The steady stream of news about acquisitions, mergers, and joint ventures

across international borders suggests that firms operating in more than one

country are coming to control more and more of the world's trade, production,

investment, and employment. This paper asks whether there is such a trend. Do

the reports represent simply the rapid growth of certain large firms or firms

prom a few countries, or do they represent a widespread shift toward inter-

nationalization in which •1ore and more of the production by firms based in

each country is carried out in other countries?

     There is now a large literature on the factors that cause individual

firms from one country to invest in production in other countries. A necessary

condition for such investment is that the investing, or parent, firm possess

some firm-specific advantages that enable it to operate in foreign countries

where local firms have the advantages of better knowledge of consumer and fac-

tor markets, the favor of local governments, and possibly of consumers as

well. While these firm—specific assets are a necessary condition for direct

investment, they are not a sufficient condition; if trade were free, a company

might exploit ts advantages by exporting to each market. There must be some

rewards that tempt firms to produce outside their home countries.

    The literature on direct investment provides a variety of explanations

for international production. Many answers may be needed because there may be

many motivations, varying with the firm involved, the industry, the home

country, and the host country, and the time at which the decision is made.

    One extreme case is an industry in which trade is impossible. That could

be because of the bulkiness of the product, the difficulty or expense of
                                      —2—



moving it from one place to another, or legal or institutional requirements.
This case is probably most characteristic of service industries and public

utilities. A railroad or retail electric utility must produce in a country to

sell there. Other examples are construction, retailing, hotels, and other con-

sumer services.

     A sore common case is that in which trade can take place, but local pro-

duction is the cheapest, or most efficient, or most profitable way of serving

a market even though it could be served by exporting from the home country.

The advantage of local production might be a reduction in transport or tarff

costs to that market. Automobile assembly in a market, as compared ith the

export of Fully-assembled cars, is an example that involves savings on

transport cost and, in many markets, the evasion of tariffs or other restrc—

tions.

     A third case is that in which a host country is the cheapest location Fo

production to serve the world market, sometimes including the home market.

Primary production, where the abundance and cheapness of natural resources is

the attraction, has historically been the major example. Within manufacturing,

there is the example of semiconductor assembly in Southeast Asia, where the

low cost of labor has been crucial.

     Finally, there is the situation in which a firm can expand its market in

a country by producing there, as opposed to exporting to it from the home

base. One reason might be that for certain types of products, particularly

complex or intricate ones for which after-sales service, consulting, and

advice are important, the implicit assurance of the firm's continued presence

in the market is an important selling point. A commitment to distribution
                                      —   —




facilities   in a country -is probably more convincing in this respect than

selling through agents, and a commitment to complete production in a country

more convincing than distribution facilities. It is said that buyers of

complex machinery often prefer to buy from sellers producing in their

countries for these reasons. A production facility in a country nay also gain

for the firm the advantage of familiarizing local buyers with the firm's name

and reputation, so that production of one product n a host country may

increase the demand there for other products of the same firm, even imported

products.

     While these could all be described as factors pulling firms away from

their home bases, there also may be forces originating at home that push them

to foreign production if they possess firm—specific advantages. For example,

Swedish multinationals in the clothing and textile industries shifted some

production even for the Swedish market to Portugal and other low-wage

countries, especially during the 1960s and early 1970s, as Swedish wages

became too high For hose production in this industry (Swedenborg, 1982, pp.

81, 101, 283-286, 290). There were many reports oF U.S. firms shifting produc-

tion to Foreign locations when the exchange value of the dollar made produc—

tion in the U.S. too expensive and uncompetitive. And recently there have been

reported cases of Japanese firms shifting their production to lower-cost Asian

countries to mitigate the effects of the large rise in the exchange value of

the Yen. Thus, an increase in the extent to which a country's firms produce

abroad could reflect a gain in the competitiveness of the country's firms, but

it could also reflect a loss in the competitiveness of the country itself as a

location for production.
                                    -4-

     Another influence on the extent of internationalization of a country's

enterprises is the oomposition of the country's produotion and shifts in it.

Although data are fragmentary, there is evidenoe that service industries have

typioally been less international in their operation than primary produotion

or manufacturing industriea. That nay be a consequenoe of the higher degree of

national regulation in service industries but may also represent a greater

degree of difficulty in these industries in transferring a company's com-

petitive advantages from one location to another (Lipsey, 1987, p. 54)

Whatever the reason, the result may be that the extent of nternationalizaticn

tends to be reduced by the worldwide growth in the importance of service

industries. An offsetting influence is the increasing degree of direct invest-

ment within the service industries (United Nations, 1988, Chapters XXI-XXII).

The prcportion of most countries' direct investment abroad that is in these

industries has been rising substantially.

     It is not obvious what measure of internationalization would be most

informative. There are data for individual firms in the United States and in

a few other countries on the proportions of their sales and assets in foreign

operations, but they are usually confined to samples of the largest firms and

give no indication of changes in the importance in the economy of the

reporting firms or their shares in overseas activity. They also suffer from

inconsistencies in the extent of consolidation in company reporting end in

accounting for intrafirm transactions. Although these data are not without

interest, we have chosen to concentrate on internationalization measures that

consist of ratios of foreign to domestic activity of a country's firms or a

country as a whole.
                                     —5—

     In the internationalization measures we have chosen, the numerators are

the amounts of direct investment or the size of direct investment operatons

in terms of assets or employment. We prefer the asset or employment measures

because they come closer to reflecting the amount of economic activity con-

ducted abroad by affiliates controlled by parents based in a home country.

Value added or output would be the best measures but are not available.

However, we sometimes can produce measures for assets or employment, and we

use them when we can. Unfortunately, we must often rely, especially for long

time series, on measures of the amount of direct investment or what is called

the 'direct investment position," which is a calculation of the amount of

investment by parent companies in the form of holdings of equity or debt. it

tends to underestimate the level of activity because it omits, for example,

the activity financed by local or other lenders. Furthermore, in the case of

the United States, at least, the trends are very different for the different

internationalization measures, and the direct investment posit-ion is biased

downward relative to the other measures.

     The denominators are, preferably, aggregate measures for each economy of

total corporate or enterprise assets or of employment or national wealth. The

ratios are affected by such characteristics of a country as the share of cor-

porations in total wealth, as compared with households, governments, and non-

corporate enterprise. We would, ideally, like to compare across countries the

extent of internationalization and changes in it for the economy as a whole

and for the enterprise and corporate sectors. That is only possible to a very

limited extent because of the lack of comparable numerators and denominators

among countries. We have focussed, therefore, on changes within countries in
                                          —6—

whatever internationalization measures are available for each one. However,

we do later summarize the very limited comparisons we can make across

countries for recent years.


                Trends in the Internationalization of U.S. Firms

The Beginnings of U.S. Direct Investment Abroad

     The U.S. has been unique among the major investing countries in that the

principal form o' its investment has been, from the earliest times recorded,

direct rather than portfolio investment. That •is, it has typically involved

control of foreign operations rather than simply the lending of capital to

foreign—controlled firms or to governments. The earliest estimates, for 1897,

show over 90 per cent of U.S. investment to have been of this type.

     The earliest examples of U.S. direct investment took place while the U.S.

was still, on net balance, an importer of capital. They illustrate the key

role of the export of technology, or other firm—specific assets, as contrasted

to the pure export of capital, as is the case with portfolio investment.

     U.S. direct investment abroad, in the sense of production abroad by sub-

sidiaries or branches of U.S. companies, began soon after the Civil War and

involved companies '.   . . with   national sales plans and unique products . . .
                                          —7-


(Wilkins 1970, p. 35). Wilkins describes Singer, the manufacturer of sewing

machines, as ".   . . the   first American international business   (p. 37), with

salaried sales representatives abroad in the early 1860s and its first foreign

factory by the late 1860s (p. 42). Other early American production abroad

during the period when the U.S. was still a capital importer was by Hoe

(printing presses), Babcock and Wflcox (boilers), International Bell Telephone

and Western Electric, Edison Electric, Thomson—Houston Electric, a component

of General Electric when it was formed later, Westinghouse Air Brake, Kodak,

McCormick, Worthington Pump, Chicago Pneumatic Tool, Otis Elevator, National

Cash Register, and Libbey—Owens (Southard, 1931; Wilkins, 1970). These com-

panies were typically early technological leaders in their fields. Another

indication of the importance of technology rather than capital is the number

of instances in which the parent's investment consisted entirely or largely of

patent-rights, as in the case of Ford n Canada, Libbey-Owens Glass in various

European countries, and Westinghouse Electric in the U.K. (Lewis, 1938,

pp. 300-301).

     A rough indication of the importance of U.S. direct investment abroad in

these years is that the stock of investment of 1897 was about 3/4 of 1 per

cent of 1900 national wealth, and the investment stocks of 1908 and 1914 were

about 1 per cent and 1 1/2 per cent, respectively, of 1912 national wealth

(U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1975, Series F 422).

     In relation to U.S. national wealth, this foreign investment grew

slightly until 1929, or possibly the early 1930s, to perhaps 1 3/4 per cent,

but fell back to less than 1 1/2 per cent by the end of WorId War     and cThse

to 1 per cent by 1950.

     Since most of direct investment is corporate investment, it may be more

revealing to compare its size to a measure of corporate wealth, such as total

corporate assets, as we can do after the mid-1920s.

Thus, what appeared to be a trend toward increasing internationalization of

U.S. companies up until 1929 or so was reversed by the Great Depression and

World War II, and the late 1940s found U.S. direct investment abroad con-

siderably smaller relative to total U.S. wealth and U.S. corporate assets than

during the 1320s.

     The late 1920s were exceptional in the history of U.S. direct investment

in that nvestment in foreign public utilities, which represented only 4 per

cent of the stock of direct investment in 1924, accounted for over a third of

the increase during the next five years. In fact, almost the whole history of

U.S. direct investment in foreign public utilities is concentrated in the few

years between 1924 and 1929. The increase in the stock of public utility

investment in these years was almost 80 per cent of the 1929 total as compared

with less than 30 per cent for all industries combined )Lipsey, 1987).

     The reasons for this concentrated burst of direct investment in utilities

are worth noting. The two U.S. companies that were the ultisate parents of

most of the utility affiliates were major manufacturers of the capital goods

purchased by the utilities. Neither one operated utilities in the U.S. The

ownership of foreign utilities was, in effect, a way of exploiting the

parents' advantages in technology and marketing in the telephone and electric

power equipment manufacturing 4ndustries.

The Growth of U.S. Direct Investment Abroad After World War II

     Whatever technological leads over firms in other countries that U.S.

firms possessed before World War II must have been greatly enlarged by the

relatively favorable environment the U.S. companies enjoyed during and imme-

diately after the war. It is therefore not surprising that after 1950, the

growth of U.S. direct investment abroad, slowed by the Great Depression and

World War II, resumed its rise and did so at a rapid pace. One measure of the

spread of U.S. firms, the number of new affiliates established, rose rapidly

from low levels immediately after the war to a peak in the late 1960s, and

then slowed down.

     These data are confined to fixed groups of corporations that had become

mutinatonai by the time the sample was selected, and the decine in the rate

oF establishment could have represented nothing more than the exhaustion of

profitable locations for new affiliates by these particular groups of parents.

Furthermore, the data take no account of the size of the newly established

affiliates or of their growth after establishment.

    A measure of the internationalization of U.S. firms as a group is the

ratio of foreign direct investment to domestic corporate assets. The value of

foreign direct investment is measured as the book value of parent investment

in affiliates as reported on the books of affiliates. In Table 1 we compare
                                    — 12 —




the value of direct investment in foreign countries with two estimates of the
total assets of U.S. corporations. One of these is based on U.S. Department of

Commerce calculations of the current value of fixed capital owned by cor-

porations and the Federal Reserve Board's figures for financial assets of cor-

porations, but omitting inventories. The second is a comprehensive asset

measure from book values reported on tax returns. The second measure is pro-

bably inferior as an indicator of corporate wealth but may be more comparable

to the book values reported in the foreign investment surveys.

     The peak importance of direct investment abroad relative to all U.S. cor-

porate assets--a little over 3 per cent--came somewhere between the mid-1960s

and the mid—1970s. However, the year—to—year fluctuations and the weakness of

the estimates for years in between surveys make it difficult to identify a

precise peak. whatever the date of the peak, there had apparently been little

change by 1980. The level of internationalization at that pont appeared to be

close to the peak level. By the time of the 1982 survey, both measures showed

a considerable decrease in internationalization, and that continued through

1985 before reversing in the next two years.

     Foreign investment was always less important in finance than in other

industries, and the ratio for all industries is greatly affected by the inclu-

sion of financial corporations. Overseas investment was a much higher propor-

tion of the assets of nonfinancial corporations than of those of financial

corporations or all corporations, but the time pattern appears to have been

similar. There was a peak at some point between 1966 and 1973, some decline

through the 1970s, a very sharp drop during the first half of the 1980s to the

levels of the 1950s, and then a couple of years in which the ratio increased

again.
     The amount of investment relative to assets is only one of several

possible measures of the international activities of U.S. firms. It is the one

that can be carried back the furthest, but it has several drawbacks. At best

it measures the financial stake in overseas affilitates, but it does not

reflect the level of activity carried on there. U.S. firms could be increasing

the share of production they carry on abroad or the share of their employment

abroad while -educing their investment in foreign affiliates and still

retaining control of them. More serious problems of measurement arise from the

fact that the nvestment in foreign affiliates is measured in book values

rather than current values and that these are subject to the vagaries of

currency translation. The tangible assets of all U.S. firms, in the denomina-

tor of the ratio, are estimated current values. The high inflation rates of

the late 1970s and early 1980s must have raised the totals for U.S. firms'

assets relative to the values on the books of affiliates. The rise in the

value of the dollar from 1980 through 1984 must have had a similar effect. The

rapidity of the decline in direct investment relative to corporate assets in

the 1980s suggests the influence of the rise in the exchange value of the

dollar.

     A financial measure that comes closer to representing the size of

U.S.-controlled overseas operations, rather than only the extent of U.S.

investment in them, is the ratio of overseas assets to the domestic assets of

corporations. It is available only for the survey years and confirms the

results from the longer direct investment series that there was a peak, among

survey years, in 1977, and a decline from that date to 1982.

However, there is a major difference in the pattern shown by this measure. The

degree of internationalization as represented here did not recede to anytHng

close to the level f   the   950s. For industries other than finance, the ratio

in 1986 was more than twice that of 1950 and above those of 1983 and 1984.

For all industries, the data are less complete, but the 1982 ratio of direct-

investment assets to total corporate assets was still, in 1982, more than

three times the 1957 ratio. The difference between the movement of the direct

investment/corporate assets ratio and the direct investment assets/corporate

assets ratio points to the fact that U.S. corporations were controlling

foreign assets overseas with much lower levels of investment per dollar of

assets in the 1980s than in the 1950s.

The decline was largest for the all-industry total because the ratio of direct

investment to assets is so low for the increasingly important finance sector,

particularly banks. However, the phenomenon was present in the non-financial

sector also, where the direct investment position fell from over 60 per cent

to about   30 per cent of affiliate assets.

   A measure free of the effects of inflation and exchange rate fluctuations

is provided by data on employment.

Relative to private non—agricultural employment in the U.S. , employment in

U.S. affiliates grew by more than half between 1957 and 1977, and the same was

true for nonfinancial affiliate employment relative to employment outsde of

finance in the U.S. For majority-owned affiliates (the only ones for which

figures are available for 1966), there was a relative increase between 1966

and 1977. Between 1977 and 1986, all measures of overseas employment declined

relative to U.S. employment. The decline was a major one, almost 30 per cent

for all non—bank and non—financial affiliates and more than 15 per cent even

between 1982 and 1986.

       The sector that has received most attention in the United States, manu-

facturing: underwent a much greater increase in the extent of inter-

nationalization in the 20 years ending in 1977 than did the rest of U.S.

industry. Overseas employment reached a quarter of domestic employment, as
                                        — 17 —




compared with a little over 10 per cent for      all    industries. The relative

decline was then much smaller in manufacturing, as can be seen below——a little

over 10 per cent after 1977 and 7 to 9 per cent after 1982.

     The great increase in the degree of internationalization between 1957 and

1977 reflected the rise in the internationalization of the nianufacturing sec-

tor, offset in part by the shift of U.S. employment away from this relatively

internationalized sector. After 1977, the decline in internationalization in

manufacturing was reinforced by a continued decline in the importance of manu-

facturing employment within the U.S.

     Employment is not an ideal measure for comparing domestic and overseas

labor input. For one thing, there was a shift toward female and part—time

employment in the U.S. that may not have been matched overseas. If that was

the case, the employment comparison overstates the relative fall in overseas

labor input in direct investment operations as compared with the domestic U.S.
                                    — 18 -




economy. Aside from the measurement problem, it is hard to know whether the

relative drop in affiliate employment from 1977 to 1982 reflects mainly the

effect of the 1982 recession or is part of a declining trend. The persistence

of the decline through 1986 casts some doubt on the cyclical explanation.

     One respect in which the degree of internationalization of U.S. manufac-

turing firms has continued to rise is that exports from overseas affiliates

have increased relative to exports from the United States by the affiliates

parents and by the U.S. as a whole (Lipsey, Blomström and Kravis, 1989). This

measure also has defects as an indicator of internationalization. It has the

advantage that numerator and denominator are in current values, but it also

reflects the changing degree of export orientation of affiliates, parents, and

U.S. firms in   general.
     The level of employment in manufacturing affiliates, after declining

relative to parent employment from 1977 to 1982 and 1983, rose in 1984,

stayed unchanged in 1985, but fell again in 1986. Thus, there are some signs

in the employment data that manufacturing firms have retreated somewhat from

foreign operations.

     While each of these measures of the internationalization of U.S. firms

has serious defects, they are unanimous in indicating that U.S. companies

expanded substantially into international production after 1950, to the point

where employment overseas reached above 10 per cent of employment in the U.S.

(in 1977) and assets of overseas affiliates reached over 15 per cent of cor-

porate assets (in 1977 and 1982) and 20 per cent of assets outside of finance

(in 1977). Since the peak levels were reached, there has been a retreat, in

the sense that overseas employment and investment have declined relative to
                                      - 19   -




total   employment and total corporate assets. How much pulling back there has

been from foreign operations remains uncertain. The drastic decline back to

19505 levels implied by the ratios of investment position to domestic assets

clearly exaggerates the extent of any withdrawal from production and

employment overseas, because U.S. multinationals were, by the end of the

period, carrying such more employment abroad and much higher assets per dollar

of investment position than during the 1950s. It is fair to conclude that

whatever force propelled U.S. firms into foreign production during those years

seems to be much weakened.

Germany

     For no other country do i'e have the same degree of information about

direct foreign investment as for the U.S. Most countries rely for theirS data

on cumulations over time of investment flows or permissions to invest or on

voluntary or other incomplete surveys, often inconsistent in coverage and

methods to a much greater degree than the U.S. surveys. Despite these defi-

ciencies of the data, we can usually extract some indication from them of the

direction and extent of internationalization.

     The longest German series is for the stock of direct investment relative

to total assets of enterprises (Table 2). It is subject to the severe

limitations of investment stock measures mentioned above. From 1965 through

1984, it shows a quintupling of the importance of direct investment abroad, an

increase that is uninterrupted in the years for which we have data, before

slight declines in 1985 and 1986. For the period after 1976, through 1985 or

1986, we have confirmation of this rise in internationalization from two

measures we consider more reliable than the stock of direct investment, the
                                    - 20   -




aggregate assets of foreign affiliates of German firms, which we compare with
the total assets of German enterprises, and employment, which we compare with

domestic employment in Germany. The asset data show a doubling and the

employment data a rise of about 50 per cent in the degree of internationali-

zation of German firms. The asset data show no year-to—year declines until

1985 and 1986, but the employment data show a decline relative to domestic

employment from 1981 to 1983 and then an increase but with only the last of

the ratios, for 1985 and 1986, exceeding that of 1981. Thus, there is some

indication here of at 1east a slowing in the rate of increase of

internationalization, but only small signs of a reversal such as took place in

the United States. The contrast between the monetary and non-monetary measures

during the 1980s may partly reflect the effects of the fail in the exchange

value of the Deutsche Mark relative to the U.S. dollar, which would tend to

raise the apparent degree of internationalization in terms of assets but not

in terms of employment. The overall picture for Germany is of a rise in the

degree of internationalization of firms that has not so far come to an end.

     As far as we can tell from the period after 1976, the use of the direct

investment position rather than total assets of affiliates does not seriously

bias the German internationalization measure as it does that for the U.S.

There was some decline in the ratio of the direct investment position to total

assets of affiliates between 1976 and 1985 but it was a much smaller one than

for U.S. affiliates, as can be seen below.

In other words, German parents do not seem to have moved extensively toward

expanding the financing of affiliates from non-parent sources.

The United Kingdom

    There has been a trend toward increasing internationalization of non-

financial British companies, if we can believe the only measure available for

the U.K., the ratio of direct investment to the total assets of some

constantly changing universe of domestic firms (Table 3). The universe con-

sists first of panels of listed companies, fixed in composition for five years

at a time. Later it is the much larger universe of what are referred to as

"large corporations" (see Appendix Table UK-4). The degree of inter-

nationalization changed little, if at all, in the early 1960s, after rising

during the late 1950s, but then picked up speed, increasing by about 75 per

cent from 1977 to 1984. Thus, the extent of internationalization grew rapidly

in the 1980s, just when the growth of internationalization appears to have

stopped in the U.S. Furthermore, there were very few cases, within the
                                    - 22   —




fragments of comparable data, in which the upward trend in U.K. inter-
nationalization was reversed for more than a year.

     The contrast between the trend in the U.K. and that in the U.S. in the

early 1980s must be at least partly produced by exchange rate changes. The

rise in the exchange value of the dollar after 1980 reduced the value of the

U.S. investment in Great Britain and increased the value of British investoent

in the U.S. Both countries were major hosts to each others' firms.

     This is another case, then, of a clear upward trend in inter-

nationalization. tn contrast to the German case, this one took place in a

country that was losing ground in international trade. Thus, it may be an

example of internationalization driven more by unfavorable conditions for pro-

duction in the home market than by the exceptional competitiveness of the

country's multinational firms.



     Particular interest attaches to the progress of internationalization oF

Japanese firms because they have been so successful in international markets

exporting from their home base. They have had, therefore, until recently,

less incentive to move production abroad than firms that were struggling

against the lack of competitiveness of their home countries. Unfortunately,

the data on the overseas operations of Japanese firms are sketchy, depending

heavily on either the cumulation of approvals for foreign investment or on

surveys that are seriously incomplete in coverage and inconsistently

incomplete over time. We suspect that the data on approvals suffer from worse

disadvantages than those from the surveys, and for that reason we have not

used them here, although they are often quoted. One problem is that there is
                                       — 23   —




no clear connection between amounts approved and amounts actually invested.

The published data on approvals in Bank of Japan (1987) are in U.S. dollars,

and it is not obvious what exchange rates should be used to convert them to

Japanese currency. Furthermore, they take no account of reinvested earnings

of Japanese companies operating abroad. The survey data, which we do use,

apparently cover 51 per cent or less of the universe in terms of numbers of

parent companies and a widely fluctuating, but considerably larger, percent

according to the only quantitative measure we have: the ratio of the book

value of outstanding equity of companies that answered the survey to the value

of equity investment of all companies with approved foreign investment, as

reported by the Ministry of Finance.

     Despite all the defects of the Japanese data, there is little doubt that

there was a move toward increased internationalization during most of the

1970s, particularly tbin the corporate sector (Table 4). All the measures

showed some slowing or even reversal of that trend during the late 1970s.

However, the reversals could easily have been an artifact created by the vola-

tility of exchange rates in the case of the financial data and by fluctuations

in the extent of coverage and our crude adjustments for them in the case of

the employment data. During the 1980s, the trend toward increasing inter-

nationalization was resumed, at least in the share of assets held overseas in

the form of direct investment. The increases in internationalization in the

last few years are less convincing than the earlier ones for two reasons. One

reason is that the ratio of foreign to domestic employment hardly changed bet-

ween 1981 and 1984 and was in any case not much greater than the ratios of

1976 and 1977. The second reason is that while the ratio of direct investment
                                        - 24   —




to   corporate assets and national wealth did rise rapidly from 1980 to 1985,

some part of that increase must have reflected the fall in the exchange value

of the yen relative to the U.S. dollar during those years.

       On the whole, over the whole period, there is a clear tendency toward

internationalization of Japanese corporations. The shift may have slowed for

several years, but it seems likely, and there is much anecdotal evidence in

that direction, that the rise in the exchange value of the Yen in 1986 and

1987 has given the trend new life, even while it has probably decreased the

nominal value of existing Japanese direct investment.

The Netherlands

      Although the Netherlands has been active in direct investment abroad for

a long period, we have been able to make some calculations of inter-

nationalization for only eight years, partly for lack of a good denominator

against which to compare the level of investment. We do have a comparison bet-

ween the direct investment position of the Netherlands and the aggregate

assets of corporations quoted on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, a limited group

with steadily decreasing numbers. For what it is worth, the results agree with

those of most other countries in showing an increase in the ratio:

The increase was not very large, but it was continuous. it is not clear

whether the decline in the number of firms in the denominator produces a bias

in the ratios. If firms were leaving the stock exchange, there would be an

upward bias in the ratios; if they were disappearing by merger with other

stock exchange firms, there would not be such a bias.

Canada

    Canada is known much more as a recipient of direct investment than as a

source, but it too has major investors among its firms. For Canada, as for

most of the countries, we have data for a substantial period only for the

direct investment position. When we compare that with the total assets of

Canadian corporations, we find that the latest ratio is substantially above

the earliest, although there is no clear trend (Table 5). The importance of

drect invesrnent, by this measure, fell from a peak in 1970 to a low point in

1976 and the ncreased about 50 per cent by 1985. It did end up considerably

higher than it was twenty years earlier.

    The pattern of changes does suggest some exchange rate influences. It

showed a substantial decline in the direct investment share from 1969 and 1970

through 1976,   while   the price of the Canadian dollar was rising relatively, at

least until 1974. Then there was a large rise through 1985, while the price of

the U.S. dollar increased by about a third.

Korea

    Korea, the only developing country in our sample, has very little direct

investment abroad, as we might expect (Table 6). However, in the very brief

period for which we have data, the degree of internationalization more than

doubled. The increase was considerably more than could be explained by

exchange rate movements and presumably reflects a trend toward more overseas

production by Korean firms.

     Across the seven countries for which we have found some data, there

seems to have been a fairly general movement toward increasing

internationalization. There are several indicators of this trend. One is the

growth of their foreign direct investment positions relative to the domestic

assets of their corporations. A second is the increase in the proportion of

assets their firms control that is located outside the home countries. And a

third is the rise in the proportion of employment that their firms control

that is outside the home countries.

     The exception to these generalizations is the United States. After a
                                       — 27   —




rapid   growth in the degree of internationalization until   the 1970s, U.S. firms
appear to have drawn back somewhat and reduced their overseas employment and

assets relative to those in the U.S. The extent of any such retreat is

greatly exaggerated by the figures for the direct investment position of the

U.S. but some reduction in foreign relative to domestic activity is indicated

by the more reliable measures.

     What can explain the divergent trends in the U.S. and other countries?

One possibility is that the period of World War II and the reconstruction

afterward had opened up a wide gap between U.S. firms and those in other

countries. U.S. firms came out of that period with an accumulation of the

technological and organizational assets that are the basis for a firms abi-

lity to operate in foreign countries. That gap between U.S. and foreign Firms

ncreased the level of foreign operations and the share of foreign operatiois

in their total activity that were optimum for the U.S. firms. They expanded

rapidly to bring their foreign operations up to this level but, having reached

it, slowed down or halted the expansion.

     The optimum level of the share of foreign operations in the total may

also have changed over time.     If the low technological level of foreign com-

petitors was a reason for the profitability of foreign operations, the reco-

very of foreign firms, even if not fully up to the level, of the U.S. firms,

could at some point have reduced the attraction of foreign production for U.S.

firms. At the same time, it would have raised the optimum level of inter-

nationalization for the foreign firms from the postwar low point, and they

would, in turn, move into production outside their home bases. To examine

such an explanation of changes in internationalization we would need
                                      — 28 —




observations   on levels of internationalization, comparable among countries, as

well as the record of trends.


                      Recent Levels of Internationalization

     Unfortunately, the continuous series we have used to judge trends are

very different in character from country to country. We need some common

measure of country size, even a crude one, against which to compare levels of

internationalization.

     One candidate for a country size measure is national wealth, the sum of

tangible assets and net foreign assets. This is a total without duplicatic'n,

in which financial assets owned internally are netted out against financial

liabilities owed to local creditors, and in which holdings of foreign assets

are netted out against foreign liabilities. Another candidate is national

assets, the sum of all tangible and financial assets, domestic and foreign.

it has the drawback of reflecting the extent of Financial intermediation or

layering in the economy but may be thought of as more comparable to the

numerator, since the direct investment asset total in the numerator is gross

rather than net, in the sense that direct investment liabilities and other

foreign liabilities are not netted out against assets as they are in national

wealth. For both of these measures we have Raymond Goldsmith's calculations

on as comparable a basis as possible, including years close to 1977. Of the

seven countries discussed here, five are in Goldsmith's compilation.

       At this point, close to the peak of the internationalization of U.S.

firms, the shares of direct investment in German and Japanese national wealth

and national assets were only about 60 and 20 per cent respectively of those

in the United States. The Canadian ratios were close to the U.S. levels and

the UK ratios were about twice as high.

The ordering of the countries is almost the same, but all these ratios are

higher relative to those of the U.S. than the ratios of direct investment to

national wealth and national assets in 1977—Ta. The difference reflects at

least partly the increases in internationalization in countries other than the

U.S. There is also a difference in the measure used.

     Of the few countries that collect data on the overseas employment of

their multinationals, the United States has the highest ratio to domestic

employment.

At least this input into production in foreign countries is much more

important relative to home input for the U.S. and Germany than for Japan, and

somewhat more important for the U.S. than for Germany. Since the ratio of

capital to labor input varies widely among industries, we cannot conclude that

production abroad bears the same relation to production at home as the

employment abroad does to employment at home. For two countries, however, we

can supplement that calculation by a rough measure of capital stocks held

overseas relative to domestic fixed assets.

The capital input measure and the labor input measure both show the U.S. to

have internationalized the production it controls to a larger degree than

Germany has. The margcns were 30 per cent for employment and 45 per cent for

capital, both considerably greater than the 19 per cent difference for the

value of direct investment. These comparisons suggest that the direct

investment comparisons can be very inaccurate as measures of the amount of

both labor and capital input in controlled operations overseas, that they tend

to greatly understate the extent of such operations, and that the

understatement is larger for the U.S. than for Germany.

     We are fairly sure from these data that U.S.-owned producton is more

internationalized than that of Germany, and that both of these countries have

moved much further in this direction than Japan. The relatively low levels of

internationalization of German and Japanese production, especially the latter,

may still reflect to some extent the loss of overseas assets by both countries

as a result of World War It.   It may also reflect the fact that both

countries, and especially Japan, have been highly competitive in world

markets, Consequently, there was not until recently a strong force pushing

German and Japanese firms to produce overseas to expand or preserve their

markets. The rise in the value of both countries' currencies relative to the

dollar may provide such a push, but any movement of real production will

initially be obscured by the fact that the value of existing foreign assets,

relative to domestic assets, is reduced by upward currency revaluations.

     Lacking data on capital and labor input, we are uncertain as to whether

the high ratios of direct investment to domestic capital in the U.K. and

Canada represent high degrees of internationalization of their production.
                                       — 32   —




The high ratio for the U.K., if we accept it at face value, suggests that

there must be explanations other than the competitiveness of a country's

firms, since U.K. firms are not usually thought of as being the world's

technological or organizational leaders. The high level and continued growth

of the ratio for the UK suggest the effects of home-country conditions: the

low competitiveness and deterioration of the U.K. as a site for production.

Under these circumstances a UK firm possessing firm—specific advantages that

can be used in production abroad may be much more tempted to go abroad than a

Japanese firm with similar firm-specific advantages. The reason is that the

Japanese firm has a home base that, at least until very recently, was a

favorable location For   production.   Thus the UK case points to the

home-country factors pushing firms out into the world as well as to the

host-country or firm attributes pulling them out.

     A difficulty in interpreting the levels of internationalization is that

we have no definition of the optimum level and no theory to explain it. It is

not clear that even with the same firm and country competitive advantages

two countries' firms would reach equal levels of foreign production.      It could

be that the smaller the country, the higher the degree of internationalization

it would reach, other things equal. A firm with a technological or other

firm—specific asset might have to go abroad at a much smaller size to exploit

it if it is based in a small country than if it is based in a large country,

as illustrated by Swedenborg's comparison of the size at which U.S. and

Swedish firms began producing outside their home countries (Swedenborg, 1979).

     An additional factor in the trends in internationalization that we have

not had time to explore is changes in the industrial composition of output and
                                       — 33   -




employment.   In the U.S. case, the apparent decrease in internationalization

partly reflects the rapid growth of the service industries which, up to now,

have been less international in their operations than manufacturing

industries, although their level of international activity has been

increasing.

     The interpretation of all of the monetary measures is affected by the two

offsetting consequences of exchange rate changes. A rise in the exchange value

of a home currency has a statistical effect on the measured level of

internationalization by reducing the value in home currency of foreign asset

holdings, and a home currency depreciation has the opposite effect. However,

the same rise in exchange value that reduces the measured level of

internationalization, if   it   is a change in real exchange rates, encourages

internationalization by reducing the real cost of foreign assets. The timing

is probably different: the statistical effect is immediate while the economic

effect must take several years since it involves building production

facilities or buying or selling them. Thus, the large rise in the exchange

value of the U.S. dollar from 1980 through early 1985 must have depressed the

nominal measures of u.s.    internationalization   even while it encouraged U.S.

firms to shift production overseas. The latter effect must have come with

considerable delay, however, and figures for the early 1980s were probably

dominated by the statistical effects of dollar appreciation and the real

effects of the low exchange value of the dollar around 1980.


Summary

      Our tentative explanation for the level of and trends in internationali—
                                       - 34   —




zation   in these countries is that country size and changes in both the

competitive advantages of firms and the competitiveness of home countries

played a role. The overseas expansion of U.S. firms in the 1950s and 1960s

reflected mainly their competitiveness, particularly the technological and

organizational gaps that had opened up between U.S. firms and those based in

other countries. The expansion may have been pushed by the growth of markets

outside the United States relative to the U.S. market until the early 1970s,

and also by the increasing overvaluation of the dollar. The combination of

events may have caused the degree of U.S. internationalization to reach a

level that was above the optimum for such a large country.

     Eventually, the rise in the competitiveness of European and Japanese com-

panies relative to their U.S. rivals both decreased the attraction of foreign

production for the U.S. companies and increased it for foreign companies. At

the same time, the movement of the exchange value of the dollar to its low

point around 1980, and again after 1985, encouraged production in the U.S. by

U.S.-based firms (reducing their internationalization levels) and by foreign—

owned firms (increasing their internationalization). The same result was

favored by the improvement in the relative growth rate of the U.S. beginning

in the early 1980s. And in the 1980s, the nominal ratios were affected by the

statistical effects mentioned above.

     The internationalization ratios for Germany and Japan are so much lower

than that of the U.S., despite their smaller market sizes, that one might

expect continued moves toward internationalization by those countries' firms.

The case for an increase is even stronger For some developing countries, to

judge by the only example we have, Korea, which appears to be roughly where
                                    - 35   —




Japan was in this respect in the early 1970s. The relatively high ratio for

Canada probably reflects mainly the small size of its domestic market,

especially by comparison with the U.S., and the extremely high ratio for the

U.K. may be a consequence of the long period of both low growth and low

competitiveness of the domestic economy.
