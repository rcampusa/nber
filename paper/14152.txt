The fundamental feature of private contracting is its relational nature. When faced with unforeseen

renegotiation, having a higher tendency to litigate, and providing weaker incentives. In sum, public
contracts are perceived to be less "efficient." In this paper I develop a theory of public contracting
that accommodates these stark differences between private and public contracting. The thrust of the
paper is that these differences arise directly because of the different hazards present in public and purely
private contracts, which directly impact the nature of the resulting contractual forms. A fundamental
corollary of this result is that the perceived inefficiency of public or governmental contracting is simply
the result of contractual adaptation to different inherent hazards, and as such is not directly remediable.

of concession contracts.

The fundamental feature of private contracting is its relational nature.1 When faced with

unforeseen or unexpected circumstances, private parties, as long as the relation remains

worthwhile, adjust their required performance without the need for costly renegotiation or

formal recontracting (Baker et al 2001).2 Public contracting,3 on the other hand, seems to

be characterized by formalized, standardized, bureaucratic, rigid procedures (Greenstein

1993).4 Faced with unexpected circumstances, parties in a public contract may face, even

when the relation remains worthwhile, the stark choice of litigation or performance. In

fact, common wisdom sees public contracts as generally more inflexible, requiring more

frequent formal renegotiation, having a higher tendency to litigate, and providing weaker

incentives. In sum, public contracts are perceived to be less “efficient.”


The main thrust of this paper is twofold: first, just as in private contracting, the nature of

contracting hazards is what determines the fundamental features of public contracting

(Williamson 1979). A fundamental difference between private and public contracts is

that public contracts are in the public sphere, and thus, although politics is normally not

necessary to understand private contracting,5 it becomes fundamental to understanding

public contracting. Second, the analysis of public contracting must be done within the

  Corporations, however, often move away from relational contracting endorsing highly formalized
contracting procedures, only to reverse course. A case in point is GM’s recent endorsement, jointly with the
US Department of Defense, of highly bureaucratized IT procurement practices, the Capability Maturity
Model Integration. See Bernard et al (2004). See also CIO.com report at
http://www.cio.com/article/156400/New_Guidelines_for_IT_Procurement_May_Prove_Intimidating.

  Hereafter, I refer to public contracting to the case when one of the parties to a transaction is a public
entity, such as a governmental agency or company.

  Although there is a large literature dealing indirectly with what I call public contracting (such as the
literature on privatization of municipal services or bureaucracy), there is in fact no systematic study I know
of comparing public v. private contracts on the dimensions mentioned here.

  There is a large literature on influence in organizations, which started with the work of Milgrom and
Roberts (1988). See, generally, Laffont and Tirole (1993).

proper institutional comparison (Coase 1964) and with a heavy micro-analytic dose

(Williamson 1979). In fact, the supposed inefficiency of public contracting must be

assessed in reference to all relevant alternatives (Williamson 1996).


In this paper I develop a theory of public contracting that accommodates these stark

differences between private and public contracting. The thrust of the paper is that these

differences arise directly because of the different hazards present in public and purely

private contracts, which directly impact the nature of the resulting contractual forms. A

fundamental corollary of this result is that the perceived inefficiency of public or

governmental contracting is simply the result of contractual adaptation to different

inherent hazards, and as such is not directly remediable (Williamson 1999). Finally, I

apply the main insights from the general framework developed here to understand the

characteristics of concession contracts.


1. The Fundamental Benchmark: Private Contracting

I start from the fundamental point that contracts are always incomplete, and that, to a

large extent, the degree of incompleteness is chosen by the parties. In the extreme, and in

the absence of a third party enforcer, contracts, whether explicit or implicit, may be

sustained exclusively via implicit or explicit threats of actions, such as discontinuation of

a relationship,6 executing implicit or explicit guarantees (Williamson 1983), decentralized

enforcement by market participants (Milgrom et al 1990), or expelling the breaching

party from membership in a clan, sect or family.7 In fact, even in the face of third party

enforcement, companies normally rely on inter-firm relationships to support contracting

    A costly action if assets are not easily redeployed to alternative uses. See Telser (1981).

    See, for example, Greif (1993), Landa (1981), and Richman (2006).

                                                       Page 2

(Macaulay 1963), and in particular, on private ordering in a discriminating way

(Williamson 2002). Inter-firm relationships help manage conflicts that would otherwise

be resolved via formal mechanisms (courts), with the corresponding uncertainties, delay

and costs (Williamson 1975). MacNeil’s (1978) three-way categorization of contracts

into classical, neoclassical and relational properly highlights that as relations become

long term and complex, the reference point for adaptations becomes less the original

contract as specified, and more the entire relation as it developed, the “relational web” as

Macneil (1974: 595) puts it. In fact, “adaptation is now taken to be the chief mission of

economic organization,” with cooperative adaptation being achieved via “complex

contractual modes” (Williamson 2002).


Although informal and continuous adaptations may be enough to sustain a private

contract over time, thereby reducing haggling and negotiating costs, they require the

discriminating selection of governance structures, with “more complex modes of

governance [being] reserved for more hazardous transactions” (Williamson 2002).

Relational contracting, then, appears in highly complex transactions, transactions where

parties have sunk highly specific investments (Williamson 1985), and where parties have

highly particular, detailed and tacit knowledge of their specific situations, which they can

use to “adapt to new information as it becomes available” (Baker et al 2002).


This, however, does not mean that formal adaptations and adjustments are not needed. In

fact, large unexpected events may require wholesale re-contracting to provide further




                                               Page 3
                                                Pablo T. Spiller



clarifications on how future adaptations will take place, or even termination of the

relation.8


In sum, discriminating alignment is the foundation of private contract adaptability. The

main risk facing the parties in complex transactions is opportunistic behavior by the

trading party. Contractual governance is precisely designed to limit such behavior so as

to successfully implement the transaction, or as Williamson (2002: 439) puts it, to “infuse

order, thereby to relieve conflict, and realize mutual gain.”


Figure 1 below reproduces Williamson’s famous “simple contractual schema,” whereby

simple transactions (k=0) get implemented via simple contractual methods such as

unassisted market transactions, while complex transactions (k>0) exposing the parties to

transaction hazards require the design of complex governance structures. Figure 1 shows

the existence of multiple governance structures – credible contracting at node (C) and

hierarchy at node (D) – which counter entering into the transaction with unrelieved

hazards (node B).




8
  As Macaulay (1963: 65) represents, the use of courts is often relegated for the purpose of settling contract
termination disputes, rather than contract adaptation.

2. Public Contracting

Public contracting is exposed to a larger set of hazards than purely private contracting,

arising from three fundamental types of opportunistic behavior. As in private

contracting, parties with idiosyncratic investments face the risk of opportunistic behavior

by its partner, whether public or private, and will thus attempt to design the transaction’s

governance so as to limit the risk of opportunistic behavior by its trading partner. I will

call this, the risks associated to standard opportunistic behavior.


Public contracting, on the other hand, generates peculiar types of hazards associated with

the fact that one of the parties to the contract is the state, or a state institution. Here I will

focus on two hazards: governmental opportunism and third party opportunism. In

previous writings, I emphasized governmental opportunism as the fundamental risk of

investors in public utilities,9 and how regulation by contract may limit such risk.

Regulation by contract requires, however, a judiciary that not only will see such a

contract as property and thus that cannot unilaterally be modified by the government, but


9
 By governmental opportunism I refer to the ability of governments to opportunistically change the rules
of the game once the utility sunk its investments. See, Spiller (1996a and 1996b), and Levy and Spiller
(1994).


                                                   Page 5
                                              Pablo T. Spiller



also that will have the ability to enforce it. Facing these risks, then, private utilities may

require that such regulatory contracts be highly specific, so as to limit opportunistic

interpretations of contracts. In this paper I will briefly deal with governmental

opportunism,10 and focus instead on what I believe is the fundamental risk faced by all

public contracts -- third party opportunism.


2.1 Public Contracting and Governmental Opportunism

The risk of governmental opportunism arises because, differing from private actors,

governments can opportunistically change the rules of the game via the standard use of

governmental powers to extract the quasi-rents of its contract partner.11 Changes in the

rules of the game can be done in multiple, subtle and not so subtle ways. Governments

may issue legislation making illegal a particular type of contract, even a contract it may

have originally designed. Such use of governmental powers may seem extreme, but is

not unusual. Consider, for example, Venezuela’s Decree No. 5.200/2007,12 requiring that

PDVSA, the Venezuelan public oil company, take operational control over oil projects in

Venezuela, cancel all exploration, commercialization and production rights of the

private/public association agreements originally set up between PDVSA and private oil

companies (where private investors were the majority shareholders) to explore and

develop those oil fields, and transfer those rights to mixed companies controlled by

PDVSA. This Decree, known as the Nationalization Decree, came after private oil

   For a more detailed treatment of governmental opportunism, see Spiller (1996 and an b).
11
   Spiller (1996a), Levy and Spiller (1994). This does not imply that the private contractor may not
opportunistically withhold information, but such opportunism is of the “standard” nature, discussed at
length by the literature.

companies invested, by all accounts, billions of US dollars in developing these fields.13

One may imagine multiple reasons for Venezuela’s government issuing the

Nationalization Decree, but it may not be wild speculation that the Decree would not

have been issued if crude oil prices would have stayed in the low 10s or 20s, rather than

increased as they did starting in 2002.14


Governmental opportunism, however, does not have to be so drastic as a law or

Executive Decree cancelling or changing the nature of contracts, but can be achieved via

the subtle works of administrative process. Consider, for example, the imposition of

fines on a public utility for alleged quality deficiencies, or a regulatory decision denying

a tariff increase. What may seem as innocuous acts of regulatory supervision, may

actually be nothing else but governmental opportunism, attempting to extract part of the

utility’s quasi-rents. Consider, for example, the case of Compañía de Aguas del

Aconquija, a water and sewage services concession granted by the Province of Tucumán,

Argentina, in 1995 and terminated by the Province just two years later. The process that

led to the contract termination, and described in unusual detail by the Arbitration Panel in

its Award,15 is a textbook, and probably an extreme, example of what I call governmental

opportunism, whereby a government uses its regulatory and executive powers to achieve

a tariff reduction not allowed by the regulatory framework. In fact, the Aguas del

Aconquija Award shows the multiplicity of instruments governments have at their



13
   See, for example, New York Times “2 Oil Firms Are Defiant in Venezuela.” June 27, 2007.
14
   The fact that other governments (such as Argentina, Bolivia and Ecuador) took similar or related actions
following the rapid raise in the price of crude oil may indicate that Venezuela’s Nationalization Decree
may be better characterized as opportunistic rather than ideological.
15
   See, Award – “In the Arbitration between Compañia de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal
S.A. Claimants v. Argentine Republic, Respondent, Case No. ARB/97/3” issued on 20 August 2007.


                                                    Page 7

disposal to attempt to extract a utility’s quasi-rents. In this case, the Provincial

Government seems to have used all its formal powers - regulatory decisions, legislative

acts, executive decrees, attorney general recommendations, even judicial decisions– and

informal powers – press releases, Ombudsman’s letters, public announcements, and the

like-, to force the company’s hand.16


Investors facing the risk of governmental opportunism will either not invest, or demand

up-front compensation for that risk. Either strategy, however, as the case of Aguas del

Aconquija shows, may not alleviate the risk, but rather may exacerbate it.


Government opportunism affects not only private investors but public operators as well.

Since the government has direct control over publicly owned companies, Savedoff and

Spiller (1999) explain how the threat of governmental opportunism against publicly

owned companies may lead those companies to protect their cash flows against such

hazards by undertaking actions, such as hiring too many permanent or transitory

employees, granting excessive benefits, and the like, which translate into low efficiency

and quality levels.


The limits to governmental opportunism are, however, institutional (Spiller 1996a and

1996b). The potential for the opportunistic use of legislative powers depends, to a large

extent, on the control the executive may exercise over the legislature. Thus, a fragmented

polity may provide more assurances to investors than a highly centralized government.

Similarly, a judiciary with a tradition of independence may put some limits on


16
  At the end, the company attempted to rescind the contract due to Governmental breach, at which point
the Province terminated the concession. The service remained in the company’s hand for another year, at
which point it was taken over by ENHOSA, a federal water service entity. See, Award, at page 112.

                                                  Page 8
                              An Institutional Theory of Public Contracts



opportunistic governmental behavior. Concession contracts, as long as they are upheld by

the local courts, may also provide a level of commitment against opportunistic behavior.

It is, thus, not surprising that the UK, a country characterized by a centralized

government but with a long tradition of judicial independence, would have adopted a

regulatory system based on concession contracts, while the regulatory structure in the US,

a country characterized by fragmented government, is based on judicial review of

administrative procedures (Spiller 1996a).


2.2 Implications of Governmental Opportunism

Facing the threat of governmental opportunism, private agents would require stronger

safeguards to undertake contracts with the state than they would in contracts with other

private agents. These safeguards may involve making the contract even more complete

and more specific so as to avoid opportunistic interpretations or the transfer of some of

the specific investments to the state.


In the absence of strong judicial independence, and of procedural safeguards, the threat of

governmental opportunism may simply imply the payment of substantial upfront rents, or

that the private sector may not contract with the state. Thus, in the absence of safeguards

against governmental opportunism, public integration (whereby the government provides

the service directly) and public ownership become equilibrium outcomes (Spiller and

Levy 1994, Savedoff and Spiller 1999).


2.3 Third Party Opportunism


The essence of public contracting is its publicity. Public contracting involves, directly or

indirectly, the use of public monies, and thus it affects, although indirectly, the lives of all


                                                Page 9
                                               Pablo T. Spiller



citizens. Reasonably working societies, then, will naturally develop ways for public

contracts to be subject to public scrutiny so as to avoid corruption and graft.17 Public

contract scrutiny is normally undertaken by designated agencies in charge of contract

supervision. In the United States, while individual departments have agencies in charge

of auditing their procurement, the Office of Management and Budget, the Government

Accountability Office, and the Congressional Budget Office routinely examine the

procurement performance of government agencies and of the auditing agencies

themselves.18


Apart from official agencies, a substantial amount of supervision and control is done by

interested third parties (McCubbins and Schwartz, 1984; McCubbins, Noll and Weingast

1987, 1989).19 In fact, McCubbins and Schwartz (1984) in their seminal article argue

that politicians can manage the bureaucracy via “fire alarms,” whereby interest groups

(interested third parties) will “pull the alarm” when agencies stray from the politician’s

preferred policy path. They further make the point that “a predominantly fire-alarm

oversight policy is likely to be more effective … than a predominantly police-patrol

policy.”20 Thus, third party supervision is fundamental in a democratic society.



17
   Private contracts, on the other hand, are normally protected against public scrutiny, often requiring a
judicial act to make a private contract subject to public scrutiny. Some private contracts, however, are
public for obvious reasons. The registration of land ownership requires the registration of real estate
transactions, making some aspects of real estate transactions then potentially open to public scrutiny.
18
   For example, the Defense Contract Audit Agency, formed in 1965, is in charge of performing audits to
all the US Defense Department contracts. The performance of the DCAA, in turn, is supervised by the
OMB, while the GOA and the CBO routinely review specific programs of the Department of Defense. See,
for example, CBO, “Replacing and Repairing Equipment Used in Iraq and Afghanistan: The Army’s Reset
Program,” Pub. No. 2809, September 2007; see also, GAO, Defense Acquisitions: Department of Defense
Actions on Program Manager Empowerment and Accountability, November 9, 2007.
19
   de Figueiredo, Spiller and Urbiztondo (1999) also show that politicians prefer not only a proliferation of
interested interest groups monitoring agencies, but also prefer them to come from divergent perspectives.
20
   McCubbins and Schwartz (1984: 171).

                                                  Page 10

A fundamental feature of interest groups as monitors, though, is that they are interested.

In other words, they are biased. They provide information only when it is to their

advantage. That is, the third party (or parties) may behave opportunistically. As it relates

to public contracts, interested third parties may have incentives to challenge the “probity”

of a particular public agent when by such action they may benefit. Such incentives may

exist when third parties compete with the public agent in another (political) market.

Benefits may arise in the political and the economic sphere. In both it may involve the

displacement of the incumbent (and competing) public agent. In the political sphere, the

challenge may be deemed successful if because of the challenge the public agent is,

eventually, replaced by an agent related or more to the liking of the interested third party.

As it relates to the economic sphere, the challenge may be deemed successful if the

private party is replaced or the terms of the contract are changed in ways that benefit the

third party. But it is precisely because of competition in the political market that such

challenges are particularly dangerous to the public agent.21


In a competitive political market environment third party opportunism, depending on the

challenge’s credibility, may entail significant costs to the public agent. The public agent

may have to incur significant time and expense to defend its actions,22 may have to leave




21
   For example, the replacement of the private party may damage the political credibility of the incumbent
public agent, weakening its position vis-à-vis a third party interested in its replacement.
22
   Public agents would not be expected to leave their positions without a (political) fight. Multiple interest
groups may be expected to contribute to the public discussion following a challenge. Some groups, aligned
with the beneficiaries of the particular contract or policy, may come to the public agent defense, and help to
limit the effectiveness, or credibility, of the challenge (de Figueiredo et al 1999).


                                                    Page 11
                                               Pablo T. Spiller



its public position, or in the extreme, if the challenge is fully successful, may be

prosecuted.23


Given the inherent informational asymmetries between the interested third party, the

courts, and the public in general, the challenge may be exercised even if the action is

ethical and/or legal. In fact, the more complex the public/private transaction, the higher

the inherent informational asymmetries, and thus, the higher the probability of third party

opportunism.


The potential for successful challenges has different types of implications. Dal Bó and

Di Tella (2006) show, for example, that the potential for threats of the type discussed

here – that is, actions by third parties that may imply costs to public agents – impacts the

selection of public agents. While the potential for positive transfers (i.e., bribes)

increases the competition to become a public agent, the potential for costly and credible

threats reduces it, thus reducing the quality of public agents. I will not explore this issue

further here.


Here I will explore the impact that potential challenges of this sort have on the nature of

public contracting in general. The exposure to third-party opportunism increases the risk

to both the public agent and the private party contracting with the state. In response, both

will have incentives to increase the specificity of these contracts as compared to

equivalent contracts among private parties. Moreover, to mitigate the risk of third-party

opportunism, these contracts are likely to demand more rigid procedural processes,



23
  This effect works also in non-democratic environments, as long as there is competition for political
power.

                                                  Page 12
                              An Institutional Theory of Public Contracts



including formal procedures for renegotiation. Nevertheless, these adjustments are

unlikely to mitigate third-party opportunism altogether, and the implementation of public

contracts is more likely to experience a higher degree of conflict than contracts among

private parties. In other words, the risk of third-party opportunism means that

“relational” contracting is less likely to evolve in the public sphere.

Marshall, Meurer and Richard (1991 and 1994), for example, show that allowing

excluded bidders to challenge the outcome of a procurement process inefficiently reduces

sole-sourcing. Kelman (1990) reports that following the enactment in 1984 of the

Competition in Contracting Act (CICA), one third of all major information technology

federal procurements were protested including nearly all of the biggest procurements,

leading to its reversal in 1995. Kelman (1990:155) further suggests that, in response,

contract agents “think only about what’s legally defensible. They bend over backwards

to avoid appeals.” Greenstein (1993) emphasizes the costs associated with procedural

rules designed to increase transparency. For example, procurement rules that restrict

agencies to evaluating vendors only on the listed factors when they cannot write a

complete specification list implies that vendors “have incentives to shirk in the provision

of those dimensions that are undervalued or are not explicitly requested in the RFP”

(Greenstein, 1993:167), thus lowering the quality of the delivered good.


Williamson (1999) raises the hazard of probity as the fundamental hazard distinguishing

some public transactions, such as foreign affairs. Williamson (1999:324) defines “probity

mission) and process integrity, while having low potential for operational cost hazards.

In this paper I try to show that probity, and the suspicion of lack of probity, is what drives

much of the features of public contracting.

4. Basic Framework of Third Party Opportunism


The following provides a basic framework to understand the workings of third party

opportunism and its impact on public contracting. Consider a political environment with

four players:


a) Incumbent public agent – who is of uncertain quality (her predisposition to corruption

being a good example), is responsible to choose the nature of the contract with the private

party (which for simplicity can be considered as high power or low power), and which

may or not involve a payment to her.24


b) Contractor – who could be a supplier or employee. His job is to accept or reject the

contract offered by the incumbent public agent, and who will then share or not share the

proceeds with the Incumbent.


c) Political competitor – the potential third party opportunist. This competitor’s decision

is whether to challenge the contract implementation. Challenges are, however, costly, so

not all contract types will be challenged. The political competitor also is able to observe

some signals concerning the realization of the contract which are not verifiable.




24
  It is easier to consider the public incumbent as a politician, that is, someone whose appointment to the
position depends on the result of an election. The public incumbent, however, can also be a political
appointee or a high level bureaucrat. All that is necessary is that she wants to remain in her position, for
which she will need the support of higher level public agents and/or the public at large.

                                                    Page 14
                                    An Institutional Theory of Public Contracts



d) The Public (which could be considered also as the court), who will, based on the actual

realization of the contract and the challenge of the political competitor decide to retain

the incumbent or to replace her by the political competitor (if the challenge took place).25


In this environment it is straightforward to show that low power incentives will be

preferred by public incumbents. By relating payments to verifiable incurred costs, low

power contracts limit the potential for successful political challenges. Contracts with low

power incentives, however, may generate less social benefits, or be more costly to the

public, but avoid the potentially negative political consequences of high power incentive

contracts. Similarly, high power incentives do not provide the same benefits they could

provide in private transactions. Challenges have also risks to the private party. In fact,

challenges may impede, ex-post, the payment of high power compensation when it is due.

Thus, third party opportunism also increases the risk to the private agent of transacting

with the state.


The response to third party opportunism for both the incumbent public agent and the

private transacting party is to provide low power contracts, to increase the degree of

contract specificity, to limit the potential discretion granted to the public agent, and to

increase procedural rigidity. Since the potential for third party opportunism increases

with complexity, complex public contracting projects would then have more contractual

rigidities than simpler public contracts.26 Rigidity, however, when combined with

complexity, will increase conflict. The potential for conflict, together with the potential

for third party opportunism, then, favors low power incentives. High power incentives


25
     The decision of the “public” will also depend on the performance of pro-incumbent interest groups.
26
     This result is consistent with Bajari and Tadelis (2001).


                                                     Page 15

simply may not be implementable given the potential for third party opportunism and the

expected level of contractual conflict.


Thus, third party opportunism limits the potential for ‘relational public contracting.”

Public agencies will have difficulty entering into a close relation with a supplier, in which

contract adaptation takes place without formal renegotiations, and/or litigation.

Furthermore, public contracting will not only be more complex, involving multiple rules

and procedures, but will also be more subject to litigation. The added complexity

required to limit the potential for third party opportunism will make public contracting

look ‘inefficient.’ This inefficiency, however, does not pass Williamson’s (1999)

remediableness test. In other words, the perceived inefficiency of public contracting is an

equilibrium response to its hazards, and in particular, to the hazard of third party

opportunism, a defining feature of public contracting. In fact, to eliminate the alleged

inefficiency, one could consider two options: one, to move the transaction within the

public sphere completely, that is, to vertically integrate; second, to drive it off the public

and into the private sector. Consider, first, moving the transaction within the public

sphere completely. Public vertical integration does not solve the “within the

bureaucracy” contracting problems. In fact, similar types of concerns arise with the

implementation of high power incentives within the bureaucracy itself. For the same

reason that high power incentives are not appropriate for public contracting, high power

incentives are not often appropriate for within the bureaucracy relations as high transfers




                                             Page 16
                                  An Institutional Theory of Public Contracts



to public employees will naturally raise probity questions, and will thus increase the risk

of third party opportunism.27


Complete privatization of the government activity may not be feasible either. There is a

public ‘sphere of action’ in which the government is the party best suited to engage in the

transaction (Williamson 1999). Privatizing key policy making aspects of a nation, for

example, may expose the nation to serious probity hazards. Thus, the undertaking of

basic public policies will have to be undertaken by Government, and that would naturally

require an interface with the private sector – that is, public contracting.


Furthermore, most public contracts would be even less efficient if brought completely

within the public sphere. That the state is more “inefficient” in computer procurement

than the private sector and has complex and rigid procurement procedures (Greenstein

1993) does not mean that the government should be in the business of making computers.


Thus, whether public contracting is, or not, inefficient cannot be inferred from the

observation that it does not replicate private contracting. A proper comparison must be

institutionally consistent and pass the Williamson’s remediableness test. That can only

be assessed on a case by case basis.


The potential for third party opportunism, furthermore, may be exacerbated by the nature

of the institutional environment in which the public contract takes place. To thrive, third



27
   There are many instances, though, of the introduction of some type of high power incentives in
bureaucracies. For example, Mexico’s higher bureaucratic echelon under the PRI has traditionally been
composed of a high paid technocracy, linked by a network of personal and political relations to the
members of cabinet. As a consequence, career advancement has been based on informal norms of
reciprocity and loyalty, where bad performance implies disloyal behavior, leading to discontinuation either
right away or when the bureau chief moves to another position. See, Grindle (1977).


                                                   Page 17
                                              Pablo T. Spiller



party opportunism requires some political contestability and fragmentation. Although

internal party politics could provide the environment for fragmentation, and for the type

of political displacement required for third party opportunists to prosper, centralized party

power limits the upward mobility of political mavericks, and thus the potential for

internal third party opportunists.28 On the other hand, political instability, the caldron

where governmental opportunism thrives, is also conducive for third party opportunism

as the cost of removing incumbent politicians falls. In the middle, between stable

centralized party control and rampant political instability, is where most of the world

democracies fall. “Open access” states, following the nomenclature introduced by North,

Wallis and Weingast (2006), naturally facilitate the development and organization of

third party interest groups. In these societies, public policies become de-personalized,

and governments are constrained in their ability to limit – whether by withdrawing

funding, political harassment or direct violence – the development and organization of

such groups. It is in these societies where the threat of third party opportunism becomes

more credible, as such challenges may not be easily covered up by side payments or the

direct threat of the recourse to violence. In “natural” states, following again North,

Wallis and Weingast (2006) nomenclature, the public agent may have more instruments

at her disposal to quash such challenges, and thus, it could be argued that her ability to

overcome a third party challenge is increased.




28
  Two interesting parallel examples are the demise of the PRI and the LDP in Mexico and Japan
respectively. Both parties controlled their respective polities for more than half a century, providing
internal party mechanisms for resolution of public conflicts, as well as for the rotation, displacement and
succession of public agents. The framework provided in this paper predicts that public contracting in
Mexico and Japan became much more cumbersome and rigid since then. This is a topic for future research.

                                                  Page 18
                                   An Institutional Theory of Public Contracts



This discussion, then, suggests that third party opportunism and governmental

opportunism may not appear in similar circumstances. While governmental opportunism

requires the existence of important sunk investments, such is not the case for third party

opportunism. Third party opportunism may appear even when the contractor may move

its assets costlessly elsewhere.29 Furthermore, while the potential for governmental

opportunism requires an institutional environment with few institutional limitations to

governmental discretion, the essence of “natural” states, the potential for third party

opportunism is limited in such environments by the same discretionary ability of

governments. Third party opportunism, then, would be more effective in open access

states, thus suggesting that public agents would adapt public contracting further away

from relational contracting in “open access” than in “natural” states.30


In sum, public contracting is plagued by third party and governmental opportunism.

While the institutional environment most propitious for the development of both types of

opportunism differ and so differ the nature of transactions which may generate each, the

framework provided here suggests that both types of hazards interact in increasing the

specificity and rigidity of public contracts causing difficulties in adapting to shocks and

leading to low-powered incentives. Similarly, both types of hazards, and their

combination, lead to more “inefficient” termination of public than private contracts.

These “inefficiencies” persist in equilibrium, and thus public contracting cannot be

simply compared to private contracting, nor can the standard measure of performance



29
   In this case, the contractor has less to fear from the consequences of third party opportunism, but that is
not the case for the public agent.
30
   This, however, does not mean that in “natural states” public contracting will be relational. In such states,
public contracting is subject to governmental opportunism requiring its types of own adaptations.

from private contracting be applied to public contracts. With this in mind, I proceed to

analyze the implications of the framework to the use of concession contracts as

regulatory instruments.


5. An Application to Concession Contracts

Concession contracts are part of the general set of licenses and permits through which

states grant the right to a private organization to undertake a particular public-service

activity. Concession contracts differ from other types of legal instruments in that while

taking the form of operating licenses, they tend to embed the basic regulatory framework

that will guide their evolution as it relates to basic features such as prices, quality,

penalties, termination and the like. In that sense, the state that selects to grant a

concession contract in essence is embedding the regulatory framework within a formal

contract.


Concession contracts, then, differ from simple operating licenses, such as those common

in the United States, as the latter are silent about the regulatory framework, leaving the

management of the terms of operation of the licensee to other instruments, such as

administrative procedures or specific legislation.31 Since including the regulatory

framework within the license makes it more rigid, as significant changes in the regulatory

framework requires either the consent of the concessionaire or a judicial decision, the

natural question to ask is why a state chooses such a restrictive legal instrument.


In Spiller (1996a) I provide a theory of regulatory instrument choice based on the need

for regulatory credibility given the nature of the institutional environment in which the


31
     See, Spiller (1996a) for a discussion of this issue.

                                                       Page 20
                              An Institutional Theory of Public Contracts



investment is undertaken. Concession contracts, then, arise as a mode for organizing

provision of public services precisely because regulation by contracts sets limits to

unilateral regulatory changes, and by doing that, it mitigates the potential for

governmental opportunism (Levy and Spiller, 1994). In particular, regulation by contract

is preferred in sectors with a high level of sunk assets (e.g., water, transport, natural gas,

and electricity distribution), in politically unstable environments, and when regulation by

law does not provide enough credibility to protect the investments of the service

providers. In these cases the providers are vulnerable to governmental opportunism, and

so private service providers will not enter the market or demand too high a premium on

services under direct regulation. Concession contracts, by creating an individualized

regulatory framework for the investments at hand, limit such opportunism.


The choice of regulatory contracts shows the inexorable trade-off between commitment

and flexibility (Spiller 1996a). To be credible, a regulatory contract must be specific –

i.e., it must lay out in detail how the parties will deal with each eventuality. However,

adjustments in the relationship require flexibility in the contract, which in turn requires

that the contract be complex. Complexity is limited by administrative capability and

negotiation costs (which depends on differences among potential investors and political

incentives).


Concession contracts are rigid by “origin”. A flexible concession contract that grants

substantial discretion to the state would fail to provide the required commitment, and thus

would not be seen by the investor as mitigating the risk of governmental opportunism.

Thus, concession contracts are born with less flexibility than normal private contracts.

They are also not “relational contracts.” In fact, adaptations to shocks seldom involve

serious contractual deviations without triggering formal contractual adaptations.32 In

fact, Guasch (2004) finds that from a total of 942 concessions granted in Latin American

countries from the mid-1980s, by year 2000 a full 42% of them were renegotiated.

Figure 2 below shows the distribution across sectors, showing that most transport and

water concession contracts were renegotiated.

The large percentage of formally renegotiated contracts is only surprising if we look at it

from the perspective of ‘relational contracts.’ But regulatory adaptations should not be

surprising. Most concession contracts should be adapted over time, as by nature, these

contracts are long term and incomplete. As a consequence, it is unreasonable to expect

that through the long life of these concessions, there will be no economic (e.g., an



32
   In a sense, it is possible to say that the frequency of contract renegotiation may provide concessions a
‘relational’ quality.

                                                        Page 22

unexpected increase in external or internal costs) or political shocks (e.g., new political

needs) that would call for a change in the agreed terms of the contract. An unadjusted

contract may lead to unproductive actions or even default, generating unnecessary social

losses.


In fact, while adaptation to new realities is necessary, informal adaptation, whereby the

parties agree to deviate from the terms of the concession contract without formal

renegotiation raises the risk of third party opportunism. As a consequence, adaptation, if

needed, would mostly be done by formal renegotiation.


Here is, though, where governmental and third party opportunism interact. Formal

renegotiation raises the risk of third party opportunism, as the whiff of corruption can

immediately be sensed. Thus, to generate a formal renegotiation, the shock has to be

large enough that the need for adaptation becomes clear to lay observers.


Long term concessions are exposed to different types of economic shocks. Internal

shocks arise early in the life of the concession when concessionaires are granted the use

of existing assets whose working conditions are difficult to ascertain. This is mostly the

case in waterworks concessions, where operators are granted the use of a waterworks

often without updated maps detailing routes, inventory of type of equipment, clients, and

so on. In fact, most water concessions get renegotiated in the initial two years.


External shocks are simply the normal types of demand and cost changes (devaluations,

drastic increase in input costs not covered in the contract, etc) that may drastically impact

the viability of the concession. This could be the case if the contract introduces high

power incentives features, such as annual payments to the government for the right to


                                              Page 23
                                               Pablo T. Spiller



operate the concession, minimum investment levels, or fixed prices over long periods of

time.33,34 These conditions may become very onerous to implement if an economic shock

lowers revenue expectations after the contract has been signed. By contrast, a regulatory

mechanism characterized by lower-powered incentives, such as rate-of-return regulation,

is less likely to trigger the need to renegotiate, as it generates adaptation more naturally.


Lack of adaptation following a shock that threatens the viability of the concession may in

fact trigger contract termination. While termination may be “socially inefficient,”35 it

may be politically preferable for the public agent than bearing the third party

opportunism risks associated with renegotiating the contract.36


All other things being equal, it is reasonable to expect that the larger the investments

undertaken in relation to future network expansion needs, the higher the government’s

incentive to terminate the concession (Troesken 1997), both because of governmental

opportunism and because of the difficulties of renegotiating given third party

opportunism hazards. Given the risk of early termination, concession contracts normally

provide for very specific and explicit compensation at termination, whether early or

normal. The degree of specificity of these clauses is obvious: the greater the ability of




33
   There are various types of price cap regulatory schemes. The UK style involves tariff reviews every five
years. Others may set prices without a fixed term for review, relying instead on the initiation of
extraordinary tariff reviews.
34
   In fact, Guasch et al (2003) show that the probability of renegotiation in Latin America increases with the
presence of price caps, financial commitments and large scale investment requirements.
35
   The concession would need to be taken over by the government, and then transferred again to a private
operator, who, this time will not accept without further guarantees of proper governmental behavior.
36
   Termination may also be the result of governmental opportunism. An economic shock may enable the
government to expropriate the quasi-rents physically (via termination) that could not be obtained
financially (by renegotiating on more favorable terms).

                                                   Page 24

the state to manipulate the compensation, the higher the government’s incentive to

terminate.37


Although there are inherent38 and institutional limits to governmental opportunism, third

party opportunism may not be subject to these limitations. Even in contractual

circumstances where the potential for governmental opportunism has been limited by

expectations of future investments or institutional limitations, third party opportunism

may still trigger “inefficient” contract termination.


Consider, for example, waterworks in the U.S. A large number of municipalities across

the United States use concession contracts to operate and manage their water works.39

Not all contracts, though, are for city-wide service, with most covering only partial

operations, such as operation of a particular pumping or treatment plant, or the provision

of billing services (Water Science and Technology Board, 2002). These contracts are

long term, often dealing with highly complex physical environments.40 These contracts

assign risks to the contractor and the city in highly complex and sophisticated fashions,

providing for cost escalation clauses, and for renegotiation facing a large scale shock

such a natural disaster.41 The transfer of existing operations to a private contractor is,



37
   Governments may still attempt to manipulate compensation via the introduction of ‘counter-claims’
although that would naturally lead to litigation.
38
   The government may benefit from a reputation for being a good contracting partner, especially if it takes
the long-term view. There may also be a financial cost of termination, including contractual termination
clauses, the rules of contract law generally, or even international law.
39
   Some commentators put the number of water systems operated by private operators in the United States
above 1,100 (see, for example, Arrandale, Tom, 2003. “Foreign Faucet,” Governing. Available at
<http://www.governing.com/archive/2003/jun/water.txt>).
40
   This observation is based on a set of contracts obtained via directly contacting the municipalities and
asking for copies of all such contracts they may have.
41
   The 1997 Seattle Public Utilities Treatment Plant Contract, is such an example. See Appendix C to
Water Science and Technology Board (2002).

though, as complex in the United States as elsewhere.42 Consider, for example, the

breakdown of the Atlanta waterworks contract. In January 2003, the City of Atlanta

terminated what was then a twenty two year management and operation contract of the

whole waterworks system of Atlanta, only four years after its transfer. Right after the

transfer the parties entered into conflicts on the costs required to meet the standards

agreed upon in the contract. United Water, the operator, claimed that much of the

baseline data were inaccurate and thus, the targets and annual fees agreed upon were

unrealistic, forcing it to lose $10 million a year out of a $20.8 million/year contract.43

Renegotiation, then, would have to involve a substantially higher per year fee, as well as

a modification of the service targets. The City, however, preferred to take back the

contract at a cost of $40 million/year – against the $22 million/year of the contract, rather

than having to handle the public criticism of its management of the contract. Following

the reasoning in this paper, renegotiation would have been “in neither party’s interest.”44

It would not have been in the City’s interest as it would be extremely difficult to explain

that a contract drafted and crafted by the City just a few years ago was in such seeming

disarray that it requires a substantial fee increase. For the City it would be much easier to

blame all problems on the operator’s bad performance. Similarly, it would not have been

in the operator’s interest, as, given the public perception of wrongful operator

performance, it would be difficult to expect that the renegotiated contract would fully

compensate it. At the end, the parties ended the contract “amicably.”45 The contract

termination, however, was preceded by a series of corruption allegations involving an

agreement to grant a $4 million/year for 17 years payment increase following the

operator’s request for $80 million compensation for work not included in the contract,46

and allegations that the Mayor had business relations with a competing water operator.47


The Atlanta case is an example of a contract falling apart not because of governmental

opportunism – as seems to have been the case in Aguas del Aconquija, but rather by the

inability of the parties to draft and implement contracts with sufficiently flexibility that

can adapt to uncertain operating circumstances. Instead, the parties entered into a highly

inflexible contract, forcing them to renegotiate or terminate. The City, however, was

unwilling to pay the political price of renegotiation. The main thrust of this paper is that

contract inflexibility is inherent to public contracts, and that, facing the potential for third

party opportunism, large shocks may trigger termination and/or litigation rather than

renegotiation.


6. Regulatory Implications

This analysis has some implications for regulation by contract. Regulation by contract

must limit high cash-flow fluctuations, suggesting that rate-of-return regulation will be

better suited to concession contracts than price cap regulation. It must also limit

investment requirements. These have not worked well in practice and instead direct

subsidies may provide better incentives to invest in low-income sectors. Regulation must

also provide a well-defined system of penalties for quality and limit transfer of

concessions based on annual payments or lowest prices. However, the reductions in

incentives this regulatory system creates may not necessarily be harmful. Gilbert and

Riordan (1995) argue that in environments with low technological change, high-powered-

incentive regulation is not that necessary.


7. Final Comments

This paper argues that public contracting is plagued by third party and governmental

opportunism. Providing for both types of hazards results in highly specific and rigid

contracts causing difficulties in adapting to shocks and leading to low-powered

incentives. Nevertheless, there is likely to be more “inefficient” termination of public

than private contracts. High contract specificity, termination penalties and jurisdictional

arrangements arise as safeguards. These “inefficiencies” persist in equilibrium, and thus

public contracting cannot be simply compared to private contracting, nor can the standard

measure of performance from private contracting be applied to public contracts.


This framework has direct implications for the study of regulation. In particular, this

framework suggests the need to reconsider the use of high-powered incentives in

concession contracts and rethink the beauty of simple, less theoretically “efficient”

contracts that are likely to be more conducive to long term sustainability (Levy and

Spiller 1994). This framework also has direct implications for other types of public
