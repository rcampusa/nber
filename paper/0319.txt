                                      SUMMA.RY



          Economists   have been paying increasing attention to the study of
situations in which csumers face a discrete rather than a continous set
of choices. Such models are potentially very important in evaluating the
impact    of government programs upon consi.mter welfare. But      very little has
been   said in general   regarding the tools of    applied welfare economics in

discrete choice situations.

           This   paper shows how the conventional methods of applied welfare
economics can be modified to handle such cases. It focuses on the corn-
putation    of the excess burden of taxation,     and the evaluation of gua].ity
change.     The results are applied to stochastic utility models, including

the popular cases of prohit and logit analysis. Throughout,           the ernp)-asis
is on providing rigorous guidelines for carrying out applied work.

I.     Introduction

       Economists are      increasing attention to the study of situations
                        paying

in which consumers face a discrete rather than a continuous set of choices.
A considerable literature has grown   covering   econometric methodology and
applications to   a wide variety of situations.' In a few specific cases,

estimates of discrete choice models have been employed for welfare analysis.2

Travel demand researchers have developed "composite cost" and "accessibility"

measures to evaluate the desirability of various states (Williams [1977),

Ben-Akiva and Lerman [1978)), but the relationship of these to conventional

welfare criteria has not been thoroughly explored. Indeed, very little has

been said in general regarding the validity of the tools of applied welfare

economics in discrete choice situations.

       Nevertheless, in at least two areas in which discrete choice models are

applied, welfare judgments are of paranount interest.      The first is the analysis
of   taxes and subsidies. Econometric studies of the impacts of taxes on labor

supply, savings, and housing decisions have permitted calculation of the welfare

cost or "excess burden" of the tax feature under consideration.3 Traditionally,

such studies have assumed that the taxed activity will be pursued regardless

of the existence of the tax.

        However, instances in which taxes influence discrete choices are numerous

arid important. For example, it has been suggested that the federal tax treat-

ment of owner—occupied housing not only increases the quantity demanded of owner-
occupied housing services, but also influences whether or not an individual owns
a home at all [Rosen, forthcoming]. For secondary earners, taxes affect not only

the number of hours of work, but also whether or not participation in the labor

market takes place jHec)ataxi,        19743.    Even for primary workers, taxes may
influence not       only the hours spent at a given occupation, but the choice be-

tween   occupations as well.
       A second important area is the analysis of quality changes in goods and
services. Nierous studies in such areas as transportation, education, health
care, child care, and pollution contain explicit or implicit welfare evalua-
tions of public policies       which change the quality of sane publicly or privately

supplied good. In many         cases,   the good affected is subject to discrete choice

mode   of    transportation, public or private schools, type       of health care, type   of

child   care, and location of recreational activities all serve as examples.
       The purpose of the present paper is to demonstrate that the conventional
methods      of   applied welfare economics can be generalized to handle cases in which
discrete      choices are   involved.    We think it important   for   several reasons

to   set out the generalization carefully. First, there has been some suggestion
that    conventional welfare change computations may have no relevance in discrete

choice cases.4 Second, as the econometric estimation of discrete choice models

of many types gains in popularity, it is useful to have a clear statement re-

garding their use in applied welfare economics. Finally, the presence of dis-

crete choice introduces        sane   differences in the relation between ordinary and

compensated        demand curves   which alters the way in which empirical approximations

should      be carried out.
        In   Section II we review the computation of the Hicks ian compensated

variation for the "standard" case in which there are             price—induced   changes in

quantity demanded by each individual. We also note its relation to the



     4For example, Ben—Porath and Bruno [1977] state that in Israel, the
pre—1975 tax structure was ... "less a deterrent to work as such than an
inducement to search for untaxable types of work" (our emphasis). They
suggest that "The concept of excess burden is not particularly well defined
in this case ..." (p. 289).

Section III it is shown how the canputations are performed for circumstances
in which discrete     choice is involved, and Section IV extends   the result to
quality changes. Section V discusses in detail the application of the results
to stochastic utility models, including the cases of probit and logit analysis.

ii. Continuous Choice


      In this section we review the justification for measuring price—induced

utility changes as areas to the left of the appropriate canpensated demand

curves. The basic analytical tool is the expenditure function, which is

treated concisely and      elegantly in Diamond and McFadden [1974].
      Suppose     that a consumer has a twice differentiable, strictly quasi—
 concave utility function u defined over the corn odities          x and x, , where
Xn
     is taken to be the numeraire. The two good case is chosen for convenience;
 the results generalize easily to an arbitrary number of commodities. The
 consumer maximizes

      u = u(x,x1)                                                                 (24)

 subject to the budget     and   non—negativity   constraints


      x + p1x1 = y                                                                (2.2)


                  x. > 0           j = n,l                                        (2.3)


 where p1 is the price of good 1, and y               is incorne

         Maximization        of (2.1) subject to      (2.2)    yields   the ordinary demand
  functions

         x.   =
                  x.(P1,Y)             j   = ri,l .                                             (2.4)

                                             Cxi >          with respect to both goods.
 Substituting        (2.4) into   (2.1) we define          the consumer's indirect utility
 function;

         v(p1,y)      UCX(p1,y),1(p1,y))                                                       (2.5)
 which is known       to satisfy Roy's Identity:5
           v/ p1 =
                       Xl     .

                                                                                               (2.6)

Provided      that the direct utility function is strictly increasing in x

and is non—decreasing in
                                   x1, v is monotonjc increasing in y and can
therefore be inverted to yield the expenditure function                            -




      y = e(p1u) .                                                                            (2.7)

The function e therefore indicates how iiuch income is required to achieve

the utility level u when the price of good 1 is p1; it satisfies


      UVC1,e(p1,u).                                                                           (2.8)


      Now suppose that the price of the first good changes fran p to

p .    By definition, the compensating variation associated with
                                                                 the price
change   is

      4e = e(p,u0)       -
                             eCp31°)   ,
                                                                                              (2.9)

      5Roy's Identity follows from comparing the total differentials of
(2.2) and (.2.5) and using the first-order maximization conditions.
                                                   —5—

This expression shows the amount of income the consumer must be given to make

him as well of at price p as at p .                         Mohring (1971] has forcefully argued,
that it is the appropriate measure for most problems of applied welfare
             6
economics.
      The problem now is to express (2.9) in terms of the compensated demand

function for x1 ,           which is defined by

                     =                                                                      (2.10)
      x(p1,u)            x1(p1,e(p1,u)).

This is done by applying Shephard's lemma:

      e(p1,u) =                                                                             (2.11)
                         x1(p1,u)   ,

         p1

where u is an arbitrarily selected utility level.7 This equation gives the
compensating variation for an infinitesimal change in p1 ;                     to   find the compen-

sating variation for a finite change, (2.11) is integrated;
                                         f

                                         Ic
                                         j x1(p1,u
                                                    o
                                                        )dp1 .                              (2.12)
                                         0
                                        p1
      This gives the basic result mentioned at the start of this section; the

 compensating        variation    of d    price   change is the area to the left of the Compen-

 sated demand curve.

       This result is easily aggregated.                   Define the aggregate compensated demand

 functionfor good 1,     , as the sum of the individual compensated demand
 functions. X depends upon prices and upon the utility levels of all consumers.

              is employed, for example, by Hause (1975] and Diamond and McFadden
 11974], both of which demonstrate that the compensating variation measure leads
to the well—known Harberger formula for excess burden. Nevertheless, some Con-
troversy surrounds          its
                       use; see Chipman and Moore [l976a) and Hause (1975].
       7Shephard's lemma follows from differentiating (2.8) with respect to p1
and   applyingRoy's Identity.

Similarly, define the aggregate expenditure function, E ,         as the sum of   the
ind.ividua2. expenditure functions at these same utility levels. Then by adding
the compensating variations (2.12) for all consumers, we obtain;
               f
              P1
          =                                                                       (2.13)
                   x(p1,{u))dp1    ,

               J
               0
              p1
where     {u1} is the set of utility levels before the change.

     For practical purposes, the area to the left of the compensated demand

curve   in    (2.13) is usually calculated from an econometric estimate of the

ordinary     or   Ma.rshallian demand curve.8 Although the compensated demand func-

tion for an individual can, under certain conditions, be computed exactly

frorn an econometric estimate of the Marshallian demand Iseade, 1978; Willig,

1976], the same is not true       of   aggregates. This had led to an approximation

procedure, employed by a number of investigators such as Harberger L1964] and

peldstein 11978],        in which the Slutsky equation is applied to the ordinary

aggregate demand      in order to obtain estimates of compensated price
                        curve

elasticities. This procedure is exact if (a) ax1/y is the same for every-

one, and (b) each individual! s share of aggregate income is fixed regard-
less of price and income changes; in this case the Slutsky equation can           be


aggregated.         To the extent that individuals' income slopes are similar, then,
this would        appear to be a reasonable approximation procedure.

        For the special case in which the price change is induced by a tax (or

subsidy), (2.13) can be used to calculate the "excess burden" of the tax, i.e.,

the welfare loss brought about by distortions in relative prices. Following



     81t has been shown that the area under the ordinary demand curve        is
                                                                          itself an
                                          very restrictive conditions  in the
exact measure of the utility change under
demand function. See, for example, Chipxuan and Noore [1976b] ,Rader (l976b], or
Bruce    [1977].
                                              —7—

Diamond and NcFadden 11974], we define excess burden as


           =     —T   ,                                                          (2.14)

where T denotes tax receipts. The exact form which equation (2.14) takes

in   practice depends on the       income effects generated by the uses of the tax   revenues
(or,   alternatively, by a set of hypothetical lump-sum taxes of equal yield), and
therefore      depends    on the distribution of these revenue uses or taxes. Although

this point is well—known (see Friedman 11949], Bailey [1954], Harberger (1964),

and Hause 11975]), it is worth restating here because its implications for dis-

crete goods, discussed in the next section, are somewhat surprising.

       Let c. and             be the own-price slopes of the aggregate .Marshallian and

compensated demand functions, respectively; and let ca be the income—slope            of

the former, viewed as a function of aggregate income Y E Z y1 . Then the
Slutsky     approximation discussed above,

                                                         -                -

can    be intuitively justified from the observation that X1dp1 is the income
compensation required to ameliorate the effect of a price increase dp1, and
hence uX1dp1 is the additional consumption induced if income is compensated.

      Now consider two alternative assumptions about the uses of the tax revenues

T:    (a)the partial equilibrium assumption that they are used in such a way as
to   generate no repercussions on demand for good 1 , and (b) the general equili-
brium assumption that they are distributed uniformly in lump sum transfers. We
again compute approximations of second order in the price change. Under assuxnp-
tion (a)., tax revenues are computed along the Marshallian demand curve:

      T 1X + cttp1]Lp1                .                                                      (2.18)

Under assumption                  (b), on the other hand, final demand contains an income
effect             ,   where TG are the             tax    revenues,     so that

      TG =                    +                                                              (2.19)

       9See Hause 119751, pp. 1156—1160, for a fuller discussion of the rationale
for   using the compensated demand curve in computing tax revenue under general
equilihrium assumptions. Note also that we are assuming a constant cost techno-
logy, i.e., introduction of the tax does not change the producer's price over
the relevant region. See also Rohif s' 11976] discussion of the adequacy of surplus
welfare measures under partial equilibrium assumptions.

The general equilibrium version (2.24) is the famous excess burden triangle
usually associated with Harberger.
        Note that, whereas the compensating variation is of first order in
the    excess burden is itself of second-order in p1            .
                                                                     Thus, the conditions
given by Willig 11976], under which the compensating variation is adequately

approximated     by the    ordinary consumer's surplus, do not necessarily justify

using   the ordinary instead of the compensated dnand curve for excess buxden
calculations. Indeed, if the general equilibrium assumptions underlying
equation (2.24) prevail, then it is the best approximation Cup to second-

order terms in p1 )          of   the excess burden, and the fractional error from
                             C
using c instead of                in equation (2.24) is. Cc—czC )/ctC = X1w/ctC     = — OriftC

where 0 is the budget share of good 1, r is its income elasticity,                      and
is   its compensated own—price elasticity.           This error can be substantial for a
good, such as hou.sing, which absorbs a large portion of consumers' incomes.
       For a normal good, the excess burden is positive and Is       in the  smaller

general than in the partial equilibrium context. This is because the consuirip-
tion cutback caused by the price distortion is lessened by the income effects
arising     from the uses of the tax     revenues.   We will see in the next section

that sie of      the   ameleriorating income effect in    the   general equilibrium case
is   lost in discrete good models, making the potential welfare losses from taxes
on such goods     greater than    conventional analysis would imply.


III. Discrete     Choice


       In this   section,   we prove the basic theorem which establishes the validity

of using the area to the left of a compensated demand               curve   for a discrete

good   as   a measure of the coxpensating variation. We take advantage of the
                                         — 10   —



notation   and    general plan of attack used in Section II for the continuouS goods
                                                     approximations for computing wel—
case.    We then show how the use of empirical

fare losses is modified.

                         in demand can be modelled   in at least three   ways.   (a)
        Discreteness

CoumoditieS may be available in continuous quantities, but in only one of a
nall number of mutually exclusive varieties. An example is housing. It can
be purchased in either the rental or owner mode, but given the tenure choice,
                                        services can be consumed. Cb) Goods may be
a continuous quantity o housing
available     in discrete units which are so large that most consumers choose
only one or two units. Examples include college degrees, transportation mode
                                                          be purchased in
for work trips, and many consumer durables. (c) Goods may
                                                           functions lead the consumer
discrete    units      because nonconcaVitieS in utility

                                           solutions.   For example,   two television

 shows aired simultafleOUlY can be
                                   consumed in any fractions, but most viewers


 will    prefer consume all of one and none of the other • Note that many
                  to

 examples could be modelled equally well as cases (a) or Cc).
      In addition, even with concave utility functions, particular prices and
                                                      is not consumed at all.

  the    Coipensatin9 yariatiOn is that discreteness introduces a point of

result      in   this   section is that   it is still possible to integrate over (2.11),
since   the expenditure function is continuous and has right and left—derivatives
at the point in question.
      The formal models for the various cases differ in detail, but the proofs
for all are essentially similar. We therefore proceed by considering case (a)
in a three-good model in which two of the goods are mutually exclusive. The
proofs for the other cases and extensions to more than three goods are outlined
in   Appendix A.

      Consider,         then,a consner with utility ftnction

      u=u(.x ,x     ,x)
                  n12                                                                 (3.1)



where             is the numeraire good. In order for the possibility of zero con—
sumption of good 1 or 2 to make sense, we assine that utility is finite
when either x1 or          x2   is zero. As in the standard    case,   utility is utaxi—
mized subject to

      x+p1x1+p2x2=y                                                                   (3.2)

                                >0            j   = 1, 2, n                           (3.3)

To prevent both x1              and       fr being consumed in positive amounts; we
impose the constraint

                   0                                                                  (34)
                                                                  10
As in the reyious section, we assume interior solutions rather than                deal
exp1icitl         with. non-negativity constraints; thus the numeraire and either
                   are consaed in positive quantitiàs,
      .L0
      Corner solutions can also be dealt with using the framework developed
in this section. See Appendix A for a demonstration.

Theore    1.

       Suppose a consumer inaxidzes,               subject     to constraints (3.2) through (3.4),

a twice differentiable, strictly quasi—concave utility function of the

form (3.11. Assume 11              is   finite whenever x1               or x2 is zero, is strictly

       Proof.    Constraint (3.4) requires that

good 2 be zero. If

ing U(X,X1,Ol subject to x3 + 1x1 = y                             .    The function u is well-behaved

when yiewed as a function only of x and                                  ,    so this suh-robl is formal—

ly identical to the problem of the previous section, and leads to well-defined
continuously differentiable indirect utility, expenditure, and compensated demand
functions,      each conditional on                 = 0   .   Denoting these by 1(1,y), 1(p11u)
                        respectively, we know             from (2.11)             that
 and
       i(p1,u)

        Similarly,    if x1 =    0,   the prob1n of maximizing u(x,O,x2)
yields functions        2(p2,y), 2Cp21u)       and i(p2,u) with the property
that

     For any incane y , the choice between good 1 and good 2 will, be
made by cparing      (p1        ,)
                            with V2 (p2 ,y) . Let k (p1 ,p2 ,y) index the
larger of the two, with k = 1 in case of a tie. Then the utility achieved
is

                            max{1(p1,) ,;2(p2,y))       .                                   (3.9)

since          is strictly increasing in y ,            and           is   simply its inverse

       Since each of the functions            is continuously differentiable in price,

so is e ,      except at those prices for which e1 = e2 ;                   and at these points,

     It remains only to identify the right'-hand-side of (3.13) as the

                           =                                                                       (.3.14)

Evaluating (3.14)       at utility u0 max{v1 (p,y) ,v2 (p2 ,y) }                   and   integrating
over p1 yields (.3.5).
                                                                 Q.E.D.
     A more heuristic discussion of the theorem may be useful at this point.

Suppose an infinitesimal change, dp1 ,                  occurs   in   the price of good 1. If

a positive amount x1           of   good 1 is being consumedr then the welfare loss is

x1dp1 .    If good 1 is not being consied, i.e.                       = 0     ,    then   the welfare

loss is again x1dp1 ,           which in this case equals zero, If the consumer is
just at the point of indifference            between     goods 1 and 2, no welfare loss

arises from switching from one good to the other. Therefore, integrating

over this point of discontinuity adds nothing to the total for a finite change.

In every case, then, the welfare loss fran an incremental price change is des—

cribed by the incremental area to the left of the demand curve.                            If   income is

compensated  as the price changes, this is equivalent to measuring the area to
the left of the compensated demand curve. This intuitive discussion applies
equally well to cases Cb) and Cc), mentioned earlier,14 and to corner solutions.

     14
          .aler   11974,   pp. 131—136) demonstrates an even stronger result for case
(h), in which the good in question must be purchased in a given quantity or not
at all. Re shows that, for a fall in the price of such a. good, the compensat-
ing variation is given by the area to the left of its ordinary demand curve.
This follows from our result because income eftects axe absent, and thus the
ordinary and compensated demand curves              are identical. So long as the price re-
mains above the "critical price0 p at which the consmmer purchases the dis--
crete 9ood, no compensation is required to keep him at the initial             utility level;
and below the critical price, the compensation cannot affect the amount of the
discrete good purchased. However, R. Willig has pointed out to us that Nler is
incorrect in sthting that the result also holds when the individual is consuming
the good, and the price rises abo're p . This asymmetry occurs because for the
price rise, the compensating income alters the itica1 price itself, and hence the
ordinary demand curve and the relevant compens. d demana curve axe not identical.

         As   in the ordinary goods case, we define an aggregate compensated
demand function for good 1, X , as the sum of the individual cpensated
demand functions. It depends upon the prices and the utilities of all con-
sumers. Similarly, define the aggregate expenditure function E as the
sum of the individual expenditure functions at arbitrarily selected utility
levels.        Then, by adding over consumers, we obtain the result that the sum

of   the individual coIn psating variations is given by- the area to the left

of the aggregate cnpensated demand curve:

where u1 is the initial utility level of the ith consumer.



Applying the Theorem

         For purposes of applying Theorem 1, it is important to notice that the

demand curve         in   (3.15) is the -unconditional demand for good 1, and is not

conditional on the choice of good 1. Both the discrete choice itself and

the quantity demanded conditional              on that choice are incorporated       in

         To make this distinction clear, write the compensated demand fuhction
in equation (3.5), for !ndividual i ,                  as

where                is a compensated discrete choice index, i.e.,                 is 1 if good

1 is chosen and 0 otherwise, assuming that price changes are compensated in

order to permit achievement of initial utility level                         .   The compensated

demand        conditional       on choice of good 1,       X1, is   defined as in the above proof. Adding

 the   right—hand sides of equation (.3.16) for the N individuals in the economy

 yields an alternative version of (3.15):

          There are two important problems which must be solved in order to make
 equation (3.17) useful for applied work. First, an            investigator cannot Jaow

 with     certainty whether or not a representative individual will consume a given
discrete good: All that can be assigned is the probability ir that the good
will be purchased, conditional upon a set of measurable characteristics (race,
sex, etc.) as well as prices and income. An attractive way to model this is to
assumethat each individual's utility function is deterministic (as in the pre-
ceding section), but that because of factors unobservable o the investigator,
the    outcome appears random.15         Thus as we move to applications of our theorem

and attach probabilistic interpretations to variables that were heretofore

deterministic,           we are not moving to a different framework, but are   dealing with


a   special case of the model developed         above. Replacing tne criolce lnue

in (3.17) with this choice probability converts (3.17) to an equation for




      15This seems to have acquired the name "random utility" approach, in
contrast to the "constant utility" approach, in which the utility function
itse.lf    (or equivalently, the choice tnechanisin)is viewed as having a random
component. Operationally, these two            formulations are equivalent, i.e.
lead to the same kind of estimating           equations. Their interpretations      are
discussed at length by Williams (1977].

th expected welfare change.16
     The second problem is that           is a compensated diScrete choice index;

therefore, it should be replaced with a compensated choice probability. We
                                                                          to that
orovide in the next sub—section an approximation procedure, analogous

or continuous      9oods,   for doing this.
     Our method is therefore fully operational provided we can find econo—
ietric   techniques for estimating the required demand curves. A straightfoiward
zrocedu.re would be to estimate the discrete choice arid conditional demand
£.-:tions   jointly using maximum   likelihood   techniques. Alternatively, a

:cristent recursive procedure has been developed by Heckman [1977].




S1tsky    Effect

      A satisfactory approximation procedure for converting econometric

estinates   into compensated demand relations must take into account the fact
that neither the Slutsky equation nor the computation of tax revenues is the




      16Note that oniy if the choice probability is independent of price
    will the correct answer be obtained by calculating areas for conditional
p1
dema.d curves and multiplying them by the probabilities. Thus, for example,
Feldsteiri and Friedman [1977] are correct in using the latter procedure
to calculate welfare effects of changes in the price of health insurance,
because in their model theprobability of illness is assumed to be exogenous.
wever, one must not be irilsied into thinking their procedure is generaliz-
able to eridogenous probabilities.

same    for discrete as for continuous goods, because the nature of the income
effects is fundamentally changed. In the continuous case, it is at least
reasonable to suppose that all consumers have identical income slopes for
good 1; this permits the Slutsky equation to be aggregated, and makes plausible
the general equilibrium assumption that tax revenues are redistributed so
as to return all consumers to their initial utility levels. In the discrete
case,    however, we explicitly recognize a group whose consumption of good 1 is

zero    throughout a range of incomes, and     thus the analysis must be modified.

         In order to focus on the issue of discreteness 2 Se, it is useful to

abstract from other differences among individuals by assuming N consumers

who differ only in their preferences between goods ]. and         2) Thus, they
have identical incomes y ,      and identical conditional Marshallian and compen-

sated demand functions 1(p1,y) and (p11u) ,               respectively.   This is, of

course, a very restrictive case. However, it is useful in that it highlights

the important differences that appear when discreteness is explicitly taken

into account. If the assumptions of this section seem too restrictive for a

given problem, they can be relaxed, although the results will be less intuitive

and computationally more complicated.


         17Assume, for example, that utility for the ith individual is given
by U1(XX1X2) = f(x1X1rX2)         +        +           where S. = 1    if x    is

chosen and = 0     otherwise (   = 1,2),   and where        and       are constants.

of good 1 to rise by (aX1/3Y) (X1/1r1)dp1               ,   which gives the first income—effect
term in (3.26). The last term arises from the effects of income compensation

on the choice probability itself.

As before, the compensating variation is given by equation (2.16); note,

however, that this is no longer equivalent to (2.17).

       We next proceed             to calculate tax           revenues under (a) partial and (b)

general      equilibrium assumptions, making                      use   of the "Slutsky-like" equation
(3.26),      which can be written:


             =   cz   +               —
                          (X1/ir1)w       (l—7r) (X1/1T1)2v                                            (3.27)


       (a) For the partial equilibrium case, tax revenue is simply                             given   by

(2.18), and excess bu.rden by (2.22). Substituting (3.27) into (2.22)

yields:

Note that, in the absence of income effects on the choice probability
(' = 0)      ,    the excess burden (3.29) is larger than would                       be calculated

from   (2.23), if discreteness were ignored.

       (b)       If tax revenues are returned uniformly in lump sum transfers,
equation (2.20) remains valid, but is no longer equivalent to (2.21),
corresponding             to the fact that the compensation no                longer returns each
consumer,        even approximately, to his initial utility level. Under this

regime, the fraction                      who paid the tax have their real incomes reduced,

while the others have them raised. In neither group are individuals moving

Comparing (3.31) with (2.25), we see again that, in the absence of income

effects on the choice probability, the excess burden is larger than that

computed by ignoring discreteness, though it is still smaller than in the

partial—equilibritr case (3.29).

       So in general, if the choice probability is independent of income but the

conditional demands have positive income elasticities, the usual approximation

procedure which ignores discreteness underestimates the compensating variation

and the excess burden of a price rise. There are two reinforcing tendencies

causing the result. First, the usual Slutsky correction results in an over-

estimate of the     magnitude     of the compensated price elasticity, and hence an

underestimate of the compensating variation. Second, the ameliorating effects

of tax—revenue redistribution on misallocation are less, because some of the

distributions are "wasted" on non—consumers of the good in question. We sus-

pect   that this result is a special           case of a more genera]. proposition that

standard    procedures tend to underestimate excess burden               (i.e.,   the compensat-
ing   variation   less tax    revenues) for groups of non—identical consumers.

        conclude this section by compiling, in Table 3.1, the results for
       We

i.e.,    the difference between terms in Table 3.1 multiplied by

tends to zero absolutely (though not as a proportion of excess burden) as ir

approaches zero.

        A   final issue concerns the conceptual experiment which lies behind the
results listed in the table. It is implicitly assumed that tax revenues are
returned to the population at large. To the extent that it is possible to

target the revenues            only to the consumers of the taxed discrete good, the
usual formulae would apply without modification. If some targeting occurs
but it is incomplete, the excess burden wonirl be somewhere between the "continuous"
and "discrete" calculations.




IV.    Quality Changes

       Thus far, our      focus has been the measurement         of   price—induced welfare
changes. Hever, in many discrete choice problems the evaluation of quality
changes is of primary        interest.     For example, we may wish to evaluate changes
in    frequency   of   bus services   in   contexts     where consumers have   a choice   between
bus and     auto; or changes in noise levels when individuals have the options of

staying     in the affected locale or of moving.
       One possibility      for dealing with a ality change is to convert it to an
equivalent price                and   then   to apply the technique discussed in Section
III. Unfortunately, this is possible only in the very special case in wIich all
consumers have constant and identical marginal rates of substitution between
the relevant quality variable and the numeraie • For example, thIs assumption
is often made in transportation studies, by assuming a single constant value of
time for everyone. Demand for a particular transportation service can then be
                                               — 26   —




viewed      as a function of money plus time price, and consumer surplus techniques
are applicable. However, this example illustrates the tenuousness of such an
assumption,        since both theoretical and       empirical considerations suggest that
value   of time depends upon a variety of factors such as the wage rate.

       An alternative tack is to extend the approach taken in Section III, by

adding a quality variable to the model. Suppose that good ].                 in the model   of

the previous section has associated with it a              quality variable described by

the scalar q1 ,           which is considered exogenous by consumers. (The variable
      could also be interpreted as the level of provision of a public good which

is complementary to good         1.)       Thus:


       u =                                                                              (4.1)
                u(x,x1,x2,q1)

where, as before, u is assumed to be finite when either x1 = 0                     or x2 =       0

We assume further that quality of good 1 does not matter unless good 1 is

being consumed:


                                = 0    .                                                 (2)
       As in Section III, the indirect utility function and the expenditure

function        are well—defined,   continuous, right— and left-differentiable        in all
arguments,        and satisfy

        u   =                                  .                                         (4,3)
                v(p1,p21g1,e(p1,p2,q1,U))

Two   alternative        formulations of the problem are      obtained   by implicitly differ-

entiating (4.3 with respect to q1 or p1 ,                    respectively,   keeping in mind

that    the right— and       left—derivatives      may differ at the crossover points.

        Taking     the   quality-derivatiVe of (4.3) yields


                   = — (l/XYav/q1      ,
                                                                                         (4.4)
                                            — 27 —



where    X   E v/3y               is the marginal utility of income. This intuitive
formula simply states that the marginal willingness-to-pay for a quality change
is given by the marginal utility of quality, converted to monetary units via
the marginal utility of income. For problems in which the indirect utility
function is explicitly specified, as in Section V below, equation (4.4) is
extremely     useful, particularly if it      is reasonable to approximate A (an
empirical     quantity, given the normalization implicit in the econometric pro-

cedure) by a constant. However, the constancy of
                                                                 is in no sense   necessary
 for (4.4) to be valid.

        Taking the price—derivative of (.4.3) on the other hand, and applying Roy' S

identity,     yields Shephard' s lemma,     which    was the starting point for deriving

Theorem 1 of Section ITI.          Thus, by simply adding q1 to the list of arguments

 of all the functions, Theorem 1 is seen to remain valid in the present context.

 This fact enables us to evaluate quality changes in terms of changes

 in consumer's surplus, along the lines explored by Bradford            and   Hildebrandt

 (1977] and Willig 11978) for continuous goods.


        To see this, assume, following Bradford and Hildebrandt, that when

the price of good 1 becomes high enough, the consumer does not care about

its quality, presumably because none of the good is being consumed. More

prec.sely, we assume that the quality derivative of the expenditure function

becomes arbitrarily small as the price of good ].           rises:

     lim                            = 0 .                                            (4.5)

Thus differentiating our previous result, (3.5), with respect to                   and

letting p +           yields   the following result:

V.    pp1Icatiofl to Econometric models


     jcadden J1973, 19763 has shown that a broad class of discxete choice

odels can be deriyed by assuming that each consumer maximizes a utility
                                                           for differences in tastes that
 function with a stochastic term accounting

 are wkobseryable     to the investigator! Since such models underlie the bulk of
                                           — 29    —




current   empirical    work on discrete choice, it is useful to examine the form
which the results of the previous two            sections   take when applied to stochastic

utility   models, in particular to                      logit models. As
                                         the popular probit and

noted above, these stochastic utility models can be viewed as special cases
of the basic deterministic model discussed in Section III.
       In our notation, the assumption behind al]. these models is that the
conditional indirect utility function of consumer i                for good   j   ,


is   additively separable into three components as follows;19



       v ,     ,y

where W() is a "universal" or "strict utility" function whose form is
identical for all consumers; and         where    E3 is     the realization for consumer

i    of a random variable           which is independent of the arguments of
                                                                                      W
The vector          contains observable characteristics of the consumer, and
attributes of the discrete goods (e.g., locational attributes) which may
vary   across consumers.
       By assuming a joint     probability distribution on         {c.)   we obtain the

probability, conditional on prices, quality levels, and observable consumer

characteristics, that utility is         maximized by choostng good 1;

          = Probjc.        <     —        for all j]                                  (5.2)

been ignored in the literature. The remaining terms have generally been des-
cribed as the "utility function" though it is clear from the inclusion of
price as an argument that they are part of an indirect utility function. A
true indirect utility function would have all prices as arguments and would
not depend on j ; hence the qualification 'conditiona1." See Small [1977)
for a fuller discussion of this point.

functions    W. ,   their   parameters (up to a normalization convention) can be

estimated from a sample of observed choices by maximizing the likelihood

function associated with (5.2).

      In order to forecast the aggregate demands, we need to measure the in-

comes y and other characteristics S1 of the individuals in the population

under consideration. One way to do this is to sample the population, and

assume that each sample member i is representative of a group of N1 indivi-

duals who are identical with respect to their incomes and measured characteristics.

The probability            calculated from (5.2) can therefore be interpreted as a

prediction of the fraction of this particular class of consumers who will choose

good 1; to compute expected aggregate demand from the class, we multiply by the

                         function,
                                N
conditional demand                   as in (3.20):

     X1(p11p2,q1,y1;S1) =                 .




Furthermore, applying Roy' s         Identity   for the conditional demand function
    in   (5.3) yields     an expression in terms of the marginal utility of income,



                              =—(N'/2)TW/3p1 .                                         (5.4)

dependence   on S , which        is assumed to be fixed.


      Having specified      functional forms for the components W of the indirect

utility function, and having implicitly normalized by choosing a specific joint

probability distribution function for the stochastic term c. ,                we are free to

make assumptions about W. on the basis of purely empirical considerations. We

now make three such assumptions, which are likely to be valid in many applications: a)

that the marginal utility of income, X ,               is   approximately independent of the

price and quality of good 1; (b) that the discrete goods are sufficiently unimportant

to the consumer so that income effects from quality changes are negligible, i.e.

that the compensated demand function in (4.6) is adequately approximated by the

Marshalliari demand function; and (C)           that W1/aq1 0 as p1 +            ,   a slightly

stronger version of (4.5). -Equation (4.6) can therefore be aggregated over members

 discrete choice models estimated from micro data, since it avoids the explicit

      1To    see this, recall that the previous results were based on Shepherd's.

lemma, obtained by differentiating (4.3) with respect to price. As mentioned

in Section IV, one may instead differentiate (4.3) with respect to quality,

leading to (4.4). The indirect utility v of (4.4) is equal to                     for

that fraction iT1 of the consmer group which chooses good 1, and is equal

to 2 for the rest. Since only                     depends on q1, aggregating (4.4) and

calculating                     from .(5.l) yields:
                     av1/3q1

                 =
                     N(rr1/X)3W1/q1 .
                                                                                    (5.6)
       aE/aq1


Equation      (5.6) is perfectly general, but one must use caution in integrating

it, since      the    income variable which appears as an argimient in all the functions

is compensated, i.e., is that value which maintains the original utility level.

With the      a.ssmmptions of constant 7.       and negligible income effects, however,

integrating  (56) yields (5.5) directly.
     A final point to notice about equation (5.5) is that jt applies equally
well to a price change, if      and W are defined as the values taken by

W1 at the initial and final            prices, respectively. This may be seen simply by
replacing       q1 by p1 in the above paragraph. Alternatively, the price—change

version of (5.5) can be derived directly by integrating (5.4)

       In the course of the econometric estimation of the choice model, specific

functional forms for the W'S are assumed, and estimates               of the coefficients
are   obtained. Hence, one can compute W1 at the initial and             final   quality

levels, arid can therefore compute the integral in (5.5). Furthermore, if

price is included as a variable in the specification, one has an estimate of

                Using this information along with the conditional demand                r
                                                                                            which

is often known,          2L    can be computed by using Roy's Identity.21 Equation (5.5)

therefore      represents an operational procedure for calculating welfare effects.

We illustrate its use below for the binary probit and logit models.



Probit

      In   the binary probit model it is assumed that Cc1 -                                       is a standard
normal yariate. The probabilities are therefore given by



           =   :1.
                         .1rl




where          is the cumulative normal distribution function. Formula (5.5) for

the   compensating yariati becomes;

                                                                             -                      -

 W1 and W2           ,      this quantity can be computed for any price                        or quality change.


      22 Thegeneralization to simultaneous changes in two pxice and two quality
 variables is straightforward, since the Jacobian condition rr1fBW2 = ir2/3W1                                         is
 satisfied. Equation (.5.5a) in footnote 20 thus becomes

Logit
       The ].ogit model arises from the assumption that the stochastic utility
components               are independently and identically distributed with the extreme
value or   double-exponential distribution [McFadden, 1973, 1976]. This leads

to a formula for the probabilities:


          =   exp(WL)
              2
                                                   9..   = 1,2   -                         (5.8)
              Z exp(W.)

In this case, the integral in (5.5)            can       be evaluated explicitly,   leading to:


        (E)/N = — (l/A)[ln        E exp(Wi]
                                              w                                            (5.9)

VI. Conclusion
       The analysis and estimation of discrete choice models is currently enjoy-
ing a popularity which is unlikely to abate in future years. Ultimately, both
researchers       arid   policy makers will be interested in ascertaining the welfare
implications of these models. The purpose of this paper has been to set forth

rigorous procedures for doing so. It has been shown how, under quite general

conditions as well as for the special cases of probit and logit analysis, the

usual techniques for measuring welfare effects must be modified for discrete

choice problems. Particular attention has been focused on how the standard

corrections for income effects might be altered. The results apply to the study

of both price and quality chan9es

     23Like the Probit model, the Logit model                        satisfies
                                                        the Jacobian symnetry
conditions, and calculation of C5.5a) for many price and quality changes yields
equation (.5.9) altered only in thgt the liits for evaluating the term in the
square brackets are the values W and W                           taken by the vector of all W at
initial and final points. The term in square brackets has been identified in
the transportation literature as the "inclusive price" or "composite cost" of an
alternative       composed of several sul,-alternatives IBefl'AkiVa, 1973; Willa.amS, 1977].

A.l Proof of Theorem 1 for different types of discreteness.
        1.    The good may be purchased only in discrete units which axe                    so

large       that most consumers choose only one or two units.

        The    utility function          is uCxx1)       where x > o ,           and   x can take on
values       of only unity    or   zero. Utility is maximized subject to the budget

constraint           + x1p1 = y      .    If x = 0        ,   the   optimal amount      of x is
trivially equal to y.               This sub-problem yields the expenditure function

conditional       on x    =               Cu)   .    Similarly,     if   x1 =   1, the conditional
expenditure function 1Cp1,u) is found trivially. As in the case analyzed
in the text, the point of maximum utility is associated with the minimum of
these       two expenditure functions:


                                                =
                                   eCp1,)

 Since e arid e1 are both continuously differentiable in price (with
                0 so is e ,          except at that price at which l =                     , and at

 this   point e is continuous and                   right— and left-differentiable. The rest

 of    the   argument follows directly that used in the text.


        2. Particular prices and inctes                  lead   to corner solutions at which a

 ciood is not     consumed at all.

        Since    wecannot now assume an interior solution, the expenditure

function conditional on x1 > 0                  may not be well defined. However, it is

not difficult to see that continuity and nonsatiability of u guarantees

that the expenditure function for the overall problem, e(p1,u) ,                           is
continuous everywhere and is difterentiable within each of the two regimes

      = 0    and x1 > 0   .    Hence is it right- and left—differentiable at every

point, and the argument in the text applies.

       3.    Goods may          be   purchased in discrete units because nonconcayities

in utility functions lead the consumer to choose among alternative corner

solutions.
      For cases in which discreteness arises frr noncoricavity of the utility

function, no general theory is                  available   for use in deriving properties of

the   resulting demand functions.. Indeed, so far as we know, no attempt has
yet   been made to          derive formally statistical discrete choice models for such
cases,      and   to   do so would be beyond the scope of this paper. Nevertheless,

it is not difficult to see that                  well-beha'red   examples can be treated within


the framework presented in the text. Suppose, for example, that in a three-

good world, all the indifference curves between x1 and x2 are concave to

the origin, but indifference curves between either x1 or x2 and the

numeraire are          convex.        Then at every price vector, consumption of either x1 or

      will be zero; hence the constraint x1x2 = 0                    can be added without changing

the problem. Furthermore, the assumptions guarantee that u(x0x2) and

u(x,x110), viewed as functions of two variables, are well—behaved. Thus the

proof of Section III applies.



 A.2 Proof of Theorem 1 for arbitrary numbers of gocds.

        1. More than one continuous good.

        The interpretation of                     as a vector of goods presents no problems

 provided that the discussion of the "standar case in Section II generalizes.

 That this is true is shown in Varian 11978, pp. 209—211).

         2. More than two discrete goods ,                  all mutually    exclusive.

by maximizing      u(x,O,...xk, ...,O)   subject    to x +             =y .     The         function
u is well—behaved when viewed as a function only          of
                                                                   x   and    Xk    ,       and   its
maximization leads to a (conditiDnal) continuously differentiable expenditure
function ek(pk,u) . The only difference between this case and that discussed
in the text is that there are now 2.. such sub-problems, rather than two. But
te idea is the same; utility maximization leads to the expenditure function
                   =         . Since each of the     is continuously differ-

argument in each of the pairs equal to zero. This leads to well—behaved

conditional expenditure functions, the minimum       of   which is associated with the

consumer's optimum. At each vector of "cross-over" prices, the minimum of

these functions is continuous and     right-    and left—differentiable in each price.

The rest of the argument follows as in the text.



                                    APPENDIX B


      In this Appendix we apply the results of Table 3.1 to the problem of

estimating the excess burden of the implicit subsidy for owner—occupied housing

in   the U.S. personal income tax. Our purpose is not to arrive at a definitive
                                           — 38 —



           of the efficiency loss associated with the provision.             Such a
estimate
calculation would necessarily involve           re cognition that the relevant income

and price elasticities vary across income classes, as does the size of the

implicit subsidy itself [Laidler, 1969]. Our goal is merely to take advantage

of some "stylized facts" concerning the demand for owner—occupied housing in

order to see how the excess burden varies under alternative assumptionS.
                                                              tax provisions. (For a more
     We begin by discussing briefly the relevant

complete exposition, the reader is referred to Laidler [1969].) Under the U.S.

income   tax, homeowners    are not required to include imputed rent in adjusted

        income. At     the same time, they are allowed to deduct payments for
gross

property taxes and mortgage interest.           Denote by d the proportion of housing

costs that are excluded from the tax base.                Then assuming a horizontal supply


curve    for owner—occupied housing services over the relevant range, the implicit

                                     to a fraction (1           td) of      supply price,
subsidy reduces their price

where T is the individual's marginal income tax rate. It is expected that
                                                                           the
 lowering the effective price of owner—occupied housing services increases
                                              who would own anyway, and also induces some
 demand for housing services by those
                                              distortions of choice lead to the excess
 renters to become homeowners. These

 burden which, we now seek to estimate.

 magnitudes are required to compute the excess burden Call stated in

 occupied housing; and r ,            the    (unconditional) income elasticity of demand.

        These parameters are computed using results reported in Rosen's [forth-

        study of the impact upon housing decisions of the personal income tax.
 cor'ting]


The econometric method upon which the results are based is a two—stage technique
discussed by Hec)cnan (1977]. In the first stage, a probitequation for the
tenure choice decision is estimated by maximum likelihood. From the probit

equation, it         is possible to calculate '        by evaluating the probit index at
the   mean values for price and income, and finding the associated probability
             25
of   owning.    The exercise is then repeated with an income value one percent

higher.      The implied valne of 'V          is 0.485. Similarly, the price elasticity
of the probability of homeownership is found               to   be -0.469.

       The second stae of the econometric procedure involves
                                                                             estimating the
demand   for   housing, conditional         upon owning. In     order to correct for potential

selectivity bias in the estiz'ats, a ve.r table based upo:'t the Mills ratio is added

to the set of regressors.           (See Hecicuan   11977] for details.) Using a specification


      25The computation assumes that the head of household is a white male
between 26 and 40 years old, and has one child under the age of 17.

which is second order in the logarithms of price and income, it is found that,
evaluated at the means, the conditional income                      and price   elasticities are 0.76

and —0.97, respectively.

      Recall, however, that e                 and       r are unconditional elasticities. It is

straightforward       to show that        a'-.   unconditinnal elasticity is just the sum of the
associated conditional elasticity arid probability elasticity. Thus,                          £ =   -1.44

and   r =   1.25

      4.    ii   ,   the probability of hcxneownership.
      The proportion of homeowners in the U.S. is about 0.64.

      5. 0 ,         the budget share of owner-.occupied housing.
      As Aaron       [1972) shows, the prrçortion of housing in the budgets of owner-
occupiers varies        considerably across income groups, but a value of about 0.25

reflects    the central tendency reasonably well. To find 0 ,                        the   overall budget

share for owner-occupied housing, we multiply 0.25 by the proportion of home-

owners, to find 0 =           0.16[   =    (.25)    (.64))

      With these figures in h.nd, we compute in Table B.1 the numerical counter-

parts to the fomulae in Table 3.1. The excess burden (in dollars per house-

hold per year) for any set of assumptions is found by multiplying the appropri-

ate number in the table by $51                    C =   .5   X 5500 X 0.64 x (0.17)2)

        The table   indicates that the "discrete"     computations do not differ

greatly from   their "continuous" ana1og.ies. (For          the partial equilibrium case

the difference is 4.2%, for the general equilibrium case it is 5.7%.) This

closeness is due to the fact that both w          ,   the   probability of owning, and

       the income elasticity of the choice probability, are relatively high for
owner—occupied housing. In situations where these parameters are closer to
zero, the differences will tend to be more substantial; on the other hand,
in situations in which the budget share e is lower than that for housing,
the   differences will tend to be   smaller. In this context it should           be noted

that figures   in the "continuous" column already are          "corrected"   for incane

effects. This correction (which is often ignored, but which is relatively

large in this case due to the size of the budget share) amounts to a 14%

difference in the magnitude of the estimated excess burden.
