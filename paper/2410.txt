                 Investment, Openness and Country Risk



                                 ABSTRACT


The  purpose of this study is to draw attention to the linkages between country
risk and the openness of an economy, and to demonstrate that in the long run
the openness of an economy is endogenously determined by the interaction
between endowments and policies. The presence of country risk poses a
problem for the smooth operation of international credit markets: the ex—ante
first best policy is for countries to pre-commit themselves to no-default
policies. Such a commitment, however, may not be credible because it may not
be the optimal ex—post policy. This suggests a special role for policies leading
towards investment in openness - as a way to increase the credibility of a no-
default commitment. The paper studies the optimal implementation of these
policies. Our analysis demonstrates that a rise in country risk is associated
with more frequent defaults and consequently with a lower level of
investment. The resultant drop in investment is larger in activities with
greater reliance on international trade. The presence of country risk is shown
to introduce a distortion, calling for financial policies in the form of a tax on
consumption borrowing and a different tax on investment borrowing. The
optimal investment borrowing tax balances two effects: the aggregate
 indebtedness and the openness effects. The stronger the openness effect, the
lower the optimal investment borrowing tax; and if this effect dominates, the
optimal policy is in the form of an investment subsidy. A final topic of our
analysis is a study of the nature of country risk in the presence of equity
finance. We demonstrate that swapping nominal debt with equities may have
useful consequences for reducing country risk, but it cannot eliminate the
fundamental problems associated with international credit.

     The evolution of external indebtedness during the 1970's and the

1980's has demonstrated the unique dimension of international banking in

the presence of country risk. The lack of simple enforcement mechanisms

for debt repayment tends to degenerate the international credit market

into an equilibrium where the volume of international credit is limited

by the effective penalties associated with defaults. These penalties

are the results of potential embargoes, being associated with

restrictions on the flow of both temporal and intertemporal trade (i.e.,

trade in goods and financial assets, respectively).

     We can gain further insight into this issue by noting that the

borrower's 'first best' policy (i.e., the policy that will maximize the

expected welfare of the borrowing nation) is to pre-commit itself to

no—default. This is because a default is associated with a net waste of

resources (resulting from the embargo) that is not captured by any party

and thus results in welfare losses. The problem with a no—default

commitment is that it is not a credible one, because it is time

inconsistent. The time consistent policy regarding the default decision

is based on a periodic cost—benefit assessment. Indeed, the existing

literature has focused on analyzing the properties of the time

consistent equilibrium. Typically, the default decision is arrived by

comparing the saving resulting from the default to the default penalty,

which is taken as exogenously given. 1/

          The purpose of the present paper is to focus on the role of
investment policies in the presence of country risk. The importance of

this      issue stems from the observation that a trade embargo has the
consequence of eliminating the gains from trade. Thus, a default
penalty      is tied directly to the openness of the economy. In the long

run the openness of an economy is endogenously determined by the

interaction      between the endowment and   investment policies. These

policies, in turn, may have important effects on the supply of credit

facing the economy. A focus of our analysis is to examine the linkages

between investment policies and country risk.

          As is common in the time consistency literature, there are welfare

benefits associated with a credible commitment that will allow the

attainment of the first best equilibrium. 1/ We can move towards such

an equilibrium by designing investment policies that will increase the

openness of the economy, thereby raising the costs of deviations from a

no—default commitment. 2/ In order to examine these policies we will

construct a simple two—periods      analysis of country risk. Borrowing in
period      one is used to finance consumption and investment in the various

activities. These activities differ in their exposure to international

trade, due to varying degrees of reliance on imported inputs or on

external markets for sales of output. The country will default in

period two if the default penalty falls short of the debt. The

and Prescott (1977).

as    installed capital is sector specific.

international   credit market is dominated by risk neutral lenders that

will supply sufficient credit to equate the expected yield on their

international lendings to the exogenously given risk free interest

rate. Domestic agents are small enough to be price takers in the

domestic credit market, thus allowing them to treat the interest rate

facing them as exogenously given. The default decision against external

creditors is made by a centralized decision maker, like the central

bank, whose policy is guided by an attempt to maximize the expected

welfare of a representative consumer. Thus, the source of country risk

is transfer risk. Agents are assumed to be rational and to be fully

informed regarding the default decision rule guiding the central bank.

We study the factors determining the supply of credit facing the

economy, the private sector consumption and investment, and the policies

needed to attain the optimal allocation.

     Our analysis demonstrates that the supply of credit is determined

by the aggregate borrowing and by its decomposition among consumption

and the various investment activities. The supply is upward sloping and

may include a backward bending portion. The investment in a given

sector is determined by the expected incidence of country default and by

the relative exposure of the sector to international trade. A rise in

country risk is associated with more frequent defaults and consequently

with a lower level of investment. The resultant drop in investment is

larger in activities with greater reliance on international trade.

    The importance of financial policies in the presence of country

risk stems from the observation that competitive equilibrium is

inefficient in the presence of international debt. The presence of
                                    —II—


country risk is shown to introduce a distortion. The distortion arises

from the fact that individual borrowers treat the rate of interest as

given even though from the perspective of the country as a whole the

rate of interest changes with the volume of borrowing and investment

because of the change in the probability of default. Each small

consumer overlooks the change in the probability of default induced by

his marginal borrowing and marginal investment. The change in the

probability of default creates an externality because of the consequent

change   in the expected default penalty inflicted on all domestic
consumers.
      The presence of country   risk calls f or financial policies. These

policies   are in the form of a tax on consumption borrowing and a
different tax on investment   borrowing. The tax internalizes   the effect
of   the activity financed by the borrowing on the probability of

default. The optimal tax should be higher the greater the increase in

the probability of default resultant from that activity. For example,

investment in intermediate goods that must be exported for final

assembly will tend to be associated with a lower optimal borrowing tax

relative to an investment in the production of final goods. Similarly,

investment in export substitutes or non—traded goods will tend to be

more taxed than investment in exportable goods. This outcome is

consistent with the notion that in the presence of country risk a

country will be able more easily to finance export led growth that is

biased towards the production of intermediate goods rather than final

goods, or inward growth biased towards import substitution.
                                   —5—

     Unlike the case of a consumption borrowing, the investment

borrowing affects the borrowing externality in two opposing directions.

First, the marginal borrowing raises the total indebtedness, thus

increasing the probability of default. Second, the investment in the

traded sector also raises the openness and the productive capacity of

the economy, thereby changing the default penalty and the probability of

default. The optimal investment borrowing tax balances these two

effects. The stronger the openness effect, the lower the optimal

investment borrowing tax; and if this effect dominates, the optimal

policy is in the form of an investment subsidy. Consequently, in the

presence of country risk the marginal use of funds plays a key role in

determining the appropriate policies.

     A final topic of our analysis is a study of the nature of country

risk in the presence of equity finance. We demonstrate that swapping

nominal debt with equities may have useful consequences for reducing

country risk, but it cannot eliminate the fundamental problems

associated with international credit. If the random shocks affect

output and the default penalty in the same way we obtain the strong

result that equity finance will eliminate defaults up to the credit

ceiling. This is done by correlating the repayments with the default

penalty. The debt—equity swap, however, is not able to eliminate the

resulting need to impose a ceiling on the available credit. Instead, it

may allow us to increase the credit ceiling. These results should be

viewed   as a special case of a more general economic environment: in the
presence of several shocks which affect output and the default    penalty
                                       —6—



in   different ways, the move to equity finance may be beneficial, but it

will not eliminate defaults.



                         II. The Credit Market Equilibrium

       Let us construct a simple framework for the analysis of country

risk and investment policy in the presence or default risk. This can be

done in a two—periods, multi-sectorial economy. Suppose that the value

added in sector i depends on three factors. First, on the realization

of a productivity shock. Second, it may be affected by the decision

regarding default. For example, if default raises the costs of imported

inputs it will tend to depress output. Third, the value added in sector

i depends positively on the capital stock, which in turn is determined

by past investment. We can summarize the value added in sector i at

time t by:


                                       n, Kit)   if no default occurs
       (1)          Y.
                      it   =

                               11;t'   d, Kit)   if default occurs




where 'P is the state of nature, reflecting a productivity shock

(    LI   a   w > 0). The second term stands for the default position of the

economy. It can have values of n and d, for default and no-default

position, and KIt is the stock of capital in sector i at time t. For

expositional simplicity we assume that the economy is a price taker in

the international market, and we normalize all prices of final goods to

unity. We also assume a common productivity shock for all sectors, and
                                      —7--


we   assume that the density function of the productivity shock (denoted
by   f('1O) is common knowledge. The GNP in our economy       is          the sum of the

value added in all activities, being given
              q
by Yt(W; s) =    Y.      s, K.     where s = n or d (no default or
                      1,         1,
              i=1
default, respectively) and there are q sectors. 1/

      We define the default penalty (denoted by ) as the drop in the

GNP resultant from the default:         =
                                            Y('!';   n) —     d).           Let us

assume that the default penalty is larger in goods states of nature

(i.e. B L I    B   'P > 0). 2/
      Aggregate indebtedness in the second period (t         2) is denoted by

B, and the interest rate on that indebtedness is r*.          Aggregate

borrowing is the result of consumption borrowing (denoted by B0) and

investment borrowing in sector i (denoted by I, where             1         i          q). For

simplicity of exposition we assume that all the investment in period one
                                                                                   q
is financed via external borrowing. In such a case B =                      +
                                                                      B0
                                                                                  i=1
and assuming no depreciation we obtain that K12 =
                                                            K11
                                                                      +    I.,.    3/

      The default decision in period two can be summarized by the f ollow—

ing simple rule: default if the penalty falls short of the payment due:

           no default if          B (1 + r*) (

           default    if          B (1 +   r*)   >



  1/ Note that the GNP      is a function also of the vector of capital
(Ki,t,... K2t,..., Kq,t). For notational simplicity this vector is
suppressed.
  2/ This assumption reflects the presumption that in goods states of
nature we expect greater volume of international trade, thereby raising
the default penalty.
  3/ To simplify we neglect the potential role of initial indebtedness
by assuming it to be zero. For an analysis regarding a partial default
decision in period zero due to initial indebtedness see Kru.man (1985).

          Let   us denote by 'Y0 the marginal value of the productivity shock

being associated with default (i.e., ''                         is   defined by the requirement

that B(1+ r*) =             A). Consequently, the probability of no default is the
probability that the productivity shock exceeds 'PQ.                           Let us denote this

probability by TI          . 1/        Assuming that the international banking sector

is   dominated      by risk neutral agents we can characterize the supply of

credit      by the combination of B and r* that solves:

          (2)    1+   rf   = (1   +    r*)   fi


where r is the exogenously                      given risk free interest       rate. 2/ We can
summarize the supply of credit facing the economy by curve SS in Figure
1. The supply schedule is upward sloping for intermediate levels of
credit. It may include also a backward bending portion, reflecting the
fact that a rise in the interest rate has two opposing effects on
expected returns -— for a given probability of no default it increases
the expected yield, but at the same time it reduces the probability of
payment, depressing the expected yield. If the second effect dominates,
we will operate on the backward bending portion of the supply

schedule. Direct application of (2) reveals that the elasticity of the

supply of credit Cd log (1 ÷                      r*)/    d log B) is determined by the

elasticity of the probability of no default with respect to the interest

rate,   denoted by —c (i.e., c = — d log 11/ d log (1 +   r*)).   It can be

shown that d log (1 +   r*)/   d log B =   c/Cl — c). 1/ The term c is a
measure of the segmentation of the domestic credit market from the

international market, being determined by the nature of the distribution

of the default penalty. A lower c is associated with greater capital

market integration, and c = 0 corresponds to the case where country

risk is absent. We restrict the economy to operate along the upward

sloping portion of the supply of credit schedule (where a rise in

indebtedness is associated with a rise in the interest rate). 2/

        We would like to use our framework to evaluate optimal policies in

the presence of country risk. We can accomplish this by comparing the

optimality conditions determining the consumption and investment from

the point of view of the consumer and the centralized planner. A

comparison between the planner's and the consumer's solutions reveals

that the two differ in that the planner applies the social interest

rate, whereas the consumer applies the private one (see the Appendix for

the derivations of these results). The social interest rate is defined

as the total   marginal interest   cost associated with the borrowing for

consumption and for investment in activity i, given by




  I' Thus, we operate on the upwards sloping portion of the supply of
credit as long as c < 1, and we reach the credit ceiling where c = 1.
for further details on the factors determining the supply of credit in
the presence of country risk see Aizenman (1986).
  2/ This assumption is consistent with welfare maximization: it can be
shown that an equilibrium on the backward bending portion of the supply
of credit schedule is inefficient. Ruling out such an equilibrium may
require policies in the form of optimal borrowing taxes (see Aizenman
(1986)).

                 + d log(i -i-r*)                              d log(i +r*))            = 1,...,

respectively. Note that the social planner may face different social

interest    rates for the various activities. The key difference between

the individual agent and the social planner is that the latter is

internalizing the marginal changes in the interest rate facing the

economy due to marginal borrowing. These changes in turn are determined

by the use of these funds, and are reflected in the second term in the

social interest rates. The percentage difference between the private

and the social interest rate equals the elasticity of the interest

rate (1 +       r*)   with respect to the borrowing. Logarithmic derivation of

(2) gives us that the elasticity with respect to consumption borrowing

is
       d log (1 +     r*)   =         > 0. This elasticity equals the elasticity

of the supply of credit                weighted by the relative importance of the

consumption borrowing to the entire volume of borrowing. Applying a

similar derivation we can infer that the elasticity with respect to
•
investment       borrowing is:
                                .   dlog(1+r*)         =

to the stock of capital in sector I (i.e.,                         A. =3 log 11/ 3 log K1). We

can view A. as a measure of the openness associated with the investment

in sector 1.          An investment project raising the openness will have the

consequence of increasing the probability of no default, thereby

raising A1.Consequently, the magnitude of Ai is a measure of the

importance of this effect. We will further investigate this

interpretation in Section III.

       The difference between the interest rate of the private consumer

and the social planner implies that in the absence of policies the
                                        — 11 —




presence of country risk implies a distortion. From the social point of
view the equilibrium is associated with "excessive" borrowing for

consumption because the private interest rate falls short of the social

one. This situation provides the rationale for policies. The

distortion arises frcn the fact that individual borrowers treat the rate

of Interest as given even though frcn             the   perspective of the country as

a whole the rate of interest rises with the volume of consumption

borrowing due to the rise in the probability of default. Each small

consumer overlooks the marginal rise in the probability of default

induced by his marginal borrowing. The rise in the probability of

default entails a negative externality because of the consequent rise in

the expected default penalty inflicted on all domestic consumers.

Therefore, the role of policies is to Internalize this externality. An

optimal consumption borrowing tax (denoted by                     is needed to yield

equality between the social and private Interest rates. This tax is

defined by the condition that 1+r0 = (1 +               r*)(1   + d log (1+r*))   where

      is the danestic interest rate defined by the borrowing tax (i.e.,

1 +
      rc=   1+ r* (1 +   p)).   Applying our previous results yields the

inefficient equilibrium on the backward bending portion of the supply of

     By following a similar approach we can determine that the optimal

borrowing tax for investment in sector i (denoted by p1) is

     Notice that unlike the case of a consumption borrowing, marginal

investment borrowing affects the borrowing externality in two opposing

directions. First, the marginal borrowing raises the total

indebtedness, thus Increasing the probability of default. This effect

is captured by the first term in (14), and is similar to the one reported

in (3)   for   consumption borrowing. Second, the investment in the traded

sector also raises the openness and          the     productive capacity of the

economy, thereby increasing the default penalty and reducing the

probability of default. This effect is captured in the second term, and

is proportional to the measure of the investment in openness, A1. The

optimal borrowing tax balances these two effects. The stronger the

investment effect, the lower the optimal investment borrowing tax.

     The optimal taxes have a simple diagrammatic interpretation in

terms of Figure 2. Let MC stand for the social marginal costs of

consumption borrowing. The consumption borrowing tax is defined by the

vertical distance between the supply SS and the marginal cost. Note

that the location of the supply schedule is determined by the vector of

the capital stock in the economy (denoted by it).               Borrowing for
                                                                +    +
investment purposes has the consequence of raising K to K', thereby
shifting     the supply arid the corresponding marginal cost schedules to

SS' and MC', respectively. The optimal investment borrowing tax is

defined by the vertical distance between SS' and the new marginal cost

schedule. 1/

      A relevant Implication of country risk is that the marginal use of

funds plays a key role in determining the appropriate policies because

the role of policies is to internalize the marginal contribution of the

activity to the probability of default. if one activity raises this

probability by more than another, borrowing f or that activity should be

taxed at a higher rate. This is the rationale for the differential

taxation of borrowing for consumption versus the various investment

projects. A possible consequence of our analysis is that investment in

openness should be treated favorably relative to investment that does

not affect openness or borrowing for consumption. For example,

investment in intermediate goods that must be exported for final

a3sembly   may be associated with a different contribution towards country
risk than   investment in the production of a final good. Consequently,

the   social interest rate   and the   corresponding   borrowing tax/subsidy

rates will differ across these activities. To derive this result more

formally we should impose further structure on our model. This is done

in the next section by specializing the model to deal with an economy

where a default results In a rise in the price of imported inputs, and




  1/ Note that if the investment financed by the borrowing is highly
effective in raising the default penalty, the shift to the right of the
relevant schedule may result in a policy of subsidizing that investment
relative to the Initial no policy equilibrium. This will correspond to
the case where the MC' schedule is to the right of the original SS.

where the various sectors differ in their dependency on importable

goods. 1/



                          III. Investment and Imported Inputs

        We would like to construct the simplest example to deal with

country risk with endogenous choice of openness. This can be done in a

two sectorial economy. The two sectors differ in terms of their

relianceon international trade .          For example, consider an economy

where output in sector i (denoted        by X1) is produced by the following

process:



        (5)          X. =     C. (K.) a (M.)i
                      1        1   1      1




where K and          are the capital and the imported inputs used in sector i,

and C is a constant. The only difference between the two sectors is

that they differ in their dependence on international trade. One of

them, suppose sector 1, is more dependent on international trade

(i.e.         < ).   Thus, we can refer to          as a measure of the "openness",

or the reliance on international trade of activity i. In the short run
the stock of capital is exogenously given. We denote the price of the
imported input by m' and we assume that    is determined by the policies


 1/ An example of such an economic environment may be the case of
Turkey in the 1970's, whereas a consequence of credit difficulties
Imports of energy were adversely affected. Our discussion should be
viewed as only one example f or modeling external dependency. While the
focus of the analysis here is on the inputs linkages, similar analysis
can apply for output linkages, where various sectors differ in the share
of exports.

of    the country. In the absence of default the country faces the

international price of m' assumed to be unity. A default will have the

consequence of triggering a penalty due to a trade embargo. A simple way

to capture the penalty is by assuming that it will raise the price of

imported inputs by a factor of p > 0, such that in states of default the

effective costs of importables facing the country is exp

       Producers in each sector maximize profits in two ways. In the

first period producers will choose the optimal investment which will

determine the capital stock in the second period. Within each period

the stock of capital is given, and producers will choose the imported

input M in order to maximize profits. As is shown in the Appendix, the

default penalty can be approximated by the sum of output in the various

sectors in states of no default weighted by a measure of the reliance on

trade (the 8. 's) times the increase in imported inputs prices, m•

Formally, the default penalty can be approximated for small values of

by:

       The reliance on international trade (as measured by the importance

of the imported input, 8) plays a key role in determining the relative

importance of sector I in the aggregate default penalty. A sector that

Is shielded from international trade would not play a role in the

determination of the aggregate default penalty. These observations play

a key role in determining the optimal tax on borrowing for investment In

sector    i. An investment in activity with a larger "openness" index

. will     cause a greater increase in the the default penalty, causing a

larger increase in the probability of no default. Thus, we expect

sectors with larger exposure to trade to be associated with a larger

elasticity of the probability of no default with respect to capital

(denoted by A1). Let us recall that this A1 was referred to as a measure

of the openness associated with investment in sector i. A larger A. was

shown to be associated with a smaller investment borrowing tax (see

(a)).    Applying      (6) we show in the Appendix that the value of

   equals s1ccz/(1 —       ), where   5j   is   a measure of sector i's share in

the aggregate penalty. This measure is proportional to the reliance on

imports,      3..   Consequently, we can derive the reduced form of the optimal

investment      borrowing tax for   activity i:




                                 !    (i-1)K1
                                                    ] (1   +




        The   optimal tax depends negatively on the openness of activity i to
international trade. A smaller openness is associated with smaller
values of s and ., implying           a higher investment borrowing tax. An

activity with no contribution to the default penalty (                    =s   =   0)

should be treated similarly to a borrowing for consumption. 1/




  1/ Note that (4') also implies that the condition for subsidizing
investment in sector i is that K/B < s a/Cl —                  ). Thus,
                                                           a higher
aggregate indebtedness as well as a higher reliance of activity i on
international trade will increase the likelihood of subsidizing
investment in sector i.

      A   default is associated with a penalty that results in a lower

productivity of capital. To gain further insight regarding the adverse

consequences of country risk on investment it is useful to consider a

special case. Suppose that investment is conducted by risk neutral

agents    who equate the expected cost of capital to the expected marginal
product, and let us   assume   that the logarithm of the productivity shock
is   normally distributed (log    ('i')      N (O,V)) with mean zero and a small

variance V. In the Appendix we demonstrate that in a competitive

equilibrium the stock of capital can be approximated by


                                                        1 —

                                                       1-     a


                       d   {18iPm(1ll)/(1i)]



where d is a constant. Equation (7) has a simple interpretation: the

stock of capital depends positively on the term in the bracket, which is

the ratio of expected net productivity (net of the default penalty)

over the expected cost of capital. 1/ The expected cost of credit is

the risk free interest rate, and this is the cost element in that

equation. Thus, as long as we operate below the credit ceiling,

country risk does not change the expected cost of borrowing (being equal

to   the risk free rate). Instead, country risk operates by reducing the

expected marginal product of capital, thereby reducing investment.

      It is noteworthy that the adverse consequences of country risk

affect the various sectors differentially. Investment drops more in the

sectors that are more heavily dependent on international trade.

Formally, one can show that a marginal increase in the probability of

default will reduce investment in sector I by a factor of 1 —              in

proportion   to the relative openness of sector 1. 1/



                      Ill.   Debt Versus Equity Finance

       Recently we have observed the emergence of schemes intended to swap

existing debt with equities. A typical loan in the 1970's and 1980's

has been in the form of a nominal interest rate contract, not allowing

for contingencies. It is hard to believe that such a contract is

optimal, and a purpose of the debt—equity swap is to overcome some of

the difficulties associated with loans with limited price contingencies

by replacing a non—contingent with a contingent contract. 2/ Indeed, it

is somewhat of a puzzle as to why the growing awareness of the welfare

benefits of contingencies has occurred only recently. 3/ We turn now to

  2/ One standard argument for debt contracts is the costs of
monitoring the behavior of the borrower and other informational costs.
This argument cannot, however, explain the lack of contingencies that
use public information which is exogenous to the borrowers (like the
price of oil and other commodities, the real interest rate in the U.S.,
the growth rate of industrialized nations, etc.).
  3/ One of the first attempts to use such contingencies was the
rescheduling plan between the IMF and Mexico in the summer of 1986, in
which the future supply of credit was made conditional on the price of
oil.

an application of our model, in which we analyze the nature of country

risk in the presence of equity finance. The present analysis will

demonstrate that swapping nominal debt with equities may have useful

consequences for reducing country risk, but it cannot eliminate the

fundamental problems associated with international credit.

       It   is useful     to start with the case of a one sector economy (q=l),

where   for notational simplicity we suppress the aectorial index.
Consider an initial equilibrium in our economy with an initial level of
indebtedness of B. A debt - equity swap will replace the debt B with
claims on an 'equivalent' fraction of the value added. We denote that
fraction by T.        A   default in the equity scheme will occur if its
benefits (in the form of no payments to foreign            investors)   exceed the
default     penalty. Thus, a default will occur if and only if

t(1—) X > XP, where the left-hand side stands for the foreign

equity income paid in case of no default, and the right—hand side stands

for    the default penalty. Consequently, the condition assuring no
default is that the foreign ownership share T           does   not exceed
   Pm/Cl —     ). This     condition is useful in yielding the maximum equity

investment in period one, which is determined by the expected net

present value of the foreign equity income extracted for
                                                               C(K)a -
   =
        m"      -   ) which    can be approximated by

This    defines the equivalent of a 'credit ceiling' for the case of equity

investment. It is given by a portion m'(t'f) of the expected

output. It can be shown that a useful property of the equity scheme is

that it increases the correlation between the income of foreign

Investors and the default penalty, thereby reducing the inoidence of
                                        — 20 —



default.      In our example, for equity investment below the ceiling

defined above we obtain no default because the equity scheme leads to a

unitary correlation between the default penalty and       the   income to

foreign owners. It can be also shown that the switch from debt to

equity finance has the consequence of increasing the credit ceiling

facing the economy. Furthermore, as long as the foreign investment is

below the ceiling, an equity scheme will increase the optimal

investment. 1/

        Our   discussion   should be viewed only as an example for the benefits

of the debt—equity swap. Because we allow the random shock to affect

output and the default penalty in the same way we obtain the strong

result that equity finance will eliminate defaults up to the credit

ceiling. This is done by correlating the repayments with the default

penalty. The debt—equity swap, however, is not able to eliminate the

impact of country risk and the resulting need to impose a ceiling on the

available credit. Instead, it allows us to increase the credit

ceiling. It is noteworthy that in the presence of several shocks which

affect output and the default penalty in different ways, the move to

equity finance will not eliminate incidences of default but it may be

beneficial to the degree that it increases the correlation between the

default penalty and the repayment. It can be shown that the general

optimal contract in the presence of country risk is not an equity

finance but rather a loan contract that optimally indexes the repayment



  1/    Formally,   the optimal capital stock with equity investment is
given by equation (7), for the case where we replace m with 0 (assuming
that we operate below the credit ceiling).

to   the default penalty, and the credit ceiling subject to such a

contract is the expected net present value of the penalty (discounted at

the risk free interest rate). 1/



                          V.   Concluding Remarks

      The purpose of this study is to draw attention to the linkages

between country risk and the openness of an economy, and to demonstrate

that in the long run the openness of an economy is endogenously

determined by the interaction between endowments and policies. The

presence of country risk poses a problem f or the smooth operation of

international credit markets: the ex—ante first best policy is for

countries to pre—commit themselves to no—default policies. Such a

commitment, however, may not be credible because it may not be the

optimal ex—post policy. This suggests a special role for policies

leading towards investment in openness — as a way to increase the

credibility of a no—default commitment.

country risk and equity finance see Aizenman (1987).

     The purpose of the Appendix is to summarize the derivation of the

results reported in the paper. We start by formulating the problem as a

welfare maximization of the representative agent and the central bank.

We then derive the optimal credit market and investment policies.

     Suppose that the utility of the representative agent is given by

(to simplify notation we suppress the consumer index):

                       u(C1)


where 5 stands for the subjective rate of time preference and C. is the

consumption of traded goods at time t (t = 1, 2). We allow for

domestic policies in the form of a borrowing tax and lump—sum

transfers. The domestic interest rate for consumption borrowing, r, is

defined by



     (A2)       r =    r*   (1 +   p)

     (A3)       r1 =   r*   (1 +   p)

where r* is the interest rate facing the country and PC is the domestic

tax on consumption borrowing. Similarly, r1 is the interest rate for

investment borrowing in sector i, defined by p. The budget constraints

facing the representative agent are

where subscripts n and d correspond to the cases of no default and

later).     The aggregate investment borrowing and consumption borrowing

borrowers. Equations (A5) and (A6) are the budget constraints                   f or


period    two for the cases of        no default and default, respectively.
Domestic agents are assumed to be small enough to be price takers in the
domestic credit market. Each faces a given interest rate.

     The agent's problem is to allocate consumption and investment so as

tomaximize his expected utility subject to the budget constraint. Let
V denote the value of the expected utility of a representative
consumer. It follows that

The agent chooses investment I and indebtedness B so as to maximize his

expected utility, (A7). Because each agent is a price taker in the

credit market,         is viewed by the consumer as given. Solving the

optimal consumption and investment plan for a representative agent

yields the following first—order conditions:

benefit of increasing the investment by borrowing equals the cost

associated with repayment.

     To gain insight into the potential role of optimal policies let us

evaluate the solution of the optimal consumption path by a centralized

decision maker. Potential deviations between the planner's and the

consumer's solutions will justify policies to support optimality. These

policies will be shown to be in the form of optimal borrowing taxes. We

assume   that the lump-sum transfer R is used to rebate to consumers the
proceeds generated by the borrowing taxes. 1/ The planner's problem is
to choose consumption borrowing (Be) and investment borrowing              that
will maximize the welfare of the representative consumer. A key
difference    between the consumer's and the planner's problems is that the

centralized planner is not a price taker in the credit market, and he is

aware that the choice of borrowing will have an impact on the interest

rate via the supply of credit. Consequently, (AT) implies that the

condition for optimal borrowing and investment from the planner's

perspective is
                                                           d log (1 +
             a.    MTJ(C1) =   tS E{MU(C2)N.D.}(1+ r*)(1 ÷              r*))

  1/ Note that this implies that the lump—sum transfer to the consumer
              q
is r*[p0Bc +    pI1]. Consequently, the budget constraint that is

relevant for the policy maker in the absence of default is

      (A5)        C2
                        =         —

for i =   1,    ..,   q.
      A comparison between the planner's and the consumer's solutions

reveals that the two differ in that the planner applies the social

interest rate, whereas the consumer applies the private one. The social

interest rate is defined as the total marginal interest cost associated

with the borrowing for consumption and f or investment activities, given

by:
                                                                               d log (1÷r*))
       (A9)            (1 +   r*)(1   + d log (1+r*)) and (1 +     r*)(1   +




respectively. Note that the social planner face different social

interest rates f or the various activities. The key difference between

the individual agent and the social planner is that the latter is

internalizing the marginal changes in the interest rate facing the

economy due to marginal borrowing. These changes in turn are determined

by the use of these funds, and are reflected in the second term in the

social interest rates. The percentage difference between the private

and the social interest rates equals the elasticity of the interest

rate (1 +      r*)    with respect to the borrowing, which in turn define the

optimal taxes, as reported in (3) —                ('I).
      We turn now          to an overview of the derivation of the equations
reported in      Section III. Short—run profit maximization with respect to

the   use of importable M yields the following value for output

the value added is             =    (1 —          .)X.,       and (All) implies that the drop in

value added in sector i resulting from the default is
