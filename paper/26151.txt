Reducing Frictions in College Admissions: Evidence from the Common Application

NBER Working Paper No. 26151
August 2019
JEL No. H0,I23

                                          ABSTRACT

College admissions in the U.S. is decentralized, with students applying separately to each school.
This creates frictions in the college admissions process and, if substantial, might ultimately limit
student choice. In this paper, we study the introduction of the Common Application (CA)
platform, under which students submit a single application to all member schools, potentially
reducing frictions and increasing student choice. We first document that joining the CA increases
the number of applications received by schools, consistent with reduced frictions. Joining the CA
also reduces the yield on accepted students, consistent with increased student choice, and
institutions respond to the reduced yield by admitting more students. In line with these findings,
we document that the CA has accelerated geographic integration: upon joining, schools attract
more foreign students and more out-of-state students, especially from other states with significant
CA membership, consistent with network effects. Finally, we find some evidence that joining the
CA increases freshmen SAT scores. If so, and given that CA members tend to be more selective
institutions, the CA has contributed to stratification, the widening gap between more selective and
less selective schools.

1    Introduction

College admissions in the U.S. is decentralized. After students choose the set of schools to which to
apply, schools then decide whether or not to make admissions offers to these applicants. Students
then select from their choice set, the institutions to which they were offered admissions. Histor-
ically, students have completed separate applications for each school, entailing substantial time
costs, or frictions. These frictions are in addition to the substantial information frictions facing
students as a result of decentralized college admissions.
    These frictions in college admissions may limit student applications and ultimately reduce
student choice. Since students tend to apply to colleges close to home, these frictions may also
lead to a less integrated market from a geographic perspective. By reducing frictions, students
might apply more nationally and ultimately attend a school further from home. At the same time,
substantial frictions, by reducing student choice sets, might also lead to less sorting across schools
according to ability, with schools less stratified than under a more centralized college admissions
process. By reducing frictions, high ability students might be disproportionately induced to apply
to selective out of state colleges, leading to more stratification.
    In this paper, we investigate these issues in the context of the Common Application (CA), a
platform allowing students to complete one application for all member institutions. The CA, by
allowing students to submit a single application to multiple institutions, may significantly reduce
frictions. By providing a centralized information portal, the CA might also reduce information
frictions. Given these reductions in frictions, the CA might increase student choice, in turn lead-
ing to increased geographic integration but also increased stratification according to ability across
institutions.
    Given this motivation, we ask a series of research questions in this paper. Has the CA re-
duced frictions, resulting in more college applications at member institutions and increased student
choice? Has the CA led to a more geographically integrated market, with more students attend-
ing CA institutions far from home? If so, by increasing student choice and integrating the market
geographically, has the CA contributed to stratification, a widening of the selectivity gap between

                                                   2
more selective and less selective institutions?
   We first present a simple model of the college admissions process that includes student appli-
cation decisions, university admissions offers, and student acceptances of these offers. We then
consider the impact of the CA, modeled as a reduction in the costs of applying to a second CA
school. The model predicts that joining the CA leads to an increase in applications due to a re-
duction in frictions. Likewise, schools joining the CA experience a reduction in their yield and
admit more applicants in order to meet their capacity. Thus, the CA increases student choice. The
CA also contributes towards geographic integration, with an increase in out-of-state students from
other states with CA institutions. Finally, the introduction of the CA increases stratification, with
high ability students disproportionately sorting into CA schools.
   We then test these predictions using panel data from the College Board (1990 to 2015). We
estimate two-way fixed effects models, comparing outcomes for schools before and after joining
the CA, and also provide event studies, investigating the timing of any effects associated with entry
into the CA. We find that the CA increases applications, consistent with a reduction in frictions,
and reduces yield, consistent with enhanced student choice. Schools respond to this reduced yield
by admitting more students. We also find that the CA has accelerated geographic integration.
In particular, there is strong evidence that entry into the CA is associated with an increase in
the fraction of out-of-state students, especially from other states with significant CA penetration,
consistent with network effects. Finally, we provide some evidence that entry into the CA is
associated with an increase in SAT scores. Given that CA entry has been more common among
selective institutions, the CA may have contributed towards increased stratification, a widening of
the gap between more selective and less selective institutions.
   The paper proceeds as follows. Following the discussion of the relevant academic literature, we
offer more details on the CA. This is followed by the presentation of the theoretical model of the
college admissions process. We then describe the data, empirical approach, and our key empirical
results. The final section concludes.

2    Related Literature

This paper is related to a literature on frictions in college admissions and interventions designed
to reduce such frictions. Hoxby and Avery [2013] document substantial information frictions in
the US, with many low-income but high-ability students not applying to selective colleges, despite
generous financial aid at these institutions. In a randomized control trial, Hoxby and Turner [2014]
and Hoxby and Turner [2015] provide these high-ability but low-income students with information
about college admissions and financial aid. This intervention increased applications to, and ulti-
mately attendance at, selective institutions. In the context of financial aid policy, Bettinger et al.
[2012] show that assistance filling out the FAFSA, a complex financial aid application, increases
aid receipt, college attendance, and persistence. Bird et al. [2017] conduct a field experiment using
the CA platform and document that providing information about financial aid increases college
attendance and especially so for first-generation college students.
    Another literature has examined how college admissions, and in particular the recent increase in
the number of applications per student, has changed both university behavior and student behavior.
Bound et al. [2009] document increases over time in the number of students applying to college,
increases over time in applications per student, and reductions in acceptance rates at selective
institutions. Blair and Smetters [2019] investigate why colleges, especially elite ones, haven't
responded to this increase in applications by expanding capacity. They argue that colleges compete
on prestige, providing incentives for each institution to reduce admissions rates. Avery and Levin
[2010] document that early applicants are more likely to be admitted, when compared to the regular
applicant pool and argue that this finding is consistent with an early application serving as a signal
of student enthusiasm for attending the institution. Avery et al. [2013] argue that standard methods
of ranking colleges, such as the U.S. News and World Report, provide incentives for institutions to
manipulate admissions decisions to reduce acceptance rates and to increase yield, the fraction of
admitted students who accept their offers.
    This paper is also related to a literature on geographic integration in higher education. His-
torically, the US market for higher education was highly localized, with most students attending

                                                  4
universities close to their residence.1 In 1949, over 90 percent of students attended in-state uni-
versities [Hoxby, 2000]. During the subsequent decades, the market for higher education became
more national, leading to both higher tuition and greater student sorting [Hoxby, 1997, 2000, 2009].
Despite this shift, the US market may still be considered local in nature, with roughly 80 percent of
first-time students enrolled in a college in their home state.2 Knight and Schiff [2019] and Cohodes
and Goodman [2014] argue that financial incentives, in the form of in-state tuition discounts and fi-
nancial aid for in-state institutions, have contributed to this high rate of attendance at in-state public
institutions. New technologies, such as the CA, may disrupt these patterns. Deming, Lovenheim,
and Patterson [2016], for example, argue that less-selective colleges are particularly localized and
study the effects of competition from online degree programs in these markets, finding that online
competition reduces enrollment at private non-selective institutions.
    More specifically on the effects of the CA, Smith [2013] studies the effect of the number of
applications on enrollment probabilities, using variation induced by the CA, finding that increasing
the number of applications significantly increases enrollment probabilities. Smith et al. [2015]
analyze various features of the application process, finding some evidence that the CA increases
applications.3 Perhaps the paper most closely related to this one is Liu et al. [2007], who use panel
data from the College Board to study how CA membership affects admissions outcomes as well
as the composition of enrollees. While their paper has a stronger focus on student characteristics,
such as race and SAT scores, we are more interested in the role the CA has played in terms of
student choice, geographic integration, and stratification.
   1 Outside  of the US, Gibbons and Vignoles [2012] study student college decisions in England and find that condi-
tional on going to college, distance is the most important factor in explaining choice of college.

3     Background

The CA began with just 15 colleges in 1975 but grew rapidly thereafter, with increases in member-
ship in every year since 1975 and a significant acceleration of membership starting around 2000
(Figure 1). It currently includes over 700 institutions, which, taken together, receive approximately
4 million applications from 1 million students annually.4

    The CA was founded by a small set of liberal arts colleges but has since expanded to a wide
range of public and private institutions, especially more selective institutions. In particular, as
shown in Figure 2, membership among the top 50 liberal arts colleges was already very high, over
80 percent, in 1990, the beginning of our analysis, and was universal in this group by the late 1990s.
During our sample period, membership among top 50 private institutions increased rapidly, from
under 40 percent in 1990 to roughly 90 percent by 2016. Membership among less selective liberal
arts colleges and other private institutions also increased during our sample period but remained
below 50 percent by 2016. The CA was originally closed to public institutions but that ban was
lifted in 2002, leading to a rapid increase in membership among the top 50 public institutions. Less
selective public institutions, by contrast, joined at a slower rate, with membership still below 20
percent by the end of our sample period.

   In addition to this rapid entry overall, the CA has also become more diverse from a geographic
perspective. That is, the CA started in the Northeast but is now accepted by colleges in many
different states. In particular, Figure 3 plots the locations of CA members in 1986 and 2014,
documenting a significantly wider geographic distribution in the latter year, with significant new
penetration in states such as California, Oregon, Colorado, Indiana, and Florida. Given this sub-
stantial adoption over time and a diverse set of members at current, it is natural that the CA may
have led to significant changes in college admissions.

4                Theoretical Model

Our model of college admissions has three distinct stages. First, students decide which colleges
to apply to. Second, colleges make admissions offers. Finally, given these offers, students decide
which college to attend. In the context of this model, we consider the CA, which reduces the costs
of applying to a second CA institution.


4.1                    Setup

There are two colleges: c = 1 and c = 2. Students receive a payoff Vc = Uc + c from attending
college c. The first term Uc is known prior to applying and may include residency status, reflecting
a preference for in-state colleges.5 The second term, which we assume is distributed type-1 extreme
value, is revealed after applying but before choosing a college. Not attending college is also an
option, with a payoff normalized to zero. There are two types of students, each representing one-
half of the population. The first type prefers college 1 over college 2, the second prefers college
2 over college 1, and we assume symmetry in the expected utility gains from attending the first
choice college.6 When applying, students pay an application fee of F to the first college and a
           5 This         could be due to either a preference for proximity or lower in-state tuition at public institutions
           6 That         is, U1 - U2 =  > 0 for the first type and U2 - U1 =  > 0 for the second type.



                                                                                                                                                                           8
potentially lower fee ( f  F ) when applying to a second college. The CA can be interpreted as a
reduction in f since the application developed for the first choice college can also be used for the
second college.
    On the supply side, colleges have a fixed capacity and can serve a fraction 0 <  < 1 of first-
choice students; thus, 2 represents overall capacity across the two institutions. These capacities,
along with student applications, determine admissions rates Qc .


4.2     Equilibrium

In the third stage, following student application decisions and university admissions offers, there
are four possible student choice sets: choosing between both colleges, college 1 or 2 only, or
only the outside option. The value of being accepted to both colleges equals C12 = ln[exp(U1 ) +
exp(U2 ) + 1].7 Likewise, we denote Y12 = exp(U1 )/[1 + exp(U1 ) + exp(U2 )] as the yield for the
first-choice college and y12 as the yield for the second-choice college for students accepted to
both. The value of being accepted to only the first choice equals C1 = ln[exp(U1 ) + 1], and the
corresponding yield is Y1 = exp(U1 )/[1 + exp(U1 )]. Similar expressions apply to the value of
being accepted to only the second choice (C2 ) and the corresponding yield is denoted by Y2 , with
Y1 > Y2 .
    In the second stage, taking yield as given, schools set their admission rates in order to satisfy
capacity. We focus on an equilibrium in which all students apply to their first choice and a fraction
b of students also apply to their second-choice college. Then, admissions rates for college 1 equate
the number of student acceptances of university admissions offers to university capacity:


               Q1 [(1 - b)Y1 + bQ2Y12 + b(1 - Q2 )Y1 ] + Q1 b [Q2 y12 + (1 - Q2 )Y2 ] =                      (1)
                           yield on first-choice students       yield on second-choice students

Among first-choice students, a fraction 1 - b apply to only their first choice, with yield of Y1 , and
a fraction b also apply to their second choice. In the latter case, a fraction Q2 are also admitted to
   7 This follow the standard formula for consumer surplus in a logit model. Similar derivations apply for type 2
students, given the symmetry of the model.


                                                            9
their second choice, with yield of Y12 , and a fraction 1 - Q2 are denied admission to their second
choice, with yield for college 1 thus equal to Y1 . The second term represents yield on second-
choice students, with a fraction b applying to both colleges. Among these, a fraction Q2 are also
admitted to their first choice and yield thus equals y12 . The remaining fraction (1 - Q2 ) are not
admitted to their first choice and yield on these students equals Y2 .
    Then, working backwards to the first stage, applying to both colleges yields a value of A12 =
Q1 Q2C12 + Q1 (1 - Q2 )C1 + (1 - Q1 )Q2C2 - F - f for type 1 students. That is, students are ac-
cepted to both colleges with probability Q1 Q2 , college 1 only with probability Q1 (1 - Q2 ), college
2 only with probability (1 - Q1 )Q2 and face application costs of F + f . For type 1 students ap-
plying to only college 1, the value equals A1 = Q1C1 - F . In equilibrium, the fraction of students
applying to both colleges increases until the benefits from a second application equal the costs of
a second application (A12 - A1 = f ). This can be written as:


                                      Q1 Q2 (C12 - C1 ) + (1 - Q1 )Q2C2 = f                                               (2)
                                          option-value            safety-value


The option value from a second application represents the benefit of being able to attend college
2 when the student has been accepted to both colleges, which occurs with probability Q1 Q2 . This
captures the idea that students may learn that college 2 is actually preferred to college 1 throughout
the admissions process, following the realization of 1 and 2 . The safety value from a second
application represents the benefit of being able to choose college 2 if not admitted to college 1, and
this event occurs with probability (1 - Q1 )Q2 .
    In a symmetric equilibrium, equations 1 and 2 represent two equations with two unknowns:
the fraction of students applying to both colleges (b) and the university admissions rate (Q). For
simplicity, we assume here a solution that is unique and interior in both b and Q, and the Appendix
details the associated assumptions.8 We provide a graphical interpretation of this equilibrium in
Figure 1 and provide closed form solutions for b and Q in the Appendix. The student indifference
   8 These require that application costs are small, relative to the benefits of a larger choice set and that college capacity

is neither too small nor too large

constraint is the admissions rate at which students are indifferent between applying to only one col-
lege and applying to both colleges, as determined by equation 2. The college feasibility constraint
is determined by equation 1 and requires, given capacity, a reduction in admissions rates given
an increase in the number of applications received. As shown, the initial equilibrium, in admis-
sions rate Q and applications rate b , occurs at the intersection between the student indifference
condition and the college feasibility constraint.

4.3    Effect of the Common Application

We next consider a comparative static based upon a reduction in the cost of applying to a second
college.
   Proposition: Consider the introduction of the Common Application, with a marginal re-
duction in f from f=F. There are four effects: 1) application activity (b) increases, 2) colleges
become more selective (a reduction in Q), 3) yield falls and, despite increasing selectivity,


                                                    11
universities accept a larger number of applications, 4) students are more likely to attend
out-of-state institutions.
    We provide graphical interpretation of these results in the context of Figure 4 and refer readers
to the Appendix for a Proof. As shown, given a reduction in F , students are no longer indifferent
between applying to one institution and applying to both institutions at the initial admissions rate.9
Given this, admissions rates fall from Q to Q in order to restore student indifference, and the
fraction of students applying to both colleges increases accordingly, from b to b . Despite the
reduction in admissions rates, universities make more admissions offers in total. This results from
the reduction in yield on admitted students, who tend to have larger choice sets. Finally, inter-
preting first-choice colleges as in-state and second-choice colleges as out-of-state, the CA leads to
geographic integration, resulting from more students applying to out-of-state institutions.


4.4       Extensions

We consider two extensions of the model, with details in the Appendix. The first has three colleges,
two in the CA and one outside of the CA, allowing for consideration of network effects. Relative
to a baseline without the CA, the introduction of the CA (with colleges 1 and 2 as members) leads
to an increase in students applying to both colleges 1 and 2 but a reduction in second application
activity for students whose ex-ante first choice is college 3, which is outside of the CA. Given
this, there are more students from state 1 attending college 2 and, likewise, more students from
state 2 attending college 1. Correspondingly, there is a reduction in students from state 3 attending
colleges 1 or 2. Thus, the CA leads to network effects, with more migration by students between
states connected by the CA.
    The second extension also has three colleges, two in the CA and one outside of the CA, but also
considers heterogeneous students: low-ability and high-ability. Colleges want to attract as many
high-ability students as possible and admit them with probability one. Low-ability students are then
   9 Inthe absence of any adjustment in admissions rates (Q), the CA in fact drives student application behavior to a
corner solution, with all students applying to both colleges.




                                                         12
admitted at an endogenous admissions rate to fill remaining capacity. In equilibrium, high ability
students disproportionately attend CA schools and low-ability students disproportionately attend
schools outside of the CA, resulting from increased application activity among high ability students
at CA schools.10 Thus, the CA increases stratification, with high ability students disproportionately
attending CA schools.


4.5      Summary

The introduction of the CA increases applications and reduces admissions rates. Likewise, the CA
reduces yield and increases the number of admitted students. There is an increase in out-of-state
attendance, especially from other CA states. Finally, the CA leads to stratification, with high ability
students disproportionately attending CA institutions.



5       Empirical Analysis

To test the model predictions, we next consider how admissions outcomes change when an institu-
tion joins the CA. We first describe the data and our empirical approach. We then present the key
empirical results.


5.1      Data

Our analysis uses two sources of data on universities, the College Board's Annual Survey of Col-
leges and the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), combined with the year
in which each university became a member of the CA.11 We use the College Board data for most
of our analysis because it covers a longer time span (1990-2016) than similar data from the IPEDS.
However, the IPEDS data has information on state-to-state student migration conducted biennially
from 1986 to 2014, and we use these data to study network effects.
    10 Although there is no safety value motivation, given that these high ability students are admitted to their first choice

with certainty, there remains an option value from additional applications.
  11 The entry year for CA members was provided to us by The Common Application organization.




                                                              13
5.2    Specifications

We use two estimating equations in most of our analysis: a two-way fixed effects specification
(TWFE) and an event study specification. The TWFE model relates an outcome yct (e.g., applica-
tions) to an indicator for CA membership in year t (CAt ) as follows:


                                      ln(yct ) =  CAct + µc + µt + ct                             (3)


where c indexes colleges, µc is a college fixed effect, and µt is a year fixed effect. Then, given the
log specification, the parameter  captures the percent change in outcomes when joining the CA,
after controlling for time effects and university effects.
   Our event study specification is designed to measure the timing of any effects of entry and is
given by:

                           k=-1                          k=K
              ln(yct ) =          t +k 1(t - Jc = k) +    t +k 1(t - Jc = k) +µc + µt + ct        (4)
                           k=-K                          k=0
                                    pre-entry                  post-entry


where Jc is the year college c joined the Common App and 1(t - Jc = k) indicates that college c
joined the CA k years ago (or will join in the future when k is negative). We normalize t -1 to
zero and hence the key parameter t +k captures the effect of joining the CA at time t on outcomes
at time t + k, relative to outcomes at time t - 1.
   In addition, we present structural break analyses in the Appendix. These analyses allow for a
more formal determination of whether breaks in outcomes occur during the year of CA entry or in
other years surrounding CA entry. That is, we estimate our TWFE model but shift the join year
into the past and into the future. We report F-statistics from the test based upon the null hypothesis
that  = 0.




                                                     14
5.3       Applications and Yield

We begin our investigation of the effect of joining the CA by estimating equation 3 using the
College Board data.12 As shown in the first column of Table 1, applications are 12 percent higher
after a college joins the CA, relative to the period before they joined the CA. This economically
and statistically significant result is consistent with the CA reducing frictions in college admissions
via a reduction in application costs.
    To investigate the role of pre-trends and to consider any dynamic effects of joining the CA,
we next present results from the corresponding event study specification.13 As shown in Figure 5,
which includes 95 percent confidence intervals, there is a slight downward trend in applications
just before a school joins the CA. After joining the CA, by contrast, there is a discontinuous 10
percent increase in the number of applications received. Moreover, the effect grows over time,
rising to roughly 25 percent after one decade in the CA. There are at least two possible reasons
why the effects might increase over time. First, the effect could be increasing over time due to the
design of the platform, with, for example, the internet playing a large role in the success of the
CA today, relative to the early days of the CA, when applications were still submitted on paper.
Second, there could be network effects, with larger effects associated with joining the CA as the
number of other CA members increases over time.14
    Finally, as shown in Figure 19 in the Appendix, the structural break analysis documents that
a break in applications in the join year, or in the years just following, best fits the data. This
somewhat delayed response in the break could reflect the increasing effectiveness of the CA, as
documented in Figure 5. There is no evidence that the break occurs prior to the join date.
  12 Standard  errors are clustered at the institution level.
  13 As noted above, we normalize the coefficient one year before joining to zero (t -1 = 0).
   14 We later investigate network effects more formally via an examination of CA penetration in the source state of

students enrolling in CA institutions.

   We next investigate whether entry into the CA has led to a decrease in yield, defined as the
fraction of admissions offers accepted by students. As shown in column 2 of Table 1, there is a 9
percent reduction in yield after a college joins the CA, relative to the period before they joined the
CA, and this effect is statistically significant at conventional levels. In the context of our model, this
finding is consistent with the CA increasing student choice via a reduction in frictions associated
with submitting college applications.
   In order to examine pre-trends and any dynamic effects of joining the CA, we next consider the
event study specification for yield. As shown in Figure 6, there is an immediate and discontinuous

                                                                                                                 16
drop in yield after a college joins the CA, and this effect again becomes more pronounced over
time. This dynamic could again be driven by either the CA becoming more powerful over time or
by network effects associated with a increase in the number of CA members. Finally, as shown in
Figure 20 in the Appendix, the structural break analysis documents that a break in yield in the join
year, or in the following year, best fits the data. There is again no evidence that the break occurs
prior to the join date.

    Given this reduction in yield, colleges might need to increase the number of admitted students
in order to satisfy their capacity, as discussed in the theoretical model. As shown in column 3 of
Table 1, we indeed find a large 12 percent increase in the number of admitted students. As shown
in the event study (Figure 7), there is a discontinuous 10 percent increase in admits upon joining,
and the effect again increases over time. This break in the series exactly during the join year is also
apparent in the structural break analysis in Figure 21 in the Appendix.

    Given that the number of admits is larger in magnitude that the reduction in yield, it must
be the enrollment is increasing.15 As shown in column 4 of Table 1 and in the corresponding
event study (Figure 8), we indeed find small increases in enrollment.16 While schools may have
been expanding capacity at the same time that they adopted the CA, it is also possible that some
universities were not at full capacity before joining the CA.
  15 That   is, we can decompose the decrease in yield via the equation ln(yield ) = ln(enollment ) - ln(admits).
  16 Similar    effects are documented in the structural break analysis in Figure 22 in the Appendix.

    Finally, we investigate whether selectivity has changed, as measured via acceptance rates.
Given that both acceptances and admits increase by 12 percent following entry into the CA, there
is no change in the log acceptance rate, as documented in the final column of Table 1.17 The
event study in Figure 9, by contrast, provides some evidence of increasing selectivity (i.e., de-
creasing acceptance rates) following CA adoption.18 Thus, the evidence with respect to selectivity
is mixed, with no effects in the TWFE specifications and increasing selectivity in the event study
specification.
  17 In
      particular, we can write the log admissions rates as ln(selectivity) = ln(admits) - ln(applications).
  18 Giventhe null result in Table 1, there is no structural break during the join year, as documented in Figure 23 in
the Appendix.

   To summarize, we find strong evidence that CA entry increased the number of applications,
consistent with reduced frictions, and reduced yield, consistent with large student choice sets.
We find only limited evidence that admissions rates fell but strong evidence that the number of
admitted students increased.


5.4    Geographic Integration

Given the documented reduction in frictions and increased student choice sets, we next examine
geographic integration. In the Appendix, we first provide evidence that the geographic integration
documented by Hoxby [2000], covering the period 1949-1994, has continued into our sample
period. In particular, we find an increase over time in the average distance traveled by students and
an increase in the fraction of out-of-state students.
   We next examine, again using College Board data, the extent to which the CA has contributed
towards these trends in geographic integration. As shown in column 1 of Table 2, the fraction
of out-of-state students rises by 1.4 percentage points in the years after joining, relative to the



                                                                                                             20
period prior to joining the CA, a roughly 5 percent increase relative to the sample average of 30
percent out-of-state. Thus, the CA has both contributed towards and accelerated recent trends in
geographic integration.

   The corresponding event study (Figure 10) documents an immediate increase in the fraction of
out-of-state enrollment of roughly 1 percentage point following a school joining the CA, and this
effect roughly doubles 10 years after joining the CA. The structural break analysis, as reported in
the Figure 24, also documents a break in the series exactly during the join year, with no evidence
of a break in the series prior to the school joining the CA.

2 of Table 2, the fraction of foreign students rises by 0.3 percentage points in the years after
joining, relative to the period prior to joining the CA. The corresponding event study (Figure 11)
also documents an increase but the effects are noisy in this case. Likewise, the structural break
analysis, as reported in the Figure 25 in the Appendix, also provides some evidence of a break in
the join year; but the results are again noisy, with corresponding evidence of breaks in the years
following the join year.

   In the Appendix, we document similar results using data from IPEDS. In particular, CA entry
leads to an increase in out-of-state students and an increase in foreign students. In addition, IPEDS
includes information on state-to-state migration of college students, and we use this information
to measure the average distance that students travel to attend college. We find that entry into CA
does increase distance traveled, and this effect largely comes from an increase in attendance from
nearby states.
   To summarize, we find, using both IPEDS and College Board data, that the CA has contributed
towards geographic integration, with an increase in the fraction of out-of-state students, with nois-
ier results for the fraction of foreign students. We next consider the source of these out-of-state
students via an investigation of network effects associated with the CA.


5.5   Network Effects and Sorting

If the CA is driving these geographic integration results, then the documented increase in out-of-
state enrollment should be driven by students applying to other CA institutions. This suggests that



                                                                                                                        23
institutions that join the CA are likely to see a greater increase in applications from students in
states that already have a significant number of CA colleges. For example, if New York has high
CA penetration (i.e. many New York schools in the CA), then we might expect that UW-Madison
will attract more New York students after joining the CA since these New York students are already
using the platform to apply to CA colleges in New York.
    To examine these issues, we use IPEDS biennial migration data and measure CA penetration
(Pst ) as the fraction of colleges in source state s at time t that are members of the CA. We then
add this penetration measure and an interaction with the CA entry indicator to our two-way fixed
effects specification, where the dependent variable is the number of freshmen (Nsct ) from source
state s attending college c at time t . This interaction term provides a test of whether enrollment
from high CA penetration states increases when college c joins the CA. In our specification, the
unit of observation is now a college by source state by year, and we thus include college by source
state fixed effects (µsc ):


                          ln(Nsct ) = 1CAct + 2 Pst + 3CAct × Pst + µsc + µt + sct                 (5)


where our key parameter of interest, 3 , captures the increase in enrollment from states with high
CA penetration after a college joins the CA, after controlling for differences across states according
to CA penetration and overall differences across colleges in CA membership.
    In Figure 12 we plot the main effects and the interaction from the above fixed effects specifica-
tion.19 Interestingly, the coefficient on CA penetration (Pst ), which can be interpreted as the effect
of CA penetration before the college joins the CA, is significantly negative. This is consistent with
network effects in the sense that non-CA schools can be disadvantaged by students applying to
CA schools. The coefficient on the interaction term is large, positive, and statistically significant,
again suggesting that the increase in applications upon joining the CA is derived from students
applying to other CA schools. This evidence is consistent with network effects, as predicted by
our theoretical model.

   Lastly, in order to investigate pre-trends and any dynamic effects, we investigate network ef-
fects using our event-study specification. As shown in in Figure 13, there are negative coefficients
on source state penetration prior to joining, followed by a sharp jump at the time of entry, and then
positive and increasing coefficients thereafter. This type of pattern is consistent with a negative
network effect before joining that becomes positive after the school becomes a CA member. Taken
together, these results provide evidence that the increase in out-of-state enrollment after joining the
CA is driven by migration from states with significant CA penetration.

5.6    Stratification

Our final research question involves whether the CA has contributed towards stratification in higher
education. That is, given the reduction in frictions, the increased student choice sets, and geo-
graphic integration, has the CA contributed towards a widening of the gap between more selective
and less selective institutions? This could be the case if, for example, high ability students pri-
marily apply to local colleges in the absence of the CA but apply more nationally, and to more
selective institutions, following the introduction of the CA. Then, these high ability students might
travel further to attend more selective institutions as a result of the CA.
   Before investigating the role of the CA in stratification, we first document general trends in SAT
scores at different types of institutions. To do so, and in parallel with Figure 2, we classify schools
into five categories: top 50 liberal arts, top 50 private, top 50 public, other private and liberal
arts, and other public. As shown in Figure 14, there is a large and increasing gap in SAT/ACT
scores at the 75th percentile between selective schools (top 50 liberal arts, top 50 private, and
top 50 public), and less selective institutions over our sample period. Thus, there is evidence of


                                                                                      26
increasing stratification in general during our sample period.

    Given that the CA is disproportionately selective institutions, as documented above, we next
investigate the degree to which the CA has contributed to this widening of the gap between more
selective and less selective institutions. As shown in columns 3 and 4 of Table 2, there is a general
increase in SAT scores of enrolled freshman following entry into the CA. In particular, SAT scores
at the 25th percentile increase by 4 points and SAT scores at the 75th percentile increase by 9
points, although only the latter effect is statistically significant.20
    In order to examine pre-trends and any dynamic effects associated with joining the CA, we
examine this effect of CA entry on SAT scores via an event study approach. As shown in Figure
15, the effects for the 25th percentile are noisy and, consistent with the results from the fixed effects
regression, the effects are small in magnitude. For the 75th percentile (Figure 16), there is a small
increase in SAT scores following CA entry, and the effect rises to over 20 points after 10 years in
  20 One interpretation of the difference in effects between the 25th and 75th percentile, in the context of our theoretical

extension to heterogeneous student ability, is that the fraction of high ability students is small. In this case, only the
top of the distribution of SAT scores would change following entry into the CA, and the bottom of the distribution
would be unaffected since it is composed of low-ability students regardless of CA membership.



                                                                                    27
the CA. These effects should be interpreted with caution, however, as there do appear to be some
pre-trends in these figures. Nonetheless, the trends are small in the three years just before entry,
and, moreover, the 20 point increase in the decade following CA entry is larger than the roughly
10 point increase in the decade prior to CA entry. Consistent with this, we find evidence of a break
in SAT score at the 75th percentile in the join year or in the following two years (Figure 27 of the
Appendix) but no evidence of a break in the series prior to the join year. To conclude, we find

the 25th percentile but stronger evidence for increases for the 75th percentile.

6    Conclusion

Consistent with model predictions, we find that the CA has significantly altered college admissions.
In particular, after joining the CA, institutions experience an increase in the number of applications,
consistent with a reduction in frictions. There is also a significant reduction in yield, consistent
with increased student choice due to the CA. We also provide evidence of an effect of the CA on
geographic integration, with more out-of-state and foreign students. Moreover, these out-of-state
students tend to come from other states with significant CA penetration, patterns consistent with
network effects in the CA. Taken together, these results suggest that the CA, by reducing applica-
tion costs, has reduced frictions and increased student choice sets in college admissions, resulting
in a more integrated market. Finally, we provide some evidence that CA entry is associated with
an increase in freshmen SAT scores. If so, and given that the CA is disproportionately composed
of selective institutions, the CA has contributed towards the rising gap between more selective and
less selective institutions.

A.1     Conditions for an Interior Solution

Regarding equation 2, the key condition for a unique solution is that the upper solution to the
quadratic equation implies an admissions rate in excess of one. This requires that application costs
be small, relative to the benefits of a larger choice set::


                                               F < C12 - C1                                       (6)

That is, the cost of a second application must be less than the option value of also being admitted
to one's second choice. The requirement that F is small also guarantees that a solution exists, in
the sense that the discriminant is positive.
    Regarding equation 1, we require the following condition for an interior solution:


                           QY1 <  < Q2 (Y12 + y12 ) + Q(1 - Q)(Y1 + Y2 )                          (7)

where Q is set at its equilibrium value and is thus a function of model parameters. The left hand side
of the inequality requires that college capacity is more than sufficient to accommodate accepted
students when all students apply to only their first choice, given equilibrium admissions rates. The
right hand side requires that the college capacity is not sufficient to accommodate the situation
when all students apply to both colleges, given equilibrium admissions rates. Thus, capacity can
be neither too small nor too large.


A.2     Equilibrium Solution

We first solve equation 2 for the equilibrium admissions rate. While this equation is quadratic in Q
and thus has two solutions in principle, the upper solution implies an admissions rate in excess of
1, under the assumptions outlined in the Appendix above, and we thus focus on the lower solution:




                                                   32
                                        C2 -     2 - 4 f (C + C - C )
                                                C2         1   2   12
                                   
                                  Q =                                                            (8)
                                               2(C1 + C2 - C12 )

Given this equilibrium admissions rate, one can then calculate the equilibrium fraction of students
applying to both colleges via equation 1, yielding:


                                                     - QY1
                              b =        2
                                                                                                 (9)
                                        Q [Y12 + y12 - Y1 ] + Q(1 - Q)Y2

where Q is set at equilibrium levels.


A.3    Proof of Proposition 1

Parts 1) and 2): In Equation 8, it is clear that equilibrium admissions rates are increasing in F .
Thus, a marginal reduction in F leads to a reduction in equilibrium admissions rates. This effect is
illustrated in Figure 17 below.

                              Figure 17: Effects on admissions rates


   Given that Q declines under the CA, we must next show that b is decreasing in Q. Taking the
derivative of equation 9 with respect to Q, we have:

                                                    33
                         db   -Y1 ( - QY1 )[2Q(Y12 + y12 - Y1 - Y2 ) + Y2 ]
                            =    -                                                                (10)
                         dQ    D                   D2

where the denominator equals D = Q2 [Y12 + y12 - Y1 ] + Q(1 - Q)Y2 . This denominator is positive
since Y12 + y12 > Y1 .
   Substituting back in the definition of b, we have that:

                             db   -Y1 - b[2Q(Y12 + y12 - Y1 - Y2 ) + Y2 ]
                                =                                                                 (11)
                             dQ                   D

Re-arranging the numerator, this relationship can be written as follows:

                      db   -2bQ(Y12 + y12 - Y1 ) + (bQY2 - Y1 ) - bY2 (1 - Q)
                         =                                                                        (12)
                      dQ                          D

   Each of these three terms in the numerator are negative. In particular, the first term is negative
since Y12 + y12 > Y1 . The second term is negative since Y2 < Y1 , b < 1, and Q<1. Finally, the third
term is negative since Q < 1 in equilibrium. Since the denominator must be positive for b to be
positive, the slope is negative. This change in application rates is illustrated in Figure 18 below.

   Part 3): Note that the number of admitted students is equal to Q(1 + b), the product of the

                                                     34
admissions rate and the number of applications received. Using the closed form solution for b,
This can be written as:


                                                           - QY1
                     Q(1 + b) = Q + Qb = Q +                                                   (13)
                                                Q[Y12 + y12 - Y1 ] + (1 - Q)Y2

   Taking the derivative, we have that:


                          dQ(1 + b)     Y1  - QY1
                                    = 1- -        [Y12 + y12 - Y1 - Y2 ]                       (14)
                            dQ          D   D2

   where the denominator equals D = Q[Y12 + y12 - Y1 ] + (1 - Q)Y2 .
   Using the fact that Qb = [ - QY1 ]/D, the slope can be re-written as:


                            dQ(1 + b)     Y1 Qb
                                      = 1- -    [Y12 + y12 - Y1 - Y2 ]                         (15)
                              dQ          D  D

   This can be re-written as:


                            dQ(1 + b) D - Y1 - Qb[Y12 + y12 - Y1 - Y2 ]
                                     =                                                         (16)
                              dQ                    D

   Since D is positive, we simply need to show that the numerator is negative. Since the term
Y12 + y12 - Y1 - Y2 is negative, the numerator is increasing in b. Thus, to show that it is negative
for all b between 0 and 1, we simply need to show that it is negative when b = 1. In this case, and
canceling terms, the numerator can be written as Y2 - Y1 , which is negative.
   Part 4): The increase in out-of-state students follows directly from the increase in b resulting
from the reduction in F .


A.4    Extension to 3 Colleges

We next consider the case in which two colleges (c = 1 and c = 2) join the CA but a third college
(c = 3) does not join. In this case, there are three types of students, corresponding to the ex-ante
ranking of the third college. Type 1 students have ex-ante preferences that rank college 3 last


                                                35
(either U1 > U2 > U3 or U2 > U1 > U3 ). Type 2 students have ex-ante preferences that rank college
3 in the middle (either U1 > U3 > U2 or U2 > U3 > U1 ). Type 3 students have ex-ante preferences
that rank college 3 first (either U3 > U1 > U2 or U3 > U2 > U1 ). Given all of this, we can write the
ex-ante preferences of the six different types of students as follows:




                                                U1 > U2 > U3 , 1.1

                                                U2 > U1 > U3 , 1.2

                                                U1 > U3 > U2 , 2.1

                                                U2 > U3 > U1 , 2.2

                                                U3 > U1 > U2 , 3.1

                                                U3 > U2 > U1 , 3.2


Let QCA and QN denote admissions rates at the CA colleges and the non-CA college, respectively.
Capacities are symmetric and equal  .
    We focus here on the case in which students do not apply to all three colleges.21 Let b1 be the
fraction of type 1 students applying to their first and second choice and likewise for b2 and b3 . The
feasibility constraint for college 1 (college 2 is analogous) is now given by:




                                                        QCA [(1 - b1 )Y1 + (1 - b2 )Y1 +
                                                                 type 1.1         type 2.1

                         b1 QCAY12 + b1 (1 - QCA )Y1 + b2 QN Y12 + b2 (1 - QN )Y1 ]+                          (17)
                                     type 1.1                          type 2.1

                   QCA [b1 QCA y12 + b1 (1 - QCA )Y2 + b3 QN y12 + b3 (1 - QN )Y2 ] =                         (18)
                                     type 1.2                          type 3.1

  21 Thiscould formalized by having a large difference in preferences between the second and third choice. For type
1.1 students, for example, U2 - U3 would be large.



                                                        36
And for college 3 it is:




                           2QN [(1 - b3 )Y1 + b3 QCAY12 + b3 (1 - QCA )Y1 ]+
                                                  types 3

                                        2QN [b2 QCA y12 + b2 (1 - QCA )Y2 ] =                     (19)
                                                            types 2


Prior to the CA, the three relevant indifference conditions are given, similarly to before, by:


                                    Q2 (C12 - C1 ) + (1 - Q)QC2 = F                               (20)

With the introduction of the CA, the conditions become as follows for type 1 students:


                                 2
                                QCA (C12 - C1 ) + (1 - QCA )QCAC2 = f                             (21)

However, for types 2 and 3, now they incorporate the two different admission rates. In the case of
students type 2, taking the case of 2.1, we have that:


                               QCA QN (C12 - C1 ) + (1 - QCA )QN C2 = F                           (22)

And students type 3, taking the case of 3.1, we have that:


                               QN QCA (C12 - C1 ) + (1 - QN )QCAC1 = F                            (23)

   Claim: these three indifference conditions cannot be simultaneously satisfied
   Proof: The introduction of the CA causes the right hand side in equation 20 to fall from F to f .
This implies that, given the admissions rate at CA schools, more type 1 individuals find it profitable
to apply to a second school, increasing bCA . However, under a higher bCA , CA colleges will have
excess demand, violating their feasibility constraint (equation 18). Thus, QCA must decrease until



                                                   37
type 1 students are indifferent between applying to a second school or not.22
    Now, note that the fall in QCA causes the left hand side in equation 22 to increase, implying that
more type 3 students want to apply to a second college. However, the opposite happens with type
3 applicants. The fall in QCA pushes down the left hand side in equation 23, implying that fewer
type 3 students want to apply to a second college.
    Due to these opposing effects of a decrease in QCA for type 2 and type 3 students, both condi-
tions cannot be simultaneously satisfied, meaning that either b2 or b3 must be at a corner solution.
More formally, comparing the conditions for type 2 and type 3, we have that:


            QCA QN (C1,2 - C1 ) + (1 - QCA )QN C2 = QN QCA (C1,2 - C1 ) + (1 - QN )QCAC2

This is only satisfied when QCA = QN . However, under this condition, the left hand side of the
three conditions are equal. But this is a contradiction with the fact that the first equation equals f ,
the second and third equations equal F , with f < F .
    Claim: There is no equilibrium with b2 = 1 and b3 interior.
    Proof: Assuming that b1 is interior, and imposing symmetry, this would require the following:


                                    2
                                   QCA (C1,2 - C1 ) + (1 - QCA )QCAC2 = f



                                 QCA QN (C1,2 - C1 ) + (1 - QCA )QN C2 > F



                                 QN QCA (C1,2 - C1 ) + (1 - QN )QCAC2 = F

Comparing the conditions for type 1 and type 3 and using the fact that f < F , we have that:


              2
             QCA (C1,2 - C1 ) + (1 - QCA )QCAC2 < QN QCA (C1,2 - C1 ) + (1 - QN )QCAC2
  22 Note that an increase in b
                                CA must accompany the fall in QCA . Else, if only QCA were to fall, colleges would not
meet the feasibility constraint, as they would have open vacancies given the smaller admission rate.


                                                         38
Re-arranging, this can be written as:


                               QCA (QCA - QN )(C1,2 - C1 - C2 ) < 0

Since C1,2 - C1 - C2 < 0, this requires QCA > QN .
   Comparing types 2 and 3, we have that:


          QCA QN (C1,2 - C1 ) + (1 - QCA )QN C2 > QN QCA (C1,2 - C1 ) + (1 - QN )QCAC2

   Re-arranging, this can be written as:


                                  (1 - QCA )QN > (1 - QN )QCA                                  (24)

This requires that QN > QCA . This contradicts that earlier requirement that QCA > QN .
   Summary: The introduction of the CA leads to an increase in b1 , the fraction applying to
both CA schools and a reduction in QCA . Given this, it must be case that b2 increases to 1 or
that b3 decreases to zero since both cannot be interior. However, we have shown that b2 cannot
equal 1, meaning that b3 = 0. Thus, there is a reduction, all the way to zero, in the fraction
applying to a school outside of the CA and a school inside the CA. Given this, there are network
effects with more type 1.1 students attending college 2 and more type 1.2 students attending college
1. Likewise, there are fewer type 3.1 students attending college 1 and fewer type 3.2 students
attending college 2.
   Quantitative analysis: To provide further evidence on the three college case, we choose pa-
rameters that guarantee interior solutions before the policy change. In particular, we set U1 = 2,
U2 = 1,  = 0.55, and F = 0.3. Prior to the CA, colleges and students are symmetric, with
Q = 0.2985 and b = 0.0776. Introduction of the CA lowers F to f = 0.29. Under the CA, imposing
that b3 = 0 in the new equilibrium, the admission rate of the CA schools falls from Q = 0.2985 to
QCA = 0.2844, while the admission rate of the non-CA school also falls, but by a smaller degree,
to QN = 0.2942. These changes reflect the direct and indirect effects of the decrease in F on the


                                                39
different types of students. Type 1 students the only ones that benefit directly by the policy and
strongly increase their applications to a second school to from b = 0.0776 to b1 = 0.3346. On the
other hand, type 2 students see their application rate grow only marginally, to b2 = 0.0908. The
reason is that type 2 students have as first choice a CA college followed by the non-CA college,
so they do not enjoy the lower application fee but do face the lower admission rate from the CA
school, providing them with incentives to apply to their second choice.


A.5    Extension to Ability Types

We consider three colleges (c) and two ability types: low-ability and high-ability. We assume
that colleges want to attract as many high ability students as possible and thus admit them with
probability one. Low ability students are then admitted at a lower rate in order to fill any remain-
ing capacity. Given our interest in stratification, we can then simply study the behavior of high
ability students. Given that high ability students are admitted with certainty, the model plays out
differently in this case. In particular, students will not be indifferent when choosing their applica-
tion sets, and corner solutions are now relevant for these high ability students. Given these corner
solutions, we focus on non-marginal changes in application costs.
   We focus here on two cases. In the first case, application costs are sufficiently high that high
ability students only apply to their first choice in the absence of the CA. For students with the
preference order U1 >U2 >U3 , this requires:


                                           C12 - C1 < F                                          (25)

Suppose now that colleges 1 and 2, but not college 3, join the CA. Further, suppose that application
costs fall sufficiently such that C12 - C1 > f , and likewise for students with preference ordering
U2 >U1 >U3 . Then, these two sets of students will apply to both colleges, and students with other
preference orderings are unaffected. Since these two sets of students are now more likely to attend
college (recall that Y12 + y12 > Y1 ), the fraction of high ability students at CA colleges increases.



                                                 40
The fraction of high ability students at colleges outside of the CA is unchanged.
   In the second case, suppose that application costs are sufficiently low that high ability students
apply to their top two choices, but not their third choice, in the absence of the CA. For students
with the preference order U1 >U3 >U2 , not applying to the third college requires:


                                           C123 - C13 < F                                           (26)

where C123 represents the value from having a full choice set of all three colleges. Suppose now
that colleges 1 and 2, but not college 3, join the CA, and application costs fall sufficiently such
that C123 - C13 > f , and likewise for all students that have college 1 or 2 as their third choice.
Then, all students except those with preference orderings U1 >U2 >U3 and U2 >U1 >U3 will apply to
all three colleges. Thus, there is an increase in applications for colleges 1 and 2 and no increase in
applications for college 3. Given that the yield on students accepted to college 3 now falls (resulting
from more college 3 applicants also applying to colleges 1 and 2), this implies that colleges 1 and
2 will now draw some high ability students who would have attended college 3 in the absence of
the CA. Thus, as in the first case, the fraction of high ability students at CA colleges increases. The
new effect here is that the fraction of high ability students falls at schools outside of the CA.

A.7       Trends in Geographic Integration

Hoxby [2000] documents that the percentage of students attending in-state institutions fell consis-
tently from 1949 to 1994 and that the role of distance in explaining college choice decreased as
well. We extend this study of geographic integration into our sample period by measuring trends
in distance traveled from a student's home state to the state of their university using IPEDS data
over the period from 1986 to 2014.23 In Figure 28 we plot the mean distance traveled in each
year, along with 95 percent confidence intervals.24 As shown, there is a clear increase in distance
traveled over this time period, with the average distance traveled increasing by over 100 kilometers
for private universities and roughly 40 kilometers for public universities. Thus, the trends towards
greater geographic integration documented by Hoxby between 1949 and 1994 also appear over our
  23 In particular, we measure the great circle distance in kilometers between state centroids, defining the distance for
all in-state students as zero
   24 Letting the subscript s denote a student's state, we define the mean distance traveled by all students from US states

at college c in year t as avdistc,t = (1/nat _enrollc,t )  enrollc,s,t  distc,s . The variable nat _enroll is total enrollment
                                                        sS
from the 50 US states and D.C. The home location of foreign students and students from US territories is usually not
available, and therefore we excluded these groups from the total. However, students from these groups are counted in
total enrollment when calculating percentage of students attending in-state.

                         Data covers every two years from 1986 to 2014, except 1990 (missing).




   In Table 3 we calculate the average increase in geographic integration over time for public
and private institutions, using the specification yct = 1 yearst + 2 yearst × publicc + µc + ct . In
column 1 we find that distance traveled increases by about 3 kilometers per year for private in-
stitutions and 1 kilometer per for public institutions, while column 2 specifies average distance
in logs and shows that both types of institutions have roughly the same percentage increase over
time of 1.4 percent. In columns 3 and 4 we examine the average distance traveled by out-of-state
students only to separate the effects of a change in the percentage of out-of-state students from a
change in the geographic composition of the out-of-state students. Interestingly, the results show
that while out-of-state students at private institutions are traveling further each year, there is essen-
tially no increase in distance for out-of-state students at public institutions (the interaction effect
is the same magnitude as the main effect). This implies that the increasing distance traveled by
public university students comes entirely from an increase in the out-of-state percentage, which
increases at about 0.15 percentage points each year for both types of institutions (the in-state per-
centage is multiplied by 100 in column 5). Lastly, in column 6 we show that the percentage of total

                                                                   47
enrollment from foreign students (multiplied by 100) increases by about 0.04 percentage points
each year for private institutions and 0.01 percentage points for public institutions.

A.8    CA and Geographic Integration (IPEDS data)

As shown in Table 4, universities, after joining the CA, experience a significant increase in the
average distance students travel to attend, with column 1 documenting an increase of 30 kilometers,
a roughly 10 percent increase (column 2). Restricting to only out-of-state students, the distance
increases by 55 kilometers (column 3), an increase of 7 percent for this population (column 4).
In addition to out-of-state students traveling further, joining the CA also decreases the fraction of
in-state students by about 2.3 percentage points (column 5) and increases the fraction of foreign
students by 0.6 percentage points (column 6). Generally, the magnitudes of the effects in Table 4
are large. Comparing each coefficient in Table 4 to its counterpart in Appendix Table 3, the effect
of joining is about 10 times larger than the yearly trend for distance measures and about 15 times
larger for in-state and foreign percentage.

    As a further analysis of the effect of joining CA on distance traveled, we now consider the
change in the entire distribution of a college's enrollees over distance. To do so, we restrict our
sample to only those institutions which joined the CA and which have migration data both three or
fours years before and three or four years after joining, depending on whether the institution joined
in an odd or even year. We then sum the enrollees across all universities in each period (pre,post)
and calculate the percentage coming from each state-to-state distance. This allows us to calculate
two cumulative distribution functions (CDF), where each bin of the CDF represents a given state-
to-state distance and we are calculating the percentage of students traveling that distance to all
universities in a period. We then plot the difference between the before and after CDF in Figure
29.25 The largest difference occurs at zero, indicating that most of the effect comes from a 3
percentage point decrease in the in-state percentage. The slope of this differenced CDF increases
sharply and approaches zero, so that a distance of 1200 kilometers the change is less than 1 percent,
and then flattens. This shape suggests that CA entry increases the distance traveled by enrollees by
mostly increasing the number of enrollees from nearby states.
  25 We    truncate the graph at 4000km since the share of students coming from a greater distance is very small in both
periods.
