                                         ABSTRACT

On June 22, 2020, President Trump issued an Executive Order (EO) that suspended new work
visas, barring nearly 200,000 foreign workers and their dependents from entering the United
States and preventing American companies from hiring skilled immigrants using H-1B or L1
visas. Exploiting this shock, and using event study methodology analyzing the cumulative
average abnormal returns (CAARs) of Fortune 500 companies following this order, we find that
the EO statistically and economically significantly caused negative CAARs of up to 0.45%, the
equivalent of over 100 billion of US dollars of losses, based on the firms' valuation before the
event. Our results are particularly pronounced for firms that had maintained or increased their
reliance on skilled immigrant workers over the prior years.

1     Introduction
On June 22, 2020 an Executive Order (EO) was issued by the President of the
United States, Donald J. Trump, restricting the entry of individuals seeking
to enter the country on a non-immigrant work visa.1 According to estimates,
this EO barred entrance of about 200,000 foreign workers and their dependents
(Chishti et al., 2020). Unlike immigrant visas, which grant individuals per-
manent residency in the U.S. and are primarily granted for purposes of family
reunification, non-immigrant visas are primarily granted in response to demand
from firms and are both employment-based and temporary.2 3 Of direct rele-
vance to the Fortune 500 companies that we focus on in this paper is the EO's
ban of new H-1B and L1 visas, both of which are used by American companies
to hire or transfer high-skilled immigrants.4 Kerr et al. (2015) document that
almost all beneficiaries of the H-1B visa have a college degree and typically
about half of the temporary foreign workers have completed a graduate degree.
Many also work in information technology and STEM, which accounted for over
70 percent of all successful visa applications in the 2012 fiscal year.
    In this paper, we study the immediate economic impact of this EO on the
largest U.S. firms by estimating the cumulative average abnormal stock returns
for Fortune 500 firms in response to the policy announcement. We find that the
June 22 shock eroded the market valuation of the 471 companies in our sample
by an estimated 100 billion of US dollars.
    We arrive at these conclusions by estimating the cumulative average abnor-
mal returns of Fortune 500 companies following the EO, based on the event
study methodology, a workhorse method introduced by Fama et al. (1969) and
used extensively in the economics and finance literature (Binder, 1985; Schoar
and Zuo, 2016). Our baseline results show that in the days that followed the

   2 Among other visa categories,          non-immigrant visas included visas related to
"specialty occupations in fields requiring highly specialized knowledge" (H-1B
visas), intra-company transfers (L visas), and exchange visitors (J visas).Source:

   3 Leiden and Neal (1990) summarize how the U.S. Immigration Act of 1990 created three

categories of visas, focused on three priorities: family-reunification, employment and diversity.
The same act created quotas for family-reunification visas and for employment. The 1990 Act
also created the H1-B visa category.
   4 The L1 visa allows American companies with global operations to temporarily transfer

foreign managers and employees to their American offices

EO, the firms in our sample ­known to rely extensively on immigrant labor­
lost about 0.45% of their value based on abnormal stock returns. We further
find that this negative shock was common on firms regardless of their economic
activity and was much stronger for firms that have maintained or increased
their reliance on foreign workers during the years prior to the EO (as measured
by each firm's Labor Condition Application requests which proxies demand for
H1B visas).
    In reporting this finding, this paper contributes with additional novel evi-
dence to the ongoing debate surrounding immigration policy focused on attract-
ing skilled temporary workers.
    A number of empirical papers in the existing literature find that skilled im-
migration improves firm outcomes such as total factor productivity (Mitaritonna
et al., 2017), production expansion (Olney, 2013), innovation (Kerr and Lincoln,
2010; Choudhury and Kim, 2019; Beerli et al., 2018), FDI (Foley and Kerr,
2013), and profits (Mayda et al., 2020).5 Other studies such as Doran et al.
(2020) present more conservative evidence on the value of temporary worker
programs, more specifically the H1B visa program, to U.S. firms. Doran et al.
(2020) document that for U.S. firms, winning marginal H1B visas through the
H1B lottery has insignificant effects on productivity and innovation outcomes,
such as firms' patenting and use of the research and experimentation tax credit.
However, Doran et al. (2020) do present some evidence that securing additional
H1B visas lead to higher firm profitability.
    Our study contributes to this active debate surrounding whether or not,
and to what extent, skilled work visas create value for firms, by examining the
short-run impacts of skilled immigration restrictions on firms' stock market val-
uations. Our results support the hypothesis, first posited by Kerr and Lincoln
(2010), that restrictions on skilled visas represent a supply shock to U.S. firms.
While there may be longer run adjustments ­such as offshoring, documented
by Glennon (2020)­ that U.S. firms can make when their access to skilled la-
bor supply is abruptly constrained, one would also expect a short-run negative
impact prior to any such adjustments, which is precisely what we document
here. Furthermore, while the prior literature is focused on studying the effects
   5 Several studies also document a positive relation between immigration and productivity

and/or innovation outcomes in the context of geographies and local labor markets. These
studies include Saxenian (2002); Hunt and Gauthier-Loiselle (2010); Kahn and MacGarvie
(2016); Miguelez and Temgoua (2020); Bahar et al. (2019, 2020). Kerr et al. (2016) provide
an excellent summary of this literature.

of the H-1B visa policy on firm outcomes in equilibrium, we complement the
prior literature by studying the effects of how a policy shock to the H-1B visa
program affects market valuation of U.S. firms in the immediate term.
    Our paper first describes the data and the empirical strategy, after which we
detail the results. Finally, in the last section, we offer some concluding remarks.6


2      Data and Empirical Strategy
We estimate the impact of President Trump's EO restricting worker's visas on
the value of Fortune 500 firms by identifying changes in their cumulative average
abnormal returns (CAARs), using stock market data.
   Our data come from two primary sources: (1) Thomson Reuters Datastream
and (2) Department of Labor (DOL) Labor Condition Application (LCA) re-
quests.7 The former provides information on daily stock returns for all firms in
our sample as well as the daily returns for the Standard and Poor's 500 Index
(S&P500), which we use as a market index proxy, between January 2019 and
July 2020. The latter is a proxy for firm demand for H-1B visas between 2015
and 2019.8 We also obtain market capitalization data from S&P Capital IQ and
employment data from Compustat. Our final sample consists of 471 firms, the
universe of all Fortune 500 companies in any year between 2010 to 2015 that
are publicly traded (and hence for which stock market data is available).9
   We employ the event study methodology, a workhorse method introduced by
(Fama et al., 1969) and used extensively in the economics and finance literatures
(Binder, 1985; Schoar and Zuo, 2016). We measure the impact of the June 2020
EO on the stock return of the companies in our sample in the following way.
    6 Our paper is accompanied by an Online Appendix where we report additional information
as well as results for several robustness tests.
    7 We use predated LCA applications following the literature to identify those visas that

are subject to the H-1B cap. In other words, we infer whether a given LCA application is
for a cap-subject H-1B visa by looking at the date of the LCA application. We assume that
any LCA filed between January and April with a work start date 5-6 months in the future
represents demand for a cap-subject H-1B visa for the following fiscal year.
    8 The H-1B application process is a two-stage process. Before a firm can file a petition with

US Customs and Immigration Services (USCIS), they must file an LCA with the DOL. There
is no limit â beyond cost â on the number of LCAs that a firm can file, so demand is measured
independent of whether an H-1B is ultimately issued or not.
    9 In Online Appendix Section A we provide the full list of the 471 companies in our final

sample with their corresponding one-digit NAICS industry code and their market capitaliza-
tion at close of June 19, 2020, the business day before the EO was announced.




                                               4
First, we estimate a market model to measure the expected return of each one
of the companies during the event window. Following (?) we first estimate for
each company i:

                                 Ri,t = i + i Rm,t + i,t                                    (1)

    where Ri,t is the daily stock return of company i (for each trading day t) and
Rm,t represents the market's daily return, which in our baseline estimations is
proxied by the Standard and Poor's 500 Index.10
    For each company in our sample, we estimate the market model for all
trading days of 2019.11 . That model then forms our expectations as to how the
company stock should behave with respect to the market during the event we
explore in 2020. With this, we then estimate the daily abnormal return (AR)
as:

                               ARi,t = Ri,t - ^i - ^i Rm,t                                  (2)

    where ARi,t is the estimated abnormal return computed as a residual using
the estimators for each firm i of  and  from specification (1). Following
the literature, we average the abnormal returns over different windows around
the event dates, which correspond to the cumulative average abnormal returns
(CAARs) for each company. Following (Schoar and Zuo, 2016), our baseline
estimation is based on averaging the cumulative abnormal results for the 3-day
window [-1, +1] and the 5-day window [-1,+3] surrounding the events. In other
words, we compute CAARs as:

                                                    t=T
                                              1
                               CAARi =                 ARi,t                                (3)
                                            T - t t=-1

   where T is 1 or 3 in our baseline estimations.
   We chose asymmetric windows to avoid confounding our results with unex-
pected market volatility due to the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic and not
the immigration announcements themselves. However, it is important to note
that our results are robust to using symmetric windows (as is typical in some
  10 Our results are robust to using Barclay's Fortune 500 index as a market proxy, too.
  11 There is no widely agreed upon estimation period in the literature. We follow (Schoar
and Zuo, 2016) and use all of 2019, the year before the event we analyze, as the estimation
period, but our results are also robust to including the first few months of 2020 as part of our
estimation period.




                                               5
of the literature) and, as we show below, robust for longer windows including
more post-event days.
    We proceed to test whether the firms in our sample experienced a significant
deviation from what we would expect from those stocks given the market be-
havior and the stocks' relationship to the market. We do this, first, by simply
establishing whether we can or cannot reject the hypothesis that the sample
mean of CAARs ­which we refer to as µ­ is statistically different from zero.
Second, we also compare between-CAARs averages for sub-samples of firms,
based on their dependence on the immigrant workforce (similar to the t-tests
performed by Schoar and Zuo (2016)).


3    Results
We first examine the CAARs sample mean µ for the days that followed the
announcement affecting non-immigrant visas. Table 1 summarizes this exercise.
Columns 1 and 2 report the CAARs sample mean (µ) using a 3-day window
(from t = -1 to t = 1) while columns 3 and 4 use a 5-day window (from t = -1
to t = 3). Columns 1 and 3 present the simple average while Columns 2 and 4
present the within-sector average, where sector is defined as the firms' reported
1-digit NAICS industry code. We do this to make sure our results are not biased
by the behavior of a particular sector. When including sector fixed effects, our
sample drops to 468 because we lack sector data for three firms.

                              [Table 1 about here.]

    The CAARs response to the EO restricting non-immigrant work visas is neg-
ative, statistically significant, and remains strikingly similar at 0.45% for both
windows. In other words, in the days following the June 22, 2020 announce-
ment banning work visas, Fortune 500 firms lost on average nearly 0.5% of their
value. The results are also robust ­and strikingly similar­ when controlling for
industry fixed effects.
    According to market capitalization figures for the 471 companies in our sam-
ple, the total value of the companies at the end of June 19, 2020 ­the business
day before the policy announcement was made­ was about 22.68 trillion dollars.
Thus, the 0.45% negative effect we estimate represents a loss of about 100.14
billion dollars for the economy as a whole.
    We also find that this result remains consistent even when we expand the
estimation to longer windows that incorporate more post-event days, as shown

                                        6
in Figure 4, which plots µ , with t = -1 as the start day of the window but
with a varying end day, from t = 1 to t = 10. The figure shows the negative
effect of the EO, which specifically affected the ability of firms to hire foreign
workers, remained steady for 10 days after the announcement.

                             [Figure 1 about here.]


Heterogeneous Effects
In this section, we examine which firms and sectors were especially negatively
impacted by the EO.
    First, we explore whether the effect we find is more or less prevalent across
the different sectors of the economy. Thus we repeat the exercise of estimating
µ this time by sectors of the economy according to the 1-digit NAICS code re-
ported by every firm. In particular we look at the four sectors where most of the
firms are concentrated: Mining, Utilities and Construction (MUC), Manufac-
turing (MNFTR), Commerce (COM), and Financial, Information Technology
and Real Estate (FIRE). Results are presented in Table 2.

                              [Table 2 about here.]

    The results show negative values for µ across all sectors, but the negative
estimates are especially large for the Financial, Information Technology and
Real Estate (FIRE) sector, followed by the Mining, Utilities and Construction
(MUC) sector. However, all in all, our results suggest that the EO negatively
impacted the valuation of all firms in our sample, regardless of industry.
    Another component we exploit is the reliance on the immigrant workforce
of these firms. We would expect that firms with non-decreasing reliance on
hiring foreign workers would be most impacted by an unexpected restriction on
their ability to hire said workers. We therefore look for differential effects for
sub-samples of firms based on their known reliance on foreign workers.
    To explore this, we divide the sample in two sub-samples based on the growth
of LCA applications over the past three years. For our baseline estimation we
use the Compound Average Growth Rate as our baseline growth measure as
follows:
                                                      T1
                                                       -t
                                            LCAi,T
                                            empi,T
                       CAGRi,tT =           LCAi,t
                                                            -1                (4)
                                            empi,t



                                        7
   In our baseline results T is 2019 and t is 2016, LCA is the predated Labor
Condition Applications for firm i in each year, and emp is the total number of
employees of firm i in each year.12
   Based on the distribution of CAGR for the 471 firms we create two sub-
samples based on their 3-year growth rate during 2016 to 2019: negative growth
and zero or positive growth, which corresponds to dividing the sample above
and below the median of the growth distribution.13
   Essentially, we split the sample by whether firms had negative vs steady/positive
growth in LCA applications. We name these two sub-samples L and H for low
and high values of the distribution of growth, respectively.
   We then proceed, in similar fashion as Schoar and Zuo (2016), to comparing
µL and µH (e.g., that is, the sub-sample means of the CAARs) by computing
 = µH - µL . Table 3 presents the results for these estimations using the
window [-1,1] and [-1,3] to compute CAARs in Columns 1 and 2 and Columns
3 and 4, respectively. As with Table 1, the even columns present results using
within-sector variation, only.14

                                  [Table 3 about here.]

    Table 3 shows that the 295 firms in our sample with zero or positive LCA
growth during 2016-2019 (as a share of their employees) experienced a 0.2 to
0.3 percent larger drop in their valuation following the June EO than the 176
firms that had reduced their dependence on LCAs. Considering that the drop
in the valuation of firms with negative LCA growth was around 0.3 percent (as
  12 Our  results are robust to computing growth rate in different manners, including using
nominal value of LCAs (e.g., not normalized by the number of employees) as shown in Online
Appendix C.
  13 As can be seen in Figure B in Online Appendix B, the distribution of CAGR for the firms

in our sample behaves similarly to a normal distribution with two particular values standing
out: -1 (e.g., 100% negative growth rate) for firms that went from having any positive value
of LCA in 2016 to none in 2019, and 0 for firms that experienced no growth in LCAs (as a
share of employees) between those two years, which is a significant share of all firms. Online
Appendix B also shows that our main results are unchanged if we use other moments of the
growth distribution to define the sub-samples.
  14 These results were obtained by estimating the following specification:

                                    [-1,T ]
                             CAARi            = µ + Hi + s + ui                            (5)

where Hi is a binary variable indicating whether firm i belongs to sub-sample H . Accordingly,
µL = µ and µH = µ + . T is a post-event day marking the upper limit of the window used
to compute the CAARs that serve as dependent variable. s represent sector (the first digit
of the NAICS code) fixed effects.


                                                8
shown by µL in Table 3), this implies that firms in the zero or positive LCA
growth sub-sample were hit almost twice as hard by the announcement.
    In fact, as Figure 4 indicates, we find that the notable difference in the sub-
samples CAAR means between the two groups, µH and µL , was sustained for
at least 10 days after the policy announcement was made, and the difference 
remains statistically different from zero for longer windows as well. Thus, the
negative shock in these companies' valuation was not reversed for at least two
weeks after the announcement.15

4     Conclusions
In this paper we employ the event study methodology to estimate how an Ex-
ecutive Order restricting the entry of temporary foreign workers to the U.S.
negatively affected the valuation of 471 publicly traded Fortune 500 firms. To
the best of our knowledge, this paper provides the first set of results on whether,
and to what extent, markets value shocks to employment based immigration pol-
icy in the very short term. We do not view the results reported in this paper as
reflecting equilibrium conditions. Over the medium to long term, it is conceiv-
able that firms respond to this shock by engaging in the process of allocating
resources across geographies (Glennon, 2020). While there may be such long-run
adjustments that firms can make when access to skilled labor supply is abruptly
constrained, we document that there is a significant short-run negative impact.
In this particular instance, the June 22 2020 immigration ban plausibly eroded
valuation to the tune of 100 billion dollars for the firms in our sample. These
results not only contribute to the broader academic debate surrounding whether
or not, and to what extent, skilled work visas create value for firms, but they
also inform the current ongoing policy discussions surrounding H-1B visas in
particular.16
  15 Online Appendix Section D extends this analysis and replicates the estimation for all

trading days between January 1st and June 15th of 2020. We find no evidence of our result
being driven by idiosyncratic factors given that the estimates of  are statistically insignificant
in nearly 93% of the trading days in period. The few exceptions, we argue, can be explained
by the economic context of the particular days.
  16 In July 2020, the US Chamber of Commerce sued the Trump Administration, challenging

the June 22 EO. In an Amicus Brief submitted on August 10, 2020, companies such as Face-
book, Netflix, Adobe, Reddit, GitHub, Paypal, and Amazon argued that the "indiscriminate

B         Growth Distribution
Figure B presents the distribution of the 2016-2019 LCA growth computed as
specified in Equation (4). As can be seen, growth distributes normally, with
high frequency for values -1 and 0 (e.g., firms that went from some to none
LCAs between 2016 and 2019, and firms that experienced no growth whatsoever,
respectively).

                                 [Figure B1 about here.]

    While the median of the distribution corresponds to the value 0 of the dis-
tribution, the mean is -.036, and the 25th and 75th percentiles are -0.011 and 0,
respectively. Table B1 shows that our results are robust to using the mean as
well as the 25th and 75th percentile as the value defining the two sub-samples.17

                                 [Table B1 about here.]




  17 Infact, since the median and the 75th percentile both correspond to zero, the results for
the 75th percentile are the same as in the baseline specification.

 The table reports , the difference between sub-sample means of CAARs for firms with lower (L) and
higher (H) growth rate of LCA applications based on different moments of the growth distribution:
Columns 1 and 2 use the 25th percentile (-0.011), Columns 3 and 4 use the mean (-0.036), and Columns
5 and 6 use the 75th percentile (0). Sub-sample means (µ) and number of firms (N ) belonging to each
sample L and H are also reported in each column. All columns are based on CAARs computed for the
window of days [-1,1]. Results in odd columns are based on simple sub-sample means, while in even
columns are based on within-sector sub-sample means, whereas sector is defined as the firms' reported
1-digit NAICS industry code. Robust standard errors are presented in parenthesis. Robust standard
errors are presented in parenthesis.

C     Robustness for Different Growth Measures
Our results are robust to using all sort of different lengths and measures to
compute growth when it comes to measuring trends in reliance on foreign work-
ers. In particular, we find our results to be robust when computing growth
as CAGR or total growth for 1, 2 or 3 prior to 2019 and when using the to-
tal (nominal) number of LCAs as opposed to share of all employees (thus, our
growth measure is indeed capturing changes in LCAs and not only on firm em-
ployment). A summary of all these results are provided in Tables C1, C2, and
C3 for windows [-1,1], [-1,3] and [-1,5], respectively. They all use the median of
the corresponding growth rate to define the sub-samples.

D     Event studies for prior dates in 2020
An additional conservative test we perform is to make sure our estimates are
indeed related to the context under consideration (the June 22 EO). In order to
do so, we repeat the exercise of estimating the statistical difference in CAARs
between firms with high vs. low CAGR in LCAs, referred to as , for every
trading day between January 1st to June 15th of 2020, a week before the event.
A summary of our results are presented in Figure D. Note that the figure also
includes the estimator for June 22 ­the same result reported in the main body
of the paper­ for comparison purposes.
    The figure shows that for nearly 93% of the 114 trading days between Jan-
uary 1st to June 15th of 2020, the estimates of  are statistically insignificant.
There are three exceptions. The first one is April 21 and 22, when there was
another announcement by President Trump restricting immigration mostly in
the form of family reunification and other immigrant visas, which might as well
have affected the firms in our sample. The second and third exceptions are May
26 and 27, as well as June 4 and 6, with positive point estimates for . In those
dates, however, the market experienced unusually large movements and there-
fore more volatility is expected. Thus, this exercise reinforces our belief that
our main findings do reflect a market reaction to the EO under consideration,
and not any idiosyncratic process that would be more frequent in the data.

This figure plots the results of the estimation of  (as specified in footnote 14) using over 100
dates, all business days between January 1st to June 15th of 2020, using a 3-day (-1 to +1)
window, each day represented by a round marker. The diamond-shaped marker represents the
baseline result discussed in the main body of the paper for comparison purposes. Whiskers
represent 95% confidence intervals using robust standard errors.
