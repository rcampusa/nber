We present a new empirical decomposition of the effects of financial liberalization on economic growth
and on the incidence of crises. Our empirical estimates show that the direct effect of financial liberalization
on growth by far outweighs the indirect effect via a higher propensity to crisis. We also discuss several
models of financial liberalization and growth whose predictions are consistent with our empirical findings.

1         Introduction
There are two contrasting views of financial liberalization. In one view, financial liberalization
strengthens financial development and contributes to higher long-run growth. In another
view, liberalization induces excessive risk-taking, increases macroeconomic volatility and
leads to more frequent crises.

        In this paper we propose an empirical framework that brings these two views together.
We decompose the impact of international financial liberalization on growth into two eﬀects:
a positive direct eﬀect and a negative indirect eﬀect through a higher propensity to crisis.
We find that the direct growth gain of financial liberalization significantly outweighs the
growth loss associated with more frequent financial crises. On net, the eﬀect of financial
liberalization on growth is economically sizeable: around 1% increase in per-capita annual
growth rate.

        The eﬀect of financial liberalization on growth and its impact on financial fragility and the
propensity to crises have been largely studied in separate strands of the empirical literature.
The financial crisis literature tests whether financial liberalization increase the risk of finan-
cial crises. Kaminsky and Reinhart (1998), Detragiache and Demirguc-Kunt (1998), Glick
and Hutchinson (2001) find that the propensity to banking and currency crises increases
in the aftermath of financial liberalization. In contrast, the literature on liberalization and
growth focuses on identifying the eﬀects of liberalization on average long-run growth. For
instance, Bekaert, Harvey and Lundblad (2005) find that stock makert liberalization leads
to an increase of one percentage point in average GDP growth.1 Henry (2000) confirms this
result at the firm level by showing that financial liberalization leads to an investment boom
associated with a decline in the cost of capital.

        The goal of this paper is not to perform another test of the eﬀect of financial liberal-
ization on growth. Instead, its main contribution is to develop an integrated framework
to empirically quantify and contrast the dual eﬀects of financial liberalization: on the one
hand, financial liberalization tends to relax borrowing constraints, leading to higher invest-
ment and higher average growth; on the other hand, it encourages risk-taking, generates
financial fragility and increases the probability of financial crises, which often have severe
    1
        They also identify a similar growth eﬀect of capital account liberalization using a measure of the intensity
of capital account openness proposed by Quinn (1997).

recessionary consequences.

    The contrasting experiences of Thailand and India illustrate the dual eﬀects of financial
liberalization. Thailand, a financially liberalized economy, has experienced lending booms
and crises, while India, a non-liberalized economy, has followed a slow but safe growth path
(see Figure 1). In India GDP per capita grew by only 99% between 1980 and 2001, whereas
Thailand’s GDP per capita grew by 148%, despite having experienced a major crisis.

    We believe that analyzing the eﬀects of financial liberalization in a unified way is impor-
tant. The division of the empirical literature on financial liberalization between the analysis
of the crises and the growth eﬀects has several disadvantages. First, each strand provides
only a partial account on the eﬀect of financial liberalization. The crisis view stresses the
severity of the output costs of financial crises, but largely ignores its growth benefits during
tranquil times. The growth view relies on the estimation of linear growth eﬀects of financial
liberalization. This linear approach captures only the “average” growth eﬀect across the
booms and busts generated by financial liberalization. The second disadvantage is that each
strand has produced its own set of policy implications. Researchers emphasizing the long-run
growth eﬀect advocate financial liberalization policies, while researchers that concentrate on
crises caution against excessive financial liberalization.
    Section 2 contains our empirical findings. Section 3 discusses theoretical mechanisms
consistent with our empirical results. Section 4 concludes.



2     Financial Liberalization, Crises and Growth: an em-
      pirical decomposition
We propose a methodology to decompose the eﬀect of financial liberalization on growth into
two channels: a direct growth channel and an indirect fragility channel. The latter eﬀect
captures a higher frequency of crises and the associated costs in terms of lower growth. The
main advantage of this approach is that it allows us to quantitatively compare the expected
growth benefits of financial liberalization in normal times with the growth costs stemming
from a greater vulnerability to crises.


2.1    Empirical Methodology
Our empirical strategy consists of adding to a standard growth regression a financial liber-
alization dummy and a financial crisis dummy. Furthermore, we treat the financial crisis
dummy as an endogenous variable that depends on several variables including financial lib-
eralization. In this set-up, the impact of financial liberalization on growth is composed of
two eﬀects: (i) a direct eﬀect on growth conditional on a standard set of control variables
and on the absence of financial crisis, and (ii) an indirect eﬀect reflecting the growth costs
associated with a higher propensity to financial crises.

    Formally, the empirical specification combines a growth model and a crisis model. The
growth model has the following panel form with i indexing the country and t indexing the
time period :

                                                       crisis
                            yi,t = αXi,t + βF Li,t + γIi,t    + εi,t ,                    (1)

where yi,t is real per-capita GDP growth, Xi,t is a set of control variables standard in the
                                                                         crisis
growth literature, F Li,t is a dummy for financial liberalization , and Ii,t    is a dummy
variable taking on a value of one if country i experiences a financial crisis in period t and
zero otherwise. Lastly, εi,t is a random component.
                                                 crisis
       The crisis model treats the crisis dummy Ii,t    as an endogenous variable which depends
on the realization of an unobserved latent variable Wjt∗ in the following way:

                                                  ⎧
                                                  ⎨ 1 if W ∗ > 0
                                       crisis             it
                                      Ii,t      =                                                    (2)
                                                  ⎩ 0 otherwise
                                        Wjt∗ = aZi,t + bF Li,t + η it .

The latent variable Ijt∗ is assumed to depend linearly on a set of control variables Zi,t , on the
financial liberalization dummyF Li,t and on a random component η it . Under the assumption
that η it v N(0, 1), the crisis model can be rewritten as:
                           ⎧
                           ⎨ 1 with probability : Pr(W ∗ > 0) = Φ(aZ + bF L )
                crisis                                it            i,t      i,t
               Ii,t      =
                           ⎩ 0 with probability: Pr(W ∗ ≤ 0) = 1 − Φ(aZi,t + bF Li,t )
                                                       it

where Φ is the cumulative distribution function of a standard normal. Thus, the parameters
of the crisis model can be estimated using a probit model.

       Notice that the mixed model described by (1)-(2) is equivalent to a treatment eﬀects
model for which standard estimation techniques have been developed (see Heckman (1978)
and Maddala (1993)).

       Estimation Procedure
       In the treatment eﬀects model representation, the crisis dummy captures the “treatment”,
the growth regression (1) is the “outcome” equation and regression (2) is the “treatment”
equation representing the likelihood to receive the treatment.2 As shown by Maddala (1983),
the model can be consistently estimated using a two-step procedure under the assumption
that the error terms εi,t and η it are bivariate normal but not independent. In the first step,
one obtains probit estimates of the probability of crisis:

                                 crisis
                             Pr(Ii,t    = 1) = Pr(Wit∗ > 0) = Φ(azi,t + bF Li,t )                    (3)

where Φ is the standard normal cumulative distribution function. Using the probit estimates

and Rubinstein (2004) to study the growth eﬀect of exchange rate regimes in the presence of a currency
crisis.

sistent estimates for the parameters (α, β, γ) of the growth model by augmenting regression
(1) with the hazard hi,t .4

       The total eﬀect of financial liberalization, the impact of a change in the financial liberal-
ization dummy from zero to one, is the sum of a direct eﬀect (γ) and an indirect eﬀect due
to a change in the probability of crisis:

                                                                              n                          o

       As discussed in the introduction, the existing empirical literature on financial liberal-
ization has focused either on the estimation of variations of the growth model, using linear
techniques, or on the estimation of the crisis model using a probit specification. In contrast,
our procedure allows us to jointly estimate the linear growth regression model and the probit
model of crisis.

       Based on the literature, e.g. Bekaert and Harvey (2005) and Kaminsky and Reinhart
(2000), our prior is that the direct eﬀect of financial liberalization on growth is positive ,
while the indirect eﬀect — via a greater likelihood of crisis — is negative.

       The non-linearity of the probit specification is, in principle, suﬃcient to identify the model
and, in particular, to distinguish the direct from the indirect eﬀect of financial liberalization.
However, Arellano (2006) shows that such an empirical strategy is likely to result in weak
identification. Hence, we introduce in the probit regression some variables that are excluded

       The hazard is given by:
                                 ⎧

from the growth regression.5,6

       The selection of the probit model specification is done using the Aikaike information
criterion. In the probit equation we initially include , along with the financial liberalization
dummy, all the control variables from the growth regression and the excluded variables in
their the first, second and third lags. We then select the specification that minimizes the
Aikaike criterion. Finally, the standard errors in both the growth estimates and the probit
estimates are clustered at the country level and are adjusted to be robust to heteroskedas-
ticity.

       The specification of the growth model and the crisis model at the same annual frequency
is convenient for the estimation. A disadvantage is that the estimation of the growth equation
using annual data does not allow us to filter out fluctuations at the business cycle frequency.
To deal with this issue, we modify the model to combine a growth equation estimated using
five-year averages with a probit crisis model estimated at an annual frequency. The first
step of the estimation - the probit regression - is identical, but the second step is modified
to take into account the possibility that a country is hit by a crisis in any given year during
the five-year interval.


2.2        Data
The sample consists of a set of sixty countries for which we have information on the dates
of financial crises and financial liberalization over the period 1980-2002. The complete de-
scription of the sources and the construction of the variables used in the regression analysis
are presented in Appendix A.

       We use two sources for the dates of financial liberalization: a de jure binary indicator
is constructed using the oﬃcial dates of equity market liberalization described in Beckaert
and Harvey (2005), and a de facto binary indicator is based on the identification of country-
specific trend breaks in private capital flows.7 We view these two indicators as providing
complementary information on the process of financial liberalization. The de jure indicator
identifies the timing of a formal regulatory change that allows foreign investors to invest in

       The excluded regressors are chosen among variables that have been found to be robust determinants of
crises, but do not seem to have a systematic independent linear eﬀect on growth.

domestic equity securities. The de facto indicator detects the timing of an actual change
in the pattern of foreign inflows and it covers portfolio flows, bank flows and foreign direct
investments. Appendix C presents the dates of liberalization for the countries in the sample.

       We chose to focus on financial crises that are characterized by the coincidence of a banking
crisis and a currency crisis. The main reason for this is that these so-called "twin" crises
are largely concentrated in financially liberalized economies. The Mexican and Asian crises
are the most prominent examples of twin crises but, actually, the incidence of “twin” crises
has been relatively widespread, occurring in such diverse parts of the world as in Latin
America in the early and mid-1980s and in Scandinavia in the early 1990s. The twin crisis
dummy variable is obtained by combining the systemic banking crises indicator of Caprio and
Klingebiel (2003) and the currency crises indicator of Glick and Hutchinson (2001).8 Caprio
and Klingebiel (2003) define a systemic banking crisis as a situation where the aggregate
value of the banking system liabilities exceeds the value of its assets. Glick and Hutchinson
(2001) construct an indicator of currency crises based on “large” changes in an index of
currency pressure, defined as a weighted average of real exchange rate changes and reserve
losses.9 Appendix C presents the dates of twin crises for the countries in the sample.

       The dependent variable in the growth model is computed as the log diﬀerence in real per
capita income. The set of controls for the growth equation is standard and includes initial
per capita income, population growth, government size, trade openness and inflation. As
discussed in section 2.1, the list of potential explanatory variables in the probit equation
includes the regressors of the growth equation. It also contains the two following variables
that are excluded from the growth equation: a measure of real exchange rate overvaluation
computed as deviation from a HP trend and the ratio of M2 to reserves. All the variables are
introduced as their first, second and third lags. The minimization of the Aikaike criterion
selects the final list of crises determinants and the optimal lag structure.

jure financial liberalization index, while specification [2] includes the de facto liberalization
index.10

   The main results can be summarized as follows. First, financial liberalization has a direct
                                         b > 0). This eﬀect is significant at the 1 percent
positive eﬀect on per capita GDP growth (β
confidence level in both equations. Its point estimate is very similar for the two liberalization
indices: 1 percentage point for the de jure index and 1.1 percentage points for the de facto
index. Second, the incidence of twin crises, estimated through the probit equation, has a
                           γ < 0). The point estimate of b
negative impact on growth (b                             γ —i.e. the reduction in growth
conditional on experiencing a crisis— is in the range (−0.099, −0.11). This range is consistent
with findings in the crisis literature.

       Third, financial liberalization significantly increases the probability of a twin crisis.11
Real exchange rate overvaluation, inflation and openness to trade are also associated with a
higher probability of crisis. As the probit model is non-linear, the partial eﬀect of a change
in one variable on the crisis probability depends on the value of the other variables. For our
purpose, we are interested in the average partial eﬀect of financial liberalization on the crisis

probability: E Φ(b azi,t + bb) − Φ(b

is on average associated with an increase in the probability of a twin crisis by 1.45 percentage
point for the de facto index and by 1.93 percentage point for the de jure index.12

       We compute the indirect growth cost of financial liberalization on annual per capita
GDP growth by multiplying the estimate of the growth cost of a crisis (b      γ ) by the average
                                                                      n                         o
                                                                         azi,t + bb) − Φ(b
partial eﬀect of financial liberalization on the crisis probability (E Φ(b               azi,t ) ).
This indirect growth cost ranges from −0.14 to −0.19 percentage points of annual growth,
meaning that it is five to seven times smaller than the direct growth eﬀect.

       Table 2 summarizes the decomposition of the eﬀects of financial liberalization on growth.

       The selection of the probit model specification is done according to the Aikaike criterion which explains
why the set of explanatory variables diﬀers between [1] and [2]. Notice that the ratio of M2/Reserves has
been included in the initial probit equation but has not been selected in the specification that minimizes the
Aikaike criterion.

     The estimated diﬀerence in the probability of a twin crisis associated with a change from zero to one

of the financial liberalization dummy is given by Φ(b               azi,t ). Hence bb > 0 means that financial
liberalization increases ceteris paribus the probability of a crisis.
   12
      In our sample the annual unconditional probability of a twin crisis is 2.3%
The total growth eﬀect of financial liberalization is slightly below 1 percentage point of
annual GDP growth, a magnitude in line with previous estimates in the literature.13

       As a first robustness test, we check whether our results survive if the growth equation
is estimated using data averaged in five-year intervals. In Table 3, we present the results of
the estimation of a modified version of the treatment eﬀects model where the probit crisis
model is estimated at an annual frequency while the growth model is estimated using a panel
of data averaged over five-year non overlapping intervals.14 The period of estimation covers
1981-2000 and contains four five-year intervals.

       In the five-year average panel, the index of financial liberalization and the index of finan-
cial crises in the growth equation represent the fraction of years during which a country has
been liberalized or has experienced a crisis within a five-year interval. Since the two-step
estimates of the growth model in five-year averages are computed using the results of the
probit model presented in Table 1, we only report the estimates for the growth equation in
Table 3. The results are similar to the ones obtained using data at annual frequency. The
direct eﬀect of financial liberalization is almost identical while the growth costs of crises are
slightly more pronounced. The growth eﬀect of inflation is now insignificant while the eﬀect
of trade openness becomes stronger. The other regressors have more or less the same impact.
Table 4 presents the decomposition of the eﬀects of financial liberalization on growth. In
comparison to the growth model estimated with annual data, both the direct growth benefit
and the indirect growth cost are a little higher but the resulting total eﬀect is very similar
for both the de jure index and the de facto index.
  13
       For instance, Bekaert, Harvey and Lundblad (2005), using a de facto index, find that financial liberal-
ization leads to a one percentage point increase in annual growth.

       As a second robustness check, we introduce the measure of real exchange rate overvalua-
tion in the growth equation in specification [1] in Table 3. As we suppress the only exclusion
restriction, the non-linearity of the probit model becomes the only source of identification of
the model. We find that the eﬀect of real exchange rate overvaluation on growth is negative
but very small and insignificant. Our main results survive in this specification although both
the direct and the indirect eﬀects of financial liberalization on growth are slightly weaker
(+0.94% and −0.13%)


2.4        Country Estimates
To illustrate our results, we now turn to country specific estimates of the treatment eﬀect
model, restricting the analysis to the subset of countries that experienced financial liber-
alization within the sample period. First, we fit the model to the data in order to obtain
the predicted growth rate and the predicted probability of crisis for each country and each
year.15 Second, for each country we compute the mean predicted growth rate and the
mean probability of crisis before and after financial liberalization. Using these mean values,
for each country we compute : (i) the predicted change in growth between the pre and
post-liberalization period; and (ii) the predicted change in the indirect growth cost of crisis
between the pre and post-liberalization periods.

       The results are presented in Figure 2. For most of the countries, the predicted change
in growth is between 1 and 1.5 percentage points. This change is slightly higher than
the marginal total eﬀect of financial liberalization, as it also reflects changes in the other
  15
       The model is fitted using the estimation of the treatment model based on the de jure index of financial
liberalization (see regression [1], Table 1).
regressors, such as an increase in trade openness. In comparison, the predicted change in
the indirect growth cost of a crisis is much smaller, around −0.25 percentage points.16

       Finally, Figure 3 contrasts the change in growth between the pre and post-liberalization
period predicted by the treatment eﬀect model with the change observed in the data. Al-
though the empirical model is parsimonious, it does a reasonable job of describing the dif-
ference in growth patterns before and after liberalization. In 15 out of the 25 cases, the
predicted change in growth is closer than one percentage point to the diﬀerential observed
in the data, and in eight cases it is closer than half of a percentage point. However, there
are six cases for which the model predicts an increase in growth while a decrease has been
observed.17

       Our key finding is that the direct positive eﬀect of financial liberalization on growth by
far outweighs its indirect eﬀect through a higher propensity for twin crises. In order to
understand this result, one should keep in mind that even in financially liberalized countries
crises remain rare events. Therefore, even if crises can have large output consequences
when they occur, their estimated growth eﬀect remains modest. In contrast, since financial
liberalization is likely to improve the access to external finance, it has a first order impact
on growth.


3        Theoretical Discussion
What are the theoretical mechanisms that can account for the dual eﬀects of financial lib-
eralization observed in the data? In this section, we discuss three models of the eﬀects of
financial liberalization that deliver predictions consistent with the empirical findings pre-
sented in Section 2.

       The interaction between financial liberalization policies and capital market imperfections
is at the core of the three models. In Ranciere, Tornell, and Westermann (2003), financial
  16
       Interestingly, there are several countries, such as Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Israel, where the pre-
dicted probability of a crisis, and thus the growth cost of crisis, has decreased after financial liberalization.
This finding primarily reflects the decrease in the level of inflation has decreased in the post-liberalization
period.
  17
     In two cases, Israel and Colombia, the disappointing growth performance can be attributed to political
factors. In the case of Japan, it can be attributed to the long lasting banking crisis of the 90s that is not
counted as a twin crisis.
liberalization relaxes borrowing constraints and increases growth, but also generates systemic
risk which results in occasional crises. In Martin and Rey (2005), stock market liberalization
and financial frictions in asset markets interact to generate either investment booms or
financial crashes. In Dell’Arricia and Marquez (2004a, 2004b) financial liberalization leads
to less screening by banks, which gives rise to boom-bust credit cycles.

       Ranciere,Tornell, and Westermann (2003) develop a model where asymmetries between
the tradeable (T) and no-tradeable (N) sectors are key to understanding the link between
liberalization and growth. Because liberalization has not been accompanied by judicial
reform, severe contract enforceability problems have persisted in many developing economies.
While many T-sector firms can overcome these problems in a liberalized economy by accessing
international capital markets, most N-sector firms cannot. Thus N-sector firms are financially
constrained and depend on domestic bank credit.

       Financial liberalization induces higher growth by accelerating financial deepening and
thus increasing the investment of financially constrained firms, most of which are in the
N-sector. However, the easing of financial constraints is associated with the undertaking of
insolvency risk, which often takes the form of foreign currency denominated debt backed
by N-sector output. Insolvency risk arises because financial liberalization not only lifts re-
strictions that preclude risk-taking, but is also associated with explicit and implicit systemic
bailout guarantees covering creditors against systemic crises. Not surprisingly, an important
share of capital inflows takes the form of risky flows to the financial sector, and the economy
as a whole experiences aggregate fragility and occasional crises.18

       Rapid N-sector growth helps the T-sector grow faster by providing abundant and cheap
inputs. Thus, as long as a crisis does not occur, growth in a risky economy is more rapid
than it is in a safe one. Of course, financial fragility implies that a self-fulfilling crisis may
occur. And, during a crisis, GDP growth falls and typically turns negative. Crises must be
rare, however, in order to occur in equilibrium–otherwise agents would not find it profitable
to take on credit risk in the first place. Thus, average long-run growth may be faster along
a risky path than along a safe one.

       Martin and Rey (2005) analyze the impact of stock market liberalization on capital flows,
  18
       For instance, the ratio of foreign liabilities to money in the banking sector, a measure often used to
proxy for currency mismatches, increased in Thailand from 50 percent in 1990 to 240 percent in 1996.
asset prices and investment. They show that when there are transaction costs in international
assets, stock market liberalization can lead to two possible outcomes for an emerging market
economy. Under normal circumstances, liberalization performs the positive role of generat-
ing capital inflows, expanding diversification opportunities and lowering the cost of capital,
thus leading to higher investment and growth. However, under certain circumstances, ”pes-
simistic” expectations about the state of the economy can be self-fulfilling, leading to a fall
in the demand for assets, capital outflows and financial crashes associated with low invest-
ment and low growth. The key element for this mechanism to operate is that the decision
to invest by one agent influences the cost of capital of other investors through the impact of
that decision on income and the price of assets.

   Dell’Arricia and Marquez (2004a, 2004b) propose a framework where financial liberaliza-
tion leads to rapid lending development driven by a reduction in banks’ screening incentives.
In their model, banks’ incentives to screen potential borrowers come from adverse selection
among banks —banks screen to avoid financing firms whose projects have been tested and
rejected by other banks. When financial markets are liberalized and many new and untested
projects request funding, banks do not have strong incentives to screen their pool of ap-
plicants and rapid credit expansion ensues. In this case, financial liberalization increases
investment and growth but also leads to a deterioration in the quality of the average bank’s
portfolio that will result in financial fragility. At the macroeconomic level, as negative shocks
occur, financial fragility will give way to financial crises and output losses.

   In the models discussed above financial liberalization alleviates the consequences of cap-
ital market imperfections, but does so at the cost of increasing financial fragility. Hence,
the overall eﬀect of financial liberalization on growth is the result of a risk-return trade-oﬀ.
A financially liberalized economy grows faster in normal times, but is exposed to severe
output contractions during financial crises. The direct growth eﬀect dominates under two
conditions: First, financial liberalization must strongly reduce financial constraints and help
firms increase investment through higher leverage. Second, the frequency of financial crises
must be low enough for risk-taking to pay oﬀ. The regression analysis presented in section
2 suggests that these two conditions are consistent with the data.
4     Conclusions
Several observers have claimed that financial liberalization is not good for growth because
of the crises associated with it. This is, however, the wrong lesson to draw. Our empirical
analysis shows that financial liberalization leads to faster average long-run growth, even
though it also leads to occasional crises.
    We find that in a large sample of countries, financial liberalization typically leads to fi-
nancial fragility and occasional financial crises. In net terms, however, financial liberalization
has led to faster long-run growth. Although crises are costly and have severe recessionary
eﬀects, they are rare events. Therefore, over the long run, the pro-growth eﬀects of greater
financial deepening and more investment by far outweigh the detrimental growth eﬀects of
financial fragility and a greater incidence of crises.

Appendix B: Construction of the de facto Financial Liberalization Index

It is a de facto index that signals the year when a country has liberalized. We construct the index by
looking for trend-breaks in financial flows. We identify trend-breaks by applying the CUSUM test of
Brown et. al. (1975) to the time trend of the data. This method tests for parameter stability based on
the cumulative sum of the recursive residuals. To determine the date of financial liberalization we
consider net cumulative capital inflows (KI).1A country is financially liberalized (FL) at year t if: (i)
KI has a trend break at or before t and there is at least one year with a KI-to-GDP ratio greater than
5% at or before t, or (ii) its KI-to-GDP ratio is greater than 10% at or before t. The 5% and 10%
thresholds reduce the possibility of false liberalization and false non-liberalization signals,
respectively.

When the cumulative sum of residuals starts to deviate from zero, it may take a few years until this
deviation is statistically significant. In order to account for the delay problem, we choose the year
where the cumulative sum of residuals deviates from zero, provided that it eventually crosses the 5%
significance level. The FL index does not allow for policy reversals: once a country liberalizes it
never becomes close thereafter. Since our sample period is 1980-2000, we consider that our approach
is the correct one to analyse the effects of liberalization on long-run growth and financial fragility.2




1
  We compute cumulative net capital inflows of non-residents since 1980. Capital inflows include FDI,
portfolio flows and bank flows. The data series are from the IFS: lines 78BUDZF, 78BGDZF and 78BEDZ. For
some countries not all three series are available for all years. In this case, we use the inflows to the banking
system only, which is available for all country-years.
2
 If after liberalization a country suffers a sharp reversal in capital flows (like in a financial crisis), it might
exhibit a second breakpoint. In our sample, however, this possibility is not present: the trend breaks due to
crises are never large enough to show up in significant CUSUM test statistics.
