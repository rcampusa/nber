                                         ABSTRACT

Economic agents face many different types of economic incentives when making financial and
moral decisions. We provide experimental data from a population that uniquely responds to
incentives to lie compared to previously studied populations. We conduct a standard 6-sided die
rolling lying study within a population that believes that God has knowledge of all their actions.
Within this population, we find that those who attend church frequently appear to refrain from
lying while those that do not frequently attend church do lie, but do not disguise their lies like
more secular populations. We further explain how our data fits into the theoretical work on lying.

1. Introduction
That people lie is no surprise. Predicting who will lie and by how much is more complex. If
people are willing to dishonestly exploit a situation, will they do so to the fullest extent
possible or somewhat less? These questions are important to businesses, governments, and
religious groups regarding the people with whom they interact and have implications for
optimal institutional design. (Hanna and Wang, 2017) Prior research has shown that
groups of individuals are either honest appearing or they engage in a form of disguised
(partial) lying. In this paper, we present an experimental study with the first population
that does not appear to disguise lying.


Our study builds upon lying studies such as Fischbacher and Föllmi-Heusi (2013).
Earnings are based on self-reported rolls of a standard 6-sided die conducted in private.
Significant deviations from a uniform distribution of reported values are interpreted as
evidence of lying. Fischbacher and Föllmi-Heusi (2013) found that in aggregate, subjects
report the highest paying number at a frequency which significantly exceeds 1/6, which
they interpret as significant evidence of lying within the population. Interestingly, they
also observe significant over-reporting of the second highest paying number, which they
interpret as an attempt to “disguise” lying from the experimenter. These findings have
been widely replicated, and a variety of explanations for this behavior have been offered.
See Abeler et al. (2018) for a detailed survey and meta-analysis of the literature.


A small number of studies have found both reduced lying and insignificant evidence of
lying in religious populations (see Shalvi and Leiser 2013, Arbel et al. 2014, Bar-El and
Tobol 2017). In these religious populations, lying continues to be disguised. Utikal and
Fishbacher (2013) find in a subject pool of nuns significant over-reporting of the lowest
earning and second lowest earning die rolls. We believe our study to be the first to find
significant evidence of lying without an accompanying attempt to disguise it.


We conducted a die-rolling experiment at a large U.S. faith-based University in which
47.3% of our sample report attending church at least once per week. Although this
proportion vastly exceeds what might be expected at most U.S. universities, the 2014
Religious Landscape Study (Pew, 2014) reports that 36% of the US population attends
church weekly. We attribute the lack of disguised lying in our study to the participants’
self-reported belief that God “Always watches our actions”. If subjects believe that God is
watching their actions, any misrepresentation of a die roll, large or small, is equally
onerous.       Further we find that undisguised lying is inversely correlated with the
frequency of church attendance. We find no evidence of lying in subjects who attend
services at least weekly.


2. Experimental Methods and Procedure 1
All participants roll a standard 6-sided die twice in private behind a visually isolated
divider. Subjects receive payment of $0.40 per number reported in one roll ($0.40 for a roll
of ‘1’ and $2.40 for a roll of ‘6’) and $0.10 per number reported in the remaining die roll. 2
Subjects complete a survey of basic demographics, frequency of church attendance, and
whether subjects perceived that God “always”, “sometimes”, “rarely”, or “never” watches
our actions. We randomize over whether subjects are given the survey before or after
reporting their die rolls, lest a reminder of belief in divine omniscience affect behavior.
(Ariely, 2008) Summary statistics are presented in Table 1.

All 53 subjects were recruited in person outside of university cafeterias or libraries and
made decisions on Ztree (Fischbacher, 2007). Subjects completed the experiment and
survey in around 10 minutes. All earnings were paid in cash.

3. Results
From Table 1, our sample almost universally (92.5%) agrees that God is always watching
their actions. This would imply that even behind a visually isolated divider, these subjects
believe God has complete knowledge of what they do. Figure 1 reports the frequency of
self-reported outcomes for our entire subject pool in Panel A and by frequency of church
attendance in Panels B and C. 95% confidence intervals around the expected frequency of
1/6 are indicated. Within the entire subject pool, the highest paying outcome is reported at
over twice its expected frequency (two-tailed binary test of mean = 1/6; p<0.001), with all
other outcomes occurring within a 95% confidence interval of their expected frequency.
We interpret this as evidence that within our more religious subject pool, most of whom
report believing that God is always watching them, there is evidence of lying “big” but with
no concealed lying. This is in sharp contrast to the disguised lying commonly found in
more secular subject pools (see Abeler et al. 2018). Our sample either “sins big” or they
appear to not lie at all (e.g. they “go home”). No attempt appears to be made to disguise a
lie, presumably because such actions reduce the benefit of the lie without reducing the cost
(e.g. they believe God knows that they have lied.) Results are indistinguishable whether
the survey was administered before or after reporting die rolls. (two-tailed Mann-Whitney,
p>0.1).
Figure 1: Histograms of Die Rolls




Notes: 95% Confidence Interval around the expected mean of 1/6 indicated in each
column.


However, we do see a significant effect related to frequency of church attendance. Panel B
reports frequencies for the 39.6% of our sample that attend church frequently (at least
once per week) and Panel C the 60.4% that do not. Die rolls by frequent church attenders
occur within the 95% confidence interval and are indistinguishable from random die rolls.
However, infrequent church attenders report rolling a 6 (the highest paid roll) at
significantly more than expected (45.3%; p<0.0001) and a 1 significantly less often than
expected (p<0.05), which we interpret as significant evidence of lying. Self-reported rolls of
5 and 4 are within the 95% confidence interval for infrequent church attenders. We
interpret these results as evidence that infrequent church attenders, most of whom state a
belief that God is watching their actions, are willing to lie but do not attempt to disguise it.


We find additional evidence that the distributions of self-reported die rolls differ by
frequency of church attendance. A Kruskal-Wallis test rejects the null hypothesis of
frequent and infrequent church attenders’ self-reported rolls being drawn from the same
distribution (p<0.05). Infrequent church attenders report an average roll of 4.45, while
frequent church attenders report a significantly lower 3.64 (two-tailed Mann-Whitney,
p<0.05). Infrequent church attenders report rolling 6 (highest payout) in 45.3% of rolls
versus 19.0% for frequent church attenders (MW, p<0.01). The average sum of both rolls
for infrequent church attenders is 8.91, marginally higher than that of frequent church
attenders at 7.29 (MW, p<0.1). In expectation, only 2.8% of subjects should report two die
rolls of 6 for maximum payout. 21.9% of infrequent church attenders report this outcome,
vastly exceeding the expected value of 2.8 (binary test p<0.001). In contrast, 4.8% of
frequent church attenders report this outcome, which does not significantly differ from
expectations, (binary test, p>0.1) and marginally less often than infrequent church
attenders (MW, p<0.1).

We further explore our results with regression analysis, reported in Table 2. First, we
specify each reported roll as a function of explanatory variables and a subject-level random
effect. In this specification (column 1), we find that frequent church attenders report lower
die rolls at a 5% level. Using a probit with subject-level random effects, we find in column 2
that frequent church attenders are significantly less likely to report a “6”. Finally, in
column 3 we find that the sum of die rolls reported by frequent church attenders is
significantly smaller.
The statistical reliability of regression results in experimental studies is sometimes called
into question because of the small sample sizes frequently used. In Table 2, we report the
statistical significance of our estimated coefficients using randomized inference. These
techniques allow comparison of the behavior of our experimental subjects with the
distribution of 10,000 computer generated repetitions of our experiment with honest
reporting of die rolls. See Athey and Imbens (2017) and Paz and West (2019).


4. Discussion and Conclusion
We find that a subset of our experimental subjects who report believing that God is always
watching their actions are often still willing to lie, but do not attempt to disguise it in
contrast to behavior observed in less overtly religious samples. This is consistent with the
“Reputation for Honesty” model of lying in Abeler et al. (2018) in that a population who
believes God is always watching is in a state of perfect observability and thus those who lie
should do so in full. Our data suggests a heterogeneity in the utility for reputation for
honesty, in which those who attend church less frequently appear to have a lower
threshold to trade their reputation for monetary gain. Alternatively, our results could be
explained with a fixed cost for lying in this population that varies not with the degree of
lying but instead with the extent to which they practice their faith.


This is the first laboratory population in the economics literature that has been observed to
lie without attempted obfuscation. Frequent church attending subjects, who appear
statistically honest, pay significant opportunity costs to attend church regularly. Such
costly sacrifices have been shown to be an efficient economic mechanism to separate
cooperators from free-riders in public goods provision environments (Aimone et al. 2014).
Similarly, our study contributes to the general work on religiosity and economic decision
making, such as Benjamin, Choi, and Fisher (2016), who examine the effect of religious
identity across a broad array of economic environments.
