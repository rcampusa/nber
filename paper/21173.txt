Maintaining Central-Bank Financial Stability under New-Style Central Banking

NBER Working Paper No. 21173
May 2015, Revised July 2015
JEL No. E42,E58

                                              ABSTRACT

Since 2008, the central banks of advanced countries have borrowed trillions of dollars from their commercial
banks in the form of interest-paying reserves and invested the proceeds in portfolios of risky assets.
We investigate how this new style of central banking affects central banks' solvency. A central bank
is insolvent if its requirement to pay dividends to its government exceeds its income by enough to
cause an unending upward drift in its debts to commercial banks. We consider three sources of risk
to central banks: interest-rate risk (the Federal Reserve), default risk (the European Central Bank),
and exchange-rate risk (central banks of small open economies). We find that a central bank that pays
dividends equal to a standard concept of net income will always be solvent—its reserve obligations
will not explode. In some circumstances, the dividend will be negative, meaning that the government
is making a payment to the bank. If the charter does not provide for payments in that direction, then
reserves will tend to grow more in crises than they shrink in normal times. To prevent this buildup,
the charter needs to provide for makeup reductions in payments from the bank to the government.
We compute measures of the financial strength of central banks, and discuss how different institutions
interact with quantitative easing policies to put these banks in less or more danger of instability. We
conclude that the risks to financial stability are real in theory, but remote in practice today.

   The Bank of Japan in the 1990s, followed in the 2000s by the Federal Reserve, the
European Central Bank, the Bank of England, and the Swiss National Bank, made dramatic
changes in the conduct of monetary policy in response to financial crises. They borrowed
trillions of dollars from commercial banks by expanding reserves and paying positive or
receiving negative interest on them, while using the proceeds to enlarge their holdings of
government bonds and other risky investments. Critics of the new style of central-bank
policy worry that, either once market interest rates begin to rise as the crisis recedes, or
if the bonds in the central bank’s portfolio default, or if the exchange rate rises suddenly,
these central banks will come under stress. Might the double burden of capital losses on
central banks’ portfolios and the rising cost of paying market interest on trillions of dollars
of reserves threaten the banks’ financial stability?
   In Appendix A, we survey the literature on central bank financial stability. Studies have
so far fallen into two strands. The first investigates how central-bank capital may affect
monetary policy and inflation. This research takes as given that the central bank remains
solvent, and explores the effect of different policies on inflation, under that constraint. The
second strand characterizes circumstances when the central bank capital can be negative,
focussing on the peculiar accounting rules of central banks and on the items in their balance
sheet. Because of this focus, that literature’s lessons apply only to the central bank under
study, usually the Federal Reserve, but do not extend to other institutional setups.
   Our approach is different. We take as given the commitment to a target for inflation,
and explore whether the central bank is financially stable. We provide an economic analysis
of how the central bank’s charter determines whether the bank faces the danger of exploding
reserves. Our theory is simple but flexible enough to accommodate most central banks
in the world. Our formal model of central bank risk, founded in modern finance theory,
describes the evolution of a central bank’s financial position, and shows when can it become
unsustainable. We spell out why a central bank’s reserves may be on an exploding path and
which institutions and policies protect against exploding reserves and guarantee financial
stability.
   We start by laying out the resource constraint faced by the central bank, focusing on
the path of reserves. Central banks are unique among financial institutions in their power
to compel banks to make loans to the central bank in the form of reserves. We introduce
three forms of risk to the assets of the central bank: interest-rate risk that comes with the



                                               2
central bank holding long-term bonds that fall in value when interest rates rise; default risk
that comes with holding bonds that may become impaired in some states of the world; and
exchange-rate risk that arises when central banks hold foreign currency and gold in their
assets.
   Section 2 spells out the meaning of central-bank financial stability. A central bank is
an independent arm of government whose relation to the government is contractual. In
particular, the bank has a dividend rule in its charter governing the cash flows from the
bank to the government and—potentially—the cash flows from the government to the bank.
There is a bias toward cash flowing from the bank to the government because the char-
ter generally specifies that the bank can issue growing volumes of currency and thus earn
seignorage. A central bank can always meet its obligation to deliver the mandated dividend
to the government because it has the unlimited power to borrow from commercial banks by
issuing reserves. But a central bank cannot continue as a functioning financial institution
independent of the government if it appears to be on a path of issuing an exploding volume
of reserves. In that case, a central bank would be engaging in a Ponzi scheme. A principal
objective of the paper is to derive conditions under which a central bank is financially stable,
in the precise sense that its volume of reserves is a stationary function of the state of the
economy. To put it differently, we ask what dividend rules prevent a central-bank Ponzi
scheme.
   We apply the theory in section 3 to appraise the current financial strength of the Federal
Reserve. We show that the new obligation to pay rising interest rates as the economy returns
to normal barely has an effect on outstanding reserves and does not threaten an explosion
of reserves. However, quantitative easing in response to a financial crisis, by expanding
the Fed’s portfolio of government bonds and significantly lengthening its maturity, exposes
the Fed to capital losses during the recovery from the crisis, when interest rates rise. We
find that in almost all conditions the Fed would be able to withstand this interest-rate risk
and would resume paying a substantial positive dividend to the Treasury after some years
of zero dividend. At that point, reserves would be back to their normal level, so there is
no threat that the crisis would trigger a permanent increase in reserves. The answer to
the question—is the Fed at risk for losing the ability to stabilize prices because it becomes
financially unstable?—is an unambiguous no, given the historical volatility of interest rates
and bond prices.



                                               3
   We discuss how different policies for managing the exit from quantitative easing affect the
stability of the Fed in the face of interest-rate risk. We show that if the only concern was to
minimize the risk of an explosion of reserves, the Fed would unwind the QE bulge in its bond
portfolio before raising interest rates. Our theory also allows us to study the institutional
practice of not marking losses to market. We show that this does not affect the present
value of losses, but only their time path. Marking to market leads to large reported losses at
the time of exit from the crisis, followed by reported gains. The accounting conventions of
the Fed smooth reported income, reducing the negative reported income when the economy
returns to normal after a crisis, but lowering reported income for several years later.
   Section 5 focuses on default risk by applying the model to the ECB’s finances. One result
is that if default risk is priced into the bonds that the central bank buys, then it has a small
effect on financial stability. Otherwise, the ECB could suffer significant losses. This section
also studies the role that repurchase agreements, which are short-term debt obligations of
banks collateralized by bonds and other securities, have on the solvency of the central bank.
The ECB has traditionally held a substantial fraction of its assets as repos. We find that,
as long as banks meet their obligations to repay the loans even when the collateral value
declines, the ECB’s repo position significantly limits the risk of instability because the ECB
suffers capital losses only if the banks fail to repay the debt and the collateral loses value by
more than the repo haircut. Only if there is a comprehensive financial meltdown such that
repos suffer default would the ECB’s stability be compromised.
   In 2015, the ECB announced it would significantly increase the size of its balance sheet,
and move towards direct holdings of bonds and away from repos. We conclude that this
policy increases the potential losses the ECB might incur and so increases the risk to the
ECB’s stability.
   Section 6 turns to exchange-rate risk. We show that foreign reserves lead to volatile net
income for a central bank often leading to losses. We conjecture that this is the reason why
central banks in many developing countries have considerable power to retain earnings and
run large deferred accounts. These institutions allow these central banks to deal with their
heightened risk of negative income.
   Exchange rate pegs are a practice that can lead to central bank reserve explosion. We
consider both the case of a central bank trying to defend a peg, as well as the more recent
experience of the Swiss National Bank. We show how the decision of the SNB to abandon



                                               4
its peg can be justified as a response to a serious risk to its stability. Finally, we find that
a central bank that undertakes a successful inflation stabilization program will often see its
stability compromised, and illustrate this finding with the example of emerging markets.
     New-style central banking, with large balance sheets and payment of interest on reserves,
makes the topic of central bank stability relevant and important. We conclude that central
banks with inappropriate dividend rules may face the risk of reserve explosion, and that
this may happen under a variety of scenarios. But we also conclude that the risks of this
happening to the Fed and the ECB are remote and that losses can be managed by a temporary
buildup of reserves that is reversed well before the next major adverse shock is likely to occur.
We show how several institutions, including central bank deferred accounts, mark-to-market
accounting, repurchase agreements, and exchange rate pegs can have a significant effect on
the stability of the central bank.


1          The Resource Constraint of the Central Bank
A central bank issues reserves, which are one-period debt claims on the central bank held
by commercial banks. We denote their real value by V in units of output. Reserves are the
economy’s unit of value. One unit of output costs p units of reserves; p is the price level.
The real value of a unit of reserves is 1/p. The central bank has the power to issue reserves
to commercial banks and to use the proceeds to buy securities, usually government debt.
Modern central banks pay interest, positive or negative, on reserves.

1.1        The financial environment
We use the scalar s to denote the state of the economy, which obeys a Markov process in the
set {1, · · · , S}, and has a transition probability ωs,s0 , where a prime (0 ) denotes next period’s
value. We use the terminology in the rest of the paper that a variable is state-dependent if it
is a function of only s and possibly s0 . We let ms,s0 denote the stochastic discount factor for
a real payoff. Then the real present value of a random real payoff one period in the future,
ys0 , is
                                                 X
                                     V(ys0 ) =        ωs,s0 ms,s0 ys0 .                          (1)
                                                 s0

     We assume that policy sets the state-dependent nominal interest rate on reserves to
is . Let the rate of inflation be πs = p0 /p − 1, where p is the price level, noting that we


                                                      5
have assumed that inflation is pre-determined one period ahead, a useful simplification that
simplifies the algebra but plays no other role in our analysis. Then, the real value of one
unit of reserves as of the current period is
                                             
                                       1 + is       1 + is
                                   V       0
                                                = 0          ,                                (2)
                                         p       p (1 + rs )

where rs is the safe one-period real interest rate. Because the real value of $1 of reserves
this period must be 1/p, this equation leads to the Fisher equation that pins down the rate
of inflation as
                                               1 + is
                                        πs =          − 1.                                    (3)
                                               1 + rs
If the central bank wants to achieve some rate of inflation, it must choose a nominal interest
rate consistent with that aim and the equation above. This derivation rests on the assumption
of saturation in reserves, so that reserves are valued solely for their cash payoff and not for
any service yield.
   In an economy with monetary non-neutrality, the application of this relationship to de-
termine the appropriate monetary policy is a challenge, because there is feedback from the
nominal interest rate to the real interest rate. In this paper, we consider an economy with
state-dependent rates of inflation πs , real interest rates rs , and nominal rates is , satisfying
the Fisher relationship. We need not, and do not, enter the thicket of modern monetary
economics to find the optimal policy or to determine the strength of the feedback from the
nominal interest rate to the real interest rate. We do make the assumption that monetary
policy, as embedded in is , is invariant to the choice of dividend rule in the central bank’s
charter.
   An alternative central bank policy would be a state-dependent price-level policy, so that
we could write the price level as a function of the state of the economy, ps . We do not pursue
this approach because a state-dependent price level implies essentially zero inflation—every
time the economy returns to a given state, the change in the price level since the first time
it was in that state is exactly zero. No central bank has an inflation target of zero. The
announced targets of central banks in advanced countries cluster around two percent per
year. It is therefore more realistic to assume a state-dependent rate of inflation with all of
the πs s non-negative and presumably near two percent.
   Finally, no theory of inflation is complete without a statement of how fiscal policy inter-
acts with monetary policy. To focus on central-bank stability, we must take a stand on the


                                                 6
solvency of the overall government. We portray the central bank as an arm of a government
that is committed to a fiscal policy that satisfies the intertemporal budget constraint by ad-
justing taxes and spending under all possible realizations of random events, without relying
on inflationary finance from the central bank. See Hall (2014) for evidence that the U.S.
satisfied that hypothesis prior to 2000 but appears to have departed seriously as a result of
the financial crisis of 2008.

1.2    The central bank’s assets and their risks
Central banks typically hold debt instruments of different maturities as well as gold and
foreign currencies. Before the financial crisis in 2008, the Federal Reserve held almost entirely
Treasury bills and bonds, while the ECB held a significant amount of gold together with repo
claims on commercial banks, which were collateralized by short-term government debt. The
Swiss National Bank, as is the case with most small open economies, held a significant amount
of foreign currency reserves. With the crisis, all three central banks borrowed extensively
from commercial banks to increase their holdings of debt instruments to include longer
maturities, higher default risks, and more foreign currency.
   We lump all central-bank assets into a single category called bonds, and denote by Bs ≥ 0
the total number of bonds held by the central bank. In the model, a bond is an instrument
that pays a real coupon θcs + (1 − θ)es0 next period, where es0 is the relative price change
of the non-domestic assets held by the central bank. Because these assets in most central
banks consist largely of foreign currency, es0 is approximately the rate of depreciation of the
domestic real exchange rate and θ is the fraction of domestic assets in the central bank’s
portfolio. In the second period, the bond will pay a fraction (1 − δ) of this payoff, and then
(1 − δ)2 in its third period, and so on. Lower values of δ correspond to portfolios with longer
maturities. We add up bonds in terms of the amount of output they will pay in the current
period so, each period, the bonds inherited from the previous period shrink by the factor
1 − δ, and 1/δ is the average maturity of the portfolio holdings. The bonds, which sell for
price qs , then give a payoff equal to the difference between the coupon payments and the
repayment of the principal by a factor δ. Appendix B shows how to obtain this composite
bond from mixing investments in short-run bonds, long-run bonds, gold and foreign currency,
as we observe in central banks’ balance sheets.




                                               7
   The asset holdings of the central bank pose three distinct risks, captured by our bond.
These risks are especially acute during financial crises. First is the risk that the bonds will
not pay the full coupon. We assume that the coupon on the bonds is one in all states apart
from the financial crisis state S, when bonds may suffer an impairment captured by cS ≤ 1.
This possibility is pressing in Europe, where the ECB holds a significant amount of Greek
debt with market values that imply substantial default probabilities.
   The second risk comes from changes in bond prices resulting from changes in discounts.
The price of the bonds qs satisfies the no-arbitrage asset-pricing recursion:

                             qs = V(θcs + (1 − θ)es0 + (1 − δ)qs0 ).                         (4)

Domestic short-term bonds are free from this risk, but if δ < 1, changes in discounts and
thus in real interest rates will cause differences in qs across states, especially as the economy
enters and exits the crisis state. This is a particularly pressing issue for the United States
today, as interest rates are expected to rise soon. Because we want to remain in the simple
environment of a recursive model, we cannot deal with term-structure changes except within
the geometric model of bond payoffs.
   The third risk comes from changes in the price of gold and foreign assets and is captured
by the exchange-rate change es0 . In the central bank of most small open economies, where θ
is close to zero, this is the main source of risk.
   The three parameters, δ, cS , and θ, describe the sources of risk: interest-rate risk, default
risk and exchange rate. If all three parameters are equal to one, the bond is riskless, and
                                                   cs
                                          qs =          .                                    (5)
                                                 1 + rs

1.3    Seignorage and inflation
The only source of income to a central bank besides its portfolio of assets is seignorage income
from printing currency. All central banks keep the market values of reserves and currency at
exact parity by standing ready to exchange one for the other. Therefore, the policy variable
is high-powered money, the sum of reserves and currency. Market forces determine the split
between the two components, and because seignorage is only earned from currency, but
not from interest-paying reserves, the central bank does not directly control the seignorage
it earns. Rather, central banks expand their portfolios to high levels almost entirely by


                                                 8
borrowing from commercial banks at market interest rates, and some of these new reserves
may be converted to currency.
     Because the volume of currency is stable in advanced countries, we take the public’s real
holdings of currency to be a function Ns of the state s. The central bank’s real seignorage
revenue is:
                                           p0 Ns0 − pNs          Ns
                                 ns,s0 =           0
                                                        = Ns 0 −    .                         (6)
                                                 p               πs
Although a central bank does not control seignorage directly, by using its policy rule to keep
prices on target, it affects the demand for currency and thus the amount of seignorage. Real
seignorage increases with inflation until it reaches a maximum and then declines. Seignorage
is a form of taxation on the real currency held by the public, where inflation acts as the
implicit tax, and there is a point beyond which higher taxes reduce revenue. Cagan (1956) is
the classic derivation of this function starting from the properties of the desire for real money
balances, and Hilscher, Raviv and Reis (2015) provide recent estimates of the seignorage
function. We assume that seignorage is state-dependent, and estimate the dependence from
the relation between the inflation target and seignorage.

1.4       The resulting resource constraint
The central bank’s real reserves follow the law of motion:

            V 0 − V = rs V + qs0 [Bs0 − (1 − δ)Bs ] + ds0 − [θcs + (1 − θ)es0 ]Bs − ns,s0 .   (7)

When the economy is in state s0 and was previously in state s, the central bank issues
additional reserves, V 0 − V , to fund the sum of: (1) real interest on the previous level of
reserves, rs V , (2) net bond purchases at real cost qs0 [Bs0 − (1 − δ)Bs ], and (3) payment of
dividends to the government, ds0 . Funding needs are reduced by (4) receipts of interest this
period on last period’s bond holdings, [θcs + (1 − θ)es0 ]Bs , and (5) receipts of seignorage,
ns,s0 .
     Equation (7) ignores the operating expenses of the central bank because these are usually
small relative to its assets. The same applies to the revenue from direct loans to banks and
to the mandatory statutory dividends that central banks are often committed to pay to
the providers of their paid-in capital. We also ignore the use of resources for quasi-fiscal
operations such as bailing out the banking system.



                                                   9
    The simplest version of equation (7) is for a central bank that issues no reserves (V =
V 0 = 0) and holds no bonds (Bs = Bs0 = 0). In this case, it boils down to:

                                           ds0 = ns,s0 .                                    (8)

In this case, the central bank transfers its seignorage revenue to the Treasury every period.
    With outstanding reserves that pay interest, and a portfolio of bonds that fluctuate in
value, the resource constraint of the central bank becomes more interesting. In principle,
either reserves or bond holdings could adjust to make the constraint hold in every state of
the world. During the recent financial crisis, both the Federal Reserve and the ECB altered
their holdings of bonds to intervene in selected financial markets, so in the next section we
will take the choices of Bs as given and take V as the endogenous variable. In the following
sections we will study how different policies for Bs affect the risks of instability.


2     The Financial Stability of a Central Bank
The traditional measure of a corporation’s financial standing is the accounting measure
variously termed capital, equity, or net worth. There are typically three reasons to measure
it: to calculate the residual winding up value of the corporation, to assess its market value,
and to ascertain the weight of equity versus credit in the firm’s funding.
    None of these reasons applies to a central bank. Central banks cannot be liquidated
because their creditors cannot demand to convert their credit into anything but what they
already hold, currency and reserves. Therefore, there is no meaning to the residual value of
a central bank because the central bank cannot be wound up. Central banks also do not
have a meaningful market value, because their goal is not profits, and shares in the bank are
typically not traded. Finally, governments own the central bank, they often deposit funds
with the central bank, and most of the assets of the central bank are government liabilities.
The traditional distinction between equity-holders and credit-holders is blurry and confusing
for a central bank.
    Nonetheless, central banks may run into financial difficulties. There is no bankruptcy
court for central banks but if private agents refuse to hold its liabilities, the central bank
can no longer operate and is effectively insolvent. Theoretically, this implies a hyperinflation
(literally, that p = ∞) because reserves become worthless, but in practice it comes with a



                                                10
currency reform such that the old central bank effectively closes its doors and a new central
bank with new liabilities starts over.
   Insolvency is an off-equilibrium outcome of a central bank that has a payout requirement
ds that is sufficiently in excess of its income from seignorage and bond interest so that its
reserves rise without limit. Specifically, with explosive dividend payouts, for any  > 0 and
stated reserve level, there is a finite time horizon such that the probability that the reserve
level will exceed the stated level is 1 − . In a well-run country, any perception that existing
policies regarding the central bank will lead to a reserve explosion results in an immediate
correction through reduced dividend payout requirements. We will discuss dividend rules
that guarantee the absence of reserve explosion.

2.1    Dividends and central bank independence
Central banks pay dividends ds to their governments. If the central bank and the Treasury
were perfectly integrated, the resource constraint in equation (7) would have little bite. The
dividends ds would just record the transfers between a particular branch and the overall
government, but these would all be subsumed within the operations of the government as
a whole. It would make little sense to talk of the solvency of the central bank instead of
the solvency of the government as a whole. The individual accounts of most government
agencies do not merit any special attention.
   Central banks are different from government agencies. In most advanced countries, the
central bank is a separately organized entity, with independence to pursue its mandate. There
are many definitions and measures of how independent a central bank is, but a minimal one
is that it need not ask the government for resources—see Cukierman’s (2008) survey. That
is, a central bank is independent as long as it adheres to its dividend rule and the rule
does not imply explosive reserve growth. The success of the fundamental political strategy
of an independent central bank hangs on the presence in its charter of a non-explosive
dividend rule. Goodfriend (1994) discusses the independence and solvency of the Fed from
this perspective.
   The rest of the paper explores alternative dividend rules with respect to their capacity
to deliver stable independent central banking free from the danger of reserve explosion.
Although some of the rules we consider have roots in accounting concepts, we focus entirely
on the economic criterion of reserve stability.

2.2     Net income and the meaning of negative dividends
Most central banks have dividend rules based on a concept of net income. The bank pays its
net income to the Treasury as a dividend. Because net income can be negative, a dividend
rule calling for payments based on net income may call for payments from the government
to the bank. Historically, this issue has not arisen for the Federal Reserve, because it
enjoyed high seignorage, high income from holding short-term bonds funded almost entirely
with currency, low levels of reserves, and zero or low interest paid on reserves. But with
the expansion of reserves and the resulting necessity to pay near-market rates on reserves,
negative income may occur.
   We assume that the government and the central bank have committed to a stated div-
idend rule, and that the public understands the commitment. Absent a well-understood
commitment, payments to the central bank may be mischaracterized as ad hoc recapitaliza-
tions of a weak central bank, a potential source of failure of the principle of central-bank
independence. Governments and the public should understand the implications of tying divi-
dends directly to a measure of net income. Either they should accept that negative dividends
are appropriate under the central bank’s charter, or adopt a charter that modifies dividends
by permitting zero dividend payments during periods when net income is negative, together
with makeup increases in dividends once net income turns positive. We will discuss both of
these types of rules.

2.3     The real mark-to-market dividend rule
If the central bank’s net income is calculated the way an economist would, in real terms with
its portfolio marked to market, the dividend would obey the real mark-to-market dividend
rule:
                   ds0 = [θcs + (1 − θ)es0 + qs0 − qs − δqs0 ])Bs + ns,s0 − rs V.           (9)

The dividend is (1) the return on the bond portfolio, the coupon payment θcs + (1 − θ)es0
plus the capital gain qs0 − qs less the depreciation δqs0 , all applied to the number of bonds,
plus (2) the seignorage revenue from issuance of currency, ns,s0 , less (3) the deduction of the
interest paid on reserves rs V .
   A simple result follows:




                                                12
Proposition 1 Under the real mark-to-market dividend rule in equation (9), the law of
motion of reserves is:
                                    Vs = qs Bs + V0 − q0 B0 .                               (10)

Here V0 −q0 B0 is an initial condition. Reserves are a function of state-dependent bond values
qs Bs and the initial condition, so reserves cannot explode.

Proof: Substitute equation (9) for ds0 in equation (7). The result simplifies to

                                   V 0 − qs0 Bs0 = V − qs Bs .                              (11)

Therefore, V − qs Bs is constant across periods. Letting the initial condition be V0 − q0 B0
gives the result. 
   During a crisis in state S, a central bank practicing quantitative easing will expand its
bond holdings and fund the expansion with added reserves. When the crisis is over, and the
bond-holding rule Bs assigns a normal, smaller level of bond holdings, reserves will contract
as the bank sells bonds and uses the proceeds to pay off its debt to commercial banks. The
proposition shows that reserves are state dependent and the central bank is always able to
honor its debts whatever is the payment on reserves that it chooses.

2.4    The nominal mark-to-market dividend rule
In practice, central bank dividend rules use nominal rather than real accounting. Net income
is defined as the change in nominal net worth that would occur if dividends were zero.
Nominal net worth is
                                   pW = p(qs Bs − V − Ns ),                                 (12)

with currency Ns treated as a liability. Then, by definition, nominal net worth pW is constant
under a rule that sets dividends equal to that concept of net income. This dividend rule also
meshes well with the notion that central banks engage in open-market operations, where the
sum of reserves and currency—the monetary base—moves one-to-one with the purchase or
sale of bonds.
   Under a state-dependent price-level policy, we could derive results parallel to the ones
for the real mark-to-market dividend rule—real reserves would be state dependent and have
a constant additive term interpreted as an initial condition. But a state-dependent inflation
policy, where all of the πs s are positive, and the price level rises continually in a non-state-
dependent way, is more realistic. Combining the nominal payment-on-reserves rule, with the

                                               13
law of motion for reserves in equation (7) and the condition that p0 W 0 = pW with equation
(12) gives the nominal mark-to-market dividend rule:
                                                            
                                                  qs                is V
                 ds0 = θcs + (1 − θ)es0 + qs0 −        − δqs0 Bs −        .                (13)
                                                1 + πs             1 + πs
     The first distinction from equation (9) is that net income is calculated in nominal terms,
so that higher inflation raises measured capital gains qs0 −qs /(1+πs ). The second distinction
is that central-bank accounting treats the growth of currency and resulting increase in bond
holdings as exactly offsetting, because currency is treated as a liability, even though the
present value of its future cash burden is zero. Given the accounting convention that the
income statement is the first difference of the balance sheet, nothing makes its way to the
income statement to reveal the income from seignorage.
     The constancy of nominal net worth implies

Proposition 2 Under the nominal mark-to-market dividend rule with W0 = 0, reserves
follow the state-dependent law of motion,

                                        Vs = qs Bs − Ns .                                  (14)

If W0 > 0, beyond this state-dependent component, there is a time-dependent component
which dies away if inflation is always positive and is a constant if inflation is always zero.

Proof: The constancy of nominal net worth implies that, in time-dependent notation:
                                                          p0
                                    qt Bt − Vt − Nt =        W0 ,                          (15)
                                                          pt
so
                                                  t−1             
                                                  Y          1
                              Vt = qt Bt − Nt −                        W0 .                (16)
                                                  τ =0
                                                          1 + πτ
With W0 = 0 we obtain equation (14), the state-dependent component. The last term on
the right-hand side is: zero if W0 = 0, depends on time and dies away if W0 > 0 and πt > 0,
and is constant if W0 > 0 and πt = 0 for all t. 
     In general, from an arbitrary starting point of real net worth W0 , reserves are not state
dependent. Rather, they are the sum of a state-dependent component qt Bt − Nt and a
negative component associated with the initial level of real net worth that dies away with
time. The dying away would be at a constant rate if the rate of inflation were constant
across all states.

                                               14
   Under this dividend rule, reserves fluctuate not only because of changes in bond holdings
but also as the public varies its demand for currency. As before, reserves during a crisis, VS ,
may be high, but they are non-explosive.

2.5    When is net income negative?
Before the crisis, the Federal Reserve’s portfolio consisted almost exclusively of short-term
government bonds. Old-style central banking was characterized by δ = θ = cS = 1. In this
case, under the real mark-to-market dividend rule:

                                    ds0 = ns,s0 + rs (q0 B0 − V0 ).                             (17)

Historically, seignorage has almost always been positive, as have been real interest rates.
Therefore, in the 100-year history of the Federal Reserve under old-style central banking,
the Federal Reserve always paid a positive dividend to the Treasury.
   Paying interest on reserves and holding investments with interest-rate, default and ex-
change-rate risk opens the possibility of negative dividends. Substituting the law of motion
for reserves, equation (25), into the real mark-to-market dividend rule in equation (9) de-
scribes dividends in terms of exogenous variables and the initial condition:

      ds0 = ns,s0 + rs (q0 B0 − V0 ) + [θcs + (1 − θ)es0 − δqs0 − rs qs ]Bs + (qs0 − qs )Bs .   (18)

   New-style central banking comes with a new term beyond seignorage and the return on
capital. It is the sum of (1) [θcs +(1−θ)es0 −δqs0 −rs qs ]Bs , the difference between the coupon
payment adjusted for bond depreciation less the real rate on reserves, and (2) (qs0 − qs )Bs ,
the capital gain on the bond portfolio. If δ = θ = 1 this second term is exactly zero. But
for a central bank that holds long-term bonds or foreign assets, net income is more likely to
be negative when the bond repayment is impaired, when the real exchange rate appreciates,
or when there is a capital loss in the bond portfolio.
   Using instead the nominal dividend rule in equation (13), we find, with the same substi-
tutions,
                                                                             
                   is                                                1 + is
           ds0 =        (Ns + W0 ) + θcs + (1 − θ)es0 + (1 − δ)qs0 −        qs Bs .             (19)
                 1 + πs                                              1 + πs
The first term is the inflation tax on holders of currency, who pay the tax by holding
banknotes instead of interest-bearing assets. The quantity within the square brackets is

                                                  15
the difference between the actual and the expected payment on the bonds. It is zero on
average, but it may well be negative if coupons or future prices fall below average. Impaired
coupons, real exchange rate appreciation, falls in bond prices, and rises in real interest rates
are potential sources of negative net income.
   Equation (19) holds whether interest is paid on reserves or not. Paying interest on
reserves requires resources, but because it also lowers net income in the dividend rule, it
has no effect on the evolution of reserves or on the equilibrium dividends paid. What
distinguishes old-style from new-style central banking is instead the holding of risky assets,
foreign and domestic, increasing the risk from changes in real interest rates, coupons, and
exchange rates. If δ = θ = cs = 1 and only one-period domestic safe bonds were held, the
term within square brackets would be zero, and the central bank would always have positive
dividends equal to the inflation tax.

2.6    Implications of a dividend rule that excludes negative divi-
       dends
In the case of the Fed, which has used the net income rule to pay its dividends, there
is no formal financial arrangement between it and the rest of the government. Nothing
obligates the Treasury to make a payment to the Fed if its net income is negative. The
appropriation of government funds would have to be approved by fiscal authorities, subject
to the political process. Negative income opens the door to political interference in monetary
policy decisions.
   One solution is to set the dividend to zero in times when net income is negative

                                        ds = max(ys , 0),                                  (20)

where ys is the measure of net income otherwise used to set dividends. In this case, the
central bank issues additional reserves to compensate for the foregone payment from the
government, in the amount of the shortfall:

                                         zs = ds − ys .                                    (21)

   Consider first a central bank subject to the real mark-to-market dividend rule. An
increase in reserves resulting from a positive shortfall z has the same permanent effect that
we analyzed in connection with the initial condition in proposition 1. We let Z denote the
cumulative sum of the zs, so Z 0 = Z + zs0 . It is not a function of the current state alone.

                                                16
Rather, since equation (20) and equation (21) imply that zs is always non-negative, as long
as there is a positive probability of negative net income, Z is a weakly increasing sequence
over time that will tend to infinity. Retracing the steps that led to proposition 1 gives:

Proposition 3 If the central bank pays real mark-to-market dividends according to the rule
in equation (20), with net income given by equation (9), reserves are:

                                 Vt = qt Bt + (V0 − q0 B0 ) + Zt ,                           (22)

so they drift upward without limit and are explosive.

The rule in equation (20) is unsustainable as it violates the no-Ponzi-scheme condition on
central bank reserves.
   The situation is somewhat different in the more realistic case of a central bank subject to
a nominal mark-to-market rule and positive state-dependent inflation. Combining the rule
in equation (13) with the constraint that dividends are non-negative in equation (21) and
the law of motion for reserves in equation (7), we obtain:
                                                W
                                       W0 =          − z0.                                   (23)
                                              1 + πs
Whenever dividends are higher than net income, z is positive, and net worth falls. In nominal
terms, p0 z 0 gives the the decline in nominal net worth this period.
   Let pZ now denote the shortfall of nominal net worth from its initial level p0 W0 . With
zero inflation, this is still the cumulative sum of the zs, but with positive inflation,
                                                   
                                       0       1
                                     Z =              Z + zs0 .                              (24)
                                             1 + πs
Inflation makes the real shortfall in net worth fall over time if the πs s are positive. In this
case, Z obeys a stationary autoregressive time-series process.
   Given the law of motion for net worth, the same steps that led to proposition 2 yield the
following result:

Proposition 4 If the central bank pays nominal mark-to-market dividends according to the
rule in equation (20), with net income given by equation (13), reserves are:
                                            t−1         
                                            Y        1
                          Vt = qt Bt − Nt −                W0 + Zt .                         (25)
                                            τ =0
                                                  1 + πτ
The term qt Bt − Nt is state-dependent. If inflation is positive, the term in W0 dies away and
Zt is stationary, so reserves V are stationary. If inflation is always zero, the term in W0 is
constant, and Zt drifts upwards without limit, so reserves V are non-stationary.

                                                17
   A corollary of the proposition is that nominal reserves pV track pZ. Inflation plays
an important role with a nominal mark-to-market dividends rule. If inflation is zero or,
similarly, if the price-level is state-dependent, then reserves again explode as a result of
the Treasury not paying into the central bank. With positive inflation, real reserves are
stationary. A policy that tries to keep nominal net worth constant leads to falling real net
worth when inflation is positive. As a result, when the central bank fails to receive funds from
the Treasury, inflation erodes this real shortfall over time and keeps real reserves stationary.
Higher inflation increases the financial stability of the central bank both by raising seignorage
and by eroding the real shortfall in Treasury backing.

2.7       Deferred assets and retaining earnings
The dividend rules of many central banks cause the bank to recover from the issuance of
reserves in lieu of reimbursement of negative income by setting subsequent dividends that
are less than net income. The rules do not allow the central bank to refuse to hand over its
net income to the fiscal authorities for arbitrary prolonged periods of time—see Amtenbrink
(2010).
   We model the relationship by hypothesizing an account balance D that measures the
backlog of negative net income realizations that the Treasury did not cover by making
payments to the central bank. D is a deferred asset capturing the claim that the central
bank has on its own future remittances to the Treasury. Many central banks do not record
this claim, but simply act on it to recover their accounting equity after losses, while the
accounting rules of the Fed (Federal Reserve Act, section 7, 12 USC 290) record the claim
as a negative liability. When D is positive, the central bank can draw it down by paying a
dividend d0 less than net income y 0 . On the other hand, when y 0 is negative, the balance D
rises by −y 0 . The dividend rule is

                                       d0 = max(y 0 − D, 0).                                (26)

   We also assume that an upper limit D̄ applies to the balance. Central-bank charters
are vague about this limit but ultimately the central bank is part of the government and
fiscal authorities can, at their discretion, reclaim the surplus accumulated by the central
bank. It is quite plausible that if the balance in D was high the Treasury would perceive
the payments associated with this debt to the central bank as an effective recapitalization.
A balance above D̄ would put in question the independence of the central bank in the same

                                                18
way that we argued before when we set this limit to zero. At the limit, D̄ may be the present
value of seignorage, so that the central bank does not need to receive a positive transfer from
the fiscal authority in present value, as shown in Reis (2013b).
   Balances in the D account decline with inflation, matching the decline that occurs in the
extra component of reserves, Z. Putting all of these elements together, we get the law of
motion,                                                                 
                   0              1              0   0             0
                D = min D̄,            (D − max(y − d , 0) + max(−y , 0)) .                 (27)
                                1 + πs
As before, the law of motion of the bulge in reserves caused by missed Treasury payments,
Z, is
                                               1
                                      Z0 =          Z + d0 − y 0 .                          (28)
                                             1 + πs
   This provision, with a reasonably generous value of D̄, will cancel a bulge of reserve
issuance following an episode of negative net income by cutting subsequent dividends and
using the funds to pay off the bulge of reserves. The degree of protection depends on D̄ and
the frequency and magnitude of negative incomes compared to offsetting positive incomes in
normal times. In an infinite lifetime, the buildup of reserves Z will rise above any finite level
with positive probability at some time, but allowing the central bank to pay low dividends
to recover lowers this probability.
   The message from these results is that, whatever the dividend rule or the inflation policy,
negative net income poses a challenge. If the Treasury does not make payments to the central
bank in times of negative net income, reserves will have to rise.

2.8     A quantitative measure of the financial strength of a central
        bank
A central bank is financially sound if its charter specifies a dividend rule that excludes
exploding reserves. The balance in the deferred account D is a useful metric for judging
the bank’s stability. It is almost identical to Z, the excess of its reserve obligations. If
the dividend rule has the prospect for payments from the Treasury that will pay off its
obligation, reserves will revert to their state-dependent levels in propositions 1 and 2. D
becomes a second state variable for the central bank.
   For the Fed and possibly other central banks, the Treasury has discretion over the repay-
ment of its deferred obligation—the charter does not deal explicitly with the issue. A central
bank relying on a large discretionary intervention of the Treasury is financially weak, and the

                                                  19
larger the amount, the weaker the bank. Therefore, while we started this section by arguing
that the usual case for the usefulness of accounting capital or equity does not apply to the
central bank, under the nominal mark-to-market rule, Z measures precisely the shortfall in
the net worth of the central bank. Our analysis provides an economically motivated measure
of the financial strength of a central bank. Rather than formulate a concept of capital for
central banks and raise red flags if capital is depleted, a better approach is to monitor how
close the central bank’s deferred claim on the Treasury is to its upper limit D̄, or how long
it will take the Treasury to pay off this deferred obligation.


3     The Federal Reserve and Interest-Rate Risk
The main lesson from the previous section is that the stability of a central bank depends
crucially on what happens to its dividends when net income is negative. Prior to 2008, the
Fed held mostly safe short-term Treasury debt with small potential capital losses and it paid
no interest on reserves. As a result, net income was always positive. In contrast, during
and after the crisis, the Fed functioned as a highly profitable hedge fund, borrowing at low
rates in the short-term market to fund holdings of higher-yield longer-term debt, thereby
generating substantial positive net income.
    The stability of the Fed is at stake when interest rates increase, as the increase raises
the payment on reserves and lowers the value of the Fed’s portfolio of longer-term bonds.
In this section, we simulate what would happen to reserves and dividends under different
scenarios for the recovery. Any answer to the question of how the federal government would
deal with a situation calling for the Treasury to pay off its deferred obligation to the Fed is
conjectural. Our approach is to take real interest rates as given, and to study how different
inflation targets, different institutions for calculating dividends, and different management
of the exit from the crisis would affect the Fed’s volume of reserves. We begin by describing
how our stylized model approximates the Fed and how we measure the relevant variables
and calibrate the model.

3.1    The Fed and the model
A central bank’s institutions in our model are captured by the parameters δ, cS , and θ and
by its dividend rule. The Fed barely has any foreign investments and it almost exclusively



                                              20
holds securities issued by the Treasury or agency securities guaranteed by it. For the Fed,
cs = θ = 1.
   Of course the Fed does not hold delta bonds, but rather Treasury bills, notes, and bonds
of various maturities. All actual Treasury instruments pay off face value at maturity, rather
than melting away like a delta bond, and notes and bonds make periodic coupon payments as
well. There is no computational obstacle to building a model that keeps track of the historical
path of purchases and sales and records gains and losses only upon sale. But the complexity
of the model would stand in the way of the points we want to make in this paper. Instead,
we use the data in the annual report of the Federal Reserve on the value and maturity of the
Treasury securities it holds, to calculate the value-weighted average maturity of the Fed’s
financial assets. The parameter δ is the reciprocal of the average maturity. Between 2009
and 2013, δ averaged 0.128. We keep δ constant throughout, but historically δ was higher,
and in the future the Fed will likely reduce the maturity of its portfolio as it exits the crisis.
Variations in δ by state of the economy, though feasible, would much complicate the model.
Our procedure is reasonably accurate, because the central risk to the Fed occurs upon exiting
the crisis state, when the portfolio is large. Prior to the crisis, the portfolio is smaller, so
our exaggeration of the capital gain at the beginning of the crisis is not large.
   We describe the Fed’s financial stability under the hypothesis that it pays dividends
according to the nominal mark-to-market rule discussed in the previous section. In fact, the
Federal Reserve does not mark its bond portfolio to market, so unrealized capital gains do
not enter into its calculations of net income and are not paid out as dividends. We discuss
this practice and how it affects the results in section 3.9.

3.2    The states of the economy
Our annual data cover the period from 1954 through 2013. To define the states of the U.S.
economy, we use the realized real T-bill rates, measured as the nominal rate on one-year bills
minus the increase in the Consumer Price Index. We allow for 5 states, where the first four
correspond to the behavior of the interest rate until 2008, and the real rates for these states
are the medians within the quartiles of the distribution of the rate over that period. Since
then, the economy has been in state 5, the crisis state, with a real rate essentially minus the
inflation rate, because the nominal rate has been close to zero. The transition into state 5
from 2007 to 2008 occurred out of state 1.

                          Table 1: Inputs Derived from U.S. Data


   Our estimates imply that the economy has a financial crisis with a probability of 1.7
percent per year. Based on recent experience, we take the exit rate to be 20 percent per year
as a rough estimate. We also assume the transition will be into state 3, the median state.
We therefore assume that a crisis has an expected life of 5 years. The estimated transition
matrix appears in Table 4 in Appendix C, together with the implied stationary distribution
across states.

3.3    The inputs of the model
Table 1 shows the values of the variables in the model at each state of the economy, based on
data from the annual financial statements of the Federal Reserve System. We measure the
holdings of bonds qs Bs as the total U.S. Treasury and agency securities held by the Federal
Reserve system. To calculate currency holdings Ns , we use currency in circulation. The
difference between the two is close to the reserves outstanding, as the Fed’s accounting net
worth is relatively small. We divide all nominal variables by GDP and use the GDP deflator
as our measure of inflation πs . Note that in the crisis state, the bond portfolio of the Fed is
more than twice as large as in the other four states.
   The last column of the table shows asset prices for the approximating delta-bond. Recall
that the price of delta-bonds is given by

                                    qs = V(cs + (1 − δ)qs0 ).

          Table 2: Net Income in the Ergodic Distribution, as a Percent of GDP


We use this delta-bond price to account for capital gains and losses on the portfolio of the
Fed. To apply the V operator, we need to have the stochastic discount factor ms,s0 . A
reasonable class of SDFs satisfies
                                                          µs0
                                          ms,s0 = β           .                             (29)
                                                          µs
For example, in the representative-agent consumption CAPM with time-separable expected
utility, µs is marginal utility. Under this assumption, the definition for the real interest rate
gives a condition that the SDF must satisfy:
                                              X
                                 β(1 + rs )        ωs,s0 µs0 − µs = 0.                      (30)
                                              s0

With the normalization µ1 = 1, this is a system of N equations in N unknowns, β, µ2 , . . . , µN
that takes as inputs the data on rs . Though nonlinear, the system solves easily by standard
methods. Bond prices then solve the linear pricing recursion. Appendix C shows the auxiliary
parameters that come out of applying the formula. This approach to asset pricing was also
taken by Hall (2014), and is closely related to the approach taken by Ross (2015).

3.4    The Fed’s stability in normal times
We begin with the case where the Treasury pays the Fed immediately if the Fed’s net income
is negative, so that proposition 2 holds and there are no concerns about stability. In this
case, reserves are state-dependent, and we assume that any initial effect from W0 has long
since melted away on account of positive chronic inflation. Table 2 shows the net income in
the ergodic distribution, with blank entries for states with zero probability.

                                                    23
   The Fed earns a positive net income in every pair of originating and succeeding states
but one—the Fed has negative net income only when the economy exits from the crisis, from
state 5 to state 3. Negative income is a substantial 0.85 percent of GDP, but this event
only happens once every 59 years. Moreover, when the Fed enters a crisis, its dividends are
abnormally high at 0.82 percent of GDP, and while the crisis lasts, net income is 0.28 percent
of GDP. The Fed is financially stable under new-style central banking.

3.5    The Fed in crisis and recovery
Only because of crises is the Fed’s financial stability potentially at stake. We track the Fed’s
finances during an extreme but still plausible worst-case scenario, where the economy moves
over a 15-year period from state 1 to a crisis in state 5 for five years and a recovery in state
3 for the remaining 9 years. Throughout, we assume 2-percent inflation. We set the initial
conditions to match the level of reserves in 2007.
   At the outset of the crisis, the Fed borrows $1.26 trillion from the banking system to
buy bonds. High levels of bond holdings financed by high levels of reserves continue until
the end of the crisis, when the economy shifts to state 3. The Fed then sells $1.31 trillion
in bonds and uses the funds to retire a similar volume of reserves, which decline to almost
their initial level. Reserves are elevated during the crisis state, but are otherwise low and
stable during the other states. The nominal interest rate starts at a fairly high level prior to
the crisis, plunges to zero for the crisis years, and then resumes a moderate positive level for
the remaining time in state 3. The bond price follows the price level on a trend, but rises at
the beginning of the crisis and falls when the crisis ends. Therefore, the Fed faces significant
reserve enlargement at the recovery, when the fall in bond prices causes capital losses in its
large portfolio, and the rising interest rate raises payments on reserves.
   Figure 1 shows the Fed’s dividend to the Treasury and the flows that determine it. The
least important determinant is the payment on reserves, which is a deduction from the
dividend. During the crisis the interest rate paid is zero, and outside of the crisis reserves
are small so the interest paid has a barely visible negative effect. The coupon earnings from
the bond portfolio less depreciation are likewise of little importance. Deducting depreciation
is the equivalent of not counting the return of principal as part of the earnings from a bond.
The most important determinant of dividends is the capital gain on the bonds. The Fed
receives a capital gain upon entering the crisis state, with negative real interest, and pays a

corresponding dividend. Upon exiting the crisis state, the Fed suffers a capital loss. The loss
is larger than the gain because it applies to the large portfolio acquired during the crisis.
   Figure 2 shows the flows that raise or reduce reserves. Interest on reserves is a minor
factor contributing to growth and seignorage is a minor factor contributing to shrinkage. The
big factor is purchasing and selling bonds. When the crisis strikes, the Fed expands reserves
to buy bonds; when it ends, the Fed sells a large volume of bonds and pays down reserves.
Dividend payments, which add to reserves, also have noticeable roles at the beginning of the
crisis—when capital gains from the lower interest rate accrue and are paid to the Treasury—
and at the end of the crisis—when capital losses from the higher interest rate accrue, which
the Treasury funds.

3.6    Financial stability when inflation is the only tool for dealing
       with negative net income
Our next calculations show how reserves evolve if the Treasury keeps all net income when
it is positive but makes no provision for compensating the central bank for negative net
income. This was the case described in proposition 4.

                            Figure 2: Flows into and out of Reserves


   In this case, real reserves grow each time the economy recovers from a crisis but shrink
every year from inflation. At the exit of the crisis, the balance in the Z account rises to
0.7 percent of GDP. With a 2 percent inflation target it would then take 35 years for it
to decline by half. An interesting question is how much inflation would be needed to speed
this transition. Providing an accurate estimate would require having reliable estimates of the
seignorage function. Instead, we provide a lower bound by assuming that the higher inflation
would have no effect on the real holdings of currency thus maximizing the seignorage that
the central bank could generate.
   If the central bank raises its inflation target to 4 percent after exiting the crisis, then the
balance in the Z account is 0.5 percent of GDP 10 years after the crisis is over, which is
slightly above two years of net income. In order to be one year of net income away within a
decade, the inflation target would have to increase from 2 percent to 6.2 percent. If instead,
the central bank raised the inflation target right away at the exit of the crisis to generate
enough seignorage income to compensate for the whole of the capital losses, then inflation
would have to rise to 18.8 percent on the year of exit from the crisis. These large amounts
reflect the limited ability to raise seignorage via higher inflation.

3.7    Financial stability with deferred Treasury reimbursement of
       negative net income
Our next calculations show how reserves evolve if the Treasury does not pay the Fed on a
current basis for negative net income, but allows the Fed to retire the extra reserves through
the D account we described earlier. We take the upper limit to be D̄ = 0.02 or 2 percent
of GDP, a limit that is not binding in our scenario. The result is that the balance D is the
same as the extra reserves Z, which is our dollar measure of the Fed’s financial condition.
   Figure 3 shows the operation of the D account under the assumptions in Figure 2. Until
the crisis ends, dividends equal net income, resulting in a large payout to the Treasury when
the Fed’s bond portfolio appreciates at the onset of the crisis. When the economy recovers,
net income is negative for a year. The Fed issues extra reserves to cover the loss. The balance
in the D account rises by $141 billion, along with a bulge in reserves of the same amount.
For the next 5 years, the Fed pays the Treasury zero dividends and gradually works off the
balance in D and the extra reserves that had been issued when the crisis ended. In the
following year, the Fed pays a positive dividend but less than net income. In the succeeding
years, D = Z = 0 and reserves are back to their state-dependent normal values.


                                                   27
3.8      Managing the balance sheet: speed and timing of the exit
We conclude that there is a theoretical danger to the Fed’s financial stability from capital
losses when exiting the crisis. Anything that lowers the fall in bond prices reduces the danger
of instability. To investigate this conclusion, first we make the exit from the crisis occur to
state 1, rather than to state 3. The fall in bond prices when exiting the crisis is now higher
and so are the capital losses. Figure 4 shows that the amount accumulated in the Fed’s
deferred claim on the Treasury account is now much larger. Our conclusion that the Federal
Reserve is still at little risk is also approximately unchanged. Now, the maximum deferred
compensation to the Fed would be $209 billion. It takes now 10 years, instead of 6, to reclaim
dividends from the Treasury to bring this amount to zero.
   How could the Fed’s dividend rule be changed to lower this risk? One possibility is to
manage the exit from the crisis differently. In particular, we assumed that the Fed shrinks
its balance sheet back to pre-crisis levels right as the recession ends. Because it sells a large
share of its portfolio at the same time as real interest rates rise and bond prices fall, the
Fed realizes a large loss. The Fed has suggested instead selling its crisis portfolio slowly.
Figure 4 shows what would happen to the Fed’s D account—the extra reserves it issues to
make up for the Treasury’s non-payment against negative net income—if it takes 5 years to
sell the bonds bought during the crisis. This policy of slow winding down makes almost no
difference to realized net income and thus to the D balance.
   If slow shrinkage of the balance sheet makes little difference, perhaps doing the opposite
helps. The opposite, in this case, consists in reversing quantitative easing before interest
rates rise. We add a sixth state and repeat our simulations to calculate the net income and
reserve borrowing of the Fed, if in that sixth state, the balance sheet falls to its pre-crisis
size, but the nominal interest rate stays at zero. The following period, the crisis is over
as we transition back to state 3 as before. Note that this experiment makes the generous
assumption that the Fed is able to sell its assets still at their high crisis-level prices, as agents
only learn about the end of the crisis the following year. Figure 4 shows that selling before
would lower the risks to the Fed’s stability. Still, the deferred account stays positive for two
years.
   An early exit from quantitative easing lowers the risk of instability. But managing the
balance sheet does not eliminate the risk. As long as the Fed marks its portfolio to market,

its income for the purposes of its dividend to the Treasury will be sharply negative at the
end of the crisis, whether it sells the bonds faster or slower.

3.9    Institutional remedies: marking the Fed’s portfolio
All the policy counterfactuals so far assumed that the Fed’s bond holdings were marked to
market each year in determining net income y. The Fed is more likely to have trouble under
this dividend rule than under its actual dividend rule, because it earns capital gains on its
portfolio upon entering the crisis state, which it would pay out immediately to the Treasury.
In actuality, the Fed uses hold-to-maturity accounting. It computes net income as if its
bonds were worth the nominal principal returned at maturity.
   If the Fed sells all of its bonds when interest rates rises, as in our baseline case, hold-to-
maturity accounting would make little difference to measured net income. When the crisis
ends, the fall in bond prices would coincide with the Fed bringing the size of its assets back
to its pre-crisis level. Therefore, the Fed would sell most of its bonds and realize the capital
losses, just as in our mark-to-market benchmark.



                                                   29
   Instead, if the Fed slowly winds down its portfolio, there would be a noticeable difference,
as shown in Figure 4 in the line labeled hold-to-maturity. The basic problem with the
dividend rules we have been studying is that they generate a burst of negative income in a
recovery. Any accounting system that smooths measured net income will avoid or ameliorate
the danger of instability that arises from occasional bursts of negative income that do not
result in payments from the Treasury to the Fed.
   A slow winding down of the portfolio without marking to market accomplishes the
smoothing. Because most of the bonds the Fed bought during the crisis would mature
in the post-crisis years, their losses would take the form, not of the immediate capital loss
that we record, but rather of a stream of coupon payments at rates lower than the current
market rate during the crisis years. By recording the bonds at an artificially high price on
its accounts, the Fed would record lower returns on them than the market interest rate that
it pays on reserves. The interest paid on reserves now shows up as a leading source of losses,
for several years after the crisis, instead of the immediate capital loss at the time of the exit.
The present value of dividends is the same: accounting rules do not create free lunches.
   The hold-to-maturity line in Figure 4 shows that the path of the D account, with a slow
winding down, spreads the recorded capital losses over the 5 years of the winding down. Now,
when the economy exits the crisis state, the Fed’s dividend is based on a small recorded loss
associated with the selling of only one-fifth of the Fed’s bonds. In the following years though,
the payment of interest on reserves leads to persistent recorded losses for 5 years. When the
crisis ends and the Fed’s income is low, both because of low coupons on its holdings of bonds
purchased during the crisis years and because of paying now-higher rates on reserves, the Fed
goes through a long period of losses. The amount in the D account actually rises over the
first four years of the recovery. During this time, the Fed pays no dividend to the Treasury.
For the next two years, the Fed also pays no dividend, even though its recorded net income
is positive, as the Fed draws down the D account.
   The policy of slow winding down of the large bond portfolio acquired in the crisis, together
with hold-to-maturity accounting, has the effect of smoothing the Fed’s dividend relative
to our assumption of marking to market. The policy avoids a big dividend payment at the
beginning of the crisis, but instead involves many periods of smaller but negative net income.
If it is the size of the balance in the deferred account at any one time that matters, then this
accounting convention is effective at increasing the Fed’s financial strength. If instead what



                                               30
would put the independence of the Fed in question would be an increase in the number of
years with negative recorded income, then actual policy makes the Fed more fragile relative
to marking to market.


4     The European Central Bank and Default Risk
The European Central Bank is the coordinating agency of the Eurosystem, comprising the
ECB and the national central banks of the euro countries. Throughout our discussion, we
use the name ECB, though our law of motion for reserves describes the Eurosystem, while
our analysis of stability relates more closely to the ECB. As long as no major country leaves
the euro area, this distinction is unimportant.

4.1    The ECB and the model
Since late 2008, the ECB has pursued policies similar to those of the Fed. Its assets have
risen substantially funded by borrowing from banks by issuing reserves, which pay close-to-
market interest rates. The ECB only reports the maturity of a subset of the securities that it
holds, those purchased under the Securities Market Program. Using the reported maturities
at the end of 2012, we set δ = 0.233.
    Like most central banks, but unlike the Fed, the ECB has traditionally held a large share
of its assets as gold and foreign reserves. While the expansion of the balance sheet after 2008
involved almost only European securities, therefore reducing the share of gold and foreign
reserves, the share of domestic assets was still on average 0.461 of the direct holdings of
assets by the ECB after 2008. We set θ to this value.
    More interesting, the ECB faces significant default risk on its holdings of sovereign bonds
from countries in the periphery. In the model, the ECB suffers a default loss of 1 − cS of
its coupon expectation every period that it remains in the financial crisis state. Note that
the bond-pricing equation assumes that all bonds resume paying full coupon rates once the
economy exits state S—the bank does not lose a fraction 1 − cS of the value of its bond
holdings. As an extreme illustrative scenario, we consider the possibility that the ECB’s
bond holdings of Greek, Irish, Portuguese, and Spanish bonds in 2012 all went into default,
and that the resulting drop in value matched the 65 percent haircut that was applied to
private holders of Greek debt in 2012. This extreme scenario corresponds to cS = 0.858.



                                              31
4.2     Data and calibration for the euro area
Our data for Europe cover the period from 2000 through 2013. We take the exogenous
real interest rates to be the 1-year Euribor rate minus inflation measured by the euro-area
Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices. We define two states, one between 2000 and 2008,
and the crisis covering 2009-13. With only one observation of each, it is impossible to
estimate a transition matrix. Instead, we take the probabilities associated with a crisis to
be the same as for the United States—the euro-area economy enters a financial crisis with
probability 0.016 and the stationary probability of a crisis is 0.081. Our source for the ECB’s
finances is its last weekly financial statement published each year. For the depreciation in
the holdings of foreign assets, we take a weighted average of the change in the price of gold
and in the real effective exchange rate, with weights given by the shares of gold and foreign
securities in the ECB’s portfolio.
   Table 3 shows the key exogenous variables for the ECB. As in the United States, the
crisis corresponds to the nominal interest rate falling to zero, and the size of asset holding
by the ECB more than doubling. The table shows the change in asset prices under two
circumstances: if markets perceive the possibility of the default that we study, or if they
believe instead that c2 = 1 as happened in the data, since no default occurred. In a crisis, the
lower real interest rates raise asset prices, and the impaired coupon lowers them. Therefore,
when there is default, the change in asset prices getting into and out of the crisis is smaller
than it would be if all assets were safe, and so the capital gains and losses will be smaller as
well.

4.3     Default and the ECB’s financial stability with direct holdings
Figures for the ECB corresponding to those we presented for the Fed are available in appendix
D. As in the United States, a crisis comes with an increase in bond prices and a fall in nominal
interest rates, and an expansion in bond holdings together with reserves. Capital gains and
losses dominate the movements of the dividend paid, while the outlays for bond purchases
and receipts from bond sales, along with coupon payments from bond held, dominate the
movements of reserves. Default though now also plays a role.
   Figure 5 shows the predicted path for net income and for the balance in the D account
after a 5-year crisis as in the last section. For these calculations, we assume the ECB receives
no payments from the euro governments when the bank’s net income is negative, and that the

ECB pays no dividend after an episode of negative income until its D balance is exhausted.
The figure shows three cases. In the first case, there is no default (cS = 1) in the crisis, just
as we observed in the data, whereas in the other two, coupons are impaired. The difference
between them is that, in one, which we call unanticipated default, the prices of the bonds do
not reflect the possibility of a default. In the second case, anticipated default, the prices of
the bonds in both periods reflect the rational expectation that the economy may enter state
2 and default occurs. The first case tries to capture the possibility that the default comes
as a surprise to the markets, that bond prices did not anticipate, whereas in the second case
the central bank would have bought the bonds that fueled the expansion in its balance sheet
at low prices, given their imminent default.
   When there is no default, the source of risk to the financial stability of the ECB is similar
to that for the Fed. When the economy exits the crisis, assets prices fall, and the ECB’s sales
of A
   C592 billion of its assets comes with a capital loss of A
                                                           C28 billion. The deferred account
has a positive balance for 5 years.
   With an anticipated default, on the one hand, the flow of coupon income is lower than
before, and no longer covers the depreciation of the bond as before, lowering net income. On
the other hand, the lower coupon implies that bond prices during the crisis are lower, so the
capital losses when exiting the crisis are smaller. The two effects close to cancel out so that,
both during the crisis as well as upon exit, the net income of the ECB is close to zero. This

confirms our previous conclusion that capital gains and losses in the central bank’s portfolio
from asset price movements is the main source of stability risk.
   With an unanticipated default though, the central bank now both suffers the losses from
the impaired coupons during the crisis, and the capital losses at the time of exit from the
crisis. In this case, the balance in the deferred account is considerable, peaking at A
                                                                                      C82 billion
and it takes many years to pay it off.

4.4         Institutional remedies: repo holdings
The baseline scenario considered only the direct holding of securities by the ECB. The ECB
has traditionally conducted its monetary policy using repurchase agreements with banks.
These repos are effectively term-lending to commercial banks collateralized by government
bonds or government-guaranteed securities. The ECB requires collateral in excess of the
value of the loan, by as much as 15 percent (the haircut), and frequently revalues its collateral
using market prices and requires extra collateral to be posted to lower its credit risk. A credit
loss from a repo involves both default by the borrowing bank and an impairment of the value
of the collateral in excess of the haircut. The ECB would suffer credit losses on its repos
only in the event of a general financial meltdown in the euro countries serious enough to
extinguish the haircut and cause the borrowing bank to default. Default would result in
reorganization of the bank and its exclusion from future borrowing from the ECB.


                                                                            34
   Repos have floating rates indexed to the one-week repo rate, so the relevant interest
rate is still the short-term safe rate rs . We let qs Bsd denote the real value of the securities
held directly and qs Bsr denote the real value of repos, so the total assets of the ECB are
Bs = Bsd + Bsr . If a meltdown has low probability, we can treat repos as safe loans, with
no risk of capital gains or losses to the ECB. In that case, repos have the same financial
character as negative reserves. Issuing reserves and investing the proceeds in repos has a
neutral effect on stability because this asset and liability earns exactly the same interest
rate. Likewise, any coupon payments or capital gains and losses stay with the bank, not the
ECB. Therefore, all the formulas from section 2 still apply as long as we replace Bs with Bsd
and V with V − qs Bsr .
   At the other extreme, with a significant probability of meltdown, the ECB faces the
possibility of capital losses, when euro banks become insolvent and the ECB’s collateral loses
value by more than the haircuts. In this case, we need to take into account the asymmetry
inherent in ownership of any debt claim, that the owner will never receive more than face
value but may receive less. Letting I be an indicator for the bank’s failure to pay off, net
income under the nominal mark-to-market rule becomes:
                                                                      is (V − Bsr )

                                                                   
                                                        (1 + is )qs
                   +I θcs + (1 − θ)es0 + (1 − δ)qs0 −                 Bsr                   (31)
                                                          1 + πs
The term preceded by I reflects the ECB’s capital loss if the bank fails to pay off the repo,
but also no longer pays the interest rate due on the repo contract. Our earlier analysis
of the conditions when reserves are stationary continues to apply. But in terms of our
simulations that follow, the change when banks fail to pay off on repos on impaired assets
can be substantial.
   Before 2008, the duration of the repos was mostly one week, with the longest being 3
months, so it would take extremely wide price movements in a short period of time for
a bank to become insolvent and not honor its repos with the ECB. Since 2008, 6-month
and 12-month repos became dominant, and in December 2011 and February 2012, the ECB
lent A
     C1 trillion through 3-year long-term refunding operations, effectively three-year repos.
Taking a worst case scenario, we assume that I = 1 if the return from holding the bonds is
negative. That is, banks do not pay off the repo when the economy exits the crisis.

              Figure 6: The ECB’s Finances under Different Types of Bond Holdings


   Figure 6 shows the net income and reserve borrowings of the ECB under different per-
spectives on the repos. In the first case, “safe repos”, we take the view that only bonds held
directly lead to risk, as in the previous figure. This scenario corresponds to I = 0 in the law
of motion. In the second case, we take the other extreme view that all of the bonds held
by the ECB are direct holdings, whether they are collateral for repos or not, in the same
way we did for the Federal Reserve. Finally, in the third scenario, “risky repos”, we take
the more realistic asymmetric case with I = 1. The ECB bears capital losses in excess of
haircuts, but not gains, on the bonds that it holds as collateral. For all cases, we assume
the case of unanticipated default, since this was the one for which losses were larger in our
previous experiment.
   If banks always perform on their repurchase agreements, the ECB ’s financial stability
suffers little risk, as we discussed above. If, instead, the banks fail on their repos when
asset prices fall, the ECB receives the collateral. The losses are A
                                                                   C76 billion. Compared
to the case were the ECB held all securities directly, with the repos, the ECB earns less
while entering and staying in the crisis, because the positive capital gains on the bonds stay
with the banks. But, when there are large capital losses, then the possibility that repos are
honored significantly lowers the risk to the ECB’s stability.

                                Figure 7: The ECB’s Finances after Quantitative Easing


4.5         Quantitative easing
Initially, in response to the crisis, the ECB expanded its repo program by both extending its
maturity and increasing its size. These long-term repurchase obligations (LTRO) extended
the usual procedures of operation of the ECB although, by continuing to accept government
securities that most credit agencies rated as junk and doing so for longer periods of time,
some of these new repos were farther from the safe repo case and closer to risky repos.
At the same time, the ECB also bought securities directly through the Outright Monetary
Transactions program (OMT), accounting for the increase in direct holdings in Table 6.
   At the start of 2015, the ECB announced a new policy, the Public Sector Purchase
Programme, to buy A
                  C1.08 trillion in government securities. This policy of quantitative
easing will roughly double the value of securities held directly by the ECB. To investigate
the effect of this policy on the financial stability of the ECB, we add a third state to the
model. It is the same as the crisis state, except that the ECB’s direct bond holdings double
relative to the crisis state. This state lasts for two years, before the economy finally exists
the crisis, back into state 1. Figure 7 describes the effect of this policy on the financial
position of the ECB.
   If there is no default, so that the securities that the ECB plans to buy turn out to be
safe, the larger balance sheet implies that capital losses at the time of the exit are now
significantly larger. As a result, the ECB accumulates a balance in its D account that only


                                                                         37
disappears 9 years after the exit. If coupons turn out to be unexpectedly impaired, the losses
are much larger, and the deferred account peaks at A
                                                   C196 billion, taking a very long time to
recover. Engaging in quantitative easing raises the risk of instability relative to enlarging the
repo program. Of course, this may be more than offset by potential benefits of this policy
in pursuing the ECB’s policy goals.


5     A Small Open Economy Central Bank and Exchange-
      Rate Risk
The assets of most central banks of small open economies include neither repo contracts
nor holdings of long-term bonds. Rather, gold and short-term foreign government debt are
the dominant assets, and currency and reserves are the main liabilities. For these banks,
δ = cs = 1, but the share of foreign-denominated assets is large, so θ is close to zero.

5.1    Exchange-rate risk and institutions
Relative to the Fed and the ECB, the accounts of the central bank of a typical small open
economy are easy to read. Because foreign short-term goverment debt is easy to value,
the way in which net income is assessed is close to our mark-to-market rule. And because
monetary operations involve exchanging foreign debt for domestic reserves, their assets are
directly held, without the complications of repo contracts. Therefore, the net income for a
typical, small open-economy central bank is:

                  ds0 = ns,s0 + rs (V(es0 )Bs − Vs ) + [es0 − (1 + rs )V(es0 )])Bs .          (32)

As well as seignorage and the return on its holdings of domestic bonds, the central bank
earns a return on its portfolio of foreign assets. It is positive if the exchange rate depreciation
(es0 ) is larger than was expected.
    When the foreign exchange holdings (Bs ) are small, net income is close to seignorage,
which is typically positive. Starting with the Asian financial crisis of the 1990s, many
central banks started accumulating large amounts of foreign assets. Combined with the
large volatility of exchange rate, this exposure leads these economies to experience negative
net income. Klüh and Stella (2002) and more recently Filardo and Grenville (2012) discuss
many of these cases in the past thirty years.


                                                 38
   These central banks sometimes experience negative net income, so we might expect that
they are more likely to take precautions to prevent unstable growth of reserves. This propo-
sition turns out to be true. For instance, the central bank of Mexico has the power to limit
dividends if there is a need to retain earnings against possible future losses due to move-
ments in exchange rates, or to bring down reserves after past unexpected losses and restore
accounting capital to positive levels. Between 2009 and 2014, the Banco de Mexico paid no
dividend in spite of positive net income.
   By contrast, the current charter of the Banco do Brasil provides that if net income is
negative, the fiscal authority must pay the bank the amount of the negative income. If this
commitment is truly unlimited, the Banco de Brasil would always be solvent as long as the
overall government is solvent—an application of our proposition 1.
   Relative to the Fed and the ECB, the dividend rules of the central banks of most small
open countries have more power to limit dividends when net income is positive, following ear-
lier periods of negative net income, just as in our model of the deferred account. Accordingly,
in spite of frequent losses, these banks’ reserves will be stable.

5.2    Exchange-rate pegs and financial stability
The combination of pegged exchange rates and large balance sheets in the form of foreign
reserves constitutes the new style of central banking for most small open economies. In the
typical case, the central bank tries to prevent the exchange rate from depreciating, by selling
foreign reserves. Insofar as this move is unexpected, the exchange rate depreciates by less
than what was expected by markets. Real interest rates rise as the central bank defends the
peg, and these higher expenses in paying the return on reserves are not offset by gains in the
foreign currency portfolio. Therefore, es0 − (1 + rs )V(es0 ) < 0 and the central bank realizes
losses. These central banks hold high Bs to defend the peg.
   Central banks are at risk of accumulating losses in the process of defending unrealistically
high pegs. Eventually, the peg is abandoned. When this happens, the large depreciation of
the currency would lead to large capital gains. But, by then, typically the central bank is
left with foreign bond holdings close to zero, so the gain ends up being minimal. The capital
gain does not offset the previous losses. A pattern of successive defense of unrealistic pegs
may lead to unstable growth of reserves.




                                               39
    A more unusual case arose out of the Swiss National Bank’s actions in 2015, when the SNB
unexpectedly dropped an earlier ceiling on its exchange rate with the euro. The Swiss franc
appreciated quickly, and the SNB realized a large loss. Our framework helps to understand
this decision from three perspectives. First, the announcement of QE by the ECB led to the
anticipation that the SNB’s holdings of euro-denominated debt would increase even further
to defend the peg. Second, the exchange rate of the euro-pegged Swiss franc relative to the
dollar had been depreciating steadily, leading to the expectation that a future abandonment
of the peg would come with a very large appreciation relative to the euro. Third, the reserve
debt of the SNB was already close to the size of the GDP of Switzerland, so that there was
limited fiscal room for either the Treasury to transfer funds or even for future net income to
provide for present losses. Therefore, in early 2015, the SNB, given its intention of sooner
or later abandoning the peg to the euro, could anticipate that if it waited just a few more
months to do so, it would face a more negative es0 − (1 + rs )V(es0 ), multiplying a much larger
Bs , generating larger losses ds0 , which neither the Treasury not future seignorage might be
able to offset. The SNB had to abandon the peg immediately to prevent a large expansion
of its outstanding reserves and the risk of insolvency.
    A final interesting case connected to pegs arises when a small open economy in a devel-
oping country successfully engages in an inflation stabilization program. If this was partly
unexpected, it leads to an appreciation of the exchange rate. Central-bank losses would en-
sue. Central bank reserve expansion may be a perverse consequence of central bank success
at controlling inflation.


6     Concluding Remarks
We have provided a systematic analyses of central bank financial health. We have applied
a reasonable definition of central bank financial stability as the achievement of stationary
levels of the bank’s reserve borrowings from commercial banks. We went on to study what
affects stability, and when is it in danger. After describing the resource constraint of the
central bank, we showed that if that rule is to pay a dividend equal to net income, the
central bank is always solvent. However, under new-style central banking, that is, with
central banks that pay interest on reserves, have large balance sheets, and have exposure to
interest-rate, default, and exchange-rate risk, net income will sometimes be negative. This
rule requires periodic payments from the government to the central bank. Without this direct


                                              40
fiscal backing or its equivalent, in the form of programmed reductions in future dividends
following an episode of negative income, the central bank could be on an unstable path of
endlessly borrowing in the form of reserves.
   We studied the workings of a deferred account to keep reserves under control. We found
that its balance provides an operational measure of the financial strength of the central bank.
We then showed how different institutions, such as not marking assets to market, holding
them as repos, or being able to build provisions against future losses may work to increase
the financial strength of the central bank. We showed how to make our theory applicable
to most central bank finances, and how to use it to inform policy choices, such as when to
manage the exit from U.S. QE, to measure the effects of European QE, and to abandon the
peg of the Swiss franc to the euro.
   Our analysis keeps real interest rates (rs ), central bank asset holdings (Bs ), and inflation
(πs ) at given values, as background for our study of the evolution of the central bank’s
net income (y), reserves (V ), and financial strength (D) for a rule on dividends (d). In
our applications, we studied how differences in each of the real economy, financial policy or
inflation policy affected the financial stability of the central bank. Future work can build on
our results to jointly study financial stability and each of these three policies. Our results
already provide initial guidance on all three fronts.
   Incorporating the determination of rs would involve models of monetary non-neutrality—
the fact that central-bank policies that set nominal interest rates have effects on real activity.
There is already some research in the past two years that uses our framework to do this; we
describe it in appendix A.
   This paper provides some first steps in designing financial policy, as captured in our
bond-holding variable, Bs . We showed that capital gains and losses on these bond holdings
are the main issue in central-bank stability. Larger asset holding, longer duration of bonds,
and more direct holdings instead of repos during the crisis increase the risks. Reducing the
size of the portfolio before interest rates rise implies lower losses when the rise occurs. These
effects of different bond-holding policies on financial stability may or may not be offset by
benefits that bond purchases by the central bank may have on financial markets. Research
has been active recently in quantifying those benefits
   Finally, with respect to inflation policy πs , we found that higher inflation improves fi-
nancial stability by both increasing seignorage as well as by raising the rate at which the



                                               41
extra reserves from previous shortfalls fall in their real value. Still, we found that even small
losses for the Fed would require very large increases in inflation.

A      Survey of the Literature
One strand of work has studied the accounting principles and the history of central banks
around the world to document when the accounting capital of the central bank is negative.
Milton and Sinclair (2010) is a useful starting point, and Dalton and Dziobek (2005), Ize
(2007) and Leone (1994) are earlier examples. This literature struggles to explain conceptu-
ally why central bank capital matters and why central banks operate with negative capital
so often. Our theoretical framework explains why balance-sheet capital per se does not
determine the stability of a central bank, but that we can use it as an imperfect measure
of the amount Z by which the central bank would have to be funded to return reserves to
their stationary path. Moreover, our study of different institutions and our formal treatment
of the determinants of central bank stability complement this literature’s collection of case
studies.
    Stella (1997), Stella (2007), and Klüh and Stella (2002) discuss whether measures of
central bank accounting capital constrain monetary policy actions. Berriel and Bhattarai
(2009) formalize the effects that a concern for its capital will have on the interest rates
chosen by a central bank, while Bhattarai, Eggertsson and Gafarov (2014), Berriel and
Mendes (2015), and Benigno and Nistico (2015) discuss how the maturity composition of
the balance sheet affects the ability of the central bank to commit to future monetary policies
and to keep inflation on target. Our approach is the opposite, and complementary to these
papers. They take as given the stability of the central bank and study its effects on interest
rates and inflation. We take interest rates and inflation as given and study the implications
for stability.
    We focus on the solvency of the central bank from the perspective of central bank in-
dependence and define it as generating a state-dependent, non-explosive path for reserves.
Buiter (2007) and Sims (2003) also discuss the separation between the Treasury and the
central banks’ resource constraints in terms of central bank independence. We take the next
step by showing that the dividend rule connecting these two branches of the government
defines the financial stability of the central bank and by studying the effect of different rules.
Reis (2015) proceeds by discussing different perspectives on central bank solvency in terms
of different constraints on dividends.

   A complementary approach sprang up after we circulated the first draft of this paper. It
assumes that the dividend rule is that the present value of dividends must be non-negative. In
this case, the central bank will remain independent of the fiscal authorities and solvent as long
as it satisfies an intertemporal budget constraint, as emphasized by Reis (2013b). Bassetto
and Messer (2013) discuss how the payment of interest on reserves affects this intertemporal
constraint. Del Negro and Sims (2015) study how inflation may have to change to generate
the seignorage revenue that will keep the central bank solvent. Hilscher et al. (2015) measure
the present value of the central bank dividends and estimate by how much it changes with
inflation. Quinn and Roberds (2014) present the fascinating case of the Bank of Amsterdam
in 1781-1792, which became intertemporally insolvent after significant losses, leading to the
disappearance of the Dutch bank florin, following the process that we described in section 2.
   A series of papers studied the particular risk for the net income of the Federal Reserve
of its recent balance sheet. Carpenter, Ihrig, Klee, Quinn and Boote (2013) and Greenlaw,
Hamilton, Hooper and Mishkin (2013) present statistical projections for components of the
balance sheet of the Federal Reserve, while Christensen, Lopez and Rudebusch (2015) use
a dynamic term structure model to obtain precise estimates of the interest-rate risk facing
the Fed. Our two conclusions from section 3 agree with theirs: the main risk facing the
Fed is interest-rate risk, and it materializes into lower net income when exiting the crisis.
While our calculations are more imprecise and take a worst case scenario, these other authors
carefully calculate plausible estimates. At the same time, they do not answer why negative
net income would matter, while we provide a theoretical analysis. Also, while their applied
study is relevant only for the Fed, we provide a general theory that applies to any central
bank.
   Outside of the United States, a considerable literature had documented how the expo-
sure to exchange-rate risk often led central banks to record negative net income. Vergote,
Studener, Efthymiadis and Merriman (2010) discusses the first eleven years of the ECB and
the Bank for International Settlements (2012) the experience of Asian countries pegging
exchange rates. We provide a theoretical framework to understand these episodes.
   Some papers have studied the institutions that may affect the solvency of the central
bank. Archer and Moser-Boehm (2013), like us, emphasize the central role of the rule
for dividends in determining the financial stability of the central bank, and provide a rich
discussion of the institutions in place at many central banks. Goodfriend (1994) discusses an



                                               47
exceptional transfer from the Fed to the Treasury in the early 1990s and how it compromised
central bank independence. Goodfriend (2014) starts from our warning that the Fed will
likely have negative net income, and suggests that it should provision its earnings—that
is, pay down some reserves so as to create a buffer of borrowing power to deal with future
situations where net income is negative. Reis (2013a) makes the more radical proposal to
sever completely the resource link between the central bank and the Treasury by having the
central bank dividends paid to a public trust fund that supports a public good, like basic
research in the social sciences.


B      Multiple Central Bank Investments
Consider a central bank that can split its investment at date t between long-term infinitely-
lived bonds BtL , short-term one-period bonds BtS , and short-term foreign assets BtF . Their
respective prices are qtL , qtS and t , where the latter is the real exchange rate for the foreign
bond. The total value of the portfolio today then is:

                                   qtL BtL + qtS BtS + t BtF ≡ qt Bt ,

where qt Bt is the defined total value of the portfolio.
    The payoff of the portfolio one period later is:

                                           L
                                   (c̃t + qt+1 )BtL + BtS + t+1 BtF .

since c̃t is the coupon on the long-term bond, while the short-term bond and the foreign
bond have no coupon. This will match our formulation in equation (7) if it equals:

                              qt+1 [θct + (1 − θ)et+1 − (1 − δ)]Bt .

    One can verify that this is true as long as:
                                                    t BtF
                                       θt = 1 −            ,
                                                     qt Bt

                                       δt   = t t ,
                                              θt qt Bt
                                       qt   = qtL ,
                                              t+1 qt
                                     et+1   =          ,

    Therefore, the relevant assumption is that θt and δt are constant over time, or in other
words, that the central bank keeps the portfolio shares of short-term, long-term and foreign
bonds constant. If this condition holds, the artificial delta composite bond in the main text
will accurately capture the payoffs of this more complicated and realistic portfolio.


C        The US Data and Simulations
Table 4 shows the estimated transition matrix among the states of the model and the sta-
tionary distribution across the states. The subjective discount factor β in the model is
0.985.
    Applying our procedure to determine bond prices gives the results in Table 5. Notice
that marginal utility is quite low in the crisis state, 5, corresponding to a high level of
consumption in that state. To rationalize the low real interest rate in the crisis state in
terms of the consumption Euler equation, it must be the case that consumption is expected
to fall when in the crisis. Accordingly, consumption in the crisis must be unusually high.
Obviously aggregate consumption does not behave this way across our states. Hall (2011)
discusses how low real interest rates in the crisis might be consistent with the consumption
paths of a limited group of wealthier consumers who participate in securities markets. Most
consumers, in that view, are at a corner in their intertemporal consumption problems, so the
slope of their consumption profiles does not contribute to asset pricing. He points to data
from the Survey of Consumer Finances to support this hypothesis.
    Figure 8 shows the nominal interest rate and the nominal bond price over our simulation
period.

D      The Euro-Area Data and Simulations
Table 6 shows the transition matrix and the stationary distribution for the Euro-Area data.
We derived the matrix by assuming a stationary probability of 0.081 for the crisis state, and
a conditional probability of entering a crisis of 0.016, the numbers for the United States.
    Table 7 shows the financial environment that results from our pricing exercise at the
ergodic distribution. This is in the case where default happens and is anticipated by agents,
so it is reflected in bond prices. In turn, Table 8 shows the corresponding ergodic distribution
of dividends, which is positive in all states.
    Figure 9, Figure 10, and Figure 11 show the simulation results for the ECB under our
crisis scenario and with unanticipated defaults. We set the inflation target to 0.5 percent so
that the nominal interest rate is close to zero in the crisis state. The results are similar to
the ones for the United States.
