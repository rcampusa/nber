Board Interlocks and the Propensity to be Targeted in Private Equity Transactions

                                               ABSTRACT

In this paper, we examine the propensity for U.S. public companies to become targets for private equity-backed,
take-private transactions. We consider the characteristics of 483 private equity-backed deals in the
2000-2007 period relative to public companies, and find that, in addition to the financial drivers studied
in previous works, board characteristics and director networks are also associated with deal generation.
We find that a company that has a director who has had LBO experience through prior board service
is ~40% more likely to receive a private equity offer, and that the strength of this effect varies with
the influence of the director and the quality of the prior LBO experience. This effect is robust to the
most likely alternative explanations and supports the idea that directors and social networks play an
influential role in change-of-control transactions.

       Social networks among the agents in a market can affect the nature of financial

transactions and their outcomes. When information is privately held, the specific links

among market participants in the social network often determine who acquires

information, when they obtain it, how to interpret its significance, and how to effectively

deploy it. Here, we examine the vast network that selectively interconnects tens of

thousands of members of boards of directors of domestic, publicly held corporations. The

director “interlock” network arises because many company officers and directors serve

on multiple boards, thus creating information pathways between specific pairs of

corporate boards. This is exactly the type of network that we would anticipate will

influence corporate governance-related outcomes; it connects important decision makers

who often operate in an environment characterized by incomplete information.

       In this paper, we associate board “interlocks” with firms’ propensities to become

targets in private-equity-backed, take-private transactions. The private equity industry has

expanded rapidly in recent years. In 2006 and 2007 alone, $700B was invested in take-

private transactions of US public firms. Notwithstanding the market’s abrupt collapse in

August 2007, the industry’s recent upsurge has been called a new wave of private equity,

characterized by cheap debt, large inflows of capital, frequent auctions, the emergence of

club deals, and a preponderance of friendly takeovers. However, despite the

unprecedented scale of recent deals and their marked differences from those of the 1980s,

the drivers of take-private activity have not been systematically examined in a broad

sample of U.S. firms since research on the hostile takeover wave of the 1980s. In addition

to presenting estimates of the effects of basic firm-level characteristics of private equity

transactions, the recent backdrop of friendly deals offers a favorable context in which to




                                              3
study the influence of boards and the role of board interlocks, which we believe yield

interesting insights into the role of social networks in corporate transactions.

         Corporate directors are key agents in all potential change of control transactions.

With respect to private equity offers, boards may influence transaction probabilities

through a number of mechanisms. First, because most recent private equity deals have

been friendly, if directors oppose a private equity offer, behind-the-scenes discussions of

a potential bid may never become public. Thus, a board’s opposition may cause the take-

private process to shutdown before public disclosure occurs. Second, directors may

actively participate in off-the-record discussions that convey to private equity firms the

openness of the companies they represent to take-private offers. Similarly, directors may

be more or less open to the idea of management-initiated discussion about the possibility

of a private equity deal. Third, viewed from the private equity side of the transaction,

firms with certain director characteristics may, ceteris paribus, represent more appealing

targets because the takeover process would be anticipated to occur efficiently or under

more favorable terms. 1 Any or all of these factors would be sufficient to create an

association between board characteristics and the probability that a firm becomes a target

in a PE transaction.

         The most novel contribution of this paper is the examination of board interlocks

in driving a firm’s hazard rate of receiving a PE-backed take-private offer (hereafter, “PE

Tx”), presumably by influencing a director’s disposition toward adopting a pro-PE

stance. Two firms are said to be interlocked if, either concurrently or at different points in

time, their boards share a common director. In 2007, approximately 85% of public firms

1
 In conversations with partners at private equity firms, we were explicitly told that potential transactions
with experienced, knowledgeable, and “professional” directors were viewed more favorably than the
alternative.


                                                      4
were interlocked with at least one other company. Within the complete set of director

interlocks, we take a subset of linkages and create a dummy variable “PE Link” at the

firm/board level, which equals one when a given firm has one or more directors with

links to past take-private experience. For example, Eugene Davis sat on the board of

Metals USA in 2005 when it received a take private offer from Apollo Management. Mr.

Davis also served on the board of Knology Inc from 2004-2007. In 2006 and 2007,

Knology would have PE Link=1, due to the relationship it has with the Metals USA

buyout via Mr. Davis.

       Following a large literature in sociology and a growing one in finance and

economics, we believe that director interlocks create information pathways between

firms. These links may lower the cost of acquiring information pertinent to the take

private process. For instance, PE-linked directors of an at-risk firm will have existing

relationships with attorneys, bankers, members of private equity firms, and other

individuals whose services may be required in the take private process. Depending on

their previous experiences, PE-linked directors also may be well positioned to assess the

terms of a potential transaction, the reputation of the private equity firm, the chance that

an initiated transaction will be completed successfully, and so on. Moreover, interlocked

directors may be particularly influential on their respective boards. The relevance of this

influence is that interlocked directors’ views on whether to consider a change of control

transaction and what alternative would be most favorable may garner the greatest weight

in boardroom deliberations. In other words, insofar as board-level decisions emerge from

an intra-board influence process, we anticipate that interlocked directors with private




                                              5
equity experience will exert the strongest “peer effects” in boardroom deliberations about

these transactions.

       Our results support the core hypothesis about linkages to past take private deals.

We find that firms with one or more directors who have experienced a private equity

transaction at another firm at which they were a director or officer are, depending upon

the specification, 30-40% more likely to become take-private targets.

       We conduct an array of supplemental analyses to address alternative explanations.

Two salient stories for PE Link immediately come to mind. First, the result may reflect a

reverse causal process by which management teams that favor a private equity transaction

recruit directors with PE experience to their boards. Second, it is undoubtedly the case

that directors and firms match to each other on many characteristics, which raises the

possibility that an unobserved variable may drive both PE Link and PE Tx. Regarding the

first concern, we find that PE Link holds for long-seated directors who are unlikely to be

placed on the board by management for the purpose of facilitating a private equity deal.

Similarly, we find that the PE Link holds when we consider only the influence of

directors who held positions on the board of a given at-risk firm since a date that

preceded the time when they gained PE experience through a second directorship. With

respect to possible omitted variables, we find that PE Link holds after controlling for

numerous characteristics that could induce the observed matching between firms and

directors; that the timing of PE Link activation within a firm matters; and that having a

PE-experienced director matters most when the individual director that creates the

interlock is influential and has had a positive prior PE experience. The latter results

suggest that the interlocked director himself has an influence on the outcome, rather than




                                              6
the effect being driven solely by an omitted characteristic. Considered collectively, we

believe these findings support the view that boards play an important role in PE

transactions, and that in particular, the board network serves as a conduit for the

transmission of experience and influence that meaningfully affects financial transactions.

       The paper is organized as follows. Section 1 reviews the related streams of

literature and provides some background on the private equity process. Section 2

describes the data and summary statistics. Section 3 provides baseline results on the

drivers of PE offers and provides estimates of the interlock effect. Section 4 addresses

potential alternative explanations in interpreting the interlock effect. Section 5 presents

additional analysis, and Section 6 concludes.



1. Background and Literature Review



       The Private Equity Process. In the typical, friendly private equity deal,

representatives from the private equity firm and target management engage in informal

talks to assess mutual interest in the deal. Participants on both sides of these transactions

describe an active role of social networks in generating leads for potential PE deals. For

instance, conversations with industry veterans revealed that important sources of deal

leads were specific contacts at region- and industry-specialized investment banks (in

addition to the large Wall Street banks), as well as executives with whom they had prior

(professional or social) relationships.

       In the early stages of negotiations between management and PE principals, the

board (in cases in which it is not involved from the beginning) is informed of talks and is




                                              7
updated on negotiation proceedings. The board will often then hire its own financial and

legal counsel and form a special committee comprised of independent directors to

evaluate the deal. The merger agreement then will require board approval before it can be

sent out to shareholders via proxy; the actual vote then takes place at a special

shareholder meeting called for the purpose. Thus, although shareholders have the final

vote and management is often the initial contact for negotiations, board approval is a

critical step in the completion of a private equity transaction. The alternative to a friendly

deal for an acquirer is to go directly to the shareholders via a tender offer, but this is

costly due to legal filing fees, mailing costs, defensive tactics by the board, and the risk

of attracting competing bidders. 2



         Propensity to Become a PE Target. Hostile takeovers were the norm in the deals

of the 1980s, which have been the main focus of the existing literature on the drivers of

private equity transactions. The papers on 1980s LBOs primarily examined the free cash

flow and undervaluation hypotheses of take private transactions (Lehn and Poulsen 1988;

Opler and Titman 1993; Kieschnick 1998; Halpern, Kieschnick, and Rotenberg 1999).

The handful of papers focusing on more recent deals have added ownership structure and

firm visibility (i.e. analyst coverage, share liquidity) as potential determinants of going

private activity. In a sample with 95 UK deals in 1998-2000, Weir, Laing, and Wright

(2005) find that CEO and institutional ownership positively related to the likelihood of

going private. Fidrmuc, Roosenboom, and van Dijk (2007) use a multinomial logit


2
  In addition to the higher cost of completing a hostile bid, members of three of the largest PE firms told us
that their private placement memoranda specifically prohibit the partnership from pursuing hostile buyout
offers. Thus anecdotal result is consistent with the fact that only 2% of the transactions in the data were
hostile deals.


                                                      8
framework in a sample of 212 UK deals, 1997-2003, to study the comparative drivers of

MBOs versus PE-backed deals. They find that both MBOs and PE deals are undervalued;

low analyst coverage predicts only MBOs; and that executive ownership drives both

MBOs and PE deals but that institutional ownership only drives PE deals.

       The more recent papers have focused on UK deals (primarily due to the

availability of comprehensive UK transaction data from the Centre for Management

Buyout Research), and none have studied the very recent period of private equity activity,

which only peaked in 2006 to 2007. In contrast, our analysis focuses on US deals in the

post-2000 period. Given that the nature of private equity activity has undergone

substantial changes since the 1980s and the area of US deals has not been recently

revisited, we expect a set of baseline estimates that provide a more relevant and timely

picture of the drivers of US private equity activity. We also contribute to this literature by

examining the role of social networks as a correlate of PE activity.



       Networks in Markets. The study of board interlocks in particular and social

networks more generally has been pioneered by sociologists. Since the late 1970s,

sociologists have studied the interfirm connections that are created when the same

individual director either simultaneously or sequentially serves on the boards of multiple

companies (e.g., Useem 1984; Mizruchi 1992). For example, Davis (1991) shows that the

decision to adopt poison pills is correlated with director interlocks—anti-takeover

defenses appear to have diffused across director-interlocked boards in a predictable

pattern. In a qualitative study, Khurana (2001) shows that directors search across the

interlock network when identifying and doing diligence on potential CEO candidates.




                                              9
       Financial economists recently have adopted some of the ideas and techniques of

social network analysis to study the consequences of director connections for different

market outcomes. Larcker, Richardson, Seary, and Tuna (2005) argue that personal

relationships between CEOs and “independent” directors reduce the independence of

boards. They employ a measure of path distances (the minimum number of

intermediaries that are required to connect two agents) in the director network to assess

the relational proximity between inside and outside directors on boards. Larcker et al.

find that CEO compensation is higher in firms with relationally “cozy” boards. In an

analysis of social networks in the boardroom of a large sample of French companies,

Kramarz and Thesmar (2006) find that CEOs who were former civil servants were more

likely to accumulate directorships (thus creating multiple firm-to-firm interlocks), but

were also more likely to run less profitable firms and were less likely to be replaced for

poor performance. Fich and Shivdasani (2006) find that independent directors that sit on

multiple boards—so-called “busy directors—are associated with weak corporate

governance, and boards dominated by such directors exhibit governance characteristics

similar to that of insider-dominated boards.

       Beyond inter-firm board connections, Cohen, Frazzini, and Malloy (2007) study

educational networks shared by mutual fund managers and the directors of the companies

in their portfolio. They find that mutual fund managers perform better on investments

when directors of their portfolio companies are members of their networks. They

interpret their results as showing that network connections confer information advantages

to fund managers. Other recent papers have shown that social networks affect investment

choices and fund returns in venture capital (Sorenson and Stuart 2001; Hochberg,




                                               10
Ljungqvist, and Lu 2007), the availability of financing for real estate transactions

(Garmaise and Moskowitz, 2003), and the governance structure of strategic alliance

contracts (Robinson and Stuart 2007). Thus, social networks are known to influence

transaction patterns and impact real financial outcomes in an array of settings.

        We contribute to the work on social networks in finance by examining one of the

most important corporate outcomes: change of control decisions. Not only are board-level

decisions critical in this process, we believe that inter-board relationships also have

meaningful effects. In the remainder of the paper, our objectives are twofold: first, for a

broad sample of firms, we present updated baseline estimates of the probability that a

firm is targeted in a PE Tx; second, we connect the PE Tx propensity to the growing

literature on social networks in financial markets.



2. Data and Summary Statistics



        Sample of going private transactions. Our sample consists of 657 deals

announced from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2007 and identified as “Going Private”

transactions in Thomson’s SDC Platinum M&A database and Capital IQ. 3 We collected

all transactions from both databases and deleted duplicate observations. These are US

targets, which we could verify traded on the New York, American, or Nasdaq stock

exchanges on the announcement date. Deals are categorized as “PE” if a private equity

firm is part of the acquiring party, “MBO” if the deal is a management-led buyout

without private equity involvement, or “Other,” which includes financial buyers such as


3
 This includes 21 transactions from SDC flagged as “LBO” but appropriately considered “Going Private”
upon reading descriptions of the deal.


                                                 11
wealthy individuals investors (e.g., Carl Icahn) or other unaffiliated investor groups.

Table 1 shows that PE deals comprise 483 of the 657 deals, and constitute $800B of

$850B of value in going private activity in 2000-2007. The MBO category is much

smaller in total deal value and average deal size, and as PE activity has expanded in

recent years the share of going private activity in the MBO category has fallen—

especially as management itself increasingly turns to private equity firms to help finance

deals it originates. PE deals are approximately 8 times (mean) and 12.5 times (median)

the size of take private transactions that are management-led. The 483 PE deals involve

454 firm-years and 435 distinct firms, as competing bids and withdrawn bids are possible

in our sample of announced transactions. These 454 firm-year observations on PE-backed

deal announcements comprise our dependent variable of interest, i.e. PE Tx=1.



        Comparison of PE target versus all public firm characteristics . To explain

the propensity of firms to be targeted in PE-backed going private offers, we compare

firms that received a PE Tx offer to the population of all US public firms from which the

take private transactions are drawn. We collected firm characteristics broadly relating to

financial situation, ownership and governance structure, and network characteristics. Data

on stock prices and company financials came from CRSP and Compustat. Institutional

ownership data comes from the Thomson Financial CDA/Spectrum 13F database,

compiled from SEC filings of institutional money managers who control over $100M of

13F securities. Data on ownership by insiders (officers and directors of the firm) come

from Compact Disclosure. 4 We obtained information on corporate directors from the

4
 One important limitation of the insider ownership data is that Compact Disclosure does not distinguish
directors’ from executives’ holdings. We know only the total of insider holdings in the firm.


                                                   12
Directors Database, which provides board composition data for public firms trading on

the New York, American, and Nasdaq stock exchanges in 2000-2007. 5 In addition to

directors’ identities, the database includes characteristics such as insider/outsider status,

each director’s primary company affiliation and primary job title. Using this database, we

construct variables such as board size, fraction of inside directors, CEO-chairman duality,

and other board characteristics related to director attributes. The database also contains

information on public firms’ top executives, 6 which we use to determine other positions

held by directors.

         Table 2 shows differences in means and medians of basic attributes of the

companies in the data broken out by whether or not firms have received a PE-backed take

private offer. Differences between the PE and Public groups are significant for most of

the financial variables, but the differences in measures of size become much less

pronounced using median comparisons (i.e. for total capitalization and assets); this

reflects the greater right skew of the size of public firms. Also, it appears that although

PE firms are smaller, they have larger EBITDA and free cash flow, defined as (EBITDA-

interest-taxes-dividends). The PE and public samples also show very strong differences in

ownership and board structure, with PE firms having higher institutional ownership,

smaller boards, and a lower proportion of inside directors.



         Network measures. The Directors Database provides data on all public board

memberships held by a director over the period 2000-2007. We are able to use this data


5
  The Directors Database is the most comprehensive dataset on corporate directors, but it dates back only to
the year 2000. Data availability rather than substantive considerations led to our choice of time period.
6
  Coverage of executives is somewhat inconsistent across firms, however, with no satisfactory answer from
the data vendor on which executives get reported.


                                                    13
to track directors across firms and over time to construct measures of director experience

and of interlocking relationships between boards. We say a focal firm i is interlocked

with firm j at time t (Int itj = 1) if there exists a director x on firm i at time t who either

serves on the board of j or is an executive officer of j at time t’, for some t’ ≤ t . This

interlock measure is intended to capture connections a firm has with other companies via

its board of directors. As we have constructed it, this is an asymmetric measure of

interlock (different papers have used different definitions) because it is possible that

Int itj = 1 but Int ijt ≠ 1 if linked director x is on the board of i but is a non-board executive

of j. We do not limit interlocks to board-to-board relationships because we believe board

members can derive sources of influence and information from other companies, either as

directors or executives.

        Note as well that our definition of an interlock link leads to a stock variable, in

that connections in the network need not be contemporaneous. We believe that this is the

appropriate way to measure links because directors serving on boards in the present carry

their previous learning, experience, and contacts with them to the boards on which they

currently and subsequently serve.

        A firm’s Board Interlock measure is the firm’s total interlock count with other

public firms, or   ∑ Int
                   j ≠i
                            j
                           it   . Table 2 shows that the median public company is interlocked


with five other firms. In comparison, the median firm receiving a PE-backed going

private offer has eight interlocks. Table 3 Panel A shows the distribution of Board

Interlock in 2007, and we see that only 10% of firms are “isolates”; all members of such

firms’ boards appear only once in the Director’s Database. All other companies are




                                                   14
connected to at least one other firm via its board interlock network. For future analysis,

we also define an Interlock Dummy that equals 1 if Board Interlock>0, and 0 otherwise.

       We also consider network measures at the director (rather than firm) level. In the

social networks literature the simplest measure of centrality is an agent’s degree score,

which is the number of links involving the agent. In our case, a link is a director on firm i

holding a director or executive position on firm j. Thus, analogous to our definition of

board interlock, we define a director’s centrality to be the number of firms on which he

has held a director or executive position, currently or in the past. Table 3 Panel B shows

the distribution of Director Centrality among directors serving on boards in 2007. We can

see that 58% of directors serve only one board; the remaining 42% create all of the

linkages in the data. At the firm level, we can construct an average centrality measure

from the centralities of the individual directors on each board. Table 2 shows that at the

median public firm, the average director serves on the boards of 0.7 other firms.

       The variable of primary interest in our paper is “PE Link”—whether an “at risk”

firm is interlocked through a shared director with another firm that in the past received a

going private offer; we are interested in whether this relationship makes the firm more

likely to itself receive a PE-backed take private offer. Formally, PELink it = 1 if

Int itj = 1 for some firm j and j received a going private offer in t’<t. Here, there are two

things of note: the past transaction must strictly precede the year “at risk,” and we

consider the broader sample of going private transactions (rather than only PE-backed

ones) where the linked director could have acquired the prior transaction experience.

Although we are specifically interested in the realization of PE-backed offers as the

outcome variable (PE Tx), we believe general take private experience is valuable to



                                              15
directors and can influence their attitude toward future take-private transactions, PE-

backed or otherwise.

       Table 4 shows the number of public firms that have identified interlock

relationships with take-private targets in prior years, that is, have PE Link=1. However, a

data truncation problem arises if we rely on the 2000-2007 Directors Database to

construct our PE Link variable. Because PE Link=1 only if we are able to match one or

more of a firm’s directors to a second firm that experienced a take-private offer in a

preceding year, the PE Link variable in the earlier years of our sample is severely

truncated. For example, for a public firm “at risk” in 2003, we identify the directors that

sit on the board of the firm in 2003, and consider the other boards that they served on in

2000, 2001, and 2002. If any of the firms that these directors served on in those years had

received a going private proposal, then PE Link=1. This naturally means that firms at risk

in the year 2000—the first in our dataset—cannot have identified links to going private

deals, since we do not have data on director composition prior to that year.

       To alleviate this problem, we hand-collected data on all take-private transactions

from 1995-1999 and obtained the directors that served on the boards of these companies

in the year of the transaction using Compact Disclosure. Then we matched these directors

to those in the Directors Database to identify all instances of interlocks between earlier

(1995-1999) period going private transactions and active directors in the 2000-2007

period. Table 4 shows that this addition makes a substantial difference in the earlier years

of the sample, with 10% interlocks among all firms and 25% interlocks among firms

receiving PE offers in 2000, which otherwise would be 0%. However, the monotonic

increase in the proportion of interlocks from 2000-2007 still remains, and likely indicates




                                             16
that the truncation problem has been attenuated but not eliminated. As all specifications

include year fixed effects, the major implication of this data truncation is that the effect of

PE Link on propensity to receive private equity-backed going private proposals is less

precisely estimated in the earlier years of the sample. However, it is also clear that the

sample interlock average of 18% for all public firms and 34% for all firms receiving

private equity-backed offers understates the true interlock rate for boards of directors. By

2007, these percentages grow to 29% and 49%, respectively.

       Table 5 also gives additional characteristics of the PE Link variable. A firm-year

can have PE Link=1 through the presence of one or more director who have experienced

the same or multiple different prior deals. Panel A shows that 78% of PE Link=1 firm-

years are generated by a single link between the focal firm-year and a prior going private

experience. Panel B shows that 94% of directors who “induce” PE Link=1 have only

experienced a single deal; with a maximum of 3 deals experienced by 1% of involved

directors, there are no directors who are disproportionately responsible for collecting and

propagating PE experiences. This will become important later, as it does not appear that

there exists a coterie of directors who are recruited to public firm boards because they are

known to be friendly to PE-led take private transactions.



3. Baseline Results



       Table 6 shows logit regression results of the probability of a firm becoming a PE-

backed target. Columns (2)-(4) of the table incorporate financial ratios and measures of

equity ownership that have commonly been considered in the literature. In (2) we




                                              17
consider market-based variables such as market capitalization, market-to-book, and

liquidity (share turnover), and find that, consistent with the literature, smaller, more

undervalued, and less liquid firms are more likely to be PE targets. For a sense of

economic magnitudes 7 : a one standard deviation increase in the following covariates

results in a (parentheses) decrease in the probability of becoming a target: size (23%),

market-to-book (60%), and liquidity (25%). Column (3) includes measures of leverage

and cash flow, but it is interesting to note that despite the prevalent practitioner concern

over cash flow and debt capacity in private equity transactions, neither the debt to total

capitalization ratio nor free cash flow consistently predict the likelihood of receiving a

take private offer. This finding is consistent with prior research, and with the idea that ex

ante leverage is not as relevant as post-deal leverage capacity.

         In (4) we add covariates related to firms’ equity ownership structure. We find that

a 10 pt increase in institutional ownership raises the probability of a deal by 17%, while a

10 pt increase in insider shareholdings raises the probability by 9%. The positive effects

of these ownership variables could arise for a number of reasons. First, PE firms may be

most attracted to firms with concentrated shareholder bases because mobilizing support

for transactions involving firms with concentrated ownership is comparatively simple.

Second, because executives of the company are typically bought out at a premium to the

current market price and then (assuming their continued involvement with the firm) are

reloaded with equity in the private company, insiders with large ownerships stakes may

 Estimates of effects on outcome probability are based on coefficients in column (6), which will constitute
our baseline specification. Estimates of effects are calculated as follows: define odds(X) as p/(1-p) where
p is the outcome success probability evaluated at the vector of covariate values X. Then for a dxk change in
covariate Xk with coefficient estimate bk, exp(bk*dxk)=odds(X+ bk*dxk)/odds(X). Because in our sample 1-
p ≈ 1, exp(bk*dxk) approximately gives the ratio of p evaluated at (X+ bk*dxk ) to p evaluated at X; or
equivalently, the percent increase in the outcome success probability relative to baseline due to dxk.


                                                     18
have a particularly strong incentive to secure PE-led bids. Third, large institutional

owners—particularly those that are unsatisfied with a company’s management team and

share price performance—often pressure directors and managers of the firm to consider a

change of control transaction.

       Column (5) extends the baseline results to include board-level covariates. We find

that a large board is negatively related to receiving a PE offer, possibly due to

coordination costs that may deter a PE offer or hinder decision-making. We also include

an Interlock Dummy set equal to 1 if the at-risk firm has any interlocks, past or present,

with other companies. We find that being connected to other firms increases the

likelihood of PE offer by 61%. There are a number of possible interpretations of this

result. First, by definition, interlocked directors have more public board experiences than

do non-interlocked directors. Thus, they are likely to be perceived as professional by

potential PE bidders. Transaction costs with experience boards in the take-private process

are likely to be lowered, and members of the board itself may perceive a more

straightforward process when experienced directors are on hand. Second, boards that are

interlocked are privy to a greater amount of the information flow across the broader board

network. We surmise that these interlocks increase the likelihood that a focal company

will be directly networked to potential bidders. These factors are likely to positively

stimulate PE interest in a company, and vice versa.

       Columns (6) includes basic controls for industry-level effects in the form of

industry fixed effects defined at the Fama-French 48 level. Column (6) will constitute the

baseline specification for analysis going forward.




                                             19
        Turning to the PE Link measure, we find based on the column (6) point estimate

that a company is 42 percent more likely to become a PE target when it has one or more

directors that previously served on the board of a company that has attracted a take-

private offer. Based on the pattern of attenuation in the coefficient on PE Link across

Columns (1)-(6) in the table, it is clear that the ownership structure covariates, general

board characteristics, and industry effects do drive a meaningful amount of covariation

between board interlocks to prior going private transactions and the probability of being

targeted in a PE Tx. However, the PE Link effect remains statistically robust. Thus, if we

view the Interlock Dummy as capturing the effect on PE Tx of generic connectedness to

other firms, we can see that there is an additional effect of specific connectedness to take

private offer-receiving firms on PE Tx, as captured by PE Link. 8



4. Endogeneity Concerns



        Although the PE link is statistically robust, the question remains whether the

effect should be interpreted as causal. We know from the sociology literature (e.g., Kono,

Palmer, Friedland, and Zafonte 1998) that directors are not randomly placed onto boards.

The presence of a PE deal-experienced director may be picking up correlation with

predictors of PE deals not captured in the model. In the absence of a persuasive

instrument for the presence of a PE-experienced director, there are two broad sources of


8
  PE Link is not technically an interaction effect on Interlock Dummy, because construction of the PE Link
variable uses supplemental data from 1995-1999 (as described in text). Thus, it is possible that Interlock
Dummy (which is based only on 2000-07 directorships) =0 while PE Link=1 (if the link is with a prior
transaction in, say, 1997). This, however, is the case in <1% of PE Link=1 observations; for the remaining
observations PE Link=1 implies Interlock Dummy=1. If we do interpret PE Link as an interaction on
Interlock Dummy, we estimate that PE Link, when considered jointly with the Interlock Dummy, actually
then has an effect of increasing the likelihood of offer by ~130% relative to baseline.


                                                    20
endogeneity we most worry about: 1) reverse causation, as board composition is

manipulated by a management team eager to do a PE deal, and 2) director-firm matching

on an omitted characteristic that determines board service and predicts PE Tx.

       First, there is the concern that because most of the recent private equity deals have

been friendly, management is not only a willing participant but an active instigator.

Management retained in the deal often are awarded generous option packages and large

ownership stakes in the newly capitalized firm. Given these incentives, it is plausible that

management plays an active role in shopping the company around to private equity firms,

and likely can wield a great deal of influence in how attractive a target their company

appears to a private equity firm. If a deal-friendly board is one such component, we may

be concerned that the presence of deal-friendly or deal-experienced directors just reflects

the influence of forward-thinking management. We will address this by examining the

role of directors with various levels of tenure on the board, including those whose board

service preceded their PE deal exposure in the interlocked firm.

       Second, there is a concern that directors and firms are matching on underlying

characteristics that are correlated with PE deal activity. Then the fact that a director

previously matched with a firm that received a going private offer and also currently sits

on a company’s board, suggests similarities between the past and current firm that would

make the current firm more likely to receive a PE offer. We will address this concern in a

number of ways. First, we control for what we believe to be the most likely potential

correlates of PE activity, which include industry, geography, governance, and director

attributes. To deal with the possibility that directors and firms are matching on more

generic correlates of PE activity, we also construct a measure of susceptibility of the




                                              21
focal firm to becoming a PE target, using the PE-susceptibility of interlocked firms as a

proxy. Second, we explore the timing of PE Link activation within a firm, by exploiting

the movement of directors across firms and also by using fixed effects. Lastly, we

examine the effect of characteristics specific to the director who is responsible for the PE

linkage—under the null that if the “PE Link” effect is due solely to matching then neither

the influence of the director on the board nor the outcome of the director’s experience in

a previous deal should have predictive power in the regressions.



       Management manipulation. In Table 7 we address the concern of reverse

causation, that PE-experienced directors may be recruited to a firm by management in

anticipation of doing a PE deal. In column (1), we consider only the effect of what we

call “preexisting” directors. These are directors whose board service at the at-risk firm

precedes their PE experience at a second firm in which they are directors or officers, and

which activates the PE Link dummy for the focal firm. Alternately, “migrated” directors

join the at-risk firm only after they acquired their PE experience. Migrated directors may

be candidates who were specifically recruited by management looking to populate a PE-

friendly board, but this would not be the case for preexisting directors whose service on

the focal board began before they obtained PE experience through board membership at a

second company. If the PE Link effect is driven solely by migrated directors, the result

could be interpreted as indicating that pro-PE company insiders attempt to actively build

PE-friendly boards.

       We find that preexisting interlocks still predict the hazard of becoming a target.

However, a shortcoming of this analysis is that we can only locate directors on boards of




                                             22
firms only back to 2000, due to limitations of the Directors Database. For example, if we

know a director experienced a PE deal in Company A in 1997 (from our SDC supplement

of 1995-1999 transactions), but this director appears in Company B in 2000 (from

Directors Database which covers 2000-2007), this director is labeled “migrated” because

we cannot verify that he served on Company B’s board prior to 1997. The result is that

many directors are actually labeled “migrated” who in fact are likely “preexisting”; this

we believe explains the marginal significance of results in column (1).

       Alternately, in columns (2)-(3) we consider only the PE Link effect of directors

who have over 2 or over 3 years of tenure on the board. These directors are not recent

recruits to the board, and hence likely are not specific hires for the purpose of facilitating

a private equity deal. In column (2), for example, for a firm at risk in 2003, we only

consider the effect of PE-experienced directors who have served on the board at least

through 2002 and 2001. Again, because we only have directors data back to 2000, this

regression only makes sense for observations in years ≥ 2002. This results in fewer

observations overall relative to column (1), but here we consider the effect of 4,724

tenured directors relative to the 3,352 preexisting directors in column (1). We find that

interlocks of these tenured directors still predicts the likelihood of receiving a PE offer.

Column (3) examines the effect of directors with 3 or more years of board service; results

are also significant, although more marginal, which we attribute to fewer overall

observations in the sample ( ≥ 2003 only) and fewer observations of such long-tenured

directors.




                                              23
       Director-firm matching. Even if management is not directly responsible for

manipulating director composition in advance of a PE deal, we might be concerned that a

director’s joint participation in a prior PE-involved firm and the current at-risk firm

reflects some underlying similarities between the two firms that make them both more

prone to take private offers. There are a few obvious candidates for omitted attributes that

may determine both board service and private equity activity, such as industry,

geography, firm governance characteristics, or director attributes/characteristics. We will

consider these in turn in Table 8.

       Just as merger activity can occur in industry-specific waves, take-private activity

may have an industry component as well. In addition, board service may reflect industry-

specific expertise. To eliminate the possibility that industry-specific relationships are

driving the interlocks and the likelihood of receiving a take private offer, in column (1)

we consider only the effect of PE Link where the interlocked firm belongs to a different

industry from the focal firm. Such a link cannot reflect matching on industry-specific

characteristics that would be predictive of within-industry private equity activity. But we

find that PE Link here still strongly predicts the probability of becoming a target.

       In column (2), we control for the geographic proximity of the at-risk firm to all

previous take private transactions. Here, the concern is that directors tend to serve on

geographically proximate firms, and that such firms may share similar likelihood of take

private activity (due to industry clustering, regional economic conditions, geographic

focus of PE firms, etc). To address this issue, we compute, for every firm in each year, a

PE geographic proximity variable that captures an “at risk” firm’s proximity to the

volume of all prior PE activity. We define PE Proximity for firm i at time t as




                                             24
         1
∑ 1 + d (i, j ) , where j is a firm that receives a PE offer in t’<t, and d(i, j) is the physical
j ≠i



distance between firms i and j. 9 This measure weights the contribution of each firm j

experiencing a PE offer according to the inverse distance between the location of the PE

target and the focal firm i. Summing these weighted contributions across all firms j

produces a distance-weighted measure of the proximity of all PE activity to each focal

firm i. The highest values of this variable are achieved for firms that are physically

located nearest to the largest volume of prior take-private transactions. In column (2),

however, we find no evidence of geographic clustering in PE targets; special proximity to

past targets does not increase the predicted hazard of becoming a target and PE Link

continues to hold.

         We may also be concerned that board service and take private activity may be

correlated with governance characteristics—i.e. “lazy” directors are drawn to poorly

governed firms, which then make ripe PE targets. We attempt to control for some basic

measures of governance, including whether the CEO also holds the chairman role and the

number of inside directors on the board—both of which reflect a lack of board

independence. 10 However, column (3) shows that CEO-chairman duality does not predict




9
   We calculate distance d(i,j) by locating firms in space according to their latitudes and longitudes. Using
information available from the U.S. Postal Service, we assigned the longitude and latitude coordinates for
the center point of every zip code to each firm lying within that zip code. Over small distances, one might
use Euclid’s formula to compute the distance between two locations; however, the curvature of the earth
seriously affects these calculations over areas as large as the continental United States. Thus, we calculated
the distance between each set of points (A and B) using spherical geometry, using
            d(A,B) = 687.56 * {arccos[sin(lat A) * sin(lat B) + cos(lat A) * cos(lat B) * cos(Δ)]}
where the units for latitude (lat) are radians, and Δ is the absolute value of the difference between the
longitude of A and the longitude of B in radians. The constant, 687.56, converts the distance into units of
five miles.
10
   Ideally we would have a governance measure comparable to the GIM measure; however, this is only
available for S&P1500 firms which are large firms that tend not to be vulnerable as PE targets.


                                                     25
PE deals, and that inside directors have a marginal effect directionally opposite to what

we would predict under a governance hypothesis; PE Link remains robust.

         In columns (4)-(5) we examine whether boards attract directors with a certain type

of expertise, which may also be correlated with PE activity. In column (4) we find that

the presence of financial experts 11 on a board—such as CFOs or VPs of Finance—is

associated with a lower likelihood of a PE offer. One possible explanation for this effect

is that boards with financially savvy directors may be better managed and leave less room

for improvement by a private equity firm. Column (5) shows that the presence of

financial investors 12 —directors who serve as Managing Directors or General Partners of

asset management firms—is associated with a higher likelihood of PE offer. This is

consistent either with such directors steering the companies toward PE deals, or being

invited to PE-leaning firms to share their expertise. We do not claim any causality in

these director attributes; however the PE Link effect remains unaffected even after

controlling for them.

         Beyond these specific characteristics, we may wonder whether there is a general

“PE Susceptibility” factor on which directors match to the boards they serve on—i.e.

whether directors systematically match with companies with certain underlying

susceptibilities to going private deals—which we should be controlling for in our

regression. If there is a shared PE-susceptibility factor among interlocked firms, we

should be able to construct the focal firm’s factor using the interlocked firms’ factors as a

proxy. Thus we construct a measure of a focal firm’s PE-susceptibility by using the

is a firm such that Int itj = 1 and pred Pr( PETx jt = 1) is the predicted probability that the

interlocked firm j receives a PE offer, which are the fitted values from the baseline logit

model excluding PE Link. In column (6) we find that while there is evidence of director

matching to firms with underlying susceptibility to PE deals, the PE Link measure is

robust to this factor.

        Timing of link activation. There are a few additional steps we can take to

address the possibility that the PE Link effect is driven by director-firm matching. First,

we can examine the timing of the “activation” of the PE Link within a firm and exploit

the movement of directors across firms. In Table 9 column (1), we include a dummy

variable Chosen Firm that equals 1 for firm i if firm i at some point in time acquires a

director who has PE experience. If the PE Link effect is due to matching, then conditional

on being a firm that is chosen by a PE-experienced director, the timing of PE Link=1

should not matter. However, we find that the firm-years that specifically have PE Link=1

do strongly predict PE activity, even after controlling for the fact that this firm is a

“Chosen Firm.”

        In column (2) of table 9, we track directors who leave a take private-offer-

receiving-firm pre-offer, to see whether other firms that they proceed to serve on have a

higher likelihood of PE offer. If the PE Link effect is due to matching, then the fact that

these directors once matched to firms that received a PE offer would suggest that the

subsequent firms they match with also have a higher likelihood of PE offer; however,

because they leave the firm prior to PE offer and do not actually experience the PE deal


                                                27
firstand, they cannot be transferring their PE experience to these subsequent firms. We

construct a dummy variable Left Director that equals 1 if a firm-year has a director who

left a firm that later received a PE offer. We find that this variable is not significant in

predicting PE activity, and that PE Link effect is still robust even after controlling for

“Left Director.”

       Finally, to exploit within-firm variation of PE Link activation, we estimate a fixed

effects specification using a linear probability model. Since a fixed effects logit drops all

groups with no within-group variation (~95% of the firm-years in our sample), we opt for

a linear probability model. We find that inclusion of firm fixed effects in column (4)

causes the PE Link estimate to increase (column (3) results without firm effects are

shown as a comparison). This is actually consistent with the findings in columns (1),

which seem to indicate that firms that PE-experienced directors serve on are actually

poorer candidates for PE deals (perhaps because they are higher quality firms in ways

unaccounted for by our observables). Taken together, the evidence suggests that the

specific firm-years in which a PE-experienced director occupies the board has

incremental explanatory power for likelihood of receiving a PE offer.

       Director-specific effects. In Table 10 we consider various characteristics specific

to the director responsible for the interlock to determine whether the magnitude of the PE

Link effect is sensitive to the influence or the experience of the director involved. If the

PE Link effect does sensibly depend on measures of director influence, this would seem

to refute the hypothesis that the results are driven simply by director-firm matching. In

columns (1)-(3), we consider interactions on PE Link where the PE Link director is a

non-executive chairman, dual CEO-chair, and a retired director, respectively. The




                                              28
estimates are too noisy to yield statistical significance; however point estimates would

suggest that an outsider chairman would wield substantial influence in deliberations over

going private transactions whereas an insider chairman would not—this is fully

consistent with standard practice of independent directors forming a special committee to

negotiate transactions while insiders are sidelined. In addition, if the linked director is a

retiree—i.e. no longer holds a position of power on a primary company—this would

suggest that he is less influential on the board as well.

       In column (4) of table 10, we examine whether PE Link has a bigger effect in

companies with less influential directors, as measured by the average centrality of the

directors on board. “Low board centrality” is a dummy variable that =1 for firms whose

directors fall in the lowest quartile of board network connectedness. The positive

interaction effect (PE Link)*(Low board centrality) shows that having a PE-experienced

director on board is especially conducive to PE offers in companies where the general

profile of the board members is relatively low. In such cases, we hypothesize that the

experienced director’s credentials will lead to his having relatively greater influence on

the agenda and outcomes of boardroom deliberations.

       In columns (5)-(8) we explore the nature of the experience the PE Link director

may have been imprinted by in the prior linked deal. In column (5) we consider interlocks

to deals experienced by the PE Link director where the deal was withdrawn and never

completed. In column (6) we consider interlocks to deals where the PE offer was received

poorly by the market—where the announcement day returns of the deal were below the

median of going private deal announcement day returns. Both capture instances where

the director’s prior PE experience may have been a negative or unsuccessful one; and




                                              29
both have substantially negative coefficients that effectively wipe out the PE Link effect.

This suggests that directors who have had prior negative experiences do not then go on to

encourage subsequent firms to be receptive to private equity offers. In column (7) we

consider PE Links by directors who were insiders in management-led buyouts in their

prior PE experience. These directors substantially enhance the PE Link effect; we

attribute this to the fact that their prior experience consists of an active initiation and

management of a prior PE deal, in contrast to experienced directors who may have just

played a sympathetic but supportive role. Lastly, it is interesting to consider PE Link

effects of directors who were MBO insiders on deals that had low announcement day

returns vs high announcement day returns. In contrast to directors who may find a high

stock market reaction to a PE deal desirable (for reasons of fiduciary duty, etc.), an MBO

insider would likely favor a low announcement day return because this means he gets to

acquire the company cheaply. Column (8) shows that while a low announcement day

return negates the effect of PE Link for a non-MBO insider, for an MBO insider the

effect of having experienced a deal with low announcement day return is quite powerful

in predicting the likelihood of PE offer in the current firm. These results are consistent

with the hypothesis that directors carry forward their experiences from other firms, and

use their influence within the board to affect outcomes.



5. Further Analysis

        Lastly we try to address the concern that the results are driven by differences in

firm characteristics of the PE Link=1 vs PE Link=0 samples. For instance, firms that

have PE Links tend to be bigger and have larger boards, since such characteristics makes




                                               30
interlocking relationships with other companies more likely. However, we know from our

baseline regressions that such characteristics are also correlated with the likelihood of

becoming a PE target. If our baseline specification inadequately controls for such

characteristics, then we might then be concerned that it is the differences in the

distribution of such covariates between the PE Link=1 vs PE Link=0 samples that might

be driving the results, and not the effect of the PE Link variable itself. 13 Ideally we would

have two comparison samples that are comparable for all covariates but differ only one

dimension, for PE Link.

        If we think of our PE Link variable as a treatment indicator, we can apply

propensity score-based methods developed in the program evaluation literature to achieve

covariate balance in the treatment and control samples (Rosenbaum and Rubin 1983;

Hirano, Imbens and Ridder 2003). The propensity score, p(X), is defined as the

probability of receiving treatment conditional on the covariates X, and is typically

estimated as a logit of the treatment indicator on X. In Inverse Probability of Treatment

Weighting (IPTW), treated and control observations are weighted by 1/p(X) and 1/(1-

p(X)), respectively, in the regression of interest. Intuitively, observations with

characteristics that result in high likelihood of treatment, p(X), are down-weighted in the

treatment group; similarly, observations with a low likelihood of treatment are down-

weighted in the control group. This procedure evens out differences in the covariates

between the control and treatment groups. Imbens-Wooldridge (2007) also suggest

trimming observations with p(X) outside of the interval [0.1, 0.9] to eliminate poor

candidates for matching across the control and treatment samples. The regression on the

  Although, bigger firms with bigger boards are less likely to become PE targets given our baseline
estimates—so that it would likely not be these particular covariates that we would be concerned are driving
the PE Link effect.


                                                    31
weighted, trimmed sample then produces estimates of treatment effects independent of

distributional differences in the initial control and treatment groups.

       Table 11 Panel A shows the differences in covariates between the PE Link=1 and

PE Link=0 samples. Panel A1 shows substantial differences in means for all covariates in

the initial sample. Panel A2 shows that after inverse-weighting and trimming, none of the

differences are significant at conventional levels. Panel B column (2) then shows the

regression results on this balanced sample; the results remain unchanged from our initial

baseline specification. Despite substantial differences in the characteristics of firms that

have versus lack PE-experienced directors, the IPTW method allows us to ascertain that

those differences do not account for the PE Link effect.



6. Conclusion

       We have considered many alternative stories that might explain the relationship

between having a director on board who has had take-private transaction experience and

the likelihood of becoming a PE target. However, we find that the PE Link effect is quite

robust. In addition, we find that the strength of this effect seems to vary with

characteristics specific to the director responsible to the link, which is supportive of our

causal interpretation of this PE Link effect.

       The evidence we have presented suggests that boards do play an important role in

private equity deal generation, particularly in the more recent deals characterized by

friendly relations between offerers and targets. To the extent that directors are imprinted

by experiences at other firms and have the power to influence their colleagues on the

board, the board interlock network in which a firm is embedded will be relevant in the




                                                32
conversion of a potential target to an actual target. More generally, social networks are

important feature of many financial transactions involving individual agents to entire

firms.

Data on going private transactions for firms trading on the NYSE, American, and Nasdaq stock exchanges, publicly announced between
January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2007. "PE" deals are transactions in which a private equity firm led the acquiring party or was identified as
providing financing. "MBOs" are deals identified as management-led with no private equity involvement. "Other" includes offers made by other
financial buyers (i.e. Carl Icahn, powerful families such as the Pritzkers of Chicago, etc.)

Table 4. PE Link, by firm-year

Based on board composition data in 2000-2007 and our sample of going private transactions, we determine whether a company has an
interlock with a firm that has in the past received a going private offer--i.e.. whether the company currently has a director serving on the
board who previously served as a director or executive of another firm in the year that it received a going private offer. Panel A shows the
number of interlocks for all the firm-years in the sample; Panel B shows the interlocks for the subset of firm-years in which PE offers are
received.

 Table 8. PE Link effect, controlling for potential correlates of private equity activity

 Table shows results of logit regressions where the independent variable =1 if a firm receives a private-equity backed going private
 offer. Observations are at the firm-year, and include public firms in 2000-2007. Regression (1) captures the effect of PE Link where
 the interlocks consist of companies in different Fama-French 48 industries. (2) controls for the geographic proximity of previous
 private-equity-backed take private activity, by weighting each previous take private deal by its distance from the firm at risk. (3)
 controls for basic measures of corporate governance such as the whether the CEO is also the Chairman and the # of insiders on
 the board. (4)-(5) control for director attributes related to board composition, such as the # of finance experts and financial
 investors, respectively. (6) controls for a generic "PE Susceptibility" measure of the at-risk firm, constructed as the average

 Table 9. Timing of PE Link activation

 Table shows results of regressions where the independent variable =1 if a firm receives a private-equity

 Regression (1), Chosen firm =1 for firm i if firm i at some point in time acquires a PE-experienced director (i.e.
 has PE Link=1 for some t ). In (2), Left director=1 if a firm i in year t has a director on board who left a firm pre-
 offer (i.e. left a firm that would later receive a PE offer but did not stay to experience the offer). Regressions (3)-
 (4) present OLS results, without and with firm fixed effects. Standard errors are Huber-White heteroskedasticity-

 Observations are at the firm-year, and include public firms in 2000-2007. Regressions (1)-(3) characterize the director who is responsible
 for PE Link=1. Non-executive Chmn=1 if the PE Link is via a director who is the board chairman but is not a firm employee; Dual CEO-
 Chm=1 if the PE Link is via a director who holds both the CEO and chairman titles in the firm; Retiree=1 if the PE Link is via a director
 who is retired from his primary job. In (4) Low board centrality=1 for firms whose directors fall in the lowest quartile of Average board
 centrality. Regressions (5)-(8) characterize the deals experienced by the PE Link director. Withdrawn offer=1 if the interlock is with a firm
 whose PE offer was withdrawn; Low annc day return=1 if the interlock is with a firm whose market return on the deal announcement day
 was below the median of PE deal announcement day returns; MBO insider=1 if the director was involved as an insider in an MBO in the
 prior linked deal. Standard errors are Huber-White heteroskedasticity-consistent, and are clustered at the firm level. * significant at 10%;
