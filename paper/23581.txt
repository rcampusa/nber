                                          ABSTRACT

In this paper we study the role of the transportation sector in world trade. We build a spatial
model that centers on the interaction of the market for (oceanic) transportation services and the
market for world trade in goods. The model delivers equilibrium trade flows, as well as
equilibrium trade costs (shipping prices). Using detailed data on vessel movements and shipping
prices, we document novel facts about shipping patterns; we then flexibly estimate our model.
We use this setup to demonstrate that the transportation sector (i) implies that net exporters
(importers) face higher (lower) trade costs leading to misallocation of productive activities across
countries; (ii) creates network effects in trade costs; and (iii) dampens the impact of shocks on
trade flows. These three mechanisms reveal a new role for geography in international trade that
was previously concealed by the common assumption of exogenous trade costs. Finally, we
illustrate how our setup can be used for policy analysis by evaluating the impact of future and
existing infrastructure projects (e.g. Northwest Passage, Panama Canal).

1 Introduction
Whether by sea, land or air, the entirety of trade in goods is carried out by the transportation sector.


With world trade at full steam- the sum of world exports and imports is now more than 50% of the global


value of production- the transportation sector has become central in everyday life. Yet, little is known


about how the market for transportation services interacts with the market for world trade in goods.


       In this paper, we study how this interaction shapes trade ows, trade costs, the propagation of shocks


and the allocation of productive activities across countries. As we demonstrate, the transportation sector


(i) implies that net exporters (importers) face higher (lower) trade costs leading to misallocation of pro-


ductive activities across countries; (ii) creates network eects in trade costs; and (iii) dampens the impact


of shocks on trade ows. These three mechanisms reveal a new role for geography in international trade


that was previously shrouded by the common assumption of exogenous trade costs.


       The transportation sector includes several dierent segments which can be split into two categories:


those that operate on xed itineraries, much like buses, and those that operate on exible routes, much


like taxis. Containerships, airplanes and trains primarily belong to the rst group, while trucks, gas and


oil tankers, and dry bulk ships to the second. Here we focus on oceanic shipping and in particular, dry


bulk shipping; 80% of world trade volume is carried by ships and dry bulkers carry about half of that.
                                                                                                                     1


Dry bulk ships are the main mode of transportation for commodities, such as grain, ore, and coal. They


are often termed the taxis of the oceans, as an exporter has to nd an available vessel and hire it for


a specic voyage, with prices set in the spot market. Despite the operational dierences of the various


transport modes, we argue that the core economic mechanisms hold for most, if not all of them.


       We leverage detailed micro-data on vessel movements, as well as rich data on contracts between ex-


porters and shipowners to uncover some novel facts. First, satellite data of ships' movements reveal that


most countries are either large net importers or large net exporters and that, related to this, at any point


in time a staggering 42% of ships are traveling without cargo (termed ballast). This natural trade im-


balance is a key driver of trade costs. Indeed, transportation prices are largely asymmetric and depend on


the destination's trade imbalance: all else equal, the prospect of having to ballast after ooading leads


to higher prices. For instance, shipping from Australia to China is 30% more expensive than the reverse:


as China mostly imports raw materials, ships arriving there have limited opportunities to reload. This


phenomenon is pervasive in most, if not all modes of transportation: trucks, trains, container air and

value.




                                                            2
ocean shipping, all exhibit similar price asymmetries that correlate with trade imbalances (the direction


of the imbalance, however, may be the opposite). In fact, the US-China trade decit in manufacturing


has incentivized US exports of low value cargo, such as scrap or hay, to ll up the empty backhauls.
                                                                                                                       2


       Second, we compute the elasticity of trade with respect to shipping costs, by regressing trade by


country pair on the corresponding shipping price. To do so, we employ a novel instrument inspired by


the insight that the shipping price exporters face depends on how attractive their destination is to the


ship in terms of future loading opportunities, as discussed above. The estimated trade elasticity indicates


that the transport sector has a substantial impact on world trade, especially given the large uctuations


in shipping prices.


       Third, a number of features of dry bulk shipping, such as information frictions and port infrastructure,


can hinder the matching of ships and exporters.              We propose a novel test to argue that these frictions


lead to unrealized potential trade.          The test is based on weather shocks at sea that exogenously shift


ship arrivals at port: in a frictionless world, in regions with more ships than exporters, the change in


the number of ships does not aect matches, since the short side of the market is always matched. Here,


instead, matches are indeed aected by weather shocks. In addition, the law of one price does not hold:


shipping prices exhibit substantial dispersion within a time-origin-destination triplet, also consistent with


frictions. Finally, at any given time, in most countries there are simultaneous arrivals of empty ships that


load and departures of empty ships, even though ships are homogeneous. This also suggests wastefulness.


       Inspired by these facts, we build a spatial model that centers on the interaction of the market for


transport and the market for world trade in goods, that is in the spirit of the search and matching


literature.     The globe is split into a number of regions that trade with each other.                  Geography enters


the model both through regions' location in space, as well as their natural inheritance in commodities of


dierent value. In each region, available ships and exporters participate in a random matching process.


When matched with an exporter, ships transport the exporter's cargo to its destination for a negotiated


price, and restart there. Ships that do not get matched decide whether to wait at their current location

   2
       In 2005, about 60% of the containers sent via ships from Asia to North America came back empty (Drewry Consultants),
and those that did come back full were often transported at a steep discount for lack of demand (...) Shippers are so eager
to ll their vessels for the return voyage to East Asia that they accept many types of unprotable cargo, like bales of hay.
Similarly, airlines had become so eager to put something in their cargo holds on the inbound journey to China that rates go
as low as 30 to 40 cents a kilogram, compared with $3 to $3.50 a kilogram leaving China [...] Very bluntly speaking, they're
ying in empty and ying out full. (The International Herald Tribune, 01/30/2006)
  In trucking,  [b]ackhaul practices are extremely important in explaining dierences in prices; i.e.   the truck companies
are compensating their expenses on the empty backhaul in the rst leg of the trip. (The World Bank, 2012). Even Uhaul
moving trucks are priced similarly, Rent a moving truck from Las Vegas to San Jose and you'll pay about $100.        In the
opposite direction, the same truck will cost you 16 times that. (...) What accounts for the dierence? (...) With so many
people leaving the Bay Area, there are not enough rental trucks to go around. (SFgate, 02/15/2018).




                                                              3
or ballast elsewhere to search there. Exporters that get matched have their cargo delivered and collect


its revenue, while exporters that do not get matched wait at port. Finally, a large number of potential


exporters decide whether and where to export, thus replenishing the exporter pool seeking transportation.


       We derive the equilibrium trade costs (shipping prices), as well as an expression for the equilibrium


bilateral trade ows, that is reminiscent of a gravity equation. As ships are forward-looking, trade costs


depend on the attractiveness of both the origin and the destination, a rich object that captures a region's


location, freight values, matching probabilities, as well as its neighbors' attractiveness. This insight applies


beyond dry bulk. Although other transport modes require dierent modeling assumptions regarding their


operational practices, in equilibrium, prices are formed by the optimizing behavior of forward-looking


transport agents and unavoidably depend, as above, on the attractiveness of origins and destinations, as


well as that of their neighbors.
                                       3


       Next, we estimate the model using the collected data. We rst estimate the matching function, which


gives the number of matches as a function of the number of agents searching on each side of the market.


A sizable literature has estimated matching functions in dierent contexts (e.g. labor markets, taxicabs).
                                                                                                                              4


Here, we adopt a novel approach to exibly recover both the matching function, as well as searching


exporters, which, unlike ships and matches, are not observed.                  Our approach draws from the literature


on nonparametric identication (Matzkin, 2003) and, to our knowledge, we are the rst to apply it to


matching function estimation. Our approach extends the literature in two dimensions. First, we do not


take a stance on the presence of search frictions. When one side of the market (in this case exporters)


is unobserved or mismeasured, it is dicult to discern whether search frictions are present. Second, we


avoid parametric restrictions on the matching function; this is important, since in frictional markets, the


shape of the underlying matching function is directly linked to welfare.


       We then estimate the remaining primitives including ship costs, the values of exporters' cargo and


exporter entry costs. In particular, we recover ship sailing and port costs from the optimal ballast choice


probabilities, via Maximum Likelihood, following the dynamic discrete choice literature (Rust, 1987).


Then, we obtain exporter valuations directly from observed prices. Finally, we use trade ows to recover


exporter costs by destination.

   3
       For instance, a model for container shipping (or other modes operating on xed itineraries), would likely feature a small
number of shipping rms that decide on their itineraries, as well as route pricing. The itinerary decision involves similar
trade-os as the ballast choice here; e.g. what network of countries can be serviced or how to manage backhaul trips. Prices
similarly depend on the number and valuations of exporters, ship supply and crucially, the entire route serviced including
the backhaul trips.
   4
       For instance, in labor markets, data on unemployed workers, vacancies and matches delivers the underlying matching
function. In the market for taxi rides, one observes taxis and their rides, but not hailing passengers; in recent work, Buchholz
(2018) and Frechette et al. (2018) have used a parametric assumption on the matching function, to recover the passengers.




                                                                4
   Why is it important to account for the transport sector to study international trade in goods? We


illustrate the role of endogenous trade costs through three experiments.


   First, we compare our setup to one with iceberg trade costs that are exogenous and depend only


on distance and the cargo's value, as is the case in canonical trade models. Strikingly, we nd that the


transport sector acts as a smoothing factor that reduces world trade imbalances. Indeed, under endogenous


trade costs net exporters (importers) export less (more) than under exogenous trade costs, leading to a


misallocation of productive activities from (ecient) net exporters to (inecient) net importers.          This


happens because of ships' equilibrium behavior and in particular the strength of their bargaining position


at dierent regions. Net exporters oer loading opportunities to ships, thus allowing them to command


high prices, which in turn restrains their exports. The converse holds for net importers. This argument


extends to a country's neighbors: a net exporter close to other net exporters oers even more options to


ships and prices are even higher, which inhibits the neighborhood's exports.


   Second, we illustrate that the transport sector dampens the impact of shocks on trade ows, by


considering a fuel cost shock. A decline in the fuel cost has a direct and an indirect eect. The direct


eect is straightforward: as costs fall, shipping prices also fall and thus exports rise. The novel indirect


eect is that a decline in fuel costs improves a ship's bargaining position, as it makes ballasting less costly.


This dampens the original decline in prices and increase in exporting. Indeed, the overall increase in world


trade would be   40%   higher if ships were not allowed to optimally adjust their behavior, in response to a


10% decline in fuel costs.


   Third, we explore the spatial propagation of a macro shock: a slow-down in China. Besides the direct


eect to countries whose exports rely heavily on the Chinese economy, the optimal reallocation of ships


over space dierentially lters the shock in neighboring vs. distant regions. Because of the slow-down,


fewer ships ooad in China, reducing ship supply in the region. Although this impacts negatively China's


own exports by raising prices, it benets distant countries, such as Brazil, because ships reallocate there.


   Finally, we consider the role of maritime infrastructure on world trade, as an illustration of how our


setup can be used for policy evaluation. To do so, we examine the opening of the Northwest Passage: the


melting of the arctic ice would reduce the travel distance between Northeast America/Northern Europe


and the Far East. Although the shock is local, it has global eects: as Northeast America becomes a more


attractive ballasting choice, ships have a stronger bargaining position and demand higher prices, pushing


exports down everywhere else. Moreover, we consider the impact of four natural and man-made passages:


the Panama Canal, the Suez Canal, Gibraltar and the Malacca Straits and show that all passages tend to




                                                       5
substantially increase world trade.




   Related Literature       We relate to three broad strands of literature: (i) trade and geography; (ii)


search and matching; (iii) industry dynamics.


   First, our paper endogenizes trade costs and so it naturally relates to the large literature in international


trade studying the importance of trade costs in explaining trade ows between countries (e.g. Anderson


and Van Wincoop, 2003, Eaton and Kortum, 2002).           In much of the literature, trade costs are treated


as exogenous and follow the iceberg formulation of Samuelson (1954). Here, we consider what happens


to trade ows when the equilibrium of the transport market is taken into account, so that transport


prices (an important component of trade costs, at least as large or larger than taris; Hummels, 2007) are


determined in equilibrium, jointly with trade ows. Moreover, related to some of our empirical ndings,


Waugh (2010) has argued that asymmetric trade costs are necessary to explain some empirical regularities


regarding trade ows across rich and poor countries.


   We also contribute to a literature that has considered the role and features of the (container) shipping


industry; e.g. Hummels and Skiba (2004) explore the relationship between product prices at dierent des-


tinations and shipping costs; Hummels et al. (2009) explore market power in container shipping; Ishikawa


and Tarui (2015) theoretically investigate the impact of backhaul and its interaction with industrial


policy; Cosar and Demir (2018) and Holmes and Singer (2018) study container usage; Asturias (2018)


explores the impact of the number of shipping rms on transport prices and trade; Wong (2018) incorpo-


rates container shipping prices featuring a round-trip eect in a trade model. Finally, recent work has


explored the matching of importers and exporters under frictions (Eaton et al., 2016, and Krolikowski and


McCallum, 2018).


   Our paper is also related to both old and new work on the role of geography in international trade (e.g.


Krugman, 1991, Head and Mayer, 2004, Allen and Arkolakis, 2014), as well as the impact of transportation


infrastructure and networks (e.g. Donaldson, 2012, Allen and Arkolakis, 2016, Donaldson and Hornbeck,


2016, Fajgelbaum and Schaal, 2017). We extend this literature by demonstrating that the transport sector


reveals a new role for geography through three novel mechanisms (it misallocates productive activities,


creates network eects and dampens the impact of shocks).


   Second, our paper relates to the search and matching literature (see Rogerson et al., 2005 for a survey).


Our model is a search model in the spirit of the seminal work of Mortensen and Pissarides (1994), where


rms and workers (randomly) meet subject to search frictions and Nash bargain over a wage. An important




                                                      6
addition in our case is the spatial nature of our setup: there are several interconnected markets at which


agents (ships) can search. Such a spatial search model was rst proposed by Lagos (2000) (and analyzed


empirically in Lagos, 2003) in the context of taxi cabs. We borrow heavily from his model; the key dierence


is that prices are set in equilibrium, while in the taxi market prices are exogenously set by regulation.


This is crucial, as the role of endogenous trade costs is at the core of our paper.
                                                                                                     5 Finally, as discussed


above, our paper also contributes to the literature on matching function estimation (see Petrongolo and


Pissarides (2001) for a survey).


       Third, we relate to the literature on industry dynamics (e.g. Hopenhayn, 1992, Ericson and Pakes,


1995). Consistent with this research agenda, we study the long-run industry equilibrium properties, in our


case the spatial distribution of ships and exporters. Moreover, our empirical methodology borrows from


the literature on the estimation of dynamic setups (e.g. Rust, 1987, Bajari et al., 2007, Pakes et al., 2007;


applications include Ryan, 2012 and Collard-Wexler, 2013). Buchholz (2018) and Frechette et al. (2018)


also explore dynamic decisions in the context of taxi cabs' search and shift choices respectively. Finally,


Kalouptsidi (2014) has also looked at the shipping industry, albeit at the entry decisions of shipowners


and the resulting investment cycles in new ships, while Kalouptsidi (2018) focuses on industrial policy in


the Chinese shipbuilding industry.


       The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a description of the industry and


the data used.       Section 3 presents the facts.         Section 4 describes the model.            Section 5 lays out our


empirical strategy, while Section 6 presents the estimation results. Section 7 demonstrates the importance


of endogenous trade costs, while Section 8 assesses the role of maritime infrastructure projects. Section


9 concludes. The Appendix contains additional tables and gures, proofs to our propositions, as well as


further data and estimation details.




2 Industry and Data Description
2.1       Dry Bulk Shipping


Dry bulk shipping involves vessels designed to carry a homogeneous unpacked dry cargo, for individual


shippers on non-scheduled routes. Bulk carriers operate much like taxi cabs: a specic cargo is transported

   5
       There are several other dierences between our setup and that of Lagos (2000) and Lagos (2003): we model also the
demand side (exporters/passengers); we allow for the potential of frictions in each region, while Lagos (2000) assumes that
matching is frictionless locally; we allow for several sources of heterogeneity in dierent regions (travel/port costs, distances,
matching rates); we allow trade to be imbalanced, while Lagos (2000) relies on taxi ows in and out of each location to be
equal- this distinction is also crucial.




                                                                7
individually by a specic ship, for a trip between a single origin and a single destination. Dry bulk shipping


involves mostly commodities, such as iron ore, steel, coal, bauxite, phosphates, but also grain, sugar,


chemicals, lumber and wood chips; it accounts for about half of total seaborne trade in tons (UNCTAD)


and 45% of the total world eet, which includes also containerships and oil tankers.
                                                                                                    6,7


       There are four categories of dry bulk carriers based on size: Handysize (10,00040,000 DWT), Handy-


max (40,00060,000 DWT), Panamax (60,000100,000 DWT) and Capesize (larger than 100,000 DWT).


The industry is unconcentrated, consisting of a large number of small shipowning rms (Kalouptsidi,


2014): the maximum eet share is around 4%, while the rm size distribution features a large tail of


small shipowners. Moreover, shipping services are largely perceived as homogeneous. In his lifetime, a


shipowner will contract with hundreds of dierent exporters, carry a multitude of dierent products and


visit numerous countries; we discuss this further in Section 3.3.


       Trips are realized through individual contracts: shipowners have vessels for hire, exporters have cargo


to transport and brokers put the deal together. Ships carry at most one freight at a time: the exporter


lls up the hired ship with his cargo.           In this paper, we focus on spot contracts and in particular the


so-called trip-charters, in which the shipowner is paid in a per day rate.
                                                                                          8 The exporter who hires the


ship is responsible for the trip costs (e.g. fueling), while the shipowner incurs the remaining ship costs


(e.g. crew, maintenance, repairs).




2.2       Data


We combine a number of dierent datasets. First, we employ a dataset of dry bulk shipping contracts,


from 2010 to 2016, collected by Clarksons Research. An observation is a transaction between a shipowner


and a charterer for a specic trip.          We observe the vessel, the charterer, the contract signing date, the


loading and unloading dates, the price in dollars per day, as well as some information on the origin and


destination.


       Second, we use satellite AIS (Automatic Identication System) data from exactEarth Ltd (henceforth


EE) for the ships in the Clarksons dataset between July 2010 and March 2016. AIS transceivers on the


ships automatically broadcast information, such as their position (longitude and latitude), speed, and level

   6
       As already mentioned, bulk ships are dierent from containerships, which carry cargo (mostly manufactured goods) from
many dierent cargo owners in container boxes, along xed itineraries according to a timetable.      It is not technologically
possible to substitute bulk with container shipping.
   7
       It is not straightforward to obtain information on the share of world trade value carried by bulkers. However, mining,
agricultural products, chemicals and iron/steel jointly account for about 30% of total trade value (WTO, 2015).

       Trip-charters are the most common type of contract.      Long-term contracts (time-charters), however, do exist:   on
average, about 10% of contracts signed are long-term. Interestingly, though, ships in long-term contracts, are often relet
in a series of spot contracts, suggesting that arbitrage is possible.

of draft (the vertical distance between the waterline and the bottom of the ship's hull), at regular intervals


of at most six minutes. The draft is a crucial variable, as it allows us to determine whether a ship is loaded


or not at any point in time.


       We also use the ERA-Interim archive, from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts


(CMWF), to collect global data on daily sea weather. This allows us to construct weekly data on the wind


speed (in each direction) on a         0.75Â°   grid across all oceans. Finally, we employ several time series from


Clarksons on e.g. the total eet and fuel prices, as well as country-level imports/exports, production and


commodity prices from other sources (e.g. Comtrade, IEA).

Table 1:     Summary statistics. The contract price per day is reported by Clarksons. To create the price per trip, we
multiply price per day with the average number of days required to perform the trip. Contracts per ship counts the
number of contracts observed for each ship in the Clarksons dataset. To proxy for trip duration, we compute the
nautical distance in miles and divide it by the average speed observed in the EE data. The probability of staying
at port is calculated from the EE data by computing the frequency at which waiting ships that did not nd a
contract in a given week remain at port instead of ballasting elsewhere. We have 12,007 observations of shipping
contracts and 393,058 ship-week observations at which the ship decides to either ballast someplace or stay at its
current location.




       Summary statistics          Our nal dataset involves 5,398 ships, which corresponds to about half the


world eet, between 2012 and 2016.
                                            9 We end up with 12,007 shipping contracts, for which we know the

As shown in Table 1, the average price is 14,000 dollars per day (or 290,000 dollars for the entire trip),


with substantial variation.         Trips last on average 2.9 weeks.        Contracts are signed close to the loading


date, on average six days before. The most popular loaded trips are from Australia, Brazil and Northwest


America to China, while the most popular ballast trip is from China to Australia (5.7% of ballast trips).

77%, while the remaining ships ballast elsewhere. Finally, Clarksons reports the product carried in about


20% of the sample. The main commodity categories are grain (29%), ores (21%), coal (25%), steel (8%)


and chemicals/fertilizers (6%).




3 Facts
In this section, we present some novel facts about the transport sector and trade: we rst discuss the


implications of trade imbalances (section 3.1); then, we quantify the impact of transport costs on world


trade (section 3.2); nally, we provide evidence of frictions (section 3.3). Throughout the paper, we most


often split ports into 15 geographical regions, depicted in Figure 10 in Appendix B.
                                                                                                     11



3.1       Trade Imbalances


World trade in commodities is greatly imbalanced. Indeed, most countries are either large net importers


or large net exporters. This is shown in Figure 1, which plots the dierence between the number of ships


departing loaded and the number of ships arriving loaded, over the sum of the two. Australia, Brazil and


Northwest America are big net exporters, whereas China and India are big net importers.


       The fact that global trade features such large imbalances is not as surprising; to a large extent, this


is due to the dierent natural inheritance of countries.               For instance, Australia, Brazil and Northwest


America are rich in minerals, grain, coal, etc.            At the same time, growing developing countries require


imports of raw materials to achieve industrial expansion and infrastructure building.                      For instance, in


recent years, Chinese growth has relied on massive imports of raw materials. As a result, commodities


ow out of producers such as Australia and Brazil, towards China and India.


       As a consequence of the imbalanced nature of international trade, ships spend much of their time


traveling ballast, i.e. without cargo. Indeed, we nd that 42% of a ship's traveled miles are ballast, so that


a ship is traveling empty close to half the time.
                                                          12 Finally, the trade imbalance is a key driver of the trade


costs that exporters face. First, a quick inspection of the data reveals that there are large asymmetries in


trade costs across space: for instance, a trip from China to Australia costs on average 7,500 dollars per

  11
       The trade-o is that we need a large number of observations per region, while allowing for sucient geographical detail.
To determine the regions, we employ a clustering algorithm that minimizes the within-region distance between ports. The
regions are: West Coast of North America, East Coast of North America, Central America, West Coast of South America,
East Coast of South America, West Africa, Mediterranean, North Europe, South Africa, Middle East, India, Southeast Asia,
China, Australia, Japan-Korea. We ignore intra-regional trips and entirely drop these observations.

       This percentage is lower for smaller ships it is 32% for Handysize, 41% for Handymax, 45% for Panamax and 49% for
Capesize.

with the attractiveness of the destination, such as its demand for shipping. Indeed, ships may demand a


premium to travel towards a destination with low exports (e.g. China), to compensate for the diculty of


nding a new cargo originating from that destination. As shown in Column III of Table 2, shipping to a


destination where the probability of a ballast trip afterwards is ten percentage points higher, costs 2.3%


more on average. Similarly, a 10% increase in the average distance traveled ballast after the destination,


is associated with a 1.7% increase in prices.




3.2       Trade Elasticity


Do shipping prices have an impact on world trade? In this section we address this question in the context


of bulk shipping. Ideally, we would like to regress bilateral trade ows on shipping prices, i.e.,




                                                    log Qiâj
                                                         t   = Î²0 + Î²1 log Ïtiâj + ijt
  13
       This price asymmetry has been documented also in container shipping; see e.g. Wong (2018) and references therein.

dent variables include combinations of: the average frequency of ballast traveling after the contract's destination
(Probability of ballast), the average logged duration (in days) of the ballast trip after the contract's destination, as
well as ship type, origin, destination and quarter FEs. The product is reported in only 20% of the sample, so the
regression in column III has substantially fewer observations. The omitted product category is cement.

where          Qiâj
                t     is the total trade value from country              i    to country        j     (in bulk commodities) at time period


(month)         t   and   Ïtiâj   is the shipping price from   i    to       j   at   t.   Naturally, this regression is going to lead to


biased estimates, as prices are likely correlated with the error,                            ijt .   Thus, an instrument is required.


         The instrument we leverage is inspired by the insight that, as discussed above, the attractiveness of


an exporter's destination impacts the shipping price it faces. Consider the trade ow from                                                 i   to    j , Qiâj
                                                                                                                                                          t   ;


the instrument we use for the shipping price                Ïtiâj      consists of the taris levied on commodity exports                                  from
the destination           j.   For example, the price to ship goods from Indonesia to China is instrumented using the


taris on raw materials on routes starting from China. These taris do not directly aect the ows from


Indonesia to China. However, they aect the value of a ship unloading in China. Indeed, taris on                                                            j 's

exports lead to a reduction in shipments from                j , thus dampening the demand for shipping services in j                                       and


making          j   a less attractive destination for ships. Therefore, when negotiating a price to ship goods from


i   to    j,   a ship demands a higher price in order to compensate for its reduced opportunities upon arrival


at   j .14     Similarly, we also use the taris levied on commodities imported at the exporter's origin,                                             i,   as an


instrument for the price              Ïtiâj .   These taris reduce          i's     imports, leading to lower ship supply in origin                           i,

and, thus, higher shipping prices to export from                   i    to   j.

         Table 3 presents both stages of the two-stage least squares. Both the rst and second stage regressions


are run in dierences to control for any xed, route-specic characteristics; we also control for GDP, taris


on the route considered, as well as taris on all goods other than commodities (all in dierences). The


rst stage regresses per-day shipping prices from                   i   to       j   both on the taris levied on exports from                        j    to its

rst and second biggest trading partners (tari                                  and tari             ), as well as on taris on              i's   imports

                                                                                       (1)âi                        (2)âi 15
from its rst and second biggest trading partners (tari                                       and tari                 ).       The instruments are


jointly signicant at the 1% level, and the signs are as expected: higher taris tend to increase shipping


prices. The rst stage results are interesting per se, as they showcase that shipping prices between any


two countries are aected by shipping conditions on other routes, creating inter-dependencies and network


eects in trade costs; this mechanism, which is formalized in our model and is central to the paper, is


quantitatively important.


         The second stage of the IV regression produces a trade elasticity of 1.02 with respect to shipping prices.

    14
         This instrument is valid as it should not impact directly       Qiâj
                                                                          t   .        Recall that here we focus only on raw materials, hence
the supply chain should not be a concern (e.g. the instrument would be problematic if                               j   imports steel and exports cars and
we considered taris on cars). Moreover, we control directly for the taris from                       i   to   j   and the overall level of taris on all
goods other than commodities.
    15
         We obtain yearly country-level trade ows from Comtrade and taris from the World Bank (WITS) and we focus only on
bulk commodities; yearly average shipping prices come from our Clarksons dataset. The results are robust if we add country
xed eects, or if we use the weighted average of taris instead.




                                                                         13
In other words, a 1% increase in shipping prices leads to a 1.02% decline in trade ows. This elasticity


indicates that the transport sector has a substantial impact on world trade, especially given the large


observed uctuations in shipping prices (for instance, shipping prices experienced an 8-fold increase in the


late 2000s, see Kalouptsidi, 2014).


       A few recent papers have estimated the same elasticity for the case of container shipping. Asturias


(2018), who uses population as an instrument, nds the elasticity to be about 5. Wong (2018), who uses


the round-trip eect as an instrument (in particular, for route                 i, j   she uses a Bartik-style instrument to


proxy for the predicted trade volume on route             j, i) nds an elasticity of about 3.     It is also worth comparing


the elasticity of trade with respect to shipping prices to that with respect to taris, which is estimated to


be between 1.5 and 5 on average (e.g. Simonovska and Waugh, 2014, Caliendo and Parro, 2015, Brandt


et al., 2017 and Arkolakis et al., 2018).            The two elasticities are comparable, with our estimate overall


somewhat lower.          Recall, however, that we use total rather than waterborne trade value; therefore our


estimate should be considered a lower bound of the trade elasticity with respect to shipping prices, as it


ignores substitution towards other modes of transportation.
                                                                           16



3.3       Search Frictions


A number of features of dry bulk shipping, such as information frictions and port infrastructure, can hinder


the matching of ships and exporters. In this section we argue that these frictions indeed lead to unrealized


potential trade. Consider a geographical region, such as a country or a set of neighboring countries, where


there are     s   ships available to pick up cargo and       e   exporters searching for a ship to transport their cargo.


We dene search frictions by the inequality:




                                                         m < min {s, e}                                                        (1)




where     m   is the number of matched ships and exporters. In other words, under frictions there is potential


trade that remains unrealized; in contrast, in a frictionless world, the entire short side of the market gets


matched, so that        m = min {s, e}.      When (1) holds, matches are often modeled via a matching function,


m = m(s, e),       as is done extensively in the labor literature. As Petrongolo and Pissarides (2001) note,  [...]


the matching function [...] enables the modeling of frictions [...] with a minimum of added complexity.


Frictions derive from information imperfections about potential trading partners, heterogeneities, the

  16
       For instance, if we exclude EU countries, which can easily substitute from oceanic shipping to land shipping, the elasticity
increases to -3.

Table 3:   Elasticity of trade with respect to shipping prices. Data on yearly bilateral country-level trade value and
taris are obtained from the World Bank (WITS) for the period 2010-2016. We focus on trade and taris for bulk
commodities. To construct taris, we consider the minimum between the most favored nation tari and preferential
rates, if applicable, and consider a weighted average across commodities. Shipping prices are calculated from the
per-day prices in Clarksons contracts, averaged at the year and country-pair level. We group countries in EU-27
and exclude countries without no access to sea.

absence of perfect insurance markets, slow mobility, congestion from large numbers, and other similar


factors.


       We present three facts consistent with frictions, as dened by (1). These facts are inspired by labor


markets, where search frictions are generally thought to be present. In particular, we (i) provide a direct


test for inequality (1); (ii) we document wastefulness in ship loadings; (iii) we document substantial price


dispersion.


       First, we provide a simple     test for search frictions.       If we observed all variables     s, e, m,    it would be


straightforward to test (1); this is essentially what is done in the labor literature, where the co-existence


of unemployed workers and vacant rms is interpreted as evidence of frictions. However in our setup, as


discussed at length in Section 5.1, we observe          m   (i.e. ships leaving loaded) and    s,   but not   e;   we thus need


to adopt a dierent approach.


       Assume it is known that there are more ships than exporters, i.e.             min (s, e) = e.    We begin with this


assumption, because our sample period is one of low shipping demand and severe ship oversupply due to


high ship investment between 2005 and 2008 (see Kalouptsidi, 2014, 2018). If there are no search frictions,


so that    m = min (s, e) = e,     small exogenous changes in the number of ships should not aect the number


of matches. In contrast, if there are search frictions, an exogenous change in the number of ships changes


the number of matches, through the matching function                m = m(s, e).    We thus test for search frictions by


using ocean weather conditions (unpredictable wind at sea), which aect travel times, to explore whether


exogenously changing the number of ships in regions with a lot more ships than exporters aects the


realized number of matches.
                                   17 Since we do not observe exporters directly, to select periods in which there


are more ships than exporters, for each region we consider weeks when there are at least twice as many


ships waiting in port as matches. Table 4 presents the results. We nd that indeed matches are aected


by weather conditions in all regions, consistent with the presence of search frictions.


       Second, we document        simultaneous arrivals        of empty ships that then load          and departures of

empty ships.         Indeed, the rst two panels of Figure 2 display the weekly number of ships that arrive


empty and load, as well as the number of ships that leave empty, in two net exporting countries: Norway


and Chile. In Norway, several ships arrive empty and load, but almost no ship departs empty. In Chile,


however, the picture is quite dierent: it frequently happens that an empty ship arrives and picks up


cargo, while at the same time another ship departs empty.                  This is suggestive of wastefulness in Chile:

  17
       In particular, we divide the sea surrounding each region into zones; for each zone we use information on the wind speed
at dierent distances from the coast and in dierent directions. To obtain the unpredictable component of weather we run
a VAR regression of these weather indicators. The results are robust to the lag structure, as well as estimating jointly for
neighboring zones.

Table 4:      Test for search frictions.   Regressions of the number of matches in each region on the unpredictable
component of weather conditions in the surrounding seas. For each region we use weeks in which there are at least
twice as many ships as matches.        The rst column reports the number of observations; the second column joint
signicance; and the third column the average ratio between matches and ships in each region during these weeks.
To proxy for the unpredictable component of weather, we divide the sea surrounding each region into 8 dierent
zones (Northeast, Southeast, Southwest and Northwest both within 1,500 miles of the coast and betwen 1,500 and
2,500 miles from the coast), and we use the speed of the horizontal (E/W) and vertical (N/S) component of wind
in each zone to proxy for weather conditions.        We run a VAR regression of these weather variables on their lag
component and season xed eects and use the residuals, together with their squared term, as independent variables
in the regression.




why does the ship that depart empty, not pick up the cargo, instead of having another ship arrive from


elsewhere to pick it up?


       This pattern is observed in many countries. Indeed, the third panel of Figure 2 depicts the histogram


of the bi-weekly ratios of outgoing empty ships over incoming empty and loading ships for net exporting


countries. In the absence of frictions, one would expect this ratio to be close to zero. However, we see that


the average ratio is well above zero. Moreover, this pattern is quite robust in a number of dimensions.
                                                                                                                        18


       Third, again inspired by the labor literature, we investigate       dispersion in prices.      In markets with no


frictions, the law of one price holds, so that there is a single price for the same service. This does not hold


in labor markets, where there is large wage dispersion among workers who are observationally identical.

  18
       This gure is robust to alternative market denitions, time periods and ship types. Capesize vessels exhibit somewhat
larger mass towards zero, consistent with the somewhat higher concentration of ships and charterers, as well as the ships'
ability to approach fewer ports. The gure is also similar if done by port rather than country. To control for repairs we
remove stops longer than 6 weeks. Finally, we only consider as ships arriving empty the ships arriving empty and sailing
full towards another region, and we consider as ships leaving empty ships sailing empty toward a dierent country; so
movements to nearby ports are excluded. This denition also implies that refueling cannot explain the fact either- though
there are very small dierences in fuel prices across space anyway (less than 10%).

This observation has generated a substantial and inuential literature on frictional wage inequality, i.e.


wage inequality that is driven by search frictions.
                                                                                                  19 As we already saw in Table 2 there is substantial


price dispersion in shipping contracts. More specically, at best we can account for about 70% of price


variation, controlling for ship size, as well as quarter, origin and destination xed eects. Moreover, the


coecient of variation of prices within a given quarter, origin and destination triplet is about 30% (23%)


on average (median). In the most popular trip, from Australia to China, the                                                                            weekly     coecient of variation


is on average 34% and ranges from 15% to 65% across weeks.                                                                   In addition, it is worth noting that the


type of product carried aects the price paid and overall more valuable goods lead to higher contracted


prices, as shown in Table 2. In the absence of frictions, if there are more ships than exporters, as is the


case during our sample period, we would expect prices to be bid down to the ships' opportunity cost.
                                                                                                                                                                                                20


In contrast, in markets with frictions and bilateral bargaining, as shown formally in the model of Section


4, the buyer's valuation aects the price he pays and exporters with higher valuations pay more.


                   As in labor markets, a multitude of factors can lead to frictions (i.e. unrealized matches) in shipping.


First, the decentralized and unconcentrated nature of the market and the mere existence of brokers, suggest


that information frictions are present.
                                                                                  21 Port infrastructure, congestion or capacity constraints may also


hinder matching. In addition, regulations may impose special ship requirements (e.g. ags, environmental

              19
                   See for instance Burdett and Mortensen (1998), Postel-Vinay and Robin (2002), Mortensen (2003) and references therein.
              20
                   In a frictionless market with more ships than freights and homogeneous ships, in equilibrium the price from an origin to
a destination would be such that ships are indierent between transporting the cargo and staying unmatched.
              21
                   The meeting process involves a disperse network of brokers; oftentimes more than two brokers intervene to close a deal,
suggesting that the ship's and the exporter's brokers do not always nd each other, and that an intermediate broker was
necessary to bring the two together (Panayides, 2016). In interviews, brokers claimed to receive 5,000-7,000 emails per day;
sorting through these emails is reminiscent of an unemployed worker sorting through hundreds of vacancy postings.




                                                                                                   18
rules). Finally, heterogeneities, such as long-run relations or special cargo requirements in ship investments


may result in unrealized trade.


       While in labor markets, as some researchers have argued, observed or unobserved heterogeneity may


partly explain the documented facts, in shipping heterogeneity is much more limited. Indeed, the data


suggests that ship heterogeneity alone is not a prominent explanation for search frictions. Ships do not


specialize neither geographically, nor in terms of products: the majority of ships deliver cargo to 13 out of


15 regions and carry at least 2 of the 3 main products (coal, ore and grain). Moreover, neither shipowner


characteristics, nor shipowner xed eects have any explanatory power in price regressions, as shown in


Table 9 in Appendix B, while ballast decisions of ships in the same region are concentrated around the


same options.
                  22 Nonetheless, despite the anecdotal and descriptive evidence presented, it is not possible


to reject that heterogeneity can also play a role in the market.




4 Model
In this section, motivated by the above ndings, we introduce a spatial model that centers on the interaction


between the market for transport and the market for world trade in goods. In each period, the timing is as


follows: In each region, available ships and exporters participate in a random matching process. Ships that


get matched transport their exporter's cargo to its destination for a negotiated price, and restart there.


Ships that do not get matched decide whether to wait at their current location or ballast elsewhere and


search there. Exporters that get matched have their cargo delivered and collect their revenue. Exporters


that do not get matched wait at port. Finally, a large number of potential exporters decide whether and


where to export, thus replenishing the exporter pool seeking transportation the following period.


       We rst lay out the model's setup; we then present the agents' value functions and derive the equi-


librium objects of interest: trade costs (shipping prices) and trade ows (gravity equation). We close the


section with a detailed discussion of our main assumptions.




4.1       Environment


Time is discrete. There are        I   locations/regions,   i â {1, 2, ..., I}.   There are two types of agents, exporters


and ships. Both are risk neutral and have discount factor               Î².
  22
       If heterogeneity were an important driver of ships' ballasting decisions, we would expect ships to choose diverse des-
tinations from a given origin.    Yet we nd that ballast choices are similar across ships (the   CR3   measure for the chosen
destinations is higher than 70% in most regions). Moreover, home-ports are not an important consideration for shipowners,
as the crew ies to their home country every 6-8 months.




                                                               19
          At each location        i   and period       t,   there are    eit   exporters/freights that need to be delivered to another


location. An exporter obtains revenue (or valuation),                                 r,    from shipping the good. Every period, at each


location        i, Ei   potential exporters decide whether and where to export. If they decide to export, they pay


production and export costs,                    Îºij   and draw their revenue               r,   from a distribution            Fijr   with mean     rÌij .

          There are     S   homogeneous ships in the world.
                                                                              23 In every period, a ship is either at port in some region


i,   or it is traveling loaded or ballast, from some location                           i   to some location             j.   A ship at port in location             i

incurs a per period waiting cost                  cw
                                                   i , while a ship sailing from i to j                 incurs a per period sailing cost                csij .   The


duration of a trip between region                     i   and region      j    is stochastic: a traveling ship arrives at                  j   in the current


period with probability                dij ,   so that the average duration of the trip is                  1/dij .24

          Freights can only be delivered to their destination by ships and each ship can carry (at most) one


freight. Following the search and matching literature, we model new matches every period,                                                          mit ,     using a


matching function, whereby the number of matches at time                                        t   in region   i   is




                                                                      mit = mi (sit , eit )


where        sit   is the number of unmatched ships in region i.                      mi (sit , eit ) is increasing in both arguments.                       Let   Î»it

denote the probability that an unmatched ship in location                                   i meets an exporter; Î»it = mit /sit .               Similarly, let


Î»eit denote the probability with which an unmatched exporter meets a ship; Î»eit = mit /eit .25                                              As discussed in


Section 3.3, the matching function captures the implications of frictional trading, in a parsimonious fashion.


In other words, we do not explicitly model the meeting technology between exporters and ships, which


would introduce intractable complexities; instead, the matching function captures the several realities


of the market discussed earlier, without explicit reference to the source of the friction (Petrongolo and


Pissarides, 2001).


          When a ship and an exporter meet, they either agree on a price to be paid by the exporter to the ship


or they both revert to their outside options. The outside option of the exporter is to remain unmatched


and wait for another ship, while the outside option of the ship is to either remain unmatched in the current


region or to ballast elsewhere. The surplus of the match over the parties' outside options is split via the


price-setting mechanism. The price,                         Ïijr ,   paid to the ship delivering a freight of valuation                        r   from region


i    to destination         j,   is determined by generalized Nash bargaining, with                             Î³ â (0, 1)        denoting the exporter's

          We follow Kalouptsidi (2014) and assume constant returns to scale so that a shipowner is a ship.
     24
          It is straightforward to have deterministic trip durations instead. Our specication, however, preserves tractability and
allows for some variability e.g. due to weather shocks, without aecting the steady state properties of the model.

bargaining power. The price is paid upfront and the ship commits to begin its voyage immediately to                                                         j.

     Ships that remain unmatched decide whether to remain in their current region or ballast elsewhere


subject to i.i.d. logit shocks. Exporters that remain unmatched survive with probability                                                 Î´>0       and wait


in their current region.




4.2      Equilibrium


The state variable of a ship in region                    i    includes its current location           i,   as well as the state          (st , et ),   where


et = [e1t , ..., eIt ]   denotes the distribution of exporters over all regions, and                           st   is an   I ÃI       matrix including


the ships that are traveling from                i   to       j , sijt ,     as well as the ships at port        sit , i, j = 1, ..., I .       The state


variable of an exporter in           i   includes his location i, valuation                  r   and destination     j,   as well as     (st , et ).    In this


paper, we consider the steady state of our industry model, following the tradition of Hopenhayn (1992).


More specically, agents view the spatial distribution of ships and exporters,                                       (st , et ),     as xed and make


decisions based on its steady-state value.




     Ships      Let      Vij   denote the value of a ship that starts the period traveling from                           i to j     (empty or loaded),


Vi   the value of a ship that starts the period at port in location i, and                              Ui   the value of a ship that remained


unmatched at        i    at the end of the period (we suppress the dependence on the steady state values                                                (s, e)).

Then:


                                                  Vij = âcsij + dij Î²Vj + (1 â dij )Î²Vij                                                                    (2)



In words, the ship that is traveling from                      i   to   j,   pays the per period cost of sailing           csij ;   with probability        dij

it arrives at its destination            j,   where it begins unmatched with value                      Vj ;   with the remaining probability


1 â dij   the ship does not arrive and keeps traveling.


     A ship that starts the period in region                       i    obtains:




                                              Vi = âcw
                                                     i + Î»i Ej,r (Ïijr + Vij ) + (1 â Î»i )Ui                                                                (3)




In words, the ship pays the per period port wait cost                                 cw
                                                                                       i ;   it gets matched with probability               Î»i ,   in which


case it receives the agreed upon price,               Ïijr ,       and begins traveling. The ship takes expectation over the type


of exporter it meets, i.e. its revenue and destination. With the remaining probability,                                             1 â Î»i , the ship does

not nd an exporter and gets the value of being unmatched                                     Ui .

     If the ship remains unmatched, it faces the choice of either staying at                                 i or ballasting to another region;


                                                                                 21
in the latter case, the ship can choose among all possible destinations. The unmatched ship's value function


is:

where the shocks          â RI       are drawn from a type I Extreme Value (Gumbel) distribution, with standard


deviation     Ï.    In words, if the ship stays in its current region                       i,   it obtains value       Vi ;   otherwise the ship


chooses another region and begins its trip there.


      Let   Pii   denote the probability that a ship in location                i chooses to remain there, and Pij                the probability

    Trade Costs (Shipping Prices)                  As discussed above, the rents generated by a match between an


exporter and a ship, are split via Nash bargaining. This implies the surplus sharing condition:

where     Ui â¡ E Ui ().     We use this condition to solve out for the equilibrium price                    Ïijr ,   in the following


lemma:



Lemma 1.        The agreed upon price between a ship and an exporter with valuation r and destination j in
location i is given by:
                                             Ïijr = (1 â Âµi ) (Ui â Vij ) + Âµi r                                                    (11)



where Âµi = (1 â Î³) (1 â Î²Î´) / (1 â Î²Î´ (1 â Î³Î»ei )).

Proof.    Substitute
                        e
                       Uijr   in (10).



    In other words, the price is a convex combination of the exporter's revenue,                          r,     and the dierence


between the ship's value of transporting the freight,           Vij ,   and its outside option,        Ui .    Consistent with the


evidence in Table 2 exporters that have a higher value,             r,   pay higher prices. As discussed in Section 3.3,


this is true because when there are search frictions, the law of one price no longer holds.


    Crucially, the price depends on ships' equilibrium behavior through the value of traveling from                                 i   to


j , Vij   (which in turn depends on        Vj ),   as well as the value of the outside option,                 Ui .   These objects


are very rich, as they capture the attractiveness of both the origin                i,   as well as the destination           j,   which


consists of numerous features. For instance, destinations that are unappealing to ships because there are


few exporters relative to ships and the probability of ballasting afterwards is high, command higher prices


(consistent with the evidence presented in Table 2). The same holds for destinations that are further away



                                                               23

possible ballast destinations from               j,    as well as for conditions at all possible export destinations from                                  j,

revealing the importance of network eects. Similarly,                          Ui   controls for the attractiveness of the origin (e.g.


exporter revenues, nearby ballast opportunities, matching probability). As a result, the price between                                                      i

and      j   depends on all countries, rather than just              i   and    j.

     This equation is a gravity equation; it delivers the trade ow (in quantity rather than value) from


i   to   j   as a function of two components. First, the primitives                           {Î»ei , rÌij , Îºij , Ei }   not just for   i   and   j   but for


all regions; this is reminiscent of the analysis in Anderson and Van Wincoop (2003) who show that the


gravity equation in a trade model needs to include a country's overall trade disposition.


     Second, it is a function of the endogenous trade costs,                                  Ïij ,   for all    j,   which are the key addition


here. In this model, trade costs introduce network eects between countries: indeed,                                              Ïij   depends on all


locations both through the outside option of the ship at the origin i,                                  Ui    , as well as the ballast and export


opportunities from the destination                j,     captured by     Vj .   Overall, any change in the primitives aects trade


ows both directly, but also indirectly through its impact on trade costs. We illustrate the importance of


this mechanism in Section 7.

4.3       Discussion


We close this section with a discussion on several of our assumptions and some caveats.


       We begin our discussion with the          matching process.          In our model the matching function is local, so


that an exporter meets a ship only if they are in the same region, much like taxis and passengers. This


is a modeling assumption, as there is no technological or other constraint that prevents an exporter from


meeting and matching with a ship in another region. Nonetheless, there are economic disincentives that


make distant matching unlikely, suggesting this is a reasonable approximation.


       More specically, practitioners explain that contracts tend to be signed with ships that are nearby,


by arguing that a ship is not a train and it cannot promise exact arrival times far in advance due to


weather conditions and port congestion. These delays are costly for exporters. Moreover, ships that are


already in the region of the exporter have a distinct cost advantage over ships in other regions, since they


do not need to incur the additional cost of sailing empty to the exporter's region. Given that ships are in


oversupply during our time period, exporters are not willing to pay (and wait) in order to contract with


ships that are far away.
                              26 Reassuringly, the data support the local matching function assumption. For


instance, about 20% of the contracts specify dierent signing and loading regions. Furthermore, as shown


in Table 1, contracts are signed just 6 days on average prior to the loading date. In addition, the satellite


data reveals that ships enter the region within 12 days of loading, which is well before the signing date.


       Also related to the matching process, we assume that exporter valuations are suciently high so that


in equilibrium, when a ship and an exporter meet, they always agree to form a match.                                It is easy to


see that for every origin-destination pair, there exists a threshold of exporter value, below which the


match surplus becomes negative and meetings do not result in matches.                              In this case, the price that a

  26
       We formalize this using the model estimates produced in Section 6. In particular, we use our model to examine whether
an exporter would benet from searching in multiple regions. We nd that when we allow an exporter to search in the best
other region, in addition to the loading region, exporters always prefer to match with a ship in the loading region. The large
majority of matches (>80%) still take place in the loading region. In addition, the price paid and the exporter value function
are virtually unchanged.




                                                                   25
ship demands to stop searching is too high for the low value exporters to pay and the match becomes


unprotable. Thus, the support of the distribution of revenues,                   Fijr ,   needs to be bounded below by this


threshold. This assumption is reasonable in our context, since exporter revenue is an order of magnitude


higher than transport prices. Using the model estimates produced in Section 6, we nd that the surplus


from matching is fairly high; on average it equals 371,270$, and it remains high even if we focus on the


lowest priced commodity, namely coal (the average surplus in this case is $249,150, well above zero). This


is not surprising: to get a sense of the magnitudes, the average value of a coal cargo is $3,864,250, while


its average shipping price is $297,720.


       Next, it is important to discuss how the model's main outputs would change in the                     absence of search

frictions;     i.e. if the matching function were assumed to be             mi = min {si , ei }.      In a world without search


frictions and more ships than exporters, the shipping price is given by               Ïij = Ui âVij , therefore the properties

of endogenous trade costs (dependence on distance, origin, destination and entire network of countries) are


independent of the presence of search frictions and               still hold.27   The paper's main implications presented


in Section 7 are thus not driven by search frictions, but rather by the endogeneity of trade costs.


       We now turn to the        steady state       assumption of our industry model, which follows the tradition of


Hopenhayn (1992) and a large body of other work in macro, IO, trade, etc. In particular, we consider the


steady state of our dynamic system, where agents' strategies and value functions depend only on their own


state and the long-run average aggregate state, which is constant. This assumption renders the problem


more tractable and allows us to derive simple(r) expressions for prices and trade ows.


       It is worth connecting this assumption to the empirical exercise coming up. Naturally, the data exhibits


variation over time. Strictly speaking, our empirical approach relies on the assumption that agents play


against the steady state; i.e. their strategies rely on their own state and the long-run industry average.
                                                                                                                                  28


That said, the steady state assumption is not unreasonable for the data at hand, which covers a period


that is uniformly characterized by ship oversupply and relatively low demand for shipping services without


any major shocks.           Moreover, given the short-lived nature of the ships' ballasting decisions it does not


feel unreasonable that they would ignore aggregate long-run shocks when making these weekly choices; in


addition, transition dynamics to a new steady state should be short given that a ship can travel to most


ports in the world in a month.
                                         29

  27
       Since ships are on the long side of the market, the price has to be such that ships are indierent between loading and
going to destination   j   and remaining unmatched, i.e. it must be that   Ïijr + Vij = Ui .   In this case the price does not depend
on the exporter's valuation     r   (law of one price). Recall that this contrasts with the results of Table 2 where the shipping
price is higher for higher revenue products.
  28
       This is reminiscent of the interpretation of the Oblivious Equilibrium (OE) concept of Weintraub et al. (2008).
  29
       To test whether ships respond to transitory shocks, we check if weather shocks aect ships' ballast decisions and nd




                                                                  26
       In this paper, we do not model         ship entry and exit;         exit is overall very small, while due to long


construction lags in shipbuilding (two to six years), the eet is xed in the short run; see Kalouptsidi


(2014, 2018).       Our counterfactual results therefore hold in the short/medium run.
                                                                                                       30 , 31 We also do not

       Finally, in the trade literature, trade costs include transport costs, taris and other barriers. Here we


focus on microfounding and endogenizing transport costs. In our setup, other trade barriers are included in


Îºij , the cost of entry into exporting.      In addition, we do not consider the determination of commodity prices;


in other words, we take exporter valuations              r   to be exogenous. Determining this object in equilibrium


within our setup is an interesting avenue for future research.




5 Empirical Strategy
In this section we lay out the empirical strategy followed to estimate the model of Section 4. Our empirical


exercise consists of two distinct components: (i) estimation of the matching function and the searching


exporters; (ii) estimation of ship travel and wait costs, exporter valuations and costs. We describe the


empirical strategy for each component here, and present all results in Section 6.




5.1       Matching Function Estimation


A sizable literature has estimated matching functions in several dierent contexts (e.g.                        labor markets,


marriage markets, taxicabs). For instance, in labor markets, one can use data on unemployed workers,


job vacancies and matches to recover the underlying matching function. In the market for taxi rides, one


observes taxis and their rides, but not hailing passengers; in recent work, Buchholz (2018), and Frechette


et al. (2018) have used such data, coupled with a parametric assumption on the matching function


to recover the hailing passengers.
                                           32 Similar to the taxi market, we observe ships and matches, but not


searching exporters. Here, we adopt a novel approach to simultaneously recover both exporters, as well


as a nonparametric matching function.

that they do not.
  30
       It also worth noting that risk neutrality is a natural starting point for our analysis. In our setup, agents make risky
decisions at a weekly frequency, so it may be reasonable to expect that over the course of the year risk washes out. Moreover,
in our data we nd that neither the variance of prices, nor of trip durations aect ships' ballast decisions.
  31
       It is straightforward to include a ship free entry condition in the model in order to consider longer-run counterfactuals.
However in this case, we would need to take a stand on shipowners' expectations of future demand.
  32
       Buchholz (2018) assumes an urn-ball matching function. Frechette et al. (2018) construct a numerical simulation of taxi
drivers that randomly meet passengers over a grid that resembles Manhattan; this spatial simulation essentially corresponds
to the matching function, and can be inverted to recover hailing passengers.




                                                                27
     Our approach extends the literature in two dimensions. First, we do not take a stance on the presence


and magnitude of search frictions in the industry. Consider the case of no search frictions, so that the


matching function is,      mit = min (sit , eit )    and all potential matches are realized. In contrast, if there are


search frictions, we have    mit = mi (sit , eit ) â¤ min (sit , eit ) , so that some potential matches are not realized.

If one side of the market is unobserved (here               eit )   or mismeasured it is not straightforward to dierentiate


these two cases. The test presented in Section 3.3 serves to distinguish the two cases.


     Second, we avoid imposing parametric restrictions on the matching function. The literature has im-


posed functional forms, most commonly the Cobb-Douglas; but parametric restrictions are directly linked


to welfare and so can be overly restrictive. For instance, it has been shown in a wide class of labor market


models, that the condition for constrained eciency depends crucially on the elasticity of the matching


function with respect to the search input (Hosios, 1990). In much of the matching function estimation


literature this elasticity has been restricted to be constant.


     Suppose we have a sample       {sit , mit }Tt=0     for each market i. The unknowns of interest are the            I   matching


functions    mi (Â·)   and the exporters    eit ,   all   i, t;   henceforth, we suppress the        i   subscript to ease notation.


Our approach relies on the literature on nonparametric identication (Matzkin, 2003) and nonseparable


instrumental variable techniques (e.g. Imbens and Newey, 2009).


     We assume that (i) the matching function                    m(s, e)   is continuous and strictly increasing in         e;   (ii) the


matching function exhibits constant returns to scale (CRS), so that                        m (as, ae) = am (s, e)     for all     a>0

and there is a known point         {mÌ, sÌ, eÌ},   such that         mÌ = m (sÌ, eÌ);   (iii) the random variables    s     and    e   are


independent. Assumption (i) is natural, as more exporters lead to more matches, all else equal. Assumption


(ii) is a restriction that guarantees identication of both sets of unknowns and is discussed further below.


Assumption (iii) is made for expositional purposes and is relaxed later on.


     Let   Fm|s   denote the distribution of matches conditional on ships, and                 Fe   the distribution of exporters,


e.   Then at a given point    {st , et , mt }   we have:




                               Fm|s=st (mt |s = st ) = Pr (m (s, e) â¤ mt |s = st )

                                                                 = Pr e â¤ mâ1 (s, mt ) |s = st
                                                                                                        

                                                                 = Pr e â¤ mâ1 (st , mt )
                                                                                         
                                      independence


                                                                 = Fe (et )                                                            (14)




                                                                      28
          The equation         Fe (et ) = Fm|s=st (mt |s = st )              forms the basis for identication and estimation. Indeed


note that this equation, along with the CRS assumption, allows us to recover the distribution                                         Fe (e),     for


all   e:    using the known point              {mÌ, sÌ, eÌ}   and letting       a = e/eÌ,   for all   e,


                                                      Fe (aeÌ) = Fm|s=asÌ (m (asÌ, aeÌ) |s = asÌ)

                                                                    = Fm|s=asÌ (amÌ|s = asÌ)                                                     (15)




We use (15) and vary               a   to trace out      FÌe (e),        relying on a kernel density estimator for the conditional distri-


bution        FÌm|s=asÌ (amÌ|s = asÌ).33          Once the distribution             FÌe   is recovered, we obtain the number of exporters


et    from
                                                                                         
                                                         et = FÌeâ1 FÌm|s=st (mt |s = st ) ,

and the matching function at                    any   point     (s, e)      from



                                                                             â1
                                                                m (s, e) = FÌm|s (Fe (e)) .


We choose the known point,                      {mÌ, sÌ, eÌ},   to be of the form            1 = m(sÌ, 1),      so that one exporter is always


matched when there are                  sÌ   ships. We set          sÌ   iteratively, to be the lowest value such that        mt â¤ et ,   for all    t,

thus obtaining a conservative bound on search frictions.


          The intuition behind the identication argument is as follows: the observed correlation between                                    s   and


m     informs us on            âm(s, e)/âs,       since the sensitivity of matches to changes in ships is observed and                           s   is


independent of             e   by assumption; then, due to homogeneity, this derivative also delivers the derivative


âm(s, e)/âe;           and once these derivatives are known, integration leads to the matching function, which can


be inverted to provide the number of exporters.


          The CRS assumption is a reasonable starting point. In the labor literature, the majority of matching


function estimates nd support for constant returns to scale; as Petrongolo and Pissarides (2001) point


out divergences from constant returns are only mild and rare. Nonetheless, to explore the robustness of


our ndings, in Section 6.1 we consider an alternative approach that does not make an assumption on the


returns to scale, but instead relies on a restriction on the distribution                                  Fe   (Poisson).

     33
          For instance, one can use a simple frequency estimator:

                                                                                   Pr (m â¤ mt , s = st )   #1 {(m â¤ mt , s = st )}
                        Fm|s=st (mt |s = st ) = Pr (m â¤ mt |s = st ) =                                   =
                                                                                       Pr (s = st )            #1 {(s = st )}

where       1 {Â·}   denotes the indicator function and          #    denotes the number of times. In practice, we use a Gaussian kernel density
estimator.



                                                                                   29
     Finally, as mentioned above, independence of ships and exporters is not a natural assumption in


our setting. To relax it, we employ the literature on nonlinear IV techniques (e.g. Imbens and Newey,


2009, while for an application similar to ours see Bajari and Benkard, 2005). In particular, assume that


an instrument      z   exists such that        s = h (z, Î·),       with      z    independent of                 e, Î· .   Under this formulation the


endogeneity is driven by the correlation between                       Î·   and   e       and, therefore,          s   is independent of      e,   conditional


on   Î·.

     The approach now has two steps. In the rst step, we recover                                       Î·   using the relationship          s = h (z, Î·);   in


practice we regress exibly the number of ships                    s   on the instrument,                   z,   and set    Î·   equal to the residual. In


the second step, we employ (14) conditioning on both                             s   (as before) and              Î·:


                                               Fm|s=st ,Î· (mt |s = st , Î·) = Fe|Î· (et |Î·)


Similarly to above we recover the unknowns of interest                               e   and    m(Â·),       by integrating both sides over            Î·.

     In this case,     z   consists of unpredictable sea weather shocks that shift the arrival of ships at a port


without aecting the number of exporters; this is the same instrument used in our frictions test presented


in Section 3.3.




5.2       Ship Costs and Exporter Revenue


We now turn to the ship cost parameters,                  {csij , cw
                                                                   i , Ï},       for all       i, j ,   as well as the exporter revenues             r â¼ Fijr

and production and export costs                Îºij ,   for all   i, j .    The estimation amounts to essentially matching the


observed ballast decisions of ships to the model's predicted choice probabilities                                               Pij ;   the observed prices


Ïijr ,   to the equilibrium Nash-bargained prices; and the observed trade ows (loaded trips) to the model's


predicted equilibrium ows          Pije .   Intuitively, ships' observed choices, conditional on observed prices, deliver


the ship costs.        Then, in equilibrium, prices inform us on the exporter's revenues.                                                Finally, potential


exporters make their entry decisions taking into account the (expected) prices they will face. From these


decisions, we are able to back out the production and export cost.




     Ship Costs            Consider rst the ship sailing costs,                  csij ,   wait costs,           cw
                                                                                                                  i ,   and the standard deviation of


the logit shocks,      Ï.    These parameters determine ships' optimal ballast choice probabilities, (5) and (6),


given prices, through the value functions                Vij .   Thus, we can estimate them via Maximum Likelihood using


the observed ship choices. In particular, we use a nested xed point algorithm to solve for the ship value


functions at every guess of the parameter values, compute the predicted choice probabilities and then



                                                                           30
calculate the likelihood, as in Rust (1987). We provide the details of the approach in Appendix D, where


we also prove that our value functions are well-dened using a contraction argument.


       As is always the case in dynamic discrete choice, not all parameters are identied and some restriction


needs to be imposed. Here, we have                   I2 + 1    parameters and           I2 â I    choice probabilities, so we require                  I +1

restrictions; we show this formally, borrowing from the analysis of Kalouptsidi et al. (2016) in Appendix


E.     The additional restrictions amount to using observed fuel prices to determine                                     csij   for some          i, j ;   see


Section 6.2. Note also that the observed prices pin down the scale of payos (in dollars) and allow the


identication of        Ï .34


       Exporter revenues and entry costs                            We next use data on shipping prices to estimate exporter


revenues. Consider the equilibrium price (11) solved with respect to the exporter's revenue                                                r:

                                            1 â Î²Î´ (1 â Î³Î»ei )        Î³ (1 â Î²Î´ (1 â Î»ei ))
                                     r=                        Ïijr â                       (Ui â Vij )                                                 (16)
                                            (1 â Î³) (1 â Î²Î´)           (1 â Î³) (1 â Î²Î´)

Note that the only unknowns in this expression are the revenue                              r and the bargaining coecient Î³ , and that

we have as many equations as the observed shipping prices. Indeed,                                      Î»ei   is known from the previous step

                                                                                              e

that the valuation          r   is dierent for each matched exporter, while the bargaining coecient parameter is a


scalar, that is identical for all markets.


       We rst estimate the bargaining weight,                 Î³    by averaging equation (16) across regions and products; this

                                                                                                                                                           2

average relationship links the average shipping price, to the average exporter revenue (rÌ                                               â¡       ij rÌij /I ).

We calibrate the average exporter revenue across regions,                         rÌ,   to be equal to the average value of total trade


in commodities (obtained from external trade data from Index Mundi) and solve (16) for                                                   Î³ .35

       Given this estimate for the bargaining weight,                    Î³,   we recover each exporter valuation                r    point-wise from

  34
       Unlike commonly used discrete choice models where only choices are observed and both the scale and level of utility need
to be normalized, here we also observe a component of payos (prices in dollars) which allows us to relax the restriction on
the scale of utility and identify      Ï.
  35
       In particular, we solve (16) with respect to       Î³   and average over    i, j, r   so that:

                                                                    (1 â Î²Î´) (r â Ï )
                                      Î³=
                                            Î²Î´Eijr Î»ei Ïijr + (1 â Î²Î´) r â Eij (1 â Î²Î´ (1 â Î»ei )) (Ui â Vij )
where    ÏÌ   is the average observed price. To obtain        r,   we rst collect the average price of the ve most common commodities
(ore, coal, grain, steel, and fertilizers) from Index Mundi, and multiply it by the average tonnage carried by a bulk carrier
(this is equal to the average vessel size times its utilization rate which equals about 65%). We then set                           rÌ   as their weighted
average based on each commodity's frequency in shipping contracts; we nd                         r   to equal 7 million US dollars. This approach
of estimating the Nash bargaining weight is inspired by the empirical literature on oligopoly bargaining (e.g. Crawford and
Yurukoglu, 2012, Ho and Lee, 2017).




                                                                            31
(16) and obtain their distribution,                      Fijr ,   nonparametrically. Note that valuations are drawn from an origin-


destination specic distribution, which allows for arbitrary correlation between a cargo's valuation and


destination.


          We nally estimate the exporter entry costs,                         Îºij ,   which capture both the cost of production, as well as


any export costs beyond shipping prices. These are estimated from the exporters' entry decisions, given


by the choice probabilities,                  Pije ,   dened in (8) and (9). Indeed, we recover                    Îºij   from the following equation


(Berry, 1994):


                                                                   ln Pije â ln Pi0
                                                                                  e
                                                                                    = Uije â Îºij .                                                         (17)



The only unknown in this equation is                              Îºij .   Recall that    Uije = Î±i (rÌij â Ïij )     and that both        Î±i = Î²Î´Î»ei /(1 â

Î²Î´(1 â Î»ei ))           and the mean revenue             rÌij   have been estimated, while            Ïij      is observed. Turning to the left hand


side of (17), note that from the satellite data we have information on the proportions of loaded trips from


i    to    j,   i.e.   Pije / (1 â Pi0
                                     e ).    However, to obtain               Îºij   we need both      Pije ,    as well as the fraction of potential


exporters who choose                   not   to export,
                                                                  e,
                                                                Pi0    or equivalently, the number of potential exporters                       Ei .   We set   Ei

equal to the total production of the relevant commodities for each region                                           i,   thus assuming that a region's


total production serves as an upper bound to the region's exports.
                                                                                                          36




6 Results
In this section we present the results from our empirical analysis.                                            We calibrate the discount factor to


Î² = 0.995              and the exporter survival rate to                   Î´ = 0.99.     In our baseline estimation we ignore the dierent


ship sizes, but our estimation results are similar when we consider Panamax alone or Handymax alone


(these are the categories with sucient data). Moreover, results are robust when we estimate the model


separately by season.

          More precisely, let    nit   denote the number of entrant exporters in period               t   and region     i.   Then, the number of exporters
transitions as follows (see equation (18) in Appendix C):


                                                                       eit+1 = Î´ (eit â mit ) + nit

If   Ei    is known, we can solve this equation for                 Pio   since the right-hand-side is known. To determine             Ei ,   we collect annual
country-level production data for grain (FAO), coal (EIA), iron ore (US Geological Survey), fertilizer (FAO) and steel (World
Steel Association). To transform the production tons into a number of potential freights (i.e. shipments that t in our bulk
vessels), we rst scale the production to adjust for the coverage of our data (we observe about half of the total eet) and
then divide by the average active ship size, taking into account a ship's utilization rate and the fact that a ship operates
on average 340 days per year (due to maintenance, repairs, etc)




                                                                                    32
6.1       Matching Function


We now present the estimates for the exporters and the matching function, obtained as described in Section


5.1.
       37 The matching function is estimated separately for each region i.


       First, we present the results from the rst stage regression of the number of ships on the unpredictable


component of weather in surrounding seas for all regions. The results, shown in Table 5, indicate that


ocean wind has a signicant impact. This suggests that weather indeed aects trip duration and therefore


weather shocks exogenously shift the supply of ships at port.

Table 5:       First Stage, Matching Function Estimation.          Regressions of the number of ships in each region on
the unpredictable component of weather conditions in the surrounding seas.             The rst column reports the joint
signicance of the instruments and the second column the F-statistic. For the construction of the instrument, see
Table 4.




       Figure 3 presents the weekly average number of exporters in each region. Not surprisingly perhaps,


exporters are concentrated in Australia, the East Coast of North and South America and Southeast Asia,


which are all rich in raw materials. India, Africa and Central America have the fewest exporters.


       The matching function has reasonable properties.              Exporters have substantially higher chances of


nding a match than ships, consistent with our sample period of high ship supply and low demand. The

  37
       The results are fairly robust to the choice of the bandwidth parameters, though some sensitivity is to be expected. In
addition, the data exhibits sucient variation over time to perform the nonparametric analysis.
  38
       This is consistent with contracting practices, where the ship promises a range of fuel consumption based on dierent
weather conditions. Moreover, regressing the log of trip duration on wind speed, both upon arrival at the destination and
upon departure at the origin conrms that the weather strongly aects trip duration; indeed, trips are 11% longer on average
under bad weather conditions.

matching rate for ships (exporters) declines as the market gets crowded with ships (exporters). Moreover,


we nd that regional heterogeneity is important: imposing a single matching function across regions leads


to severely biased estimated exporters and matching function elasticities.                                                                                                                                                      To illustrate the importance


of the nonparametric approach, we compare our estimated matching function to a typical parametric


specication:      the Cobb-Douglas.               This specication, which is common in the literature, imposes that


the elasticities of the matching function are constant, a property that can be restrictive.                                                                                                                                                         Figure 11 in


Appendix B plots our estimates for the elasticity of matches with respect to the number of ships at port,

               âmi (e,s) s
s (e, s) =      âs      m , across regions.                    Our nonparametric matching function strongly rejects that these


elasticities are constant: on average the range of these elasticities is 33% of the elasticity at the average


level of ships and exporters in each region.                                                     In addition, we estimate a Cobb-Douglas specication for


the matching function and nd that the exporters recovered under this, more restrictive, assumption are


dierent both in magnitude (the average absolute error is 63%) and in the relative ranking of regions,


compared to the nonparametric case.

       To measure the extent of search frictions in dierent regions, we compute the average percentage


of weekly unrealized matches; i.e.                          (min{si , ei } â mi ) / min{si , ei }.                                                                                                     The results are plotted in the left

it as,



                             log (mit ) = log (Ai ) + (1 â Î±i ) log eit + Î±i log sit = Î±i0 + it + Î±i log sit

search frictions are heterogeneous over space and may be sizable, with up to 20% of potential matches


unrealized weekly in regions like South Africa and parts of South America and Europe.                        On average,


12.7% of potential matches are unrealized.
                                                         40 We can also reject that the matching function equals the


minimum for all regions.


       Moreover, as shown in the right panel of Figure 4, the estimated search frictions are positively correlated


with the observed within-region price dispersion, another indicator of search frictions. We also nd that


the frictions are negatively correlated with the Herndahl Index of charterers in a region; this suggests


that when the clientele is disperse, frictions are higher.                 Moreover, they are negatively correlated with


the index of quality of port infrastructure issued by Index Mundi, so that regions whose ports have a


low quality score, suer from higher matching frictions. Finally, when we estimate the matching function


separately for Capesize (biggest size) and Handysize (smallest size) vessels, we nd that for Capesize,

Figure 4:      Search Frictions. The left panel shows the average weekly share of unrealized matches, with condence
intervals from 200 bootstrap samples. The right panel displays the correlation between the average weekly share
of unrealized matches and several variables of interest. Price dispersion and the Herndahl Index of charterers are
calculated from the Clarksons contract data.            Price dispersion is computed from the residuals of a regression of
prices on ship characteristics, origin, destination and time xed eects. Port quality is obtained from the index of
quality of port infrastructure issued by Index Mundi.




       We close this section by discussing the robustness of our results to the CRS assumption. To do so,


instead of assuming CRS, we impose a parametric assumption on the distribution of exporters,                        Fe .   In

  40
       It is worth noting that this does not imply that in the absence of search frictions we would have 12.7% more matches,
as we would need to take into account the optimal response of ships and exporters. This is simply a measure of the severity
of search frictions in dierent regions.




                                                                 35
particular, we assume that exporters are distributed Poisson, as we can then interpret the number of


freights       et   as the number of arrivals of exporters at port every week. We estimate the number of exporters


and the matching function following an analogous strategy, based on Matzkin (2003).
                                                                                                                                  41 The results, shown


in Figure 12 in Appendix B, are robust to this alternative restriction. Moreover, we nd that the implied


degree of homogeneity of the matching function under the Poisson distributed exporters is roughly equal


to one, even though we do not assume CRS.




6.2          Ship Costs and Exporter Valuations


In our baseline specication, we construct seven groups for the sailing cost                                             csij ,   roughly based on the


continent and coast of the origin; and we estimate port wait costs                                        cw
                                                                                                           i ,   for all   i.42    Note that    csij   is the


per week         sailing cost from      i   to   j   and its major component is the cost of fuel. Following the discussion


on identication in Section 5.2, we set this cost for one of the groups (for trips originating from the East


Coast of North and South America) equal to the average weekly fuel price (40,000 US dollars). Moreover,


since the fuel cost is paid by the exporter when the ship is loaded, we add it to the observed prices.


          The rst two columns of Table 7 report the results.
                                                                                             43   Sailing costs are fairly homogeneous.                 Port


wait costs are more heterogeneous and large, ranging between 90,000 and 290,000 US dollars per week.


Consistent with industry narratives, waiting at port is costly, both due to direct port and security fees, as


well as the rapid depreciation of the ship's machinery and electronics and antifouling costs caused by the


accumulation of microorganisms during immobility. Ports in the Americas are the most expensive, while


ports in China, India, and Southeast Asia are the cheapest. The standard deviation of the logit shocks,


Ï,    is estimated at about 16,000 US dollars, roughly 5% of the average trip price including the fuel cost


payment. This suggests that the logit shocks do not account for a large part of utility or ballast decisions.


As shown in Figure 13 in the Appendix, the model's t is very good, as our predicted choice probabilities


are very close to the observed ones.

          Recall our basic equation,   Fm|s (m|s) = Fe (e).        If    Fe (e)    is Poisson with parameter     Ï,   we have:

                                                                                                   e
                                                                                                   X Ïk
                                                        Fm|s (m|s) = Fe (e) = exp (âÏ)
                                                                                                     k!

If   Ï    were known, we could solve this equation for           eit ,   all   i, t,   since the right-hand-side is known. We determine     Ï   iteratively
by requiring again that the inequalities             mit â¤ eit   always hold.
     42
          The seven groups are: (i) Central America, West Coast Americas; (ii) East Coast Americas; (iii) West and South Africa;
(iv) Mediterranean, Middle East and North Europe; (v) India; (vi) Australia and Southeast Asia; (vii) China, Japan and
Korea.
     43
          The standard errors are computed from 200 bootstrap samples with the resampling done at the ship level. We combine
these bootstrap samples with those of the matching function to incorporate the error from the matching function estimation.
     44
          As our data comes from a period of historically low shipping prices, our estimated value functions are negative. This
is partly due to the fact that we are not modeling ships' expectations, so the value function does not take into that under

    In the left panel of Figure 5 we plot the average exporter revenues across origins, while the third

is substantial heterogeneity in exporter revenues across space. South and North America have the highest


revenues, while China, Japan, and Southeast Asia have the lowest.                                                                                                                                                                    This ranking is reasonable, as for


instance, Brazil exports grain which is expensive, whereas Southeast Asia exports mostly coal, which is


one of the cheapest commodities. We generalize this example by focusing on grain, the most expensive


frequently shipped commodity. In particular, using data from Comtrade, we explore whether regions that


have a high share of grain exports tend to have higher estimated revenues.                                                                                                                                                                       The results, shown in the


right panel of Figure 5, reveal that indeed there is a positive correlation between the two.                                                                                                                                                                               Of course,


there may be other factors determining the valuation of an exporter such as inventory costs, just in time


production, etc. On average, the price                                                                                                    Ïij              is equal to about 5% of the mean valuation                                                     rÌij ,   consistent with


other estimates in the literature (e.g.                                                                                                       UNCTAD, 2015, Hummels et al., 2009).                                                                     Finally, the estimated


exporter costs,                           Îºij ,               exhibit substantial heterogeneity across destinations from a given origin, as well as


across origins. On average                                                            Îºij             is the same order of magnitude as the average valuation                                                                                               rÌij ,   reminiscent of

7 The Role of Endogenous Trade Costs
In this section, we illustrate the importance of endogenous trade costs. In particular, we demonstrate that


the transportation sector (1) implies that net exporters (importers) face higher (lower) trade costs leading


to misallocation of productive activities across countries; (2) creates network eects in trade costs; and


(3) dampens the impact of shocks on trade ows. We illustrate these mechanisms, by studying how our


setup compares to one with exogenous iceberg trade costs, the impact of a fuel cost shock and the spatial


propagation of a macro shock (a Chinese slow-down). These mechanisms also shape the policy analysis


considered in the next section.




Exogenous Trade Costs


We begin by showcasing how endogenous trade costs lead to misallocation (mechanism 1) and network


eects (mechanism 2) by comparing our setup to one with exogenous trade costs. Typical trade models


assume that trade costs are iceberg, so that a percentage of the traded good's value is lost in transporta-


tion; this percentage is often a function of the distance between the origin and destination (Samuelson,


1954).   In our setup, this amounts to assuming that the price paid for transportation from origin                        i   to


destination   j   is a function of only the distance,    1/dij ,   and the exporter valuation   rÌij .   We thus construct


a measure of exogenous trade costs by exibly regressing the observed shipping prices between                   i   and   j   on


distance and      rÌij .   This ensures that the overall level of shipping prices is the same. We then consider the


trade patterns under these (counterfactual) trade costs, using the exporters' choices, (8) and (9).


   Strikingly, we nd that in this world of exogenous iceberg trade costs, trade is substantially less


balanced: trade imbalances are 24% higher on average. Indeed, net exporters experience a 9.4% increase


in their exports, (and up to 24% for Australia), while net importers experience a 4.7% decline in their


exports (and up to 22% for India). In other words, the transportation sector acts as a smoothing factor


for world trade.


   The core mechanism is related to the ship's equilibrium behavior and in particular the strength of its


bargaining position. Consider a ship that is located near a large net exporter, such as Brazil. As loading


chances are high, the ship's bargaining position upon meeting an exporter (i.e.                   its outside option) is


strong and the ship can extract a high price, which in turn, tends to restrain Brazilian exports compared

                                                   45 In contrast, consider a ship located near a net importer, such


as India. The ship is unlikely to reload there. This lack of options puts the ship in a weak bargaining


position and forces it to accept lower prices, which in turn increases Indian exports compared to the case

       In addition, the likely destinations are net importers where ships' value are low. This further increases prices faced by
next exporters like Brazil and dampens exports and trade imbalances.

Figure 6:   Exogenous Trade Costs: the left panel presents the change in exports. The right panel correlates the
change in exports under exogenous trade costs and a region's centrality, dened as the distance-weighted sum of
                                           P
the imbalance of all other regions, i.e.      j   (1/dij ) (exportsj -importsj ).


of exogenous trade costs. The left panel of Figure 6 presents the change in each region's exporting under


exogenous trade costs and reveals that indeed net exporters experience a disproportionally large increase


in their exports.


    This implies that in a world of endogenous trade costs, there is a misallocation of productive activities,


which are reallocated from (ecient) net exporters to (inecient) net importers. In our setup this corre-


sponds to production decreasing in high            rÌ/low Îº            countries which face higher trade costs all else equal and


increasing in low   rÌ/high Îº   ones, which face lower trade costs. Indeed, total net value of trade increases


by 10% under exogenous trade costs. In addition, we nd that this argument extends to a region's neigh-


borhood; this is because trade costs depend on the entire network of neighboring countries. Indeed, a net


exporter close to other net exporters oers even more options to ships and prices are even higher, which


inhibits the neighborhood's exports. Hence, a country's own trade imbalance, as well as the imbalance


of its neighborhood, are crucial factors determining its trade disposition. To demonstrate these neighbor-


hood eects, we consider a centrality measure for each region that consists of the weighted sum of trade
                                                                                                                     P
imbalance in all regions, where the weights are given by the distance (i.e.                                               j   (1/dij ) (exportsj -importsj )).

The right panel of Figure 6 correlates the change in exports to this centrality measure and shows that the


overall imbalance of a neighborhood matters: regions whose neighborhood is overall a net-exporting one,


oer high outside options to ships, which pushes prices up and thus exports down (and vice versa).

A Shock to Fuel Costs


Here we explore how world trade reacts to a fuel cost shock. This shock directly aects the main (variable)


cost of transportation,           cs , and as a result also changes ship optimal behavior.                 This exercise illustrates how


the transport sector dampens the impact of the shock (mechanism 3), while at the same time reallocating


production across countries (mechanism 1).
                                                             46 , 47


       Consider a 10% decrease in              cs .   The left panel of Figure 7 presents the resulting change in world


exports, while the right panel presents the impact of the shock on several outcomes of interest. A decline


in   cs   has a direct and an indirect eect. The direct eect is straightforward: as costs fall, shipping prices


also fall and thus exports rise.
                                            48 Indeed, we see that exports increase everywhere, on average by 4.4%.


The indirect eect is that the decline in sailing costs lowers the cost of ballasting. This implies that the


ships' outside option,           U,   is now higher, which leads, all else equal, to an increase in prices that dampens


the direct eect (mechanism 3). This is intuitive: reduced sailing costs imply that ships are less tied


to their current region (and indeed ballast miles increase by 17%), and, as their bargaining position is


stronger, they negotiate higher prices. The dampening is substantial: as shown in the second column in


the right panel of Figure 7, if ships were not allowed to optimally adjust their behavior, the increase in


trade would have been 41% higher.


       In addition, as fuel costs decline and the importance of the transport sector is reduced, misallocation


declines. Indeed, as shown in the right panel of Figure 7, net exporters experience an increase in exports


of about 5%, while net importers experience an increase of about 3% (mechanism 1). This is largely driven


by the indirect eect: ships ending a trip at net importing regions, are now less likely to wait there given


the lower sailing cost; their outside option is higher and they can command higher prices that further


reduce exports from these regions. Indeed, if ships were not allowed to optimally adjust their behavior,


the increase in the exports of net importing regions would have been more than twice as high.

  47
       In this and all remaining counterfactuals, we compute the steady state spatial equilibrium distribution of ships and
exporters. In Appendix F, we provide the computational algorithm employed. The use of nonparametric techniques in the
estimation of the matching function may require substantial extrapolation in the counterfactuals; reassuringly, we nd that
the counterfactual matches and ships are always strictly within the range of our data.
  48
       Formally, there is a direct increase in the surplus of all matches, since now a match between a ship and a freight is more
valuable. Using the ship and freight value functions, the match surplus is given by

                                                           csij              dij Î²                 e

A decline in   csij ,   holding everything else constant, directly increases Sijr . All else equal, this reduces export prices,   Ï,   which
                                                                e
in turn increases the value of an unmatched exporter,         Uijr , and thus induces more entry into the export market.

Chinese Slow-down


Finally, we explore the spatial propagation of a macro shock: a slow-down in China.                                This experiment


showcases how the transport sector creates network eects (mechanism 2), while again misallocating


resources (mechanism 1).


      We consider a reduction in the revenue of freights going to China,                    rÌi,china ,   by 10%. The left panel of


Figure 8 plots the change in exports, while the right panel collects some statistics. We begin by looking


at China itself. Chinese exports decline by             11%,   even though they are not directly aected by the change


in   rÌi,china :   the entirety of this decline is driven by the transport sector. Indeed, endogenous trade costs


create a complementarity between imports and exports: the high Chinese imports, led to a large number


of ships ending their trip in China and looking for a freight there, which in turn reduced trade costs for


Chinese exporters (mechanism 1).              Therefore, when imports decline, fewer ships end up in China and


Chinese exporters are hurt.


      Next, note that, as China is a large importer that trades with multiple countries, world exports natu-


rally decline. Indeed, China's large trading partners, such as Australia, Indonesia and Brazil, experience


a substantial decline in their exports; total exports decline by 11%. However, in addition to this direct


eect, the optimal reallocation of ships over space dierentially lters the shock in neighboring vs. distant


regions (mechanism 2). Even though distant countries, such as Brazil, also experience a decline in exports,


they benet from the reallocation of ships across space. In particular, prior to the shock, a large fraction of




                                                                 42
the eet was located in the Southeast Pacic region, with ships traveling between China and its neighbors,


mainly Australia and Indonesia. Following the shock, these ships reallocate to other parts of the world,


pushing up exports there all else equal and dampening the overall decline from the direct eect. To see


this, the right panel of Figure 8 shows that if ships were not allowed to optimally adjust their behavior,


the decline in exports for distant countries would have been more than double (e.g.                     Brazilian exports


would have fallen by 21% rather than 9%).                This underscores the importance of being close to a large


net importer like China: exporting countries in that pocket of the world, gained not just by directly


exporting to China, but also indirectly from the increased supply of ships in that region.

8 The Role of Maritime Infrastructure
How much do large maritime infrastructure projects contribute to world trade? We use our estimated setup


to address this question by rst evaluating a future project, the Northwest Passage. We then examine the


impact of four natural and man-made passages: the Panama Canal, the Suez Canal, Gibraltar and the


Malacca Straits.


       The Northwest Passage is a sea route connecting the northern Atlantic and Pacic Oceans through


the Arctic Ocean, along the northern coast of North America. This route is not easily navigable due to

  49
       China's neighbors do not see their exports decline even further, because when Chinese imports decline, ships' outside
options fall everywhere, reducing shipping prices all else equal and dampening the decline in exports (mechanism 3).



                                                              43
Arctic sea ice; with global warming and ice thinning, it is likely that the passage will soon be open for


shipping. The opening of the Northwest passage would reduce the distance between East Coast of North


America and the Far East, as well as Northern Europe and the Far East.

passage. In the right panel, the rst column presents the total eect of the opening, while the second column the
direct eect that does not allow ships to optimally adjust their behavior.




       To simulate the impact of this new route, we reduce the nautical distance between Northeast America


and Northern Europe to and from China/Japan/S.Korea by 30%.
                                                                                    50 The left panel of Figure 9 presents


the resulting change in exports by region, while the right panel collects some statistics.


       Not surprisingly, Northeast America sees its exports increase by 8%, while Northern Europe by 1.2%.


Interestingly, exports from China and Japan/S.Korea are only marginally aected (0.3% for Japan, and


-0.1% for China). On one hand, the import-export complementarity pushes exports up; but on the other


hand ballasting is now less costly for ships: when in China or Japan ships can now ballast to the East


Coast of North America more cheaply.                      The ships' higher outside option tends to increase prices and


decrease exporting (mechanism 3).


       Figure 9 reveals that other countries, not directly aected by the opening of the Northwest Passage,


experience changes in their trade. This illustrates how network eects lead to the propagation of local


shocks (mechanism 2). For instance, Brazil, Northwest America and Australia see their exports fall by


1%, even though none of these countries are directly aected by this passage. Indeed, ships that used to


ballast to these regions now choose to ballast to Northeast America, that experiences a 17% increase in

       We calculate this change in travel distance via the Northwest Passage from Ostreng et al. (2013).

Table 8:   Impact of Panama, Suez, Gibraltar and Malacca on world expots. The real and counterfactual maritime
routes among regions are calculated using the Dijkstra's Algorithm. These are combined with ships' average speed
to compute trip duration with and without the corresponding passage.




   We also quantify the impact of four existing passages (Panama, Suez, Gibraltar, Malacca) by consid-


ering the change in world trade in their absence. These passages reduce nautical distance and thus the


duration of specic trips. Table 8 presents the results. All passages substantially increase world trade.


Removing the Panama Canal leads a decline in world trade of 4%, but up to 32% in the Northeast Amer-


ica. Removing the Suez Canal reduces trade by 3% and up to 26% in the Middle East. Gibraltar seems


to be the most critical one, as removing it would reduce world trade by close to 7% and up to 49% in the


Mediterranean. Finally, removing the Malacca Straits would reduce trade by about almost 2% and up to


11% in Southeast Asia.




9 Conclusion
In this paper we focus on the importance of the transportation sector in world trade. We build a spatial


model where both trade ows and trade costs are equilibrium objects.          Dierent experiments showcase


that the transportation sector unveils a new role for geography through three mechanisms: it misallocates


productive activities, creates network eects and dampens the impact of shocks.           While our empirical


implementation focuses on bulk shipping, similar mechanisms are present in most, if not all, modes of


transportation. We also demonstrate our setup's potential to be used for policy evaluation by considering


the quantitative impact of maritime infrastructure projects, such as the opening of the Northwest Passage.


It is straightforward to use our setup in other counterfactuals, such as taris, trade wars, environmental


regulations and port infrastructure. Finally, embedding our setup within a general equilibrium framework


that endogenizes product prices is an exciting avenue for future research.

Appendix
A Construction of Ship Travel Histories and Searching Ships
Here, we describe the construction of ships' travel histories. The rst task is to identify stops that ships


make using the EE data. A stop is dened as an interval of at least 24 hours, during which (i) the average


speed of the ship is below 5 mph (the sailing speed is between 15 and 20 mph) and, (ii) the ship is located


within 250 miles from the coast. A trip is the travel between two stops.


   The second task is to identify whether a trip is loaded or ballast. To do so, we use the ship's draft:


high draft indicates that a larger portion of the hull is submerged and therefore the ship is loaded. The


distribution of draft for a given vessel is roughly bimodal, since as described in Section 2, a hired ship is


usually fully loaded. Therefore, we can assign a high and a low draft level for each ship and consider


a trip loaded if the draft is high (in practice, the low draft is equal to 70% of the high draft). As not all


satellite signals contain the draft information, we consider a trip ballast (loaded) if we observe a signal


of low (high) draft during the period that the ship is sailing. If we have no draft information during the


sailing time, we consider the draft at adjacent stops. Finally, we exclude stops longer than six weeks, as


such stops may be related to maintenance or repairs.


   The third and nal task is to rene the origin and destination information provided in the Clarksons


contracts.   Although the majority of Clarksons contracts provide some information on the origin and


destination of the trip, this is often vague (e.g. Far East, Japan-S. Korea-Singapore), especially in the


destinations.   We use the EE data to rene the contracted trips' origins and destinations by matching


each Clarksons contract to the identied stop in EE that is closest in time and, when possible, location.


In particular, we use the loading date annotated on each contract to nd a stop in the ship's movement


history that corresponds to the beginning of the contract. For destinations where information in Clarksons


is noisy we search the ship's history for a stop that we can classify as the end of the contract. In particular,


we consider all stops within a three month window (duration of the longest trip) since the beginning of


the contract. Among these stops we eliminate all those that (i) are in the same country in which the ship


loaded the cargo and (ii) are in Panama, South Africa, Gibraltar or at the Suez canal and in which the


draft of arrival is the same as the draft of departure (to exclude cases in which the ship is waiting to pass


through a strait or a canal). To select the end of the contract among the remaining options we consider


the following possibilities:




                                                      46
  1. If the contract reports a destination country and if there are stops in this country, select the rst of


      these stops as the end of the trip;



  2. If the destination country is Japan-S. Korea-Singapore, and if there are stops in either Japan,


      China, Korea, Taiwan or Singapore, we select the rst among these as the end of the trip;



  3. If the contract does not report a destination country and there are stops in which the ship arrives


      full and leaves empty, we select the rst of these as the end of the trip.



We check the performance of the algorithm by comparing the duration of some frequent trips, with


distances found online (at https://sea-distances.org), and nd that durations are well matched.


   Next, we turn to the construction of searching ships                                                                                    st = [st1 , ..., stI ] and matches mt = [mt1 , Â· Â· Â· , mtI ],

where   sit   denotes the number of ships in region                                                    i and week t that are available to transport a cargo and mit

the realized matches in region              i and week t.                                      To construct                                      sit           we consider all ships that ended a trip (loaded


or ballast) in region    i   and week            t â 1.                   We exclude the rst week post arrival in the region to account for


loading/unloading times (on average (un)loading takes 3-4 days but the variance is large; removing one


week will tend to underestimate port wait times). To construct                                                                                                                  mit ,                we consider the number of ships that


began a loaded trip from region                  i      in week                         t.

Table 9:       Regression of shipping prices on shipowner characteristcs and xed eects.          Shipping prices, ships'
characteristics (age and size), and the identity of the shipowner are obtained from Clarksons.            Information on
shipowner characteristics is obtained from ORBIS. In particular, we match the shipowners in Clarksons to ORBIS;
we do so for two reasons: (i) ORBIS allows us to have reliable rm identities, as shipowners may appear under
dierent names in the contract data; (ii) ORBIS reports additional rm characteristics (e.g. number of employees,
revenue, headquarters). Here we identify the shipowner with the global ultimate owner (GUO); results are robust
to controlling for the identity of the domestic owner (DUO) and the shipowner as reported in Clarksons. Finally,
the data used span the period 2010-2016.




C Proof of Proposition 1
We rst derive equations (12) and (13). Consider the model's state transitions. Exporters in region                   i   at


time   t   transition as follows:

                                                                                     e

                                                                                                 X

In words, out of        sit    ships,   mit    ships get matched and leave                  i,   while out of the ships that did not nd a


match, fraction        Pii    chooses to remain at              i   rather than ballast away; moreover, out of the ships traveling


towards    i,   fraction      dji   arrive. Finally, ships that are traveling from                       i   to   j , sijt    evolve as follows:



                                                                                                           Pije

                                                                                                         1 â Pi0

In words, fraction            dij   of the traveling ships arrive, fraction                      Pij     of ships that remained unmatched in


location   i    chose to ballast to       j    and nally,          Pije / (1 â Pi0
                                                                                  e)   of ships matched in                i   depart loaded to     j.

     Suppose      sijt ,eit   approach     sij ,ei   as    t â â.       Then (19) becomes:



                                                                                             X

while for ships traveling from             j   to    i,   (20) becomes:

where   mi = mi (si , ei ).         Summing this with respect to                   j 6= i   we obtain:

and replacing in (21) we get (12).


     Equation (13) is a direct consequence of (18).


     The steady state equations (12) and (13) have a xed point over a properly dened subset of                                                    R2I ,   by


the Leray-Schauder-Tychono theorem (Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis, 2015) which states that if                                                    X     is a non-


empty, convex and compact subset of                       R2I   and     h:XâX           is continuous, then               h    has a xed point. Indeed,

Since our model features a number of inter-related value functions (V, U ), it does not fall strictly into the


standard Bellman formulation. Hence, we provide Lemma 2, which proves that our problem is characterized


by a contraction map and thus the value functions are well dened.

       In brief, our estimation algorithm proceeds in the following steps:



   1. Guess an initial set of parameters                         {csij , cw

                       1âÎ²(1âdij ) . The Hotz and Miller (1993) inversion states:

Substituting from (2)-(3) we obtain:

      It also holds that (see Kalouptsidi et al., 2016):



                                                              Vij   Ui

                                                               Ï    Ï

or:
