                                           ABSTRACT

We assess the impact of the geographic expansion of bank assets on the cost of banks’ interest-
bearing liabilities. Existing research suggests that expansion can both intensify agency problems
that increase funding costs and facilitate risk diversification that decreases funding costs. Using a
newly developed identification strategy, we discover that the geographic expansion of banks
across U.S. states lowered their funding costs, especially when banks are headquartered in states
with lower macroeconomic covariance with the overall U.S. economy. The results are consistent
with the view that geographic expansion offers large risk diversification opportunities that reduce
funding costs.

1. Introduction
       Does the geographic expansion of a bank’s assets affect its funding costs? Several models

detail how expansion can reduce funding costs. If geographic expansion adds assets to a bank’s

portfolio that are imperfectly correlated with existing assets, this can reduce bank risk and lower

its funding costs, as emphasized by Diamond (1984) and Boyd and Prescott (1986). Similarly, if

a bank expands into geographic areas where the economies are imperfectly correlated with the

bank’s existing local economy, this will enhance the bank’s ability to use its internal capital

market to respond effectively to local liquidity or asset-quality shocks (e.g., Houston, James, and

Marcus, 1997, Houston and James, 1998, Gatev, Schuermann, and Strahan, 2009, and Cornett et

al., 2011). Other models explain how geographic expansion can increase funding costs. For

example, the agency-based models of Jensen (1986), Jensen and Meckling (1976), and

Scharfstein and Stein (2000) suggest that if geographic dispersion creates barriers to shareholders

and creditors governing banks, then bank insiders can more easily extract private rents, which

reduce bank valuations and boost funding costs. Similarly, Brickley, Linck, and Smith (2003)

and Berger et al. (2005) stress that distance can hinder the ability of a bank’s headquarters to

monitor its subsidiaries, which can have detrimental effects on efficiency, asset quality, and

funding costs.

       In this paper, we evaluate the impact of geographic expansion on the cost of a bank’s

interest-bearing liabilities. This is important for at least two reasons. From a policy perspective,

many regulations, laws, taxes, and other policies limit the geographic expansion of banks. In

assessing the impact of these policies on the efficiency of financial intermediation, it is critical to

evaluate how they shape a bank’s funding costs—and interest-bearing liabilities account for

about 95% of banking system liabilities. Second, existing empirical work provides valuable, but

conflicting, insights into some of the mechanisms through which geographic expansion might

shape funding costs. Consistent with the predictions of agency-based models, Goetz, Laeven, and

Levine (2013) find that geographic expansion increases lending to bank executives and reduces
                                                                                                                 2




bank valuations, putting upward pressure on funding costs. In contrast, when banks diversify

geographically, risk tends to fall (e.g., Calomiris, 2000 and Goetz, Laeven, and Levine, 2016)

and banks become more effective at responding to local economic shocks (Cortes and Strahan,

2016), putting downward pressure on funding costs. 1 What is missing, however, is an assessment

of how geographic expansion influences overall funding costs.

        We estimate the effect of the geographic expansion of bank holding company (BHC)

assets across the U.S. states on the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. To measure funding costs,

we use the implicit interest rate on a bank’s interest-bearing liabilities, i.e., total interest expenses

divided by interest-bearing liabilities (Demirgüç-Kunt and Huizinga, 2004). To measure the

geographic expansion of a BHC’s assets, we use the cross-state distribution of its subsidiaries

and weight each subsidiary by its share of assets in the BHC. To identify the causal effect of

geographic expansion on funding costs, we follow the Goetz, Laeven, and Levine (2013)

procedure for constructing an instrumental variable for geographic expansion.

        Specifically, we implement a two-step procedure for constructing an instrumental

variable for BHCs’ geographic expansion. First, we exploit the dynamic process of interstate

bank deregulation across the U.S. states from 1982 through 1995. Starting in 1982, individual

states removed restrictions on BHCs headquartered in “foreign” states from establishing

subsidiaries within the deregulating state’s borders. Not only did states start the process of

interstate bank deregulation in different years, they also followed very different dynamic paths as

states signed bilateral and multilateral reciprocal agreements in a fairly chaotic process over

many years. Thus, there is substantial cross-state heterogeneity in the start and dynamics of

interstate bank deregulation. The passage of the Riegle-Neal Act in 1994 eliminated all

remaining restrictions on interstate banking starting in 1995. An extensive body of research

provides evidence that interstate bank deregulation is exogenous to state economic conditions

Ryngaert (2001), who examine the impact of bank mergers on valuations.
                                                                                                         3




(e.g., Kroszner and Strahan, 1999, Morgan, Rime and Strahan, 2004, and Beck, Levine and

Levkov, 2010) as well as to banking system profitability, valuations, and risk (Jayaratne and

Strahan, 1998, Goetz, Levine, and Levine, 2013, 2016). This first step yields year-by-year

information on whether BHCs headquartered in one state can establish subsidiaries in each

foreign state. This first step, however, does not differentiate among BHCs headquartered within

the same state; that is, it does not provide information on why some BHCs in a state expand into

foreign states and others do not.

        The second step in constructing an instrument for geographic expansion uses the gravity

model to distinguish among BHCs within the same state. 2 The gravity model predicts that the

costs of conducting economic transactions, including the costs of establishing bank subsidiaries,

vary positively with distance. Thus, the gravity model predicts that when state j allows BHCs

from state i to establish subsidiaries within j’s borders, BHCs headquartered in state i that are

closer to state j will face lower costs to expanding into j. Since the physical locations of the

headquarters of BHCs were pre-determined before the period of interstate bank deregulation, we

exploit this as an exogenous source of variation in how interstate bank deregulation differentially

affects BHCs in a state. Indeed, only 2% of BHCs change the state in which they are

headquartered during our sample period and the results are robust to including or excluding them.
Specifically, we calculate the aerial distance between the headquarters of each BHC and the

capital of each foreign state and use this distance to differentiate among BHCs headquartered in

the same state. Based on these distances, we use the gravity model to estimate each BHC’s cross-

state asset holdings in foreign subsidiaries.

        The integration of the gravity model of BHC investment with the dynamic process of

interstate bank deregulation yields a time-varying, BHC-specific instrumental variable of the

cross-state dispersion of each BHC’s assets. Specifically, we (1) project the share of each BHC’s


2
 The gravity model has been heavily used in international economics, as exemplified by Tinbergen (1962) and
Helpman, Melitz, and Rubinstein (2008).
                                                                                                  4




holdings of assets in subsidiaries in each foreign state j using the gravity model and (2) impose a

value of zero when interstate bank regulations prohibit a BHC from establishing a subsidiary in

state j. Thus, we use these exogenous sources of variation to project the cross-state holdings of

assets for each BHC in each period and then compute the projected Herfindahl index of cross-

state asset holdings. We use this as the instrument for a BHC’s actual dispersion of assets and

evaluate the impact of the geographic expansion on the costs of interest-bearing liabilities.

       With respect to the validity of our identification strategy in general and the instrumental

variable in particular, we emphasize five points. First, we find that it is strongly correlated with

the actual cross-state dispersion of a BHC’s assets. That is, the F-test on the instrument in the

first-stage regression is above 25, indicating that we do not have a weak instrument problem.

Second, in terms of the exclusion restriction, it is valuable to first note that the instrument is

constructed from two plausibly exogenous sources of variation: the dynamic process of interstate

bank deregulation and pre-determined geographic distance. Third, since the instrumental variable

differentiates among BHCs within each state and time period, we address a key concern with

using interstate bank deregulation to identify the impact of geographic expansion on funding

costs: perhaps, some other factor besides geographic expansion is systematically changing when

state j allows BHCs from state i to enter and it is this other factor that affects funding costs

across BHCs in state i. We address this concern by including state-time fixed effects to control

for all time-varying state influences on funding costs. In this way, identification comes from

comparing the differential impact of interstate bank deregulation on BHCs in the same state.

Fourth, we address concerns that other BHC-specific factors simultaneously account for both

their cross-state dispersion of assets and their funding costs by (1) including BHC-fixed effects

to control for all time-invariant BHC traits and (2) controlling for time-varying BHC

characteristics such as the competitiveness of the banking market in which a BHC is

headquartered, as well as BHC size, capital-asset ratio, and profitability. Fifth, we evaluate the

particular theoretical prediction that geographic expansion reduces funding costs by allowing
                                                                                                   5




banks to hold a more diversified portfolio of assets and to manage local economic shocks more

effectively. This evaluation both provides information on one potential mechanism linking

geographic expansion and funding costs and reduces concerns that the instrument violates the

exclusion restriction because our evaluation further differentiates BHCs by the economic

comovement between the aggregate U.S. economy and the economy of the state in which the

BHC has its headquarters.

       The instrumental variable results indicate that geographic diversification materially

lowered BHC funding costs. Geographic diversification enters the funding cost regression

negatively and statistically significantly at the one percent level, and this result holds when using

different measures of the cost of interest-bearing liabilities as the dependent variable and

different control variables. The results are also robust to conducting the analyses over (a)

subsamples of BHCs, such as BHCs with more than $500 million in total assets or those that

generate more than 2/3rd of their total revenues from interest-bearing assets, and (b) different
time periods. Furthermore, we show that it is crucial to use instrumental variables to identify the

impact of the cross-state dispersion of BHC assets on funding costs. When using ordinary least

squares (OLS), we find a positive association between diversification and funding costs, which

might reflect reverse causality: BHCs with higher funding costs expand to other states in search
of lower funding costs, so that OLS yields an upwardly biased coefficient estimate on geographic

diversification. When employing our instrumental variable, however, we find strong, robust

results that an increase in the cross-state dispersion of assets lowers funding costs. Moreover, the

estimated impact is economically large. For example, the estimates imply that a one standard

deviation increase in the cross-state dispersion of a BHC’s assets will reduce the total interest

expense ratio by 13.6% in our sample.

       We also examine whether geographic expansion reduces funding costs by allowing banks

to diversify away idiosyncratic risk and better manage localized economic shocks. Specifically,

if geographic diversification reduces funding costs by lowering risk, then its impact on funding
                                                                                                   6




costs should be greater when BHCs expand into states that offer greater risk diversification

opportunities. We evaluate this prediction by testing whether the cost-reducing effects of

geographic diversification are greater when BHCs are located in states with economies that have

lower correlations with the U.S. economy. We use the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s

Coincident index to capture the degree to which each state’s economy is correlated with the

overall U.S. economy.

       The results indicate that geographic expansion reduces BHC funding costs more when the

BHC is headquartered in a state that has an economy with a lower correlation with the overall

U.S. economy. This is consistent with the risk-reducing view of how geographic diversification

lowers funding costs. Furthermore, the estimated impact is large. The estimates suggest that the

cost-reducing effect of a BHC that expands from a home state that is perfectly negatively

correlated with the U.S. economy into an average state is more than twice as large as that of a

similar BHC headquartered in a state that is perfectly correlated with the U.S. economy that

expands into the same state. The results in this paper highlight a material cost of restricting banks

from using geographic expansion to diversify their risks.
       The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the data and the process of

interstate banking deregulation. Section 3 provides ordinary least squares results on the relation

between funding costs and geographic diversification. Section 4 describes the construction of the

instrumental variable for geographic diversification, presents the instrumental variable results,

and assesses the validity of the instrument. Section 5 conducts additional tests on the

mechanisms linking geographic diversity and funding costs, and section 6 concludes.



2. Data and interstate bank deregulation

2.1 BHC and bank subsidiary data sources

       We use financial and structural information on BHCs and their chartered subsidiary

banks to assess the impact of geographic expansion on a BHC’s funding costs. For each domestic
                                                                                                7




U.S. BHC, the Federal Reserve collects detailed information on consolidated balance sheets,

income statements, and detailed supporting information from the FR Y-9C reports. The data is

publicly available on a quarterly basis since June 1986. Individual banking institutions regulated

by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve, or the Office of the

Comptroller of the Currency also file Reports of Condition and Income (“Call Reports”) that

provide financial statements for each banking institution in each quarter. The Call Reports also

provide ownership information, so that we can link each bank subsidiary to its parent BHC. In

particular, each BHC is considered the parent of a bank subsidiary if it holds at least a 50%

ownership stake in the subsidiary. We focus on the ultimate parent holding company, and thus

eliminate those that are owned by other financial institutions. Furthermore, the Call Reports give

the location of each banking institution. In this way, we can measure a BHC’s geographic

dispersion of assets across states via its bank subsidiaries.

       Our initial sample includes all BHCs in the Y-9C reports from the third quarter of 1986

through the last quarter of 2007 operating within the 48 contiguous states and the District of

Columbia (excluding BHCs headquartered in Alaska and Hawaii). We then eliminate BHCs

located in the states of Delaware and South Dakota since the two states changed their laws to

encourage the entry of credit card banks shortly before removing branching restrictions. We

further drop BHCs that change the location of their headquarters from one state to another during

the sample period. This reduces the number of BHCs by about 2%, though the results hold when

including them. Our final sample contains 111,545 BHC-quarter observations on 3,758 public

and private BHCs over the period 1986 – 2007.



2.2 Geographic diversity

       We measure a BHC’s geographic diversity as the cross-state dispersion of its bank

subsidiaries, where each subsidiary is weighted by the book value of its assets. Specifically, 1-

Herfindahl index of assets across states equals one minus the Herfindahl-Hirschman index of a
                                                                                                 8




BHC’s assets in subsidiaries located in other states besides the state in which the BHC has its

headquarters. Thus, a higher value indicates a more dispersed distribution of assets across states.

We construct this measure for each BHC in each quarter.



2.3 Funding costs and other BHC traits

       We construct two measures of BHC funding costs. First, Total cost of funds equals a

BHC’s total interest expense during a quarter divided by interest-bearing liabilities at the

beginning of the quarter. As argued by Demirgüç-Kunt and Huizinga (2004), Total cost of funds

is an implicit interest rate on BHC liabilities, which is inferred from its financial statements.

While Total cost of funds measures the overall cost of a BHC’s debts, it can differ across banks

and time due to differences in interest rates or in the maturity and structure of a BHC’s debt. We

therefore construct a second funding cost measure that focuses only on deposits. Following Gilje,

Loutskina, and Strahan (2016), we measure the cost of deposits as a BHC’s interest expense on

domestic deposits during a quarter divided by the stock of domestic deposits at the beginning of

the quarter (Cost of domestic deposits). Table 1 provides summary statistics for the funding cost

measures. The Total cost of funds and Cost of domestic deposits both range from about 0.3% to

2%, with a mean value of 1.1%. Since banks are highly levered, these non-equity funding costs

capture the bulk of funding expenses for BHCs.

       In assessing the impact of diversification on funding costs, we control for several time-

varying bank characteristics. Since funding costs might differ between large and small banks and

between those with greater or smaller leverage, we include Total assets, which equals the book

value of total assets in billions of US dollars, and the Capital-asset ratio, which equals the book

value of BHC equity divided by total assets. To account for differences in BHC profitability, we

control for Return on assets, which equals net income divided by the book value of total assets.

All bank-specific controls are measured at the beginning of a quarter. Furthermore, since

research suggests that market competition affects bank risk (e.g., Boyd and De Nicolo, 2005), we
                                                                                                               9




control for the competitive pressures facing each BHC by using a measure of the concentration

of banks in each Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). In particular, Market concentration (MSA)

equals the Herfindahl-Hirschman index of banking assets in each MSA in each quarter. 3

Appendix Table A1 describes detailed variable definitions and Table 1 reports summary statistics.



2.4 The dynamic process of interstate bank deregulation

        For much of the 20th century, U.S. states prohibited banks headquartered in other states

from establishing subsidiaries (or branches) within their borders. As shown by Jayaratne and

Strahan (1998), these regulatory restrictions protected banks from “foreign” competition and

allowed banks to earn monopolistic rents, which created a powerful constituency for maintaining

restrictions on interstate banking. Kroszner and Strahan (1999) explain that a series of

technological innovations that started in the 1970s reduced the rents associated with these

regulatory restrictions as automatic teller machines, banking by phone, and improvements in

credit scoring models made it easier for banks to attract customers from states where they had no

subsidiaries or branches. These innovations triggered a process of interstate bank deregulation

that allowed BHCs to expand across state borders.

        From 1982 through 1995, states removed restrictions on interstate banking using three

types of deregulation: (1) national nonreciprocal means the deregulating state unilaterally

allowed entry of banks from all other states; (2) national reciprocal means the deregulating

allowed entry of banks from reciprocating states, i.e., states that also allowed banks from the

deregulating state to enter; and (3) regional reciprocal means the deregulating state signed

bilateral or multilateral reciprocal agreements with specific states that also allowed entry of

banks from those states. For instance, Maine was the first state to relax its interstate banking
3
  In our sample, about 13% of BHCs are not headquartered in an MSA, which typically means they are
headquartered in a rural area. For these non-MSA BHCs, we set Market concentration (MSA) equal to one,
indicating a highly concentrated banking market. To account for potential problems associated with differences in
competition between MSA and non-MSA counties, we construct an MSA indicator that equals one when a BHC is
headquartered in an MSA, and zero otherwise. Although not reported in the tables, when we control for Market
concentration (MSA), we always simultaneously include the MSA indicator.
                                                                                                 10




restrictions by enacting a national reciprocal policy in 1978, but no state reciprocated until 1982

when New York adopted a similar nationwide reciprocal agreement and Alaska implemented a

national nonreciprocal policy. Over the next 12 years, states started the process of interstate

banks deregulation in different years and followed different patterns of deregulation over those

years. The Riegle-Neal Act of 1994 repealed all remaining regulations restricting BHCs

headquartered in one state from acquiring banks in other states (starting in 1995).

       There is enormous heterogeneity both in terms of when states started removing

impediments to interstate banking and in terms of the dynamic process that each state followed

in lowering those barriers. For each state and year, Goetz, Laeven, and Levine (2013) provide

information on the foreign states into which a state’s BHCs were allowed to open subsidiary

banks based on information from each state’s bank regulatory authority. Figure 1 shows the

dynamic process of interstate banking deregulation over the period from 1982 through 1994. In

particular, each bar represents the cumulative percentage of state pairs in which one state is

allowed to enter the other one. As shown, less than 10% of state-pair deregulations happened

before 1986, which is the first year of our sample period. By 1994, 71% of the state pairs allow

interstate banking, and the Riegle-Neal Act allowed interstate banking for all state pairs in 1995.



3. Geographic diversity and BHC funding costs: OLS regression results

We first use ordinary least square (OLS) regressions to estimate the association between BHC

funding costs and geographic diversity. The model specification is as follows.



Ln(𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 𝑜𝑜 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓)𝑏𝑏𝑏 = 𝛽(1 − 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻ℎ𝑙 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑜𝑜 𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠)𝑏𝑏 +

                              + 𝜃𝜃′𝑏𝑏𝑏 + 𝛿𝑏 + 𝛿𝑠𝑠 + 𝜀𝑏𝑏𝑏 ,                                      (1)



where the dependent variable, 𝐿𝐿(𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 𝑜𝑜 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓)𝑏𝑏𝑏 , represents either the natural logarithm of

the Total cost of funds or the natural logarithm of the Cost of domestic deposits for BHC b
                                                                                                  11




headquartered     in       state   s   in   quarter    t.   The     key    explanatory      variable,

1 − 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻ℎ𝑙 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑜𝑜 𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑏𝑏 , denotes the extent to which a holding

company b diversifies its banking subsidiaries assets across states over quarter t, as measured by

1-Herfindahl index of assets across states. 𝑋′𝑏𝑏𝑏 is a vector of time-varying characteristics for

BHC b, headquartered in state s, at the beginning of the quarter t: Total assets, Capital-asset

ratio, and Return on assets. These controls account for differences in bank size, leverage, and

profitability, respectively. We also include Market concentration (MSA) to account for time-

varying differences in the concentration of banking assets within the MSA of BHC b’s

headquarters. 𝜃 is a vector of coefficients on these BHC characteristics. We also include (1)

BHC fixed effects, 𝛿𝑏 , to account for all time invariant BHC-specific factors and (2) state-quarter

fixed effects, 𝛿𝑠𝑠 , to control for all time-varying state-specific factors, such as economic

conditions, tax policies, and regulations. Thus, the estimated coefficient, 𝛽 , indicates the

economic relation between changes in a BHC’s cost of funds and changes in its geographic

dispersion of assets after controlling for this large set of conditioning variables. Following Goetz,

Laeven, and Levine (2013), the standard errors are heteroskedasticity-robust and clustered at the

state and quarter level.

       As shown in Table 2, the OLS estimates indicate a positive relation between a BHC’s

cost of funds and its diversity of assets in subsidiaries across states. The geographic diversity

measure, 1-Herfindahl index of assets across states, enters positively and significantly when the

dependent variable is either Ln(Total cost of funds) in columns (1) – (2) or Ln(Cost of domestic

deposits) in columns (3) – (4). The results hold when conditioning on quarter and BHC fixed

effects or when controlling for BHC and state-quarter fixed effects.

       Identification concerns, however, complicate the interpretation of these OLS estimates.

First, a BHC’s funding costs might influence its decision to expand into other states. For

example, BHCs with higher funding costs might be especially motivated to establish subsidiaries

in a foreign state where funds are cheaper. Under these conditions, even if geographic expansion
                                                                                                 12




reduces the cost of funds, OLS will yield an upwardly biased coefficient estimate on 1-

Herfindahl index of assets across states. Second, while equation (1) includes an array of BHC

controls and fixed effects, omitted variables might drive both the geographic diversification of

BHC assets and its funding costs. We address these endogeneity concerns by employing an

instrumental variables approach.



4. Geographic diversification and BHCs funding cost: Instrumental variable results

In this section, we (1) describe the construction of our instrumental variable for the cross-state

diversity of BHC assets, (2) present the instrumental variable results on the impact of geographic

diversity on funding costs, and (3) analyze the validity of our identification strategy.



4.1. Identification strategy: Constructing gravity-deregulation instrumental variable

       4.1.1 Framework

       To describe the construction of the instrumental variable, we begin with an overview and

then give the details. We develop this instrument by integrating (1) the dynamic, state-specific

process of interstate bank deregulation with (2) the gravity model of investment. As explained

above, interstate bank deregulation evolved in a rather chaotic manner from 1982 through 1995,

where states started removing regulatory restrictions on interstate banking in different years and

then followed different dynamic paths of implementing regional reciprocal, national reciprocal,

and national nonreciprocal deregulations with other states. This process of interstate bank

deregulation provides state-year information on whether BHCs in one state can establish

subsidiaries in each other state. This process of interstate bank deregulation, however, does not

differentiate among BHCs within the same state, which is crucial for identifying the impact of

the cross-state diversification of a BHC’s assets on its funding costs.

       To differentiate among BHCs within the same state, we use the gravity model of

investment. Specifically, an extensive literature finds that the cost of investing varies positively
                                                                                                 13




with geographic distance. Applied to banks, the gravity model predicts that it will be less

expensive for BHCs to expand into geographically closer markets. Indeed, for the case of banks

across the U.S. states, Goetz, Laeven, and Levine (2013) show that BHCs headquartered in a

state that have their headquarters geographically closer to another state than other BHCs in the

same state are more likely to expand into that state. For example, they show that a BHC in the

southern part of California will tend to have a larger share of assets in Phoenix, Arizona than in

Portland, Oregon and a BHC headquartered in northern California will tend to have a larger

share of assets in Portland. Thus, we construct a time-varying, BHC-specific instrumental

variable for the cross-state diversity of BHC assets by integrating the interstate bank deregulation

with the gravity model of investment, where interstate bank deregulation provides state-year

information on the states into which BHCs in a state can expand and the gravity model

distinguishes among BHCs within each state.



       4.1.2 The two-step process for constructing the gravity-deregulation instrument

       Following Goetz, Laeven, and Levine (2013, 2016), we use a two-step process for

constructing an instrument for the geographic diversity of BHC assets. In the first step (“zero

stage”), we estimate the following gravity model.



 𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 = 𝛼𝐿𝐿(𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑏𝑏𝑏 ) + 𝛽𝛽𝛽�𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 ⁄𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗 � + 𝛿𝑡 + 𝛿𝑖 + 𝛿𝑗 + 𝛿𝑖𝑖 + 𝛿𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 , (2)



where the dependent variable, 𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 , is the share of assets a BHC b headquartered in state i

holds through its subsidiaries in a foreign state j over quarter t. 𝐿𝐿(𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑏𝑏𝑏 ) denotes the

natural logarithm of geographic distance between the BHC b’s headquarters and the capital city

of state j (in miles). 𝐿𝑛�𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 ⁄𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗 � equals the natural logarithm of the ratio of the total

population of BHC b’s home state i to the total population of the foreign state j in quarter t,

where U.S. Census Bureau provides population data. We include the population ratio in the
                                                                                                     14




gravity model to account for the possibility that BHCs expand into comparatively large markets.

To assess the independent link between the geographic diversity of a BHC’s assets and distance,

we consider regression specifications that control for (a) quarter fixed effects, 𝛿𝑡 , to condition

out all quarter-specific influences, (b) a BHC’s home state fixed effects, 𝛿𝑖 , to control for all

time-invariant features of the BHC’s home state, (c) fixed effects for each other state, 𝛿𝑗 , or (d)

state-pair fixed effects, 𝛿𝑖𝑖 , to condition out all time-invariant features of each state pair. We also

consider a specification that controls for state-pair-quarter fixed effects, 𝛿𝑖𝑖𝑖 , to condition out all

time-varying features of each state-pair.

           In this first step estimation of the impact of distance and population ratios on the share of

assets that BHCs hold in different states, we proceed as follows. We only include observations in

which it is legally feasible for BHC b headquartered in state i to open subsidiaries in a “foreign”

state j during quarter t. To accommodate the quarterly frequency of BHC data, we assume that

deregulation occurs during the last quarter of the year in which state j relaxed its entry

restrictions with state i, i.e., when BHCs headquartered in state i are allowed to open subsidiaries

in state j.4 We provide estimates using both a fractional logit model and OLS. We employ the

fractional logit model since (a) the dependent variable is bounded between zero and one, (b)

many observations have a value of zero, and (c) the fractional logit ensures that the projected

shares are bounded between zero and one. In some cases, we use OLS instead of a fractional

logit model because the fractional logit model would not converge when we control for a large

number of fixed effects. As shown below, the OLS results are consistent with those from the

fractional logit model when we can use both estimation methods. We use the fractional logit

model when constructing the instrumental variable so that we do not have projected share values

less than zero.

           Table 3 reports the estimation results from this zero-stage regression and shows that

geographic distance is negatively associated with the share of a BHC’s assets in a foreign state.

4
    The results hold when assuming that deregulation occurs in the first quarter of the year.
                                                                                                                     15




As shown in columns (1) and (2), the average marginal effect of Ln(Distance) on the share of a

BHC’s assets in foreign states enters negatively and statistically significant at the 1% level,

suggesting that BHCs tend to invest more in closer states. Moreover, there is a significant

negative relation between a BHC’s investment and the relative size of its home state banking

market to the foreign banking market, indicating that a BHC is more likely to diversify into a

comparatively large market. The estimates hold when adding quarter fixed effects in column (3)

or when using OLS, as shown in columns (4) and (5). Moreover, we continue to find that both

distance and population remain significantly related to a BHC’s investments in foreign states

when controlling for home state fixed effects and foreign state fixed effects, or when including

state-pair fixed effects or state-pair-quarter fixed effects, as shown in columns (6) – (9),

respectively. When including state-pair fixed effects, the regression controls for the distance

between the two states. Thus, it shows that the differential distance between two BHCs

headquartered in state i and state j shapes their holdings of bank assets in state j. Specifically,

BHCs headquartered in state i that are physically closer to state j tend to have subsidiaries with

larger asset holding in state j than BHCs headquartered in state i but are physically farther away

from state j.

         In the second step of the construction of the gravity-deregulation instrument, we use the

coefficient estimates from Table 3 to project, for each BHC in each quarter, its dispersion of

assets in subsidiaries across all states. Specifically, we use the coefficient estimates from column

(2) in Table 3 to predict a BHC’s asset share in each state in each period. 5 We impose a predicted

value of zero for states in which the BHC is prohibited from establishing a subsidiary. Based on

these projected shares, we compute the projected diversity measure, 1 - Herfindahl index of

assets across states (predicted), for each BHC in each quarter. This projected diversity measure

serves as the time-varying, BHC-specific instrumental variable for a BHC’s actual degree of

5
 We do not include quarter, home state, foreign state, state-pair, or state-pair-quarter fixed effects in the projection
because including them in the construction of the instrument can lead to biased estimates in the two-stage least
squares regressions, as explained in Goetz, Laeven, and Levine, 2013, 2016).
                                                                                                    16




diversification. We show below that the results are robust to using the Table 3 estimates from

column (1) that are only based on distance, instead of those from column (2) that are based on

distance and relative population, to construct the instrumental variable. This alternative

instrument, 1 - Herfindahl index of assets across states (predicted Distance only), yields very

similar findings.

       Several checks advertise the validity of the gravity-deregulation instrumental variable.

With respect to the correlation between the instrument and 1-Herfindahl index of assets across

states, the instrument is “strong.” As shown in the first-stage regression results reported in Panel

B of Table 4, the F-statistic of the null hypothesis that the instrument is irrelevant is above 25.

With respect to the exclusion restriction, we first note that the instrument is explicitly

constructed from two plausibly exogenous sources of variation in the ability and cost of a BHC

establishing subsidiaries in other states: interstate bank regulations and geographic distance.

Furthermore, although our instrumental variable specification is exactly identified, so that we

cannot employ a test of the over-identifying restrictions, we can provide evidence on specific

concerns. One concern is that some other characteristic of state j systematically changes when

another state, state i, deregulates and allows state j’s BHCs to enter state i and this other factor

affects BHC funding costs. However, by using a time-varying, BHC-specific instrumental

variable that distinguishes among BHCs within each state and period, we can include state-time

fixed effects to condition out the potentially confounding influences of such state-time

characteristics. A second concern is that particular characteristics of a BHC, beyond its distance

to other states, account for its cross-state expansion and funding costs. These characteristics

could include the culture of the BHC, its size, fragility, profitability, or the structure of the local

banking market. However, we include BHC-fixed effects to control for all time-invariant BHC
                                                                                                         17




traits and control for BHC size, capital ratio, profitability, and bank concentration at the MSA-

level to condition out these time-varying factors. 6



4.2 IV results

        The instrument variable results indicate that geographic diversity reduces BHC funding

costs. As reported in Panel A of Table 4, geographic diversity, 1-Herfindahl index of assets

across states, enters the funding cost regressions negatively and significantly at the 1% level.

The results hold when examining either Ln(Total cost of funds) in columns (1) and (2), or

Ln(Cost of domestic deposits) in columns (3) and (4). The results are also robust to controlling

for time-varying characteristics (bank size, leverage, profitability, and market concentration),

BHC fixed effects, and state-quarter fixed effects. Moreover, the results are robust to using a

different zero-stage estimation to construct the instrument. In particular, we use the coefficient

estimates from column (1) in Table 3, where only Ln(Distance) is included while Ln(Population

ratio) is excluded, to construct a different instrument, 1-Herfindahl index of assets across states

(predicted Distance only). All the results in Table 4 remain highly robust to this alternative

instrument. The corresponding robustness tests are reported in Appendix Table A2.

        The estimated impact of diversity on funding costs is economically large. One way to

illustrate the economic size of the relationship is to consider a one standard deviation increase in

geographic diversity. The coefficient estimate in column (2) indicates that a one standard

deviation increase in 1-Herfindahl index of assets across states (0.096) reduces Total cost of

funds by 13.6% (=0.096 * 1.419), corresponding to 15 basis points given that the sample mean of

Total cost of funds equals 1.1 percentage points. The estimated impact of geographic diversity on

Cost of domestic deposit is similar in magnitude. A second way to illustrate the economic size of

the estimated impact of geographic diversity on funding costs is to consider the case of


6
 Furthermore, as noted in the Introduction, many papers show that economic conditions in general and banking
conditions in particular do not predict the timing of interstate bank deregulation.
                                                                                                   18




California. If the state of California changes from a situation in which its BHCs are not allowed

to open subsidiaries in any other states to a situation in which its BHCs can diversify into all

other states, then the estimates from column (2) indicate that funding costs for BHCs

headquartered in California will drop by about 58% (=1.419*0.410). Although this is not a

marginal change, it illustrates large estimated impact of geographic diversity on funding costs.

Given that total interest expenses across all California BHCs in 1987 was $13.5 billion, holding

other factors constant, the estimated effect implies a drop of over $7.8 billion in funding

expenses per year.

       Panel C of Table 4 demonstrates that the reduced form estimates are consistent with the

IV results. It reports the reduced-form estimates of BHC funding costs on the gravity-

deregulation instrument variable 1-Herfindahl index of assets across states (predicted), while

controlling for BHC and state-quarter fixed effects, market competition (Market concentration

(MSA)), and the time-varying BHC traits (bank size, capital-asset ratio, and return on assets). The

results show that the projected degree of diversity from the gravity-deregulation model is

negatively associated with the cost of raising interest-bearing liabilities. Consistent with classical

discussions on the differences between the “intent to treat” effects (reduced form results) and the

“treatment” effects (IV results), the estimated coefficients from the reduced from regressions are

smaller in absolute value terms than those from the IV regressions.

       The differences between the OLS results in Table 2 and the IV results in Table 4

advertise the importance of using instrumental variables to evaluate the impact of the geographic

diversity of BHC assets on funding costs. The differences between the OLS and IV results are

consistent with the view that BHCs with higher funding costs are more likely to diversify their

subsidiaries across states, potentially in search of lower funding costs, confounding the ability to

identify the impact of the geographic diversity of BHC assets on funding costs using OLS. When

using the gravity-deregulation instrumental variable to extract the exogenous component of
                                                                                                           19




geographic diversity, we find that an increase in a BHC’s cross-state diversity of asset holdings

materially lowers its funding costs.

           These IV results are robust to three additional sensitivity checks, as shown in Table 5.

First, since the full implementation of the Riegle-Neal Act, including the relaxation of interstate

branching restrictions, was completed in 1997, we redid the analyses over the 1986 through 1997

period. As shown in Panel A, although the number of observations falls by almost half, the

coefficient estimates on 1-Herfindahl index of assets across states remain statistically and

economically significant using this alternative sample period. Second, to account for the

possibility that relatively large banks are more likely to expand geographically, we redid the

analyses with a subsample of BHCs with total assets above $500 million (in Panel B). Third, to

account for potential differences in the product mixes of BHCs, we redid the analyses with a

subsample of BHCs that earn a minimum of 2/3rd of their total revenues in the form of interest
income (in Panel C, columns (3) and (4)). As a further check on the potential role of different

product mixes, we include an additional control variable to account for differences in the

structure of BHC earnings. In particular, we control for Noninterest income, which equals one

minus the absolute difference between net interest income and total noninterest income divided

by total operating income, in Panel C (columns (1) and (2)). 7 As shown, the results are highly
robust to these three tests.


5. Mechanisms: Risk diversification

           If the cross-state diversification of a BHC’s assets reduces funding costs by lowering risk,

then the impact of geographic diversification on funding costs should be greater when the BHC

is located in a state with an economy that commoves less with the rest of the economy. That is,

geographic expansion should have a bigger impact on funding costs when there are greater

opportunities to diversify risk through geographical expansion. In this subsection, we test this

7
    This variable has been used to assess the diversity of BHC earnings, e.g., Laeven and Levine (2007).
                                                                                                    20




potential channel from cross-state diversification to funding costs. Furthermore, by isolating and

assessing this “risk” channel, we reduce concerns that the instrumental variable violates the

exclusion restriction because we further differentiate BHCs by the comovement between the

economy of the state in which the BHC has its headquarters and the aggregate U.S. economy.

       To assess this risk reduction channel, we need to (a) measure the degree to which a

state’s economy commoves with the U.S. economy and (b) modify the regression model. To

measure the degree to which expanding into a state will provide risk-reducing opportunities, we

use the degree to which the state’s economy is correlated with the U.S. economy. Specifically,

US/State comovement equals the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s Coincident index of the

degree to which each state’s economy commoves with the overall U.S. economy. The coincident

index combines four indicators of state-level economic conditions: nonfarm payroll employment,

average hours worked in manufacturing, the unemployment rate, and wage and salary

disbursements deflated by the consumer price index (U.S. city average). The trend for each

state’s index is set to the trend of its gross state product (GSP), so long-term growth in the state’s

index matches long-term growth in its GSP. For each quarter, we compute the correlation

between a state’s economy and the U.S. using monthly data of the coincident index over the

previous 12 quarters. Thus, a higher value of US/State comovement suggests a higher covariation

between a BHC’s home state and the rest of U.S. economy.

       In terms of modifying the regression model used to assess the impact of geographic

diversity on funding costs, we add the interaction term between 1-Herfindahl index of assets

across states (which is measured at the BHC-time level) and US/State comovement (which is

measured at the state-time level). If the coefficient on this interaction term is positive, it suggests

that the cost-reducing impact of cross-state asset diversification is smaller when the BHC is

headquartered in a state that comoves more with the overall U.S. economy and, hence, where

there are correspondingly more modest diversification benefits. To conduct the instrumental

variable analyses with this modified regression model, we use the following instruments: 1-
                                                                                                21




Herfindahl index of assets across states (predicted) and its interaction with US/State comovement.

As shown in Panel A of Table 6, the F-statistics of these excluded instruments are greater than 14.

       The results show that geographic expansion reduces BHC funding costs by an especially

large amount when the BHC expands into economically different states. Columns (1) and (2) of

Table 6 Panel A show that the linear term, 1-Herfindahl index of assets across states, enters the

regression negatively and significantly, whereas its interaction term with US/State comovement

enters positively and significantly. That is, geographic expansion, on average, reduces BHCs’

funding cost, but the effects are less profound among BHCs located in states where the economic

conditions covary highly with the U.S. economy. As shown, these results hold when examining

either Ln(Total cost of funds) or Ln(Cost of domestic deposits). Furthermore, these IV findings

are consistent with the reduced-form analyses reported in Panel B of Table 6, where 1-

Herfindahl index of assets across states (predicted) enters negatively and significantly, while its

interaction with US/State comovement enters positively and significantly. Taken together, the

results reported in Table 6 suggest that risk diversification is an important mechanism through

which geographic expansion reduces funding costs.

       The economic impact is large. Consider a BHC headquartered in a state where its

economy has a correlation of -1 with the rest of the U.S. economy. The regression estimates from

column (2) of Panel A indicate that a one standard deviation increases in the geographic diversity

across states (0.096) reduces the BHC’s total funding cost by 35% (= - 2.432*0.096 + 1.254*(-

1)*0.096). Next, consider another BHC headquartered in a state where its economy has a

correlation of +1 with the rest of the U.S. The regression estimates from column (2) indicate that

a one standard deviation increases in the geographic diversity across states (0.096) reduces the

BHC’s total funding cost by 11% (= - 2.432*0.096 + 1.254*(+1)*0.096). Thus, the cost-reducing

benefits for BHCs in a perfect procyclical economy is 68% (= (11-35)/35) less than in a perfect

countercyclical economy.
                                                                                                22




6. Conclusion

       This paper assesses how cross-state diversity of BHC assets affects the cost of raising

external funds. To identify the impact of geographic diversification on BHCs funding costs, we

employ a gravity-deregulation model to construct an instrument for the distribution of BHC

assets across states. The time-varying, BHC-specific instrument exploits (1) the dynamic process

of interstate banking deregulation that varies at the state-time level, and (2) the BHC-specific

geographic tendency to diversify across state borders. We provide evidence on the validity of the

gravity-deregulation instrumental variable.

       The IV regression results suggest that geographic diversification materially lowers BHC

funding costs. The results hold when we control for state-quarter fixed effects, BHC fixed effects,

market concentration at the MSA level, and time-varying BHC traits (size, capital-asset ratio,

and profitability). The results also remain highly robust to the analyses over subsamples of BHCs,

and different time periods. Moreover, the cost-reducing effects of geographic diversification are

more profound when the economy of a BHCs’ home state is less correlated with the overall U.S.

economy. These results are consistent with the view that geographic diversity reduces BHCs

funding costs by lowering risk.

Figure 1. Dynamic process of interstate banking deregulation
This figure shows the cumulative percentage of state pairs when one state is allowed to enter the other
state from 1982 through 1994 when the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act
passed and removed all the remaining entry barriers across all states. The sample covers all the state pairs
among the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia. Each bar represents the fraction of state
pairs in which BHCs from state A are allowed to enter state B in the indicated year.

Table 1 Summary statistics
For all of the variables used in the analyses, this table provides the following summary statistics: number of
observations (N), the average value (Mean), the standard deviation (SD), the minimum value (Min), the Maximum
value (Max), and the values at the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles. Each of the variables is defined in Appendix Table
A.1. “All” represents the full sample of BHC-quarter observations, while “Non-Diversified BHCs” represents the
subsample of BHC-quarter where a BHC owns zero out-of-state bank subsidiary in a particular quarter, and
“Diversified BHCs” refers to the subsample of BHC-quarter where a BHC has at least one out-of-state bank
subsidiary in a given quarter.

Table 2 Geographic diversification and cost of funds
This table reports the baseline regressions using ordinary least squares (OLS). The dependent variable is the natural
logarithm of total cost of funds in columns 1-2, and natural logarithm of cost of domestic deposits in columns 3-4.
Total cost of funds is the ratio of Total interest expenses /Interest-bearing liability at the beginning of a period. Cost
of domestic deposits equals Interest expenses on domestic deposits/Interest-bearing domestic deposits at the
beginning of a period. 1-Herfindahl index of assets across states equals one minus the sum of squared share of
assets held in different states among a BHC’s subsidiaries. Total asset (lag) is the book value of total assets in
billion US dollars at the beginning of a period. Capital-asset ratio (lag) is the fraction of bank equity over total
assets, measured at the beginning of a period. Return on assets (lag) equals net income divided by the book value of
total asset, measured at the beginning of a period. Market concentration (MSA) is the Herfindahl index of banking
asset concentration in a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). We impose a value of one for non-MSA. Although not
reported, we include across all columns an MSA indicator, that equals one if a BHC is headquartered in an MSA,
and zero otherwise. The corresponding fixed effects are indicated in the table. Standard errors are heteroskedasticity
robust and clustered at the state and quarter, and reported in parentheses. *,**, and *** indicate significance at 10%,
5%, and 1%.

Table 3 Zero-stage estimation for the gravity model
This table shows the relation between distance, population and BHC asset holdings estimated from ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions. The gravity model
includes observations in which it is legally feasible for BHC b with headquarters in state i to open a subsidiary in state j at time t. We exclude Alaska and Hawaii
from the analyses and focus on the 49 contiguous states. Specifically, we estimate the following model:

                                         𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖
𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 = 𝛼𝐿𝐿(𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑏𝑏𝑏 ) + 𝛽𝛽𝛽 �            � + 𝛿𝑡 + 𝛿𝑖 + 𝛿𝑗 + 𝛿𝑖𝑖 + 𝛿𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 ,
                                         𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗


where the dependent variable, 𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 , is the share of assets a BHC b headquartered in state i holds in its subsidiaries in a foreign state j over the quarter t.
𝐿𝐿(𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑏𝑏𝑏 ) denotes the natural logarithm of geographic distance between the BHC b’s headquarter and the capital city of state j (in miles).
𝐿𝐿(𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟) equals the natural logarithm of �𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 ⁄𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗 �, defined as the ratio of the total population of the BHC b’s home state i to the total
population of the foreign state j in quarter t. The corresponding fixed effects are indicated in the table. Note that all the coefficients and standard errors are

Table 4 Geographic diversification and cost of funds: Instrumental variables based on a
gravity-deregulation model
This table reports the second-stage regression results from 2SLS analysis in Panel A, the first-stage results in Panel
B, and the reduced form results in Panel C. The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of cost of total funds in
columns 1-2 and the natural logarithm of cost of domestic deposits in columns 3-4. Total cost of funds is the ratio of
Total interest expenses/Interest-bearing liability at the beginning of a period. Cost of domestic deposits equals
Interest expenses on domestic deposits/Interest-bearing domestic deposits at the beginning of a period. The
endogenous variable is 1-Herfindahl index of assets across state, defined as one minus the sum of squared share of
assets held in different states. The excluded instrument is 1 - Herfindahl index of assets across states (Predicted),
which is computed as follows: Using the coefficient estimates from the gravity-deregulation model (column 2 in
Table 3), we predict the share a BHC holds in a state and year, where we impose that BHCs’ projected holdings of
assets as zero in states that they cannot enter because of interstate bank regulations. Finally, we aggregate the
information for each BHC at the BHC-quarter level and compute the Herfindahl index of assets across states
(Predicted). Bank controls include Capital-asset ratio (lag) Return to assets (lag), and Total assets (lag), all
measured at the beginning of a period. Market concentration (MSA) is the Herfindahl index of banking asset
concentration in a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). We impose a value of one for non-MSA. Although not
reported, we include across all columns an MSA indicator, that equals one if a BHC is headquartered in an MSA,
and zero otherwise. Bank holding company fixed effects and state-quarter fixed effects are included throughout the
table. Standard errors are heteroskedasticity robust and clustered at the state and quarter, and reported in parentheses.

Table 5 Geographic diversification and cost of funds: Robustness tests on subsamples
This table reports three robustness tests of the impact of geographic diversification on BHC funding costs. Using the
same empirical methods as in Table 4, Panel A reports the second stage results using the sample period from 1986
through 1997; Panel B reports the second stage results on a subsample of large BHCs, i.e., BHCs with total assets
greater $500 million; Panel C, columns (1) – (2) includes the additional control variable, Noninterest income, which
equals one minus the absolute difference between net interest income and total noninterest income divided by the
total operating income; and Panel C, columns (3) – (4) reports the second stage results using the subsample of BHCs
in which interest income accounts for at least 2/3 of total operating income. BHC controls include the same set of
controls as in Table 4, namely Capital-asset ratio (lag), Return to assets (lag), and Total assets (lag), Market
concentration (MSA), and MSA indicator.

Table 6 Geographic diversification and cost of funds: Economic comovement
This table reports the 2SLS and reduced form regression results that are similar to the specification in Table 4, while
differentiating the correlation between a BHC’s home state and foreign states. The dependent variable is the natural
logarithm of Total cost of funds in columns 1, and the natural logarithm of Cost of domestic deposits in columns 2.
Total cost of funds is the ratio of Total interest expenses/Interest-bearing liability at the beginning of a period. Cost
of domestic deposits equals Interest expenses on domestic deposits/Interest-bearing domestic deposits at the
beginning of a period. The endogenous variable is 1-Herfindahl index of assets across state, defined as one minus
the sum of squared share of assets held in different states. The excluded instrument is 1 - Herfindahl index of assets
across states (Predicted), which is computed using the same gravity-deregulation model as described in Table 4.
US/State comovement equals the correlation between a BHC’s home state’s coincident index and the US coincident
index. The coincident indexes summarize the economic conditions in a specific state. The indexes combine four
state-level variables, namely nonfarm payroll employment, average hours worked in manufacturing, the
unemployment rate, and wage and salary disbursements deflated by the consumer price index (U.S. city average).
For each quarter, we estimate the pairwise correlations using the monthly values of the coincident index over the
previous 12 quarters. Bank controls include Capital-asset ratio (lag) Return to assets (lag), and Total assets (lag),
all measured at the beginning of a period. Market concentration (MSA) is the Herfindahl index of banking asset
concentration in a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). We impose a value of one for non-MSA. Although not
reported, we include across all columns an MSA indicator, that equals one if a BHC is headquartered in an MSA,
and zero otherwise. Bank holding company fixed effects and state-quarter fixed effects are included throughout the
table. Standard errors are heteroskedasticity robust and clustered at the state and quarter, and reported in parentheses.
*,**, and *** indicate significance at 10%, 5%, and 1%.

Table A2 Geographic diversification and cost of funds: Instrumental variable based only
on distance
This table reports the second-stage regression results that are similar to Table 4 in the main text, except that the
instruments are predicted only using geographic distance, not population. The dependent variables and explanatory
variables have the same meaning as in the previous table. Bank holding company fixed effects and state-quarter
fixed effects are included throughout the table. Standard errors are heteroskedasticity robust and clustered at the
state and quarter, and reported in parentheses. *,**, and *** indicate significance at 10%, 5%, and 1%.
