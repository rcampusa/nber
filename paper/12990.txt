                                              ABSTRACT

We develop a new approach to dealing with real options problems with uncertain maturity. This type
of situation is typical for R&D investments and mine or oil exploration projects. These types of projects
are characterized by significant on-going investment costs until completion. Since time to completion
is uncertain, the total investment costs will also be uncertain. Despite the fact that these projects include
complicated American abandonment/switching options until completion and European options at completion
(because of fixed final investment costs) we obtain simple closed form solutions. We apply the framework
to situations in which the owner of the project has monopoly rights to the outcome of the project, and
to situations in which there are two owners who simultaneously invest, but where only one of them
may obtain the rights to the outcome. We expand the real options framework to incorporate game theoretic
considerations, including a generalization of mixed strategies to continuous-time models in the form
of abandonment intensities.

about the outcome when the investment project is completed but also about the total investment costs. The
problem gets even more complicated if the situation involves competitive interactions, such as the case when
two diﬀerent ﬁrms at the same time are competing to develop a pharmaceutical drug for a particular disease.
   The real options approach has been applied to the valuation of R&D investment projects and to mine or
oil exploitation projects. These type of projects involve not only uncertain cash ﬂows after completion, but
also uncertain costs and time to completion. So far in the literature, solutions to these type of problems
have involved complex numerical solution techniques. Pindyck (1993) introduces a stochastic process to
govern uncertain time to completion. Schwartz and Moon (2000) extend this approach to value an R&D
project with both uncertain costs and also uncertain value of the completed project. The solution involves
a complex numerical procedure to solve elliptical PDEs. Schwartz (2004) solves the same R&D investment
problem using Monte Carlo simulation methods applying the Longstaﬀ-Scwhartz procedure (cf. Longstaﬀ
and Schwartz, 2001) to value the American abandonment feature of the problem. Miltersen and Schwartz
(2004) extend this framework to deal with competitive interactions and Hsu and Schwartz (2006) analyze
the design of research incentives in R&D research. Both of the last two papers also apply Monte Carlo
simulation solution techniques. One problem with the Monte Carlo numerical solution techniques used to
solve these types of problems is that it cannot easily handle temporary suspensions of the projects. Hence, it
is very diﬃcult to compare investment projects with and without the temporary suspension option to isolate
its value. Moreover, the numerical methods applied are designed to estimate the value of the projects, but
they do not estimate the abandonment/swiching threshold levels very accurately.
   In this paper we take a diﬀerent approach. Without loosing the essential ingredients of the problem, we
simplify the framework enough to get closed form solutions. Our simpliﬁed framework can be applied to many
interesting and important cases of investments with uncertain time to completion. Moreover, our simpliﬁed
framework allows us to look at cases not only where the owner of the investment project has exclusive rights
to the outcome of the investment project if completed successfully, such as, e.g., an investment project where
the owner of a property explores for gold, but also to look at cases where two (or more) ﬁrms are researching
for the same product and at most one of them will be successful.
   The main simpliﬁcation we propose in our framework is that completion of the project is governed by an
independent exponential distributed random variable.1 This implies that the value of the projects will be a
solution to an ordinary diﬀerential equation, instead of a partial diﬀerential equation. Normally, the values
of ﬁnite time option problems are solutions to partial diﬀerential equations, and since the type of investment
projects we consider involve both American and European options, it is impossible to obtain closed form
solutions without the simpliﬁcation we propose. Carr (1998) uses a similar simpliﬁcation as a numerical
procedure to approach the value of ﬁnancial American put options.
  In our framework the owner of the investment project pays a certain amount of on-going investment costs
per unit of time until a product or a mine is discovered. The completion date at which the product or the
mine is discovered is uncertain. Since the completion date is uncertain, the on-going investment costs paid
until completion will also be uncertain. At the completion date, when the product or mine is discovered,
the owner of the investment project has to decide whether it is worth while to make a ﬁnal investment
in building a plant to produce the product or extract the mineral. To make this decision the owner of the
investment project compares the ﬁnal investment costs with the present value of the net cash ﬂows that could
1
 This implies that the conditional probability of completion per unit of time is constant. This assumption might be somewhat
unrealistic for some situations.
                       REAL OPTIONS WITH UNCERTAIN MATURITY AND COMPETITION                                   3


be generated by selling the product or mineral. This present value of the net cash ﬂows we will call the value
of the outcome of the investment project. We assume that the value of the outcome evolves stochastically
through time and that it can be observed or estimated by the owner of the project at any point in time.
The idea here is that as investment and/or time progresses, the owner of the investment project changes his
estimate of the present value of the net cash ﬂows that could be derived from the investment project and
that this updated information may inﬂuence the owner’s willingness to continue with the investment project.
  Within this framework we analyze two general types of models. In the ﬁrst type of models, monopoly
models, the owner of the project has exclusive rights to (the value of) the outcome of the investment project
if and when it is completed. In the second type of models, duopoly models, two owners of similar investment
projects compete to be the ﬁrst to complete their investment projects because only the ﬁrst to complete will
get the right to (the value of) the outcome.
   We analyze three diﬀerent monopoly models. In the ﬁrst model we allow the owner of the investment
project to abandon the investment project if the future prospects are not good enough. Since the owner
of the investment project is paying on-going investment costs to keep the investment project alive, for low
enough values of the outcome it will be optimal to abandon the investment project.
  In the second model we allow the owner of the investment project to switch from an active investment
project into a passive investment project and vise-versa. When the investment project is active the owner
incurs on-going investment costs and there is a positive probability of completing the project. When the
investment project is passive there are no on-going investment costs but also no possibility of completion. If
the value of the outcome is high enough it will be worth while to pay the on-going investment costs to have
the possibility of completion. In the passive state there are no on-going investment costs, so if the value
of the outcome is low enough, the owner would like to switch to the passive state. Hence, there will be a
threshold value of the outcome above which it is optimal to have the investment project active and below
which it is optimal to have it passive. Moreover, it will never be optimal to abandon the investment project,
since it is costless to keep it passive.
  Finally, we consider a model with both switching and abandonment options. In this model the owner can
switch between two diﬀerent levels of investment activity, high and low. At the high investment activity
level, the owner pays high on-going investment costs and the probability of completion per unit of time
is high. That is, there is a high chance of discovering a product or a mine per unit of time. At the low
investment activity level, the on-going investment costs are lower but the probability of completion per unit
of time is also lower. In this setting there will be a threshold value of the outcome above which it is optimal
to have a high investment activity level and below which it is optimal to have a low investment activity level.
Moreover, there will be another threshold value of the outcome below which it is optimal to abandon the
investment project.
   In all these three models the owner of the investment project has monopoly rights to the value of the
outcome, that is, there is no competition as to whom owns the right to the value of the outcome when the
investment project is eventually completed. We then look at another type of models where there are two
diﬀerent owners of investment projects, but only the one whose investment project is completed ﬁrst gets
the value of the outcome. Here the values of the investment projects and the decisions to abandon or switch
will depend not only on the value of the outcome but also on the competitive interactions between the two
owners (players). To be able to solve these types of problems we need to expand the real options framework
4                        REAL OPTIONS WITH UNCERTAIN MATURITY AND COMPETITION


we have developed to incorporate game theoretic considerations, where the optimal actions of each player
depend on the (optimal) actions of the other player. To simplify the analysis we assume that the two players
are identical with respect to the size of their investment costs and their probability of completion.
  We again analyze models with abandonment and with switching. In order to analyze the abandonment
option we ﬁrst consider the case where one of the players (the leader) has a un-modeled advantage over the
other player (the follower), such as slightly less investment costs or more ﬁnancial resources available. In this
model the two players have diﬀerent abandonment threshold levels. We then look at the model where the
two players are truly identical and we analyze the game that occurs. We obtain three (Nash) equilibria. One
of these equilibria involves a strategy for each of the two players where they each chooses an abandonment
intensity. The abandonment intensity gives for each player the probability of abandoning their individual
investment projects at each instant of time. This equilibrium concept is a natural extension of mixed strategy
equilibria to continuous-time models and as far as we are aware it has not appeared in the literature.
   We ﬁnally analyze the duopoly model with the switching option between a passive and an active state.
In this case the switching threshold levels for the two players are again determined as a Nash equilibrium in
a game between the two players.
   The simpliﬁed framework we develop allows us to obtain simple closed form solutions to the values of
the investment projects and the threshold levels2 of all the models described above. We are therefore able
to easily perform comparative statics of each model and compare the diﬀerent models. We hope that this
simple and ﬂexible framework will generate more insight and more analysis and solutions of many interesting
real options problems.
    The monopoly models are presented in Section 2 and the duopoly models in Section 3. Section 4 develops
some extensions of the models and Section 5 concludes. To simplify the presentation some of the derivations
are given in the Appendix.

                                              2. Monopoly Models

    In this section we consider models in which the owner of the investment project does not face any com-
petition as to whom will have the right to the value of the outcome at completion of the investment project.
In that sense the owner has a monopoly right to the value of the outcome of the investment project.
  Consider an investment project that requires on-going investment costs at the rate of k per unit of time.
The investment project will be completed at a random date τ at which date the owner of the investment
project has the option to pay ﬁnal (ﬁxed) investment costs K in order to obtain the (net present) value of
the outcome V . In this setup the value of the investment project at the random completion date, τ , would
be max{Vτ − K, 0}.
   For the case of an R&D investment project, k would represent the rate of expenses for the R&D program,
τ would represent the random date at which the research project is completed, K would represent the costs of
building a plant for manufacturing the products obtained from the research project, and V would represent
the net present value of the beneﬁts from selling the products.
   Similarly, for the case of a mine or an oil exploration project, k would represent the rate of expenses for
the exploration phase, τ would represent the random date at which a natural resource may be discovered,

 In the combined abandonment and switching model the two threshold levels have to be found numerically, but a very simple
goal-seek in, e.g., Excel ﬁnds these two values in less than a tenth of a second.

K would represent the costs of developing the mine or the oil ﬁeld, and V would represent the net present
value of the beneﬁts from exploiting the natural resource discovered.
   We assume that the value of the outcome, V , can be observed (estimated) at any date t by the owner
of the investment project. This value we denote Vt . We assume that the dynamics of V is given by the
geometric Brownian motion

(1)                                               dVt = Vt μdt + Vt σdWt .

Here σ is the instantaneous volatility of the value process, μ is its instantaneous drift, and W represents a
Brownian motion.
  We assume that the random time to completion, τ , is exponentially distributed with intensity, λ, and
that the time to completion is independent of the value process, {Vt }t∈[0,∞) . Hence, the expected time
to completion is T = λ1 without taking into account any abandonment possibilities nor any possibilities of
switching to diﬀerent levels of intensity, λ. Finally, we assume that the riskless interest rate, r, is constant.
In order to avoid the possibility of inﬁnite values of the investment projects which we consider in this paper,
we assume that the instantaneous drift of the value process, μ, is strictly less than the riskless rate, r, i.e.
μ < r. The memorylessness feature of the exponential distribution implies that the expected time (and the
whole distribution of the time) to completion of the investment project does not dependent on calendar time.
Hence, time to completion and the completion date will have the same distribution, so we will not distinguish
between these two terms. Moreover, the value of the investment project at a given date, t, depends only on
the value of the outcome, Vt , and not on the calendar date t itself. This property considerably simpliﬁes the
analysis and allows us to obtain closed form solutions for many important and interesting cases.

2.1. Model with Abandonment Option. We ﬁrst consider the model with abandonment. In addition
to the option to the value of the outcome at the completion date, τ , the owner has the option to abandon
the investment project at any date before completion. This means that the owner would loose the option to
the value of the outcome but on the other hand she/he will save the remaining (future) on-going investment
costs. Given that the owner of the investment project is spending on-going investment costs at the rate k
per unit of time there will be a threshold level, AM , so that if the value of the outcome, V , drops below this
threshold level at a certain date, then it will be optimal to abandon the investment project at that date.
We denote the value of the investment project M (V ).3 The investment project is a contingent claim on the
value of the outcome, V . Applying standard arguments, M (V ) must satisfy the system of ODEs4
            1 2 2 
(3a)          σ V M (V ) + μV M  (V ) − (r + λ)M (V ) − k = 0                                   when AM < V < K
            2
3For notational simplicity and clarity we write the value of the investment project as a function of current value of the outcome
instead of the date t value of the dynamic value process Vt .
4Either we can assume that there exists a suﬃciently dynamically complete ﬁnancial market and that we have modeled the
dynamics of the value process, V in Equation (1), under a risk neutral measure, or we can assume that the owner assesses the
value of the investment project at date t as
                                                                               min{τ,ν}              

                                  ν∈S                                           t
Here ν represents the stopping time for abandonment which the owner chooses to follow. Et denotes expectations given all
information at date t and 1{τ ≤ν} denotes the indicator function that the stopping time for completion, τ , occurs before the
stopping time for abandonment, ν. The owner maximizes her/his value of expected future cash ﬂows by choosing the optimal
abandonment stopping time, ν, from the set, S, of all optional stopping times. The assessment in Equation (2) reﬂects a risk
neutral owner.

          2
Here we have implicitly assumed that the abandonment threshold level, AM , is below the ﬁnal investment
costs K (this K is also the exercise price of the option to the value of the outcome).5 Equation (3a) describes
the value of the investment project when the value of the outcome, V , is below the exercise price, K, that is,
if the option to the value of the outcome is out of the money (should the investment project be completed
immediately). For the rest of the paper we will say that the investment project is out of the money to describe
this situation. (Obviously, to describe the opposite situation, namely that V ≥ K, we say that the investment
project is in the money.) Equation (3a) reﬂects the fact that with intensity λ (i.e., with probability λ per
unit of time) the investment project would be completed and because the investment project is out of the
money, the value of the investment project will jump down to zero. This corresponds to a loss in value of
M (V ).6 In addition, the owner has to pay on-going investment costs at the rate k per unit of time in order
to keep the investment project alive. Equation (3b) describes the value of the investment project when it is
in the money. This equation reﬂects the fact that with intensity λ the value of the investment project would
jump to the completion value, V −K. This corresponds to a jump in value of V −K −M (V ). In addition, the
owner still has to pay on-going investment costs at the rate k per unit of time in order to keep the investment
project alive. We can solve each of the two ODEs, (3a) and (3b), separately for given boundary conditions.
We denote the general solution for ODE (3a) M1 (V ) and the general solution for ODE (3b) M2 (V ). The
boundary conditions will be used to tie the diﬀerent general solutions for the diﬀerent areas of the value of
the outcome, V , together into one continuous (and diﬀerentiable) value function for the investment project
for all values of the outcome, V . The general solutions to each of these two ODEs, (3a) and (3b), are

                                                 M is above K in Appendix A.
6One may argue that it is unrealistic to assume that the investment project is valueless if it is completed at a time when the
value of the outcome, V , is below the ﬁxed investment costs, K. The owner would still be able to claim the right to her/his
discovery (either by patenting or other legal actions) and eventually put it into production at a later date. That is, a more
realistic assumption would be that at the date of completion of the investment project the owner receives a perpetual American
call option on the value of the outcome with exercise price equal to the ﬁnal investment costs, K. We analyze this extension of
the model in Section 4.

Note that y1 > 1 and that y2 < 0. Since the value of the investment project can never exceed the value
of the outcome, V , we know that limV →∞ M2V(V ) must be ﬁnite (in fact, it must be less than one). This
implies that m21 = 0 since y1 > 1. Hence, we can eliminate the V y1 term in Equation (4b). Moreover, we

can substitute T =   λ   for the expected (remaining) time to completion of the investment project to get

The value of the investment project has the following boundary conditions

(7a)                                            M1 (AM ) = 0,
(7b)                                            M1 (AM ) = 0,

(7d)                                              M1 (K) = M2 (K).

Condition (7a) reﬂects the fact that at the abandonment threshold level, AM , the value of the investment
project is zero. Condition (7b) is the usual smooth pasting condition at the abandonment threshold level.
Condition(s) (7c) (and (7d)) reﬂect(s) the fact that the value function should be continuous (and diﬀeren-
tiable) at the point when the two diﬀerential equations (3a) and (3b) meet at the ﬁnal investment costs, K.
We can solve the system of equations (7) in the four unknowns, m11 , m12 , m22 , and AM . The solution is

We made an implicit assumption when setting up the system of ODEs (3) above, namely that the abandon-
ment threshold level, AM , is below the ﬁnal investment costs, K. If it turns out that by solving the system
of equations (7), the solution to AM from Equation (8b) is greater than K, we must reconsider the whole

Note that the abandonment threshold level in this situation (denoted ÃM ) is, in general, diﬀerent from AM
from Equation (8b). For notational simplicity, however, we will always refer to AM as the abandonment
threshold level for the rest of the paper even though strictly speaking we should distinguish between AM and
ÃM depending on whether AM < K or ÃM ≥ K. These two events are mutually exclusively and collectively
exhaustive.7
  To illustrate the nature of the solution, we consider an investment project that requires on-going invest-
ment costs of $1 (million) per year until completion. We assume that the expected time to completion is
5 years and that at completion the investment project requires ﬁnal investments of $5 (million) in order to
obtain the cash ﬂows of the outcome. The instantaneous drift of the value process is 3% and its instanta-
neous volatility is 40% per year. Finally, the interest rate is 5% per year. The parameters of this numerical
illustration, which we call our base case, is summarized in Table 1.

7Thorough extensive numerical investigations have conﬁrmed that in the parameter space, {(μ, σ, r, λ, k, K) ∈ R6 |μ < r, σ >
0, r > 0, λ > 0, k ≥ 0, K ≥ 0}, the sets {AM ≥ K} and {ÃM ≥ K} are (generically) identical. This is also the case for the
sets {AM > K} and {ÃM > K} and also {AM = K} and {ÃM = K}. However, we have not formally proven this result
analytically.

              completion, T = 1, T = 5, and T = 10 years. The ﬁgure also shows the corresponding
              abandonment threshold levels (denoted A1M , A5M , and A10
                                                                     M ) on the horizontal axis for the
              three diﬀerent values of expected time to completion. The exact levels are A1M = 4.37,
              A5M = 5.26, and A10M = 6.26. Finally, the ﬁgure also shows the completion values of the
              investment project (denoted V − K) as a function of the value of the outcome. All other
              parameters are given in Table 1.


  In Figure 1 we show the values of the investment projects as a function of the value of the outcome, V ,
for three diﬀerent values for the expected time to completion, T = 1, T = 5, and T = 10 years. We denote
the corresponding values of the investment projects as M 1 (V ), M 5 (V ), and M 10 (V ). As can be seen from
the ﬁgure the values of the investment projects are higher when the expected time to completion is shorter.
Since the owner of the investment project pays on-going investment costs in the order of $1 per unit of time
the investment project is more valuable with shorter expected time to completion. For realistic values of
on-going investment costs the typical situation is that the value of the investment project decreases with
longer expected time to completion. However, for very low values of on-going investment costs rate, k, (say
k is in the order of 1–4% of the value of the ﬁnal investment costs, K) the value of the investment project
may be increasing in the expected time to completion. This is so because the value increasing eﬀect of
10                         REAL OPTIONS WITH UNCERTAIN MATURITY AND COMPETITION


postponing the ﬁnal investment costs, K, at completion may dominate the value decreasing eﬀect of paying
the on-going investment costs for a longer time.8 Hence, in general, the value of the investment project may
be non-monotonic in the expected time to completion.
   In Figure 1 we also show the corresponding abandonment threshold levels on the horizontal axis for the
three diﬀerent values of the expected time to completion, denoted A1M , A5M , and A10
                                                                                   M . When the expected
time to completion is 5 years or 10 years the corresponding abandonment threshold levels are above the ﬁnal
investment costs, K, and are therefore derived from Equation (11a). The exact levels are A5M = 5.26 and
A10
  M = 6.26. When the expected time to completion is 1 year the corresponding abandonment threshold level
is below the ﬁnal investment costs, K, and it is therefore derived from Equation (8b). The exact level is
A1M = 4.37.
   Finally, in Figure 1 we also show the completion values of the investment projects as function of the value
of the outcome. We denote these values V − K. In most cases the value of the investment projects is below
the corresponding completion values mainly because the owner has to pay the on-going investment cost in
order to keep the investment projects alive. However, for investment projects that are out of the money or
at least not too far in the money, (early) completion can result in a negative jump in value, because the
value of the project (before completion) includes the chance of a higher completion value.
   When the abandonment threshold level is above the ﬁnal investment costs, K, an increase in the expected
time to completion of the investment project will typically lead to an even higher abandonment threshold
level since the eﬀect that the owner has to pay the on-going investment costs for a longer time typically
dominates. However, when the abandonment threshold level is below the ﬁnal investment costs, K, an
increase in the expected time to completion of the investment project may lead to a lower abandonment
threshold level since the eﬀect that a longer expected time to completion increases the likelihood that the
investment project will be completed in the money dominates the eﬀect that the owner has to pay the
on-going investment costs for a longer time. In Figure 2 we show the abandonment threshold levels as
a function of expected time to completion, T , with our base case parameters. As we have just explained,
typically, the abandonment threshold levels will be an increasing function of the expected time to completion.
However, for short expected time to completion (for T below 0.36 years with our base case parameters), the
abandonment threshold levels decrease with increased expected time to completion. Hence, even with our
base case parameters, Figure 2 demonstrates that the abandonment threshold levels may be a non-monotonic
function of the expected time to completion. For T = 0, the abandonment threshold level is clearly equal to
the ﬁnal investment costs, K = 5. Finally, note that the abandonment threshold level function in Figure 2
is smooth around the level 5 on the vertical axis where the abandonment threshold level shifts from being
deﬁned by Equation (8b) to being deﬁned by Equation (11a), as claimed in footnote 7.

2.2. Model with Switching Option. Now consider the same investment project as in sub-section 2.1 but
with the following modiﬁcation. The owner of the investment project can temporarily suspend investing in
the project. When the investment project is suspended both the on-going investment costs rate, k, and the
intensity of completion, λ, switch to zero. In other words, the owner has the option to switch from an active

8In general this eﬀect may again be dominated by another value decreasing eﬀect. That is, if the value of the outcome, V , is
high enough compared to the ﬁnal investment costs, K, then the value decreasing eﬀect of having to wait a longer time to get
the value of the outcome may dominate the value increasing eﬀect of postponing of the ﬁnal investment costs. This eﬀect is
caused by our assumption that the instantaneous drift, μ, of the value process is less than the riskless interest rate, r. Moreover,
the greater the diﬀerence between r and μ, the stronger is this eﬀect.

investment project to a passive (mothballed) investment project and vice versa costlessly. Clearly, in this
model it would never be optimal to abandon the investment project since there are no costs of keeping the
investment project passive. Abandonment is a non-reversible decision, whereas switching allows for multiple
changes of state. Since when the investment project is passive there is no possibility of completion, there
will be a threshold level, SN , so that if the value of the outcome, V , is above this threshold level at a certain
date, then it would be optimal to be in the active state at that date, and if V is below this threshold level it
would be optimal to be in the passive state at that date. We call SN the switching point. It is easy to see
that SN will be above the ﬁnal investment costs, K, since by mothballing the investment project when it is
out of the money, the owner can avoid that the investment project is ever completed out of the money. Let
N (V ) denote the value of the investment project for this model. Following arguments similar to the previous
model, N (V ) must satisfy the system of ODEs

Equation (12a) describes the value of the investment project when it is passive. This equation reﬂects
the fact that there is no chance (or risk) that the project will be completed as long as it is passive, i.e.
λ = 0, and that there are no on-going investment costs when the investment project is passive, i.e. k = 0.
Equation (12b) describes the value of the investment project when it is active. This equation has the same
terms as Equation (3b) because, as we have argued, the investment project is always in the money when
it is active. The general solutions to each of the two ODEs, (12a) and (12b), which we denote N1 (V ) and
N2 (V ), are

(13a)          N1 (V ) = n11 V x1 + n12 V x2                                                 when V ≤ SN

Here the powers, x1 and x2 , are given by

and

The powers y1 and y2 are still deﬁned by the system of equations (5). Comparing the powers x1 and x2
with the corresponding powers y1 and y2 , we see that y1 > x1 > 1 and that y2 < x2 < 0. In our general
solution in Equation (13a) we can eliminate the V x2 term, since the value of the investment project must
be zero when the value of the outcome, V , converge to zero. Since x2 < 0, the coeﬃcient in front of the
V x2 term must be zero in order for the value of the investment project not to explode as the value of the
outcome, V , converge to zero. In addition, using the same arguments as in sub-section 2.1, we know that
limV →∞ N2V(V ) must be ﬁnite. Hence, we can eliminate the V y1 term in Equation (13b). The value of the
investment project has the following boundary conditions

(15a)                                              N1 (SN ) = N2 (SN )

and

(15b)                                              N1 (SN ) = N2 (SN ).

The two conditions, (15a) and (15b), reﬂect the fact that the value function should be continuous and
diﬀerentiable at the point when the two diﬀerential equations (12a) and (12b) meet at the switching point,
SN . In order to ﬁnd the optimal switching point itself, SN , we solve

(15c)                                          λ(SN − K) = λN2 (SN ) + k.

Equation (15c) is based on the following instantaneous trade-oﬀ argument. At each instant in time the owner
considers the instantaneous costs and beneﬁts from switching between an active and a passive investment
project. The increased instantaneous beneﬁts from switching from a passive state to an active state is the
                          REAL OPTIONS WITH UNCERTAIN MATURITY AND COMPETITION                                           13


increased intensity of completion which has a value ﬂow λ(V − K) per unit of time. On the other hand the
increased instantaneous costs of switching are (i) the increased intensity of loosing the investment project
(an inevitable consequence of completion) which has a value ﬂow λN2 (V ) per unit of time9 and (ii) the
increased on-going investment costs at the rate k per unit of time.
   Note that Equation (15c) also implies that the value function, N (V ), will be two times diﬀerentiable at
the switching point, SN . To see this note that N2 is a solution to the ODE (12b), hence,
                    1 2 2 
(16)                  σ SN N2 (SN ) = rN2 (SN ) − μSN N2 (SN ) + λN2 (SN ) + k − λ(SN − K).
                    2
Using Equation (15c), we can eliminate the last terms in Equation (16), so we have
                                      1 2 2 
(17)                                    σ SN N2 (SN ) = rN2 (SN ) − μSN N2 (SN ).
                                      2
On the other hand N1 is a solution to the ODE (12a), hence,
                                      1 2 2 
(18)                                    σ SN N1 (SN ) = rN1 (SN ) − μSN N1 (SN ).
                                      2
Using Equations (15a) and (15b) we conclude that the right hand sides of Equations (17) and (18) are
identical, hence the left hand sides must also be identical. Since SN > 0 and σ > 0, we conclude that

(19)                                              N1 (SN ) = N2 (SN ).

In order to ﬁnd the value of the investment project, we solve the system of equations (15) in the three
unknowns, n11 , n22 , and SN , to get
                                     (x1 + (x1 − y2 )rT )(1 + (r − μ)T )(kT + K)

                                         (x1 − 1 + (x1 − y2 )(r − μ)T )(1 + rT )
                                     y2 (1 + (r − μ)T )(kT + K) + (1 − y2 )(1 + rT )SN
(20b)                        n11   =                                             x1    ,
                                             (x1 − y2 )(1 + (r − μ)T )(1 + rT )SN

and
                                     x1 (1 + (r − μ)T )(kT + K) − (x1 − 1)(1 + rT )SN
(20c)                        n22 =                                             y2     .

From Equation (15c) it is clear that SN > kT + K. To see this note that kT + K would have been the
optimal switching point if the owner did not take into account the costs of losing the investment project.
That is, if the term λN2 (SN ) would not have been present on the right hand side of Equation (15c) then the
optimal switching point would have been kT + K. Since N2 (SN ) is strictly positive, the optimal switching
point must be higher than kT + K. Finally, the value of the investment project is
                                  ⎧

The solution to the switching point from Equation (20a), which essentially is based on the instantaneous
trade-oﬀ argument from Equation (15c), also has the property that it maximizes the value function, N (V ),
globally. That is, if we consider the value of the investment project, now denoted N (V ; S), not only as a
function of the value of the outcome, V , but also as the function of a given pre-committed switching point,
9Note that it does not matter whether we use N (S ) or N (S ) for the value of the investment project at the switching point
                                              1 N       2 N
since by Equation (15a) the two functions have the same value at the switching point, SN .

S, then the switching point solution, SN , from Equation (20a), maximizes the function S → N (V ; S) for
any choice of V .
  Note that this switching option model has the standard perpetual American call option as a limit case.
That is, if λ = ∞, switching to an active investment project will trigger immediate completion. This
corresponds to the decision of exercising a perpetual American call option written on the value of the
outcome, V , and with the ﬁnal (ﬁxed) investment costs, K, as exercise price. Inserting T = 0 (corresponding
to λ = ∞) into Equation (20a) gives the well-known optimal exercise threshold level10

   In Figure 3 we show the values of the investment projects as a function of the value of the outcome, V ,
for three diﬀerent values of the expected time to completion, T = 1, T = 5, and T = 10 years. We denote
the corresponding values of the investment projects as N 1 (V ), N 5 (V ), and N 10 (V ). As can be seen from
the ﬁgure, we have the same observation as for the model with the abandonment option, namely that the
values of the investment projects are higher when the expected time to completion is shorter. Now, since
there are no costs of keeping the investment projects passive, the projects have strictly positive values even
for very low values of the outcome. For comparison we also show in Figure 3 the value of the corresponding
investment project with abandonment option for T = 5 years. We denote this value M 5 (V ). For very high
values of the outcome the value of the investment project with the abandonment option and the one with
the switching option converge since for very high values of the outcome the option to abandon and to switch
are far out of the money and therefore their values become negligible compared to the intrinsic values of the
investment projects which are identical for the two models.
   In Figure 3 we ﬁnally show the corresponding switching points on the horizontal axis for two of the three
                                                               1      5
diﬀerent values of the expected time to completion, denoted SN   and SN . The switching point for T = 10 is
                                                 1           5                10
to the right of the ﬁgure. The exact levels are SN = 32.04, SN = 37.58, and SN   = 44.79.
  In Figure 4 we show the switching points as a function of the expected time to completion, T , with
our base case parameters. We denote the switching points SN . Typically the switching points will be an
increasing function of the expected time to completion but, as in the abandonment model, for short expected
time to completion (for T below 0.72 years with our base case parameters), it may be a decreasing function
                                                                                                           x1
of time even for realistic parameter values. For T = 0, the switching point is equal to                   x1 −1 K   = 35.75 with
our base case parameters as derived in Equation (22).

2.3. Model with both Abandonment and Switching Options. Next we consider the model where the
owner of the investment project can switch between two activity levels, low and high. At the low activity
level the on-going investment costs rate is k and the intensity of completion is λ, and, hence, the expected
time to completion is T = λ1 . At the high activity level the intensity of completion is increased to λ̄ > λ
but the on-going investment costs rate is also increased to k̄ > k. Note that at the high activity level the

10The size for the on-going investment costs rate, k, is irrelevant since the waiting time until completion is zero, so the present
value of those costs will be zero. Note also that as λ goes to inﬁnity, y2 will go to minus inﬁnity.

expected time to completion is reduced to T̄ = λ̄1 < T . When the value of the outcome is high, the owner
will prefer to reduce the expected time to completion even if this requires a higher on-going investment costs
rate, and when the value of the outcome is low, the owner will prefer to reduce the on-going investment costs
rate even though the expected time to completion will be longer. Moreover, when the value of the outcome
is very low the owner may even want to abandon the investment project. For the case of an R&D investment
project we can imagine that the owner can switch between two diﬀerent levels of research activity. A low
research activity level with low on-going costs rate, k, and a corresponding long expected time to completion,
T , versus a high research activity level with higher on-going costs rate, k̄, but also shorter expected time
to completion, T̄ . The owner will of course also have the option to abandon the R&D investment project
deﬁnitively. Clearly the decision of which research activity level to choose and eventually when to abandon
will depend on the net present value of the beneﬁts from selling the products, V . As in the ﬁrst model we

studied in sub-section 2.1, there will be a threshold level, AO , such that when the value of the outcome is
below this level it is optimal for the owner of the investment project to abandon it; and as in the second
model we studied in sub-section 2.2, there will be another threshold level, SO , where it will be optimal to
switch between the two possible activity levels. As in sub-section 2.2 we assume that there are no switching
costs. We solve this model in Appendix B.
   In Figure 5 we show the values of an investment project of this kind as a function of the value of the
outcome, V . In this investment project the owner can switch to a lower level of activity with a lower on-
going investment costs rate, k = 0.3, but also a longer expected time to completion, T = 10 years. All
other parameters are as in our base case. We denote this value O(V ). For this model the optimal switching
point between the two activity levels is SO = 51.41 (which is to the right of the ﬁgure) and the optimal
abandonment threshold level is AO = 3.03 with our base case parameters. For comparison we also plot the
values of the corresponding investment project with only the abandonment option in the base case. That
is, here the owner has expected time to completion of T = 5 years and an on-going investment costs rate of
k = 1. In this model the owner’s only option is to abandon her/his investment project, which she/he will do
at the abandonment threshold level AM = 5.26. We denote this value M (V ). Also for comparison, we plot
the values of the corresponding investment project with only the switching option in the base case. That
is, here the owner can switch between a passive and an active investment project. The passive investment

project has an on-going investment costs rate of k = 0 and no chance of completion, i.e. T = ∞, whereas
the active investment project has expected time to completion of T = 5 years and an on-going investment
costs rate of k = 1. In this model the owner’s only option is to switch between the passive and the active
investment project, which she/he will do at the switching point SN = 37.58 (which is also to the right of
the ﬁgure). We denote this value N (V ). Interestingly, as the value of the outcome, V , increases, the values
of the three investment projects converge. This is so because for very high values of the outcome the option
to abandon and/or switch are far out of the money and therefore their values become negligible compared
to the intrinsic values of the investment projects which are identical for all three investment projects.

                                            3. Duopoly Models

  In the previous section we considered models in which the owner of the investment project does not face
any competition as to whom will have the right to the value of the outcome when the investment project is
completed. Now we consider models in which there are two diﬀerent owners of investment projects. Only
the one whose project is completed ﬁrst, gets the value of the outcome, V , and the other gets nothing. That
is, we make a winner-takes-it-all assumption. A typical illustration of this would be when two competing
research teams are working to develop similar products and the one who completes ﬁrst is able to patent the
product and obtain all the beneﬁts. To simplify the analysis we consider models in which both owners (which
we will now call players) have the same rate of on-going investment costs, k, the same ﬁnal investment costs,
K, and the same expected time to completion, T . We also assume that the two exponential distributions
governing the time to completion of the two investment projects are independent. As in the previous section
we will consider ﬁrst the abandonment option and then the switching option.

3.1. Model with Abandonment Option. Since there is only one stochastic process governing the value
of the outcome for both players and the two players have the same characteristics, both will meet the optimal
abandonment threshold level at the same point in time. This abandonment threshold level will be as least
as high as the abandonment threshold level in the corresponding monopoly model, AM , from Equation (8b),
which we derived in sub-section 2.1. Hence, both players will prefer that the other player abandons so that
she/he would get the investment project as a monopolist. The decision as to whom abandons is the result of
a game. To break the tie we ﬁrst consider the case where one of the players, the leader, has an unmodeled
advantage over the other player, the follower. This advantage could be slightly lower investment costs or
more capital, etc. In this case, we assume that the follower abandons ﬁrst and leaves the monopoly value to
the leader. The threshold level at which the follower will abandon we will denote, AQ . Clearly, as we have
argued, AQ ≥ AM . After having analyzed the leader-follower case we will consider the case where the two
players are identical and analyze the game that occurs.

3.1.1. Leader and Follower. If the two players know in advance whom will be the player who will abandon
ﬁrst, the abandonment threshold levels will reﬂect this and be diﬀerent for each of the two players.
3.1.1.1. The Follower . First we analyze the follower’s investment project. As in the two previous abandon-
ment models we analyzed in sub-sections 2.1 and 2.3 we will have to consider both the situation where we
assume that the abandonment threshold level, AQ , is below the ﬁnal investment costs, K, and the situation
where it is above. Here we assume that AQ < K. In Appendix C we analyze the situation when AQ ≥ K.
Let Q(V ) denote the value of the investment project for the follower. This value must satisfy the system of
ODEs

Equation (24a) describes the value of the follower’s investment project when it is out of the money. This
equation reﬂects the fact that with intensity 2λ either the follower’s or the leader’s investment project will be
completed out of the money. If it is the follower’s investment project which is completed out of the money the
                           REAL OPTIONS WITH UNCERTAIN MATURITY AND COMPETITION                                               19


value of her/his investment project would jump down to zero (cf. footnote 6). If it is the leader’s investment
project which is completed out of the money, we assume that the value of the follower’s investment project
also jumps down to zero.11 In addition, the follower has to pay on-going investment costs at the rate k per
unit of time to keep the investment project alive. Equation (24b) describes the value of follower’s investment
project when it is in the money. This equation reﬂects the fact that with intensity 2λ either the follower’s
or the leader’s investment project will be completed in the money. If it is the follower’s investment project
which is completed, the value of her/his investment project would jump to the completion value, V − K.
But, if it the leader’s investment project which is completed, the value of the follower’s investment project
will jump to zero because of our winner-takes-it-all assumption. In addition, the follower has to pay on-going
investment costs at the rate k per unit of time to keep the investment project alive. The general solutions
to each of the two ODEs, (24a) and (24b), which we denote Q1 (V ) and Q2 (V ), are

Here the powers, z1 and z2 , are given by

Comparing the powers z1 and z2 with the corresponding powers y1 and y2 from the corresponding monopoly
model from the system of equations (5), we see that z1 > y1 > 1 and that z2 < y2 < 0. Using the same
arguments as for the previous models, we know that limV →∞ Q2V(V ) must be ﬁnite. Hence, we can eliminate
                                                                                   1
the V z1 term in Equation (25b). In addition, we can substitute T =                λ   for the expected (remaining) time to
completion of the investment project to get
                                                      kT

                                                    2 + rT
and
                                               V        kT + K
(27b)            Q2 (V ) = q22 V z2 +                 −                                  when K ≤ V.

11This reﬂects that the leader still has a right to her/his discovery (either by patenting or other legal actions) even though it
turns out that it is not worth putting into production immediately. As we indicated in footnote 6 on page 6 a more realistic
assumption would be that the owner (in this case the leader) receives a perpetual American option at the completion date
of her/his investment project. The important assumption here is that if the leader’s investment project is completed, then
the follower’s investment project becomes valueless because of the winner-takes-it-all assumption. We think this is the most
realistic and appealing assumption. As an alternative, we could assume that if the leader’s investment project is completed out
of the money, then the follower suddenly becomes a monopolist and that the value of her/his investment project will jump to
the corresponding monopoly value, M (V ), which we derived in sub-section 2.1. This case is also solvable, although the optimal
abandonment threshold level can only be found numerically.
20                         REAL OPTIONS WITH UNCERTAIN MATURITY AND COMPETITION


The value of the follower’s investment project has the following boundary conditions

(28a)                                                 Q1 (AQ ) = 0,

These boundary conditions are the same as the boundary conditions used in the corresponding monopoly
model with abandonment, cf. the system of equations (7) in sub-section 2.1. In order to ﬁnd solutions for
the four unknowns, q11 , q12 , q22 , and AQ , we solve the system of equations (28). The solution is

Note the close similarity to the corresponding monopoly solution from Equation (9) and the system of
equations (8) in sub-section 2.1. It is not so obvious when one looks at the ODE, but from the solution it
is clear that the value of the follower’s investment project is identical to half the value of the corresponding
monopoly investment project with double the on-going investment costs rate and half the expected time
to completion.12 Therefore, the abandonment threshold level for the follower, AQ , is also identical to the

12Ex post, after having discovered this result, it is easy to see that it is possible to derive it directly from the ODEs. Take the
system of ODEs (24) describing the value of the follower’s investment project, Q(V ). In order to get two times this solution,
i.e. 2Q(V ), we need to double the cash ﬂow rates. That is, X(V ) = 2Q(V ) would be a solution to the system of ODEs

(31a)           σ V X (V ) + μV X  (V ) − (r + 2λ)X(V ) − 2k = 0                           when AX < V < K,

             2
The boundary conditions for X(V ) are the same as for Q(V ), cf. Equations (28). Now comparing the system of ODEs (31)
to the corresponding system of ODEs (3) for the monopoly model from sub-section 2.1 and also the boundary conditions, cf.
Equations (7), it is clear that X(V ) is the value of a monopoly investment project with intensity 2λ (corresponding to an

abandonment threshold level for the corresponding monopoly investment project with double the on-going
investment costs rate and half the expected time to completion.
   If it turns out that the solution to AQ from Equation (29b) is greater than K, we must reconsider the
problem. We do this in Appendix C. In this situation, the value of the follower’s investment project is

Note again that the abandonment threshold level in this situation (denoted ÃQ ) is, in general, diﬀerent from
AQ from Equation (29b). For notational simplicity, however, we will always refer to AQ as the abandonment
threshold level for the follower for the rest of the paper even though strictly speaking we should distinguish
between AQ and ÃQ depending on whether AQ < K or ÃQ ≥ K.
3.1.1.2. The Leader . After having found the abandonment threshold level for the follower, AQ , we can turn
to the valuation of the leader’s investment project. The abandonment threshold level for the leader, AP , will
always be lower than the abandonment threshold level for the follower, AQ . Hence, the follower will always
have abandoned before the leader considers abandoning her-/himself. So the leader will ﬁnd her-/himself
in the corresponding monopoly situation before she/he considers abandoning. Hence, the abandonment
threshold level for the leader will be the same as the abandonment threshold level in the corresponding
monopoly model. That is, AP = AM . Moreover, the value of the leader’s investment project will be equal
to the value of the corresponding investment project in the monopoly model, M (V ), as soon as the follower
has abandoned. Hence, we only need to analyze the value of the leader’s investment project for values of
the outcome, V , above the abandonment threshold level for the follower, AQ . As it was the case when
we analyzed the value of the follower’s investment project, we have to consider both the situation when
AQ < K and and when AQ ≥ K. Here we analyze the situation when AQ < K. In Appendix D we analyze
the situation when AQ ≥ K. Let P (V ) denote the value of the leader’s investment project. This value must
satisfy the system of ODEs
            1 2 2 
(34a)         σ V P (V ) + μV P  (V ) − (r + 2λ)P (V ) − k = 0                    when AQ < V < K,
            2
and
            1 2 2 
(34b)         σ V P (V ) + μV P  (V ) − (r + 2λ)P (V ) − k + λ(V − K) = 0         when K < V.
            2
The system of equations (34) for the value of the leader’s investment project is identical to the system of
equations (24) for the value of the follower’s investment project and the explanations for the terms are the
same. Since the value of the leader’s investment project is equal to the value of the corresponding investment

project in the monopoly model as soon as the follower has abandoned we have

(35a)                       P (V ) = M (V )                               when AM ≤ V ≤ AQ .

Using the same arguments as for the follower we get the solutions to each of the two ODEs, (34a) and (34b),
which we denote P1 (V ) and P2 (V ), as
                                                     kT

The value of the leader’s investment project has the following boundary conditions

(36a)                                               P1 (AQ ) = M (AQ ),
(36b)                                                P1 (K) = P2 (K),

and

(36c)                                                P1 (K) = P2 (K).

Condition (36a) reﬂects the fact that at the abandonment threshold level for the follower, AQ , the value of
the leader’s investment project is the same as the value of the corresponding monopoly investment project.
Note that the value of the leader’s investment project is not (necessarily) diﬀerentiable at the abandonment
threshold level for the follower. This is so because (i) the leader does not take any active decisions at this
point,13 and (ii) the value process of the leader’s investment project only follows this path once (opposite a
switching point where the value processes of the two players’ investment projects may pass back and forth
over this threshold level inﬁnitely many times). Conditions (36b) and (36c) are the usual continuity and
diﬀerentiability conditions at the ﬁnal investment costs, K. We can solve the system of equations (36) in
the three unknowns, p11 , p12 , and p22 . The solution is14

                                                                    (1 + rT )(2 + rT ) AzQ2

                                         (z1 − z2 )(2 + (r − μ)T )(2 + rT )
Note that the solution to p11 from Equation (37a) is identical to q11 for the follower from Equation (29a).
Note also the similarity between p22 from Equation (37c) and q22 for the follower from Equation (29d).



13It is the follower who determines when to abandon her/his investment project, so her/his value should smooth paste at this
threshold level, cf. Equation (28b).
14Note that M (V ) on the right hand side of Equation (36a) is actually M (V ) from Equation (6a), since A
                                                                         1                                 M < AQ < K.
Therefore we get the terms m11 and m12 in the solution to p12 in Equation (37b).

Substituting the value of the corresponding monopoly investment project, M (V ), into Equation (39) is
straight forward but a little care is needed.15 See Appendix D for details.
   In ﬁgure 6 we show the values of both the leader’s and the follower’s investment projects as a function of
the value of the outcome, V , with our base case parameters. We denote the values of the leader’s investment
project as P (V ) and the values of the follower’s investment project as Q(V ). For comparison we also show
the values of the corresponding monopoly investment project. These values we denote M (V ). We also show
the corresponding abandonment threshold levels on the horizontal axis for the follower and for the leader.
We denote the abandonment threshold level for the follower AQ . The abandonment threshold level for the
leader is the same as the abandonment threshold level in the corresponding monopoly model. Therefore, we
denote this abandonment threshold level, AM . The exact levels are AQ = 6.30 and AM = 5.26 with our base
case parameters. For values of the outcome below the abandonment threshold level for the follower, AQ , the
value of the leader’s investment project is the same as the value of the corresponding monopoly investment
project.
   It is interesting to note that the value of the leader’s investment project is actually a decreasing function
of the value of the outcome for values of the outcome just above the abandonment threshold level for the
follower (for V between 6.30 and 6.56 with our base case parameters). The reason for this is as follows:
Suppose we are in the situation when the follower has not yet abandoned. A small increase in the value of
the outcome, V has two eﬀects. There is a value decreasing eﬀect on the leader’s investment project because
of the reduced likelihood that the follower will abandon and there is a (natural) value increasing eﬀect of
a higher value of the outcome at completion of the leader’s investment project. For values of the outcome
close to the threshold level where the follower will abandon, the value decreasing eﬀect dominates.



15Basically, one needs to be careful to substitute the correct version of M (V ) into Equation (39) depending on whether A < K

                 AQ ) and for the leader (denoted AM ). The exact levels are AQ = 6.30 and AM = 5.26. All
                 other parameters are given in Table 1.

     For high levels of the outcome the values for the leader’s and the follower’s investment projects converge
because the advantage of being the leader becomes relatively small compared to the intrinsic values of the
investment projects which are identical for the leader’s and the follower’s investment projects.

3.1.2. Identical Players. When the two players are truly identical we need to analyze the abandonment
decision as a game. The value of each of the two players’ investment projects when both keep investing we
will denote R̂(V ). M (V ) is the value of the investment project in the corresponding monopoly model from
sub-section 2.1. It is easy to see that R̂(V ) ≤ M (V ). The two players consider whether to continue investing
or whether to abandon by studying the normal form representation of the game in Table 2. If the value
of the outcome, V , is high enough to make R̂(V ) strictly positive, it is easy to see (by eliminating strictly
dominated strategies) that the unique Nash equilibrium in pure strategies is that both players continue
investing in their investment projects. When the value of the outcome is below the abandonment threshold
level in the corresponding monopoly model, i.e. when V ≤ AM , it is no longer proﬁtable to continue investing

even for a monopolist, so then the unique Nash equilibrium in pure strategies is that both players abandon
their investment projects. Finally, when the value of the outcome is in the area when R̂(V ) < 0 < M (V ),
then there are two Nash equilibria in pure strategies. These are characterized by the fact that one of the
players continues investing and the other player abandons. This is exactly the leader-follower case, which we
have just analyzed. However, if the players are (truly) identical there is no mechanism to select one of the
two equilibria from the other. A co-operative solution in this case would be that the two players agree to
meet and to ﬂip a coin in order to break the tie and decide whom should be the leader and whom should be
the follower. We will term this solution the Coin Toss Solution. From an ex-ante point of view both players
prefer this solution, since this gives each of the two players the highest ex-ante value of their individual
investment projects.
3.1.2.1. Coin-Toss Solution. If the players have agreed that they will meet to ﬂip a coin in order to determine
whom should be the leader and whom should be the follower, and it is clear that the looser ex post, after
the coin has been tossed, would honor the agreement and actually abandon, then both players would like to
know the outcome of the coin toss as soon as the value of the outcome, V , hits (or is below) the abandonment
threshold level for the follower, AQ , from Equation (29b),16 in the corresponding leader-follower case. This
is so because AQ is the optimal abandonment threshold level for the looser of the coin toss. As long as V
is above AQ the players do not need to know the outcome of the coin toss since it would not change their
investment decisions—both players would optimally continue investing for values of the outcome, V , above
AQ .
   Before the players ﬂip the coin to determine whom should be the follower and whom should be the leader
they each have a ﬁfty-ﬁfty chance of being the leader or being the follower. Hence, the value of each of the
two players’ investment projects in this case will be half the value of the leader’s investment project and half
the value of the follower’s investment project from the corresponding leader-follower case.
   In Figure 6 we show the values of the investment projects using the coin-toss solution as a function of the
value of the outcome, V , with our base case parameters. We denote these values 12 (P + Q)(V ). Obviously,
these are the values of each of the two players’ investment projects for a given value of the outcome before
the coin is ﬂipped. At the point in time when the coin is ﬂipped the value of the winner’s investment project
jumps up to the value of the leader’s investment project, P (V ), and the value of the looser’s investment

16Note that if A from Equation (29b) is above the ﬁxed investment costs, K, then the relevant abandonment threshold level
                Q
for the follower is ÃQ from Equation (33a) and not AQ from Equation (29b).
26                      REAL OPTIONS WITH UNCERTAIN MATURITY AND COMPETITION


project jumps down to the value of the follower’s investment project, Q(V ). It is interesting to note that
also the values of the investment projects using the coin-toss solution is a decreasing function of the value
of the outcome for values of the outcome just above the abandonment threshold level for the follower, AQ ,
(for V between 6.30 and 6.44 with our base case parameters). However, the interval in which the values of
the investment projects using the coin-toss solution is a decreasing function of the value of the outcome is
smaller than the interval where the values of the leader’s investment project is a decreasing function of the
values of the outcome because the values of the follower’s investment project is always an increasing function
of the value of the outcome.
   For values of the outcome in the interval between the abandonment threshold levels for the leader and for
the follower, i.e., for V ∈ (AM , AQ ), the interpretation of the values 12 (P + Q)(V ) is still that it is the values
to each of the two players before the coin is ﬂipped. One reason why these values can be of interest is that
the initial date-zero value of V may be in this range, i.e., V0 ∈ (AM , AQ ). In this case the players should
ﬂip the coin immediately and the looser should abandon as soon as the outcome is realized.
3.1.2.2. Variable Abandonment Intensity Solution. A problem with the Coin-Toss Solution, however, is that
it is not sequentially rational for the looser of the coin toss to actually abandon if she/he thinks that the
whole game can be repeated if she/he stays in. In continuous time repeated games can be deﬁned in diﬀerent
ways. The basic problem is that if there is not at least some ﬁnite time interval between points in time when
the game outlined in Table 2 can be repeated, then there is basically no costs of playing another round
and therefore none of the players will ever abandon. That is, we are not able to trade oﬀ the present value
of the on-going costs of keeping investing (for another round) and the present value (of the probability) of
becoming the monopolist.
   One way to introduce this trade oﬀ is to let each player choose an abandonment intensity at each instant in
time. It turns out that intensities play the same role in a continuous-time model as mixed strategies does in a
non-repeated game or even in a repeated game setting in discrete time. A player’s choice of an abandonment
intensity (i.e., a probability to abandon per unit of time) quantiﬁes her/his tendency to abandon versus
continuing investing in her/his investment project in the right way in a continuous-time model since all the
beneﬁts and costs are also in rates per unit of time.
   To be precise, we assume that each player has an associated Cox process with an intensity chosen by the
player. This intensity may vary over time. However, since the only state variable in our model is the value of
the outcome, V , and this process is Markovian, the intensity can at most depend on the current realization of
this process. We denote player i’s chosen abandonment intensity γi (V ), for i = 1, 2. The strategy of player
i is to continue investing in her/his investment project until the associated Cox process jumps. When the
Cox process jumps, player i should abandon her/his investment project. That is, player i abandons her/his
investment project with (instantaneous) probability γi (V ) per unit of time. We assume that, conditional on
V , the two Cox processes governing the actual abandonments of each of the two players are independent.
Player i’s strategy is completely determined by her/his chosen abandonment intensity, γi (V ). Hence, we will
call γi (V ) player i’s abandonment strategy.
   For values of the outcome, V , above the abandonment threshold level for the follower, AQ , in the corre-
sponding leader-follower case both players will continue investing for sure so they will both optimally choose
to have zero abandonment intensities, i.e., γi (V ) = 0 for V > AQ and i = 1, 2. For values of the outcome,
V , at or below the abandonment threshold level in the corresponding monopoly model, AM , both players
                          REAL OPTIONS WITH UNCERTAIN MATURITY AND COMPETITION                                            27


will abandon immediately so they will both optimally choose inﬁnitely high abandonment intensities, i.e.,
γi (V ) = ∞ for V ≤ AM and i = 1, 2. For values of the outcome, V , in the interval between AM and AQ ,
both players will optimally choose non-trivial abandonment intensities which trades oﬀ the on-going costs
of keeping investing in their individual investment projects and their individual value of (the probability
of) becoming the monopolist. Clearly, as soon as one of the players abandons her/his investment project,
the other player automatically becomes the monopolist, and therefore, it is optimal for her/him to switch
her/his abandonment intensity to zero.
  The interesting question is how the two players should choose their individual abandonment strategies,
γi (V ), for i = 1, 2, as their (instantaneous) responses in an instantaneously repeated game in continuous
time for all possible values of the outcome, V , in the (relevant) interval between AM and AQ .
  Let Ri (V ) denote the value of player i’s investment project in this case, i = 1, 2. Note that this value, in
general, will depend on both players chosen abandonment strategies, γj (V ), j = 1, 2.
   An essential argument in our approach to ﬁnding the abandonment strategies is that the chosen strate-
gies should be sequentially rational. That is, when the associated Cox process of one of the players, say
player i, jumps, indicating that player i should abandon her/his investment project, then it is essential that
abandonment is not a dominated strategy for player i. If player i’s value of continuing investing in her/his
investment project, Ri (V ), is strictly positive, then abandonment (which clearly has value zero) would be
dominated by continuing investing for player i. Hence, player i’s value of continuing investing in her/his
investment project cannot be strictly positive. On the other hand, if player i’s value of continuing investing
in her/his investment project is strictly negative, then the strategy of continued investing (with the cho-
sen abandonment intensities for both players, γi (V ), i = 1, 2) would be strictly dominated by immediate
abandonment (corresponding to an inﬁnitely high abandonment intensity) for player i. That is, the chosen
abandonment intensity for the players, γi (V ), i = 1, 2, for values of the outcome, V , in the interval between
AM and AQ can only lead to sequentially rational strategies if Ri (V ) = 0 for all values of the outcome, V ,
in the interval between AM and AQ and i = 1, 2.
   As it was the case in all the previous abandonment models we have analyzed in this paper, we have
to consider diﬀerent situations, depending on where the threshold levels for abandonment are compared
to the ﬁnal investment costs, K. For this case we will have three situations to analyze. We will have (i)
AM < AQ < K, (ii) AM < K ≤ ÃQ , and (iii) K ≤ ÃM < ÃQ . Here we analyze the ﬁrst situation when
AM < AQ < K. In Appendix F we analyze the two other situations, which are conceptually similar.
  As we have just argued, Ri (V ) = 0 for V ∈ (AM , AQ ] and i = 1, 2. On the other hand, using arguments
similar to all the other models analyzed in this paper, since player i is still investing in her/his investment
project, Ri (V ) is still a solution to the ODE

Here we use index j to refer to the other player, i.e. j = 3 − i. Mi (V ) denotes player i’s value of the
investment project in the corresponding monopoly model from sub-section 2.1.17 Since both players assign
the same value to the investment project in the corresponding monopoly model there is, strictly speaking, no
17In sub-section 2.1 we used subscripts on M (V ) to denote the diﬀerent general solutions to the diﬀerent ODEs in the system
of ODEs (3). Here we use subscripts to denote player speciﬁc values of becoming the monopolist.
28                      REAL OPTIONS WITH UNCERTAIN MATURITY AND COMPETITION


need for the index i on the value M (V ), but we think it clariﬁes our arguments if we allow for player speciﬁc
values of becoming the monopolist. For the same reason, we also allow for a player speciﬁc rate of on-going
investment costs, ki , in ODE (41). The ODE (41) describes the value of player i’s investment project when
it is out of the money. The ODE has the same terms as the ODE (24a) for the value of the follower’s
investment project and the ODE (34a) for the value of the leader’s investment project in the corresponding
leader-follower case and the explanations to these terms are the same. In addition, the ODE (41) has two
extra terms, γi (V ) + γj (V ) Ri (V ) and γj (V )Mi (V ). The term γi (V ) + γj (V ) Ri (V ) reﬂects the fact that
with intensity γi (V ) + γj (V ) either player i or player j will abandon. If it is player i who abandons then the
value of her/his investment project clearly jumps to zero. This corresponds to a loss in value of Ri (V ). If it is
player j who abandons, then player i becomes the monopolist and therefore the value of her/his investment
project jumps to Mi (V ). This corresponds to a jump in value of Mi (V ) − Ri (V ). This explains the second
term, γj (V )Mi (V ).
   Since Ri (V ) is zero over the whole interval (AM , AQ ], we know that both Ri (V ) and Ri (V ) must also be
zero in the whole open interval (AM , AQ ). Hence, from Equation (41) we conclude that the only way that the
chosen strategies for the two players can be sequentially rational is if player j chooses her/his abandonment
strategy to be

Clearly the same arguments apply to player i’s abandonment strategy. So player i chooses her/his abandon-
ment strategy to be γi∗ (V ) from Equation (42).
  The question is now whether the abandonment strategies (γ1∗ (V ), γ2∗ (V )), from Equation (42), form a
Nash equilibrium. We show formally that this is the case in Appendix E. Basically the argument is that as
long as both players use the abandonment strategies, γi∗ (V ), i = 1, 2, both players’ values of their individual
investment projects, Ri (V ), are zero. The question is now whether any of the players, say player i, has
any incentives to deviate from using the abandonment intensity γi∗ (V ), given that she/he knows that the
other player (player j) uses the abandonment intensity γj∗ (V ). When player i’s value of her/his investment
project, Ri (V ), is zero, and she/he knows that player j uses the abandonment intensity, γj∗ (V ), then player i is
instantaneously indiﬀerent between any choice of her/his own abandonment intensity—including immediate
abandonment. So there is no other strategy, i.e. no other choice of abandonment intensity, for player i that
is strictly better than using the abandonment intensity, γi∗ (V ). Since this argument applies for both players,
the abandonment strategies (γ1∗ (V ), γ2∗ (V )), from Equation (42), form a Nash equilibrium. Moreover, player
i is only indiﬀerent between any choice of her/his own abandonment intensities exactly when player j uses the
abandonment intensity γj∗ (V ), and similarly, player j is only indiﬀerent between any choice of her/his own
abandonment intensities exactly when player i uses the abandonment intensity γi∗ (V ), so there is only one
Nash equilibrium where the two players use non-trivial abandonment strategies for values of the outcome,
V in the interval (AM , AQ ]. However, as we formally show in Appendix E, there are exactly three Nash

equilibria. The two other Nash equilibria are the two pure strategy equilibria corresponding to the cases
where one of the players is the follower and the other one is the leader analyzed in sub-sub-section 3.1.1.18
  Since the two players have the same beneﬁts of becoming a monopolist, M (V ), and also have the same
rate of on-going investment costs, k, it is clear from Equation (42) that the two players choose identical
abandonment intensities. We will denote this common abandonment intensity function, γ ∗ (V ).19 Moreover,
the two players will also have identical values of their individual investment projects. We will denote this
value R(V ). As we have already argued, R(V ) = 0 for all values of the outcome below (and including)
AQ . For values of the outcome, V , above the abandonment threshold level for the follower, AQ , in the
corresponding leader-follower case, the value of each of the two players’ investment projects is a solutions to
the same system of ODEs as we set up both for the follower (24) and the leader (34). Hence, the solutions
to each of the two ODEs, which we denote R1 (V ) and R2 (V ), are20

(44c)                                                  R1 (K) = R2 (K),

Conditions (44a) and (44b) are actually continuity and diﬀerentiability conditions at the abandonment
threshold level for the follower, AQ , in the corresponding leader-follower case. The right hand side of
these equations are zero because, as we have argued, R(V ) = 0 for V ∈ (AM , AQ ] and R (V ) = 0 for
V ∈ (AM , AQ ).21 Conditions (44c) and (44d) are the usual continuity and diﬀerentiability conditions at the
ﬁnal investment costs, K. The boundary conditions (44) are identical to the boundary conditions for the
follower in the corresponding leader-follower case from the system of equations (28). So because both the
general solutions to the system of ODEs are the same as for the value of the follower’s investment project,
compare Equations (27) and (43), and also the boundary conditions are the same, compare Equations (28)
and (44), the two players’ investment projects have exactly the same value as the value of the follower’s

18Readers familiar with game theory can compare our variable abandonment intensity game with the battle of the sexes game
in e.g., Gibbons (1992a,b, Chapter 1). This game also has three Nash equilibria. Two pure strategy equilibria and one (Pareto
inferior) mixed strategy equilibrium.
19The common value of the investment project in the corresponding monopoly model, M (V ), to substitute into Equation (42)
is M1 (V ) from Equation (6a).
20To keep the notation consistent with the previous sub-sections of this paper, the subscripts on R(V ) now refer to the diﬀerent
general solutions of the diﬀerent ODEs from the system of ODEs (24) (and (34)) and not to the individual players’ values of
their individual investment projects.
21Since we want R(V ) to be diﬀerentiable at the value A , we also have that R (A ) = 0.

investment project in the corresponding leader-follower case. That is, the value of each of the two players’
investment projects is

(45)                                                    R(V ) = Q(V ).

Since the value of each of the two players’ investment projects, when they play the variable abandonment
intensity game, is the same as the value of the follower’s investment project in the corresponding leader-
follower case, the variable abandonment intensity Nash equilibrium is, however, Pareto inferior to both
of the two pure strategy leader-follower equilibria. But as we have argued previously, if the players are
(truly) identical and they are not allowed to communicate, there is no mechanism to select one of the two
leader-follower equilibria from the other.22
   The values of the follower’s investment project (denoted Q(V )) shown in Figure 6 also represents the
values of the two identical players’ investment projects when they play the variable abandonment intensity
game. There is however an important diﬀerence in the investment decisions. The follower abandons her/his
investment project as soon as the value of the outcome hits (or is below) the abandonment threshold level,
AQ . The two players playing the variable abandonment intensity game, on the other hand, keep investing in
their individual investment projects also for values of the outcome below the abandonment threshold level,
AQ . The values of their individual investment projects just happens to be zero for all values of the outcome,
V in the range between the abandonment threshold level for the corresponding monopoly model, AM , and
the abandonment threshold level for the follower in the corresponding leader-follower case, AQ , because of
the variable abandonment intensity game they are playing with each other in this range. The players apply
just the right intensity of abandonment in order to balance the other player’s chances of getting the monopoly
value and her/his on-going costs of keeping investing. Eventually when one of the two players abandons in
this range the value of the other player’s investment project jumps up to the corresponding monopoly value
(denoted M (V ) in Figure 6).
   In Figure 7 we show the abandonment intensities for each of the two players as a function of the value
of the outcome, V , with our base case parameters. We denote the abandonment intensities γ ∗ (V ). In the
ﬁgure we also show the abandonment threshold level for the follower in the corresponding leader-follower
case and the abandonment threshold level in the corresponding monopoly model on the horizontal axis. We
denote the abandonment threshold level for the follower in the corresponding leader-follower case as AQ and
the abandonment threshold level in the corresponding monopoly model AM . The exact levels are AQ = 6.30
and AM = 5.26 with our base case parameters. For values of the outcome below AM the abandonment
intensities are inﬁnitely high and for values of the outcome above AQ the abandonment intensities are zero.
This means that the abandonment intensity jumps at the abandonment threshold levels for the follower in
the corresponding leader-follower case, AQ . That is, γ ∗ (AQ ) = 3.89 with our base case parameters. But for
any V > AQ , γ ∗ (V ) = 0. Finally, note how dramatically the abandonment intensities increase as the value
of the outcome, V , becomes smaller. This is so because as V becomes smaller so does the value of becoming
the monopolist but the on-going costs of keeping investing stays at the same rate, k.




22This is also the case in the battle of the sexes game (Gibbons, 1992a,b, Chapter 1). In this game the mixed strategy equilibrium
is also Pareto inferior to the two pure strategy equilibria. But again, if the two players are not allowed to communicate, there
is no mechanism to select one of the two pure strategy equilibria from the other.

            AQ = 6.30 and AM = 5.26. For values of the outcome below AM the abandonment intensi-
            ties are inﬁnitely high and for values of the outcome above AQ the abandonment intensities
            are zero. All other parameters are given in Table 1.

3.2. Model with Switching Option. Finally we will consider the model where two identical players each
can switch (costlessly) between an active and a passive investment project. As it was the case in sub-
section 2.2, where we analyzed the corresponding monopoly model, we ﬁnd the switching points of the two
players by an instantaneous trade-oﬀ argument. Again, as it was the case in the corresponding monopoly
model, it is clearly optimal for both players to be in passive state when the investment projects are out of
the money. Hence, each of the players’ switching points will be above the ﬁnal investment costs, K. Let
32                      REAL OPTIONS WITH UNCERTAIN MATURITY AND COMPETITION


U i (V ) denote the value of player i’s investment project. The players decide whether to be active or passive
by considering the normal form representation of the game in Table 3. Take Player one. The instantaneous
beneﬁts of being active is the value ﬂow from the intensity of completion, λ(V − K). The instantaneous
costs of being active is the intensity of loosing the investment project, which has a value ﬂow of λU 1 (V ), and
the on-going investment costs at the rate k. If the other player (Player two) is active there is an additional
instantaneous cost, namely the intensity of loosing the investment project in case she/he ﬁnishes her/his
investment project. This instantaneous cost also has a value ﬂow of λU 1 (V ). Player one incurs this ﬂow of
costs whether she/he is active or passive her-/himself. We can apply exactly the same arguments for Player
two.
  Based on the normal form representation of the game in Table 3 we see that Active is a strictly dominating
strategy for player i for values of the outcome, V , such that

                                             λ(V − K) > λU i (V ) + k

and that Passive is a strictly dominating strategy for player i for values of the outcome, V , such that

                                            λ(V − K) < λU i (V ) + k.

Hence, if the two players have the same value functions, they will use the same switching point, which we
will denote, SU . So if the two players are identical, they will use the same switching point and have the
same values of their individual investment projects. So we can skip the superscript on U (V ) for the values
of the two players’ investment projects. Moreover, we ﬁnd the switching point, SU , by solving

(46)                                        λ(SU − K) = λU (SU ) + k.

Following arguments similar to the previous models, U (V ) must satisfy the system of ODEs
              1 2 2 
(47a)           σ V U (V ) + μV U  (V ) − rU (V ) = 0                                   when V < SU ,
              2
and
              1 2 2 
(47b)           σ V U (V ) + μV U  (V ) − (r + 2λ)U (V ) − k + λ(V − K) = 0             when SU < V.
              2
Equation (47a) is the same as Equation (12a) for the corresponding monopoly model and similarly, Equa-
tion (47b) is the same as Equation (24b) for the follower and Equation (34b) for the leader. Moreover,
the explanations for the terms are the same. Using the same arguments as in the monopoly model, cf.
sub-section 2.2, we get the solutions to each of the two ODEs, (47a) and (47b), which we denote U1 (V ) and
U2 (V ), as

(48a)            U1 (V ) = u11 V x1                                             when V ≤ SU ,

and

(48b)            U2 (V ) = u22 V z2 +                −                          when SU ≤ V.
                                        2 + (r − μ)T   2 + rT
The value of each of the two players’ investment projects has the following boundary conditions

(49a)                                           U1 (SU ) = U2 (SU )
                       REAL OPTIONS WITH UNCERTAIN MATURITY AND COMPETITION                                    33


and

(49b)                                            U1 (SU ) = U2 (SU ).

These conditions are the usual continuity and diﬀerentiability conditions at the switching point, SU . In
order to ﬁnd solutions for the three unknowns, u11 , u22 , and SU , we solve the system of equations from (46)
and (49). The solution is
                                    (x1 + (x1 − z2 )(1 + rT ))(2 + (r − μ)T )(kT + K)

                                    z2 (2 + (r − μ)T )(kT + K) + (1 − z2 )(2 + rT )SU

                                            (x1 − z2 )(2 + (r − μ)T )(2 + rT )SUx1

and
                                    x1 (2 + (r − μ)T )(kT + K) − (x1 − 1)(2 + rT )SU
(50c)                       u22 =                                                    .

Note the close similarity to the corresponding monopoly solution from the system of equations (20) in sub-
section 2.2. Note also that by the same arguments as in sub-section 2.2, we can use Equation (46) to argue
that SU > kT + K as long as U (SU ) > 0. Moreover, since U (V ) < N (V ) for all V ≥ 0 it is clear that
SU < SN . Finally, the value of each of the two players’ investment project is
                                   ⎧
                                   ⎨u V x 1                        when V < SU ,

                                   ⎩u V z2 +      V
                                                         − kT +K   when S ≤ V.

Note that the value function for each of the two players’ investment projects, U (V ), is not two times
diﬀerentiable at the duopoly switching point, SU , (unless λ = 0) because of the way the switching point is
selected in the game between the the two players, cf. Equation (46).
  If we again look at the special case of the perpetual American option as we did in sub-section 2.2, we see
that by inserting T = 0 into Equation (50a) we get the well-known competitive exercise threshold level for
the perpetual American option

(52)                                                   SU = K

and thereby a value of zero of the option in this special case. Note that in this special case U (V ) = 0 for all
V , so it is not a violation of Equation (46) to have SU = K.
  In Figure 8 we show the values of the two players’ investment projects as a function of the value of
the outcome, V , with our base case parameters. We denote these values U (V ). For comparison we also
show in the ﬁgure the values of the corresponding monopoly investment project and the values of the
corresponding investment projects using the coin-toss solution. We denote the values of the corresponding
monopoly investment project N (V ) and the values of the corresponding investment projects using the coin-
toss solution 12 (P + Q)(V ). (Note that the scale on the horizontal axis in Figure 8 is diﬀerent from Figure 6,
where we had also shown the coin-toss solution.) In Figure 8 we also show the corresponding switching
points on the horizontal axis. The switching point for the duopoly model we denote SU and the switching
point for the monopoly model we denote SN . The exact levels are SU = 13.05 and SN = 37.58 with our base
case parameters. For high levels of the outcome the values of the two players’ investment projects converge
to the value of the corresponding investment project using the coin-toss solution (and thereby also to both

the values of the leader’s and the follower’s investment projects, cf. Figure 6) because the options to switch
and to abandon become far out of the money and thereby their values become relatively small compared to
the intrinsic values of the investment projects which are identical for the two players’ investment projects
and the corresponding investment projects using the coin-toss solution. Finally, a careful look at Figure 8
shows that the curvature of the value function, U (V ), changes at the duopoly switching point, SU . This
indicates that this function is not two times diﬀerentiable at the duopoly switching point, SU .
   In Figure 9 we show the switching points for the duopoly model as a function of the expected time to
completion, T , with our base case parameters. We denote the switching points for the duopoly model SU .
For comparison we also show in this ﬁgure the corresponding switching point for the monopoly model, cf.
sub-section 2.2. We denote the switching points for the monopoly model SN . The monopoly switching points
are also shown in Figure 4, although in a diﬀerent scale. The monopoly switching points are substantially
higher than the corresponding duopoly switching points for all values of the expected time to completion, T ,
due to the lack of competition. For T = 0, the switching point in the duopoly model is equal to K (as derived

                                                                      x1
in Equation (52)) and for the monopoly model it is equal to          x1 −1 K   = 35.75 (as derived in Equation (22))
with our base case parameters.
  This analysis has some important policy implications. First of all, competition accelerates investments
and therefore reduces (expected) time to completion. For values of the outcome between the switching point
for the duopolists, SU (which with our base case parameters is around 5–12 depending on the intensity of
completion, λ), and the switching point for the monopolist, SN (which with our base case parameters is
around 32–36 depending on the intensity of completion, λ), a monopolist would remain passive whereas the
duopolists would be active. As we explain in the conclusion (Section 5) we could easily compute the expected
time to completion for both of the two cases in closed form and make an exact comparison. Secondly, since the
switching point would never go below the ﬁnal investment costs, K, even with a large number of competing
investment projects we see that in this model just the step from one monopolist to two duopolists brings us
most of the way from monopoly to full competition.


                                                     4. Extensions

  In this section we analyze the model where at the completion of the project the owner obtains a perpetual
American option on the value of the outcome. Up to now we have assumed that at the completion date of the
36                     REAL OPTIONS WITH UNCERTAIN MATURITY AND COMPETITION


investment project, the owner must exercise immediately the option to pay the ﬁnal ﬁxed investment costs.
That is, if the project is in the money at the completion date, τ , then the value of the investment project is
V − K. Moreover, if the investment project happens to be completed at a time when it is out of the money
we have up to now assumed that it is valueless. Now we extend the model by giving the owner the option
to delay paying the ﬁxed ﬁnal investment costs in order to obtain the value of the outcome. This extension
is especially interesting when the project is completed out of the money. Take, e.g, an R&D investment or
a mine exploration project where a product/mine has been discovered (i.e., we are at the completion date),
but the owner would like to wait until the optimal time to build the plant and launch the product/mineral.
  We will only develop this extension for the monopoly model with the abandonment option, which we
analyzed in sub-section 2.1. Similar analysis could be done for all the other models we have developed in this
paper. Instead of the exercise value of the investment project, max{V − K, 0}, at the completion date, τ , the
owner gets the value of a perpetual American call option. We denote the value of the perpetual American
call option H(V ). Since the owner is paying on-going investment costs at the rate k, there will still be an
abandonment threshold level, which we denote AL , so that the owner abandons her/his investment project
when the value of the outcome is below AL . However, since H(V ) is always greater than (or equal to) the
exercise value of the American call option, max{V − K, 0}, it is clear that the abandonment threshold level,
AL , for this extension is less than the corresponding abandonment threshold level, AM , for the monopoly
model with abandonment analyzed in sub-section 2.1. Let L(V ) denote the value of the investment project
for this extension. L(V ) must satisfy the ODE
            1 2 2 
(53)          σ V L (V ) + μV L (V ) − (r + λ)L(V ) − k + λH(V ) = 0               when AL < V.
            2
If we compare the ODE (53) to the system of ODEs (3) for the value of the investment project in sub-
section 2.1, we have simply changed the completion value from max{V − K, 0} in the system of ODEs (3)
to the value of a perpetual American call option, H(V ), in the ODE (53). It is well-known that the value of
the American perpetual call option, H(V ), is

numerically using the closed form solutions from the system of equations (58).
   Figure 10 shows that the value in this case, L(V ), is always larger than the monopoly case we discussed
in sub-section 2.1, M (V ), especially for lower values of the outcome, V . For very high values of the outcome
these two values will converge since the completion will bring immediate exercise of the American call option.
The ﬁgure also shows the completion values for these two cases, H(V ) and V − K.

                                                            5. Conclusions

   In this paper we develop a simple, yet powerful, framework to deal with real investment projects with
uncertain investment costs and time to completion. We apply the framework to situations in which the
owner of the project has monopoly rights to the outcome of the project, and to situations in which there
are two owners who simultaneously invest, but where only one of them (the ﬁrst to complete) may obtain
the rights to the outcome. We obtain analytical solutions to important cases with abandonment and/or
switching to diﬀerent levels of investment activity. Hence, we are able to easily compare the project values
and abandonment/switching threshold levels for the diﬀerent cases.
  Our framework can also be applied to derive closed form solutions to the expected time to completion,
probability of completion, expected cost until completion, etc. Basically, all of these key values satisfy very
similar ODEs as the value of the investment project. One simply adjusts the payoﬀ rates and the discount
rates in the ODEs. Hence, the formulas for these key values have the same structure as the formula for the

23As in the other models with abandonment options we have analyzed in this paper, there are diﬀerent situations. Here we
analyze the most common (and also most complicated) situation when AL < EH . However, even though it may seem quite
exotic, we cannot rule out that for extremely high on-going costs, k, the abandonment threshold level for the investment project,
AL , is so high that it is above the exercise threshold level, EH , for the American option received at completion. In this situation
the value of the investment project is identical to the standard monopoly model analyzed in sub-section 2.1. That is, if A˜M
from Equation (11a) is greater than (or equal to) EH from Equation (55), then the value of the investment project—even with
the American option extension—is still given by Equation (10) in sub-section 2.1.

value of the investment projects. Moreover, the value of the investment project can also be divided into three
parts: the value of the outcome at completion, the value of all the on-going investment costs until completion
(or abandonment), and the value of the ﬁxed investment costs at completion. However, it is always necessary
ﬁrst to solve for the value of the project in order to ﬁnd the optimal abandonment/switching levels.
  The duopoly models we have developed easily extend to more than two players. For example in the
abandonment case, the leader-follower solution easily extends to more than two players if we know the order
in which they abandon. Given this solution, the variable abandonment intensity solution also easily extends
to more than two players.

  Anther interesting extension of our framework would be to include asymmetric information between the
two players. For example, each player knows her/his own on-going investment cost rate exactly, but she/he
only knows the distribution of the other player’s on-going costs. The knowledge of the other player’s on-going
investment costs is updated as time progresses observing that he/she still has not abandoned.
   Finally, a possible application of our framework is to analyze the design of research incentives for non-
proﬁtable R&D investments as analyzed numerically by Hsu and Schwartz (2006).


Appendix A. Monopoly Model with Abandonment Option: Derivation of the value of the
                              investment project when AM ≥ K.

   Assume that the abandonment threshold level is above the ﬁnal investment costs, K. In this situation,
the value of the investment project (still denoted M (V )) must satisfy the ODE
         1 2 2 
(60)       σ V M (V ) + μV M  (V ) − (r + λ)M (V ) − k + λ(V − K) = 0                    when ÃM < V.
         2
Note that we denote the abandonment threshold level ÃM to emphasize that it may be diﬀerent from the
solution obtained in Equation (8b). The general solution of the ODE (60), which we denote M3 (V ), is
                                             V        kT + K
(61)            M3 (V ) = m32 V y2 +                −                            when ÃM ≤ V.
                                       1 + (r − μ)T   1 + rT
Using the same arguments as in sub-section 2.1, we have eliminated the V y1 term in Equation (61). The
boundary conditions are

(62a)                                              M3 (ÃM ) = 0

In this situation we just solve the system of equations (62) in the two unknowns m32 and ÃM . The solution
is

   As in the ﬁrst model we analyzed in sub-section 2.1 we will have to consider both the situation where we
assume that the abandonment threshold level, AO , is below the ﬁnal investment costs, K, and the situation
40                      REAL OPTIONS WITH UNCERTAIN MATURITY AND COMPETITION


where it is above. So ﬁrst we assume that AO < K. Let O(V ) denote the value of the investment project
for this model. O(V ) must satisfy the system of ODEs
            1 2 2 
(63a)         σ V O (V ) + μV O (V ) − (r + λ)O(V ) − k = 0                                    when AO < V < K,
            2
            1 2 2 
(63b)         σ V O (V ) + μV O (V ) − (r + λ)O(V ) − k + λ(V − K) = 0                         when K < V < SO ,
            2
and

            2
The general solutions to each of the three ODEs, (63a), (63b), and (63c), which we denote O1 (V ), O2 (V ),
and O3 (V ), are
                                               kT

Here the powers, w1 and w2 , are given by

The powers y1 and y2 are still deﬁned by the system of equations (5). Comparing the powers w1 and w2
with the corresponding powers y1 and y2 , we see that w1 > y1 > 1 and that w2 < y2 < 0. Using the same
arguments as for the previous models, we know that limV →∞ O3V(V ) must be ﬁnite. Hence, we can eliminate
the V w1 term in Equation (64c). The value of the investment project has the following boundary conditions

Condition (66a) reﬂects the fact that at the abandonment threshold level, AO , the value of the investment
project is zero. Condition (66b) is the usual smooth pasting condition at the abandonment threshold level.
Conditions (66c) and (66d) are the usual continuity and diﬀerentiability conditions at the ﬁnal investment
costs, K, and similarly, Conditions (66e) and (66f) are the usual continuity and diﬀerentiability conditions
at the switching point, SO . In order to ﬁnd the optimal switching point, SO , we solve

(66g)                             (λ̄ − λ)(SO − K) = (λ̄ − λ)O3 (SO ) + (k̄ − k).

Equation (66g) is based on the following instantaneous trade-oﬀ argument. At each instant in time the owner
considers instantaneous costs and beneﬁts from switching between the two activity levels. The increased
instantaneous beneﬁts from switching from the low to the high activity level is the increased intensity of
completion which has a value ﬂow (λ̄ − λ)(V − K) per unit of time. On the other hand the increased
instantaneous costs of switching are (i) the increased intensity of loosing the investment project which has a
value ﬂow (λ̄ − λ)O3 (V ) per unit of time and (ii) the increased on-going investment costs at the rate k̄ − k
per unit of time. By the same arguments as in the switching model from sub-section 2.2, Equation (66g)
also implies that the value function, O(V ), will be two times diﬀerentiable at the switching point, SO . That
is,

In order to ﬁnd solutions for the seven unknowns, o11 , o12 , o21 , o22 , o32 , AO , and SO , we must solve the
system of equations (66). We are able to solve ﬁve of these equations in closed form as functions of AO and
SO using the Equations (66a), (66b), (66c), (66d), and (66f):

     If it turns out that the numerical solution to AO is greater than K, we reconsider the problem. In this

   To prove that the abandonment strategies (γ1∗ (V ), γ2∗ (V )), from Equation (42), form a Nash equilibrium,
we look at each of the players best response correspondences. Player i’s best response correspondence is
player i’s set of best responses25 (in form of a set of abandonment intensities) to any given abandonment
intensity, γj , chosen by player j, for a given value of the outcome, V . We denote player i’s best response
correspondence γi∗ (γj ; V ).
   In order to ﬁnd player i’s (set of) best responses to any given strategy, γj , chosen by player j, we study
player i’s instantaneous beneﬁts and costs for a given value of the outcome, V , in the interval (AM , AQ ], and
for given strategies chosen by the two players, γi and γj . Player i’s instantaneous beneﬁts are the intensity
of becoming the monopolist, which only happens if player j abandons. This has a value ﬂow γj Mi (V ) per
unit of time. (There is no value ﬂow from the intensity of completion since player i’s investment project
is out of the money.) Player i’s instantaneous costs are (i) the intensity of loosing the investment project
either due to abandonment from one of the players or due to completion (out of the money), which has a
value ﬂow 2λ + γi + γj Ri (V ) per unit of time, and (ii) the on-going costs at the rate ki per unit of time.
Hence, player i’s instantaneous net beneﬁts (denoted πi (γi , γj ; V )) are

(83)                             πi (γi , γj ; V ) = γj Mi (V ) − 2λ + γi + γj Ri (V ) − ki .

Since we know that Ri (V ) = 0, πi (γi , γj ; V ) reduces to

(84)                                           πi (γi , γj ; V ) = γj Mi (V ) − ki .

Take a given value of the outcome, V , in the interval (AM , AQ ]. If player j chooses an abandonment
intensity, γj , which is strictly less than γj∗ (V ) from Equation (42), then player i’s instantaneous net beneﬁts,
πi (γi , γj ; V ), is strictly negative, since Mi (V ) is positive. Hence, the best response for player i would be
immediate abandonment. On the other hand, if player j chooses an abandonment intensity, γj , which is
strictly greater than γj∗ (V ) from Equation (42) then player i’s instantaneous net beneﬁts, πi (γi , γj ; V ), is
strictly positive. Hence, the best response for player i would be to continue investing with zero abandonment
intensity. Finally, if player j chooses exactly the abandonment intensity γj∗ (V ) from Equation (42), then
player i’s instantaneous net beneﬁts, πi (γi , γj ; V ), is zero for any choice of his own abandonment intensity,
γi , (including immediate abandonment). Hence, player i is completely indiﬀerent between any choice of his

25The best response correspondence is a generalization of the best response function. Generally, a function returns one value
for a given input. A correspondence returns a set of values for a given input. Player i may have more than one best response to
a given strategy from the other player (player j). The correspondence returns all these responses as a set. (Clearly player i is
indiﬀerent between playing any of these strategies in the set, otherwise they would not all be part of his set of best responses.)

Clearly the same arguments apply to player j’s best response correspondence. So player j’s best response
correspondence is γj∗ (γi ; V ) from Equation (85).
   For a given value of the outcome, V , in the interval (AM , AQ ], we plot the two players’ best response
correspondences in Figure 11. Player one’s best response correspondence (the dotted line) is plotted as a
function of player two’s abandonment intensity, γ2 . That is, the independent variable (γ2 ) is on the vertical
axis and the outcome (i.e. the set of best responses) is on the horizontal axis. Player two’s best response
correspondence (the solid line) is plotted as a function of player one’s abandonment intensity, γ1 . We see that

the two players’ best response correspondences cross three times indicating three Nash equilibria. These are
the two leader-follower equilibria and the variable abandonment intensity solution. Hence, we have shown
that the abandonment strategies (γ1∗ (V ), γ2∗ (V )), from Equation (42), form a Nash equilibrium. Note the
similarity between this argument and the standard arguments used to explain why a mixed strategy is a
Nash equilibrium in a simple non-repeated game, (cf. Gibbons, 1992a,b, Chapter 1).

The argument why the abandonment strategies (γ1∗ (V ), γ2∗ (V )), from Equation (87), form a Nash equilibrium
is the same as in the previous situation. Player i’s instantaneous net beneﬁts in this situation is

for values of the outcome, V , in the relevant range, i.e. V ∈ (AM , ÃQ ]. Since again the two players have the
same beneﬁts of becoming a monopolist, M (V ), and also have the same rate of on-going investment costs,
k, the two players choose identical abandonment intensities. We again denote this common abandonment
intensity function γ ∗ (V ),26 and their common individual investment project value R(V ). For values of the
outcome, V , above the abandonment threshold level for the follower, ÃQ , in the corresponding leader-follower
case, the value of each of the two players’ investment projects is a solutions to the same ODE as we set up


26The common values of the investment projects in the corresponding monopoly model, M (V ), to substitute into Equation (87)
is M1 (V ) from Equation (6a) when AM < V ≤ K and M2 (V ) from Equation (6b) when K < V ≤ ÃQ .

both for the follower (75) and the leader (78). Hence, the solutions to the ODE, which we denote R3 (V ), is

Moreover, the boundary conditions are

Because both the general solutions to the system of ODEs are the same as for the value of the follower’s
investment project, compare Equations (76) and (89), and also the boundary conditions are the same,
compare Equations (77) and (90), the two players’ investment projects have exactly the same value as the
value of the follower’s investment project in the corresponding leader-follower case. That is,

(91)                                                R(V ) = Q(V ).

   Finally, assume that we are in the situation when K ≤ ÃM < ÃQ . We have already argued that Ri (V ) = 0
for V ∈ (ÃM , ÃQ ] and i = 1, 2. Since player i is still investing in her/his investment project, Ri (V ) is still a
solution to the ODE
