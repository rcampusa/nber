                                          ABSTRACT

Over the 1948­2013 period, many factors significantly impacted on human capital, which in turn
affected economic growth in the United States. This chapter analyzes these factors within a
complete national income accounting system which integrates Jorgenson-Fraumeni human capital
into the accounts. By including human capital, a fresh perspective on economic growth across time
and within specific subperiods is revealed, notably regarding the 1995­2000 and 2007­2009
periods. During the 1995­2000 period, the reduction in human capital investment significantly
reduced apparent economic growth. In the 2007­2009 period, the increase in human capital
investment tempered the negative impact of the Great Recession. Over the longer time period, first
the post-World War baby boom and then the substantial increase in education led to higher
economic growth than otherwise expected. As the pace of increase in education slowed and the
workforce aged toward the end of the period, human capital induced growth was reduced.

            The Accumulation of Human and Market Capital in the United States:
                                      The Long View, 1948­2013



Over the 1948­2013 period, many factors significantly impacted on human capital. In 1948, the
post-World War II baby boom was well underway. The G.I. Bill (Servicemen's Readjustment
Act of 1944) provided stipends for tuition and expenses for veterans attending colleges and trade
schools, facilitating matriculation. The average educational attainment by both men and women
increased by over 55 percent between 1950 and 2010. By 2010 women were on average slightly
more educated than men and those aged 25-34 were almost seven percentage points more likely
than men to complete tertiary education. Most of the labor force changes came from increasing
participation by women. Civilian labor force participation for prime age (35-44 year old) women,
rose from about 35 percent in 1950 to 77 percent in 2000, before declining slightly to 75 percent
in 2010. Only about 23 percent of married women were part of the civilian labor force in 1948,
but by 1970, this number had climbed to 41 percent. By 1980, the "V" drop in civilian female
labor force participation during child-bearing ages had disappeared. Male prime age civilian
labor force participation by decade peaked in 1970 at about 97 percent, then declined over the
subsequent decades to less than 92 percent in 2010. Just over halfway through the covered
period, in the mid-eighties, the so-called "Great Moderation" began. In this "moderation,"
business cycles were less volatile, which tends to increase employment stability and therefore the
potential pay-off from further education.1 Towards the end of the covered period, the 2007­2009
Great Recession ended this moderation and reduced employment significantly.

This chapter is the fourth in a series of human capital accounting papers using Jorgenson-
Fraumeni methodology. The first in this series established the methodology and emphasis used
in subsequent papers (Jorgenson and Fraumeni, 1989). The second, published 28 years later,
updated the accounts to reflect many changes in the U.S. national accounts over that time period.
The period covered in the second paper includes a gap as human capital estimates from 1985
through 1997 (Fraumeni et al., 2017). The third is the only one in the series which breaks out
human capital by gender (Fraumeni and Christian, 2019). As gender-specific estimates are not
available in Jorgenson and Fraumeni (1989) the coverage of the 2019 paper begins in 1975. This
chapter includes a much longer time period--65 years--than in the previous three papers,
accordingly the term "long view" is part of the chapter title.2 The human capital estimates from

 Two other papers by Jorgenson and Fraumeni are frequently cited: Jorgenson and Fraumeni, 1992a and 1992b.
1992a is cited because it imbeds an education and human capital sector within an aggregate GDP account. The
1992b paper is cited because for the first time it includes the equations underlying the methodology.
1948 through 1975 are from Jorgenson and Fraumeni (1989); those from 1976 are constructed by
Christian (2017) and modified to more closely conform to the Jorgenson-Fraumeni methodology.

An important continuing contribution of this paper series is to integrate human capital estimates
with the system of national accounts (SNA). The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) National
Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) data for this paper was collected subsequent to the 14th
comprehensive revision of the NIPAs.1 Comprehensive revisions typically occur every five
years (BEA, 2013: 13­39), accordingly many have occurred since 1948. The NIPAs are the
basis for almost all of the core accounts data in this chapter except for human capital data. There
have been many definitional, classification, source data, methodological, and presentation
changes as a result of the revisions and it is important to integrate the human capital estimates
with the latest definitions used in the U.S. national accounts. It was not until 1951 that constant
dollar estimates of Gross National Product (GNP) were released (Jaszi and Kendrick, 1951).2
Many methodological or statistical improvements have been made since then. Boskin (2000)
counted 160 revisions to nominal dollar Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in six comprehensive
revisions beginning in 1976 and ending in 1999; certainly, many revisions occurred in the
comprehensive revisions before and after the revisions he analyzed. A number of the revisions
were concerned with prices or quality change, such as hedonic price indexes for computers and
implementation of chained Fisher ideal indexes. Other changes include the classification of
software, research and development, and entertainment and literary artistic originals as
investment, separation of government expenditures into consumption versus investment,
measurement of implicit services provided by property and casualty insurance and by
commercial banks, and a complete revamping of the table presentation of the accounts.3 In
addition, the NIPAs changed over time to be in greater conformity with the SNA.4

This chapter is organized into six sections: I) Human capital methodology, II) Factors impacting
on human and market capital, III) Overview of the accounts, IV) Analysis of the accounts in
nominal dollars, V) Analysis of contributions and rates of growth, and VI) Conclusion.

I.       Human Capital Methodology

The measures of human capital employed in this account are based on the methodology of
Jorgenson and Fraumeni (1989). The Jorgenson-Fraumeni approach measures human capital as
nominal lifetime earnings, in present discounted value, of all living people--adults and children--
in an economy. Quantities are measured using chain indexes with the exception of quantities
such as net investment, which can include negative components; prices are implicitly determined
from the nominal values and the quantities.5 The Jorgenson-Fraumeni approach includes both a

  Quantities such as net investment, which can include negative components, are created using additive aggregation.
Fisher indexes are the basis for underlying measures; Törnqvist indexes are used to create aggregates which include

market component, which is measured using nominal lifetime market labor compensation, as
well as a nonmarket component, which is measured using lifetime value of time spent in
nonmarket activities other than schooling and personal maintenance. Including nonmarket
activities during the 1948 to 2013 period is particularly important as notably women changed
time spent in various activities. Time spent in nonmarket work decreased as time spent in
market work increased.

The Jorgenson-Fraumeni approach measures nominal lifetime earnings, using equation (1):

          , , ,            , , ,       1             1      ,          ,          ,       , ,         ,      , ,
                                                                                                                         (1)
                                   1             1         ,   ,           1          ,         , ,          ,     , ,

where  is the discount rate (set to 0.04);  is the earnings growth rate (set to 0.02); and, for a
person in year y of age a, sex s, and level of education e:

             , , ,     is average nominal lifetime earnings, in present discounted value;
               , , ,    is average nominal yearly earnings;
           , , , which is assumed to not vary by education, is the survival rate from year y to year
          y+1; and
           , , , is the school attendance rate.

It is assumed that nominal lifetime earnings at a maximum age (in this application, age seventy-
five) are equal to zero among men and women in all years at all levels of education. With this
assumption, it is possible to work backwards by age, using equation (1), to compute average
nominal lifetime earnings for all combinations of year, sex, age, and education, given measures
of average nominal yearly earnings, school enrollment rates, and survival rates by year, age, sex,
and education.

The Jorgenson-Fraumeni model divides the life cycle into five stages (Jorgenson and Fraumeni,
1992b). In the first stage, people neither earn income ( , , , = 0), nor do they attend school
( , , , = 0). This period covers all ages up to age four. In the second stage, people do not
earn income ( , , , = 0), but they may attend school ( , , ,  0). This period lasts from
age five to either age thirteen (up to 1975) or fourteen (1976 and after); the post-1976 accounts
constructed by Christian (2017) ends this phase at age fourteen following a change in 1980 to the
minimum age for recording work experience and income in the March Current Population
Survey (CPS). In the third stage, people may earn income ( , , ,  0) or attend school
( , , ,  0). This period lasts from age fourteen (up to 1975) or fifteen (1976 and after) and
continue through age thirty-four. In the fourth stage, people may earn income ( , , ,  0) but
do not attend school ( , , , = 0). This period lasts from age thirty-five to age seventy-four.

human capital and other components such as market labor and to create aggregates which do not include any human
capital components.

                                                                   3
In the fifth stage, which covers ages seventy-five and up, people do not earn income (     , , ,   =
0) or attend school ( , , , = 0).

The approach of Jorgenson and Fraumeni (1989) includes not only market earnings, but also the
value of nonmarket time outside of work, school, and personal maintenance as part of yearly
(and, consequently, lifetime) earnings. Jorgenson and Fraumeni (1989) assume that time in
school is assumed to be 1,300 hours per person among persons enrolled in school; time in
personal maintenance is assumed to be 10 hours per day for all persons. The time per year that
remains after subtracting time spent in work, school, and personal maintenance is valued at an
opportunity cost equal to the wage rate multiplied by the difference between one and the
marginal tax rate. The value of nonmarket time is set to zero among persons who are younger
than or older than working age. Note that lifetime earnings--and all components of human capital
stock and investment--can be computed in a way that includes its market component only, its
nonmarket component only, or both.

The nominal stock of human capital in a given year is measured by computing the weighted sum
of the population by age, sex, and education, using nominal lifetime income by age, sex, and
education as a weight:

                                            , , ,              , , ,               (2)

This is equal, as mentioned above, to the expected nominal lifetime income, in present
discounted value, of all individuals in an economy. The change in the nominal stock of human
capital from one year to the next can be split into two components, nominal revaluation and
nominal net investment:

                                            , , ,               , , ,      , , ,
                                                                                     (3)
                        , , ,       , , ,           , , ,

where the left-hand-side term in (3) is the change in the nominal human capital stock from year
y-1 to y; the first term on the right-hand-side of (3) is nominal revaluation of the human capital
stock; and the second term on the right-hand-side of (3) is nominal net investment in human
capital. While (3) presents an approach in which revaluation is measured before net investment
(so that human capital in year y-1 is revaluated using lifetime earnings in year y, as in Jorgenson
and Fraumeni, 1989), it can be cast in such a way in which net investment is measured before
revaluation.

Note that net investment is driven by changes in the size of the population and in the distribution
of the population by age, sex, and education. Net investment can be divided into components
associated with the different factors that change the size and distribution of the population:
births, deaths, education, aging, and migration. These specific aspects of net investment are
grouped more broadly in Jorgenson and Fraumeni (1989) into the component of net investment

                                                        4
that increases the human capital stock (births, education, and immigration), which is denoted
investment, and the component of net investment that reduces the human capital stock (deaths,
aging, and emigration), which is denoted as depreciation.

 As noted above, the human capital estimates up to 1975 are from Jorgenson and Fraumeni
(1989), while those for 1976 and after are from a modified version of the estimates in Christian
(2017), with the modifications made to more closely confirm to the Jorgenson-Fraumeni
methodology. Yearly earnings are measured up to 1975 using Gollop and Jorgenson's (1980,
1983) data base of market activities (Jorgenson and Fraumeni, 1989), and in 1976 and after from
estimates produced from the March demographic supplements to the CPS. Population and school
enrollment is measured up to 1975 using a demographic data base produced using Census data
for Jorgenson and Fraumeni (1980). For 1976 and after, school enrollment is measured using
estimates produced from the October school enrollment supplements to the CPS. The October
CPS is also used to measure the distribution of population by age, sex, and education for 1976
and after, but the level of population is measured using Census estimates. Survival data is drawn
from life tables published by the National Center for Health Statistics (Center for Disease
Control and Prevention, undated).

The human capital estimates in Christian (2017) differ in substantive ways from those in
Jorgenson and Fraumeni (1989). One substantive difference is that net investment is decomposed
into five components: investment from births, investment from education, depreciation from
deaths, depreciation of aging, and residual net investment, which includes immigration and
emigration, as well as any population discrepancies over time that result from using multiple
sources of data that do not necessarily agree. We have included residual net investment as part of
investment. There are many other differences between the approach in Christian (2017) and that
in Jorgenson and Fraumeni (1989), but we have modified the measures in Christian (2017) to
reduce these differences. These modifications include:

       Results incorporate both market and nonmarket human capital stock and investment, with
       nonmarket time valued as in Jorgenson and Fraumeni (1989);
       The stock of human capital is measured after investment during that year, rather than
       before as in Christian (2017);
       Investment is education, which is measured net of depreciation from aging while enrolled
       in school in Christian (2017), is measured as gross investment in education separate from
       depreciation of aging while in school;
       Yearly market earnings, which were measured using pre-tax wage, salary, and self-
       employment income in Christian (2017), are measured instead using analogous post-tax
       earnings measures, and adjusted using a multiplier derived from the NIPA tables to better
       approximate labor compensation;
       The same multiplier is applied to nonmarket earnings, so that the opportunity cost reflects
       labor compensation rather than only wage, salary, and self-employment earnings;

         Earnings are set to zero after age 74;
         Depreciation from aging is measured before investment in education, rather than after as
         in Christian (2017);
         The highest level of education is set to seventeen years of education, as in Jorgenson and
         Fraumeni (1989), rather than eighteen as in Christian (2017).
         The quantities underlying the contributions shown in this chapter are constructed with
         Törnqvist indexes as in Jorgenson and Fraumeni (1989), with the exception of the
         quantities underlying human saving and wealth contributions after 1975, which are
         constructed with Fisher indexes as in Christian (2017).6

II.      Factors Impacting on Human and Market Capital

Among the factors impacting on human and market capital are labor force participation, the state
of the economy, education, and the level of income.

Significant changes in labor force participation were highlighted in the introduction; pertinent
details of labor force changes are shown in figures 1, 2, and 3.7

There is little variation in the civilian male labor force participation rates for the 10-year periods
shown in figure 1. The rates in the first three years--1950, 1960, and 1970--and the next three
years--1980, 1990, and 2000--are very similar. For the peak working ages of 25 through 54,
the male civilian labor force participation rate declines monotonically starting from 1960 for all
subsequent years shown. For males aged 55 and over, the rates almost monotonically decline
over the seven years shown. The uptick in 2010 for older individuals and the drop for younger
individuals perhaps reflected delayed retirement or difficulty finding jobs subsequent to the
Great Recession, which occurred from late 2007 through mid-2009 (see table 1 for a list of
recessions). The high civilian labor force participation rate in 1950 for those over 64 might
reflect a shortage of male workers in the initial post-World War II era.

There are important changes in the female civilian labor force participation rate (figure 2). In
1950, 1960, and 1970 the rates decline in a classic "V" shape for those of child-bearing age. In
1950, 1960 and 1970 the "V" shape for those of child-bearing age is centered around ages 25-34;
at the same time the average civilian labor force participation rate rose for females under the age
of 65. The labor force participation rate among married women rose from 23 percent in 1948 to
41 percent in 1970 (figure 3). As the labor force participation rate for widowed or divorced
females stayed relatively constant over the same time period (varying from 35 to at most 39
percent), the increase in labor force participation comes from married women with husbands
present. As previously mentioned, the child-bearing "V" disappeared in 1980. In 1990, 2000,
and 2010, increases in civilian labor force participation for prime age workers, i.e. ages 25-54,
largely no longer occur, although participation among older individuals continued to increase in
most cases. The uptick in participation in 2010 among women 65 or older, as is the case with
males, may have been due to delayed retirements because of the Great Recession. Females aged

Over the period 1950­2010, average educational attainment for both males and females
substantially increases, by over 50 percent. At the beginning of the period, average educational
attainment for the younger individuals, aged 25-34, is almost 50 percent higher than older
individuals aged 55-64 (figure 4). By 2010 there is not much difference between educational
attainment of those younger and older cohorts, and all individuals aged 15-74. These trends are
very similar for males and females. However, there is a notable difference nearer to the end of
the period in the tertiary education enrollment and completion rates for younger males versus
younger females for those aged 25-34 (figure 5).8 By 2000, the male percentage of younger
individuals who enrolled in tertiary education who complete, which started to decline by 1995, is
less than the female percentage of younger individuals who enrolled in tertiary education who
complete, i.e. graduate. By 2010, the female percent of those who enrolled in tertiary education
who complete is 6.6 percentage points higher than the same figure for males (37.5 percent of
females complete compared to 30.9 percent of males).




8
  Individuals who have not been in tertiary education long enough clearly have not completed their degree. The
percent of individuals who have at least some years of tertiary education compared to the number who have
completed is still relevant as the notable trend which begins in 1995 persists long enough for individuals to have had
the time to complete.

Another factor impacting human capital and the health of the economy is the level of earnings
received. In 2013, mean female earnings in 2018 dollars are more than twice that in 1967; the
corresponding figure for males is 40 percent. Between 1967 and 2013, mean female earnings in
2018 dollars on average grew at more than double the rate of males earnings (figure 6). One
factor contributing to this difference is that mean male earnings in 2018 dollars declines during
every recession that occurred after 1967; mean female earnings in 2018 dollars declines in only
three of the seven recessions during that time period.9 In addition, the change in the mean female
earnings exceeds that of males in two thirds of the covered years. Due in large part to the impact
of the Great Recession, the mean income in 2018 dollars of both females and males is lower in
2013 than in 2006.

The mean earnings of females in 2018 dollars increases as a percentage of that of males between
1967 and 2013. Female mean income in 2018 dollars is less than 50 percent of that of males until
1982; this percentage does not stay consistently above 60 percent until after 2000, reaching 67
percent in 2013. However, as figure 6 shows, sometimes the female percent of mean male
earnings in 2018 dollars does not always rise, for example the highest figure at 67 percent is
attained in 2009.10

III.    Overview of the Accounts

The backbone of the accounts are the five accounts summarized in figure 7. Each is outlined in
detailed accounting tables with nominal values for 1948 or 1949 and for 2013.11 Together they
form an expanded, complete, and integrated system for the private economy by combining


10
   If the percent that mean female earnings is of mean male earnings is computed with median earnings of full-time,
year-round workers as in table P-40 Women's earnings as a percentage of men's earnings by race and hispanic
origin: 1960 to 2018, the percents are much higher. The P-40 percents are the percents typically cited, however, in
this chapter table P-42 is the basis for the discussion as all earnings impact on human capital,.
11
   The first year available from Jorgenson and Fraumeni (1989) for some components of the expanded gross private
national capital accumulation and wealth accounts is 1949.

                                                                                 13
human capital and NIPA estimates.12 The expanded accounts include a production account,
incorporating data on output and input; an income and expenditures account, giving data on
income, consumer expenditures and outlays, and saving; a capital accumulation and saving
account, allocating saving to various types of capital formation, and a balance sheet, containing
data on national wealth. The accumulation accounts are related to the wealth accounts through
the accounting identity between period-to-period changes in wealth and the sum of net saving
and the revaluation of assets. Of the five accounts, the expanded production account is most
familiar to users as it contains a private version of GDP augmented to include the production of
human capital.




12
   In the previous three Fraumeni co-authored papers cited earlier, the term "full" was used instead of "expanded."
Since not all possible components are included in these accounts, notably those related to the environment,
terminology was changed.

The production account is for the private domestic economy; the other accounts use private
national economy as the conceptual basis. Government measures are included or excluded
depending on which concept is being used. The private domestic concept excludes the output and
inputs of the government sector.13 Compensation of government employees appears on the
receipts side of the income and expenditure account as this account is based on the accounting
identity that the value of consumer receipts equals the value of outlays plus saving. In general,
the private national concept includes account-relevant activities that occur in the United States,
but it restricts included relevant activities to those made by (such as expenditures), received by
(such as income), or held by (such as wealth) private entities. To be consistent with Jorgenson-
Fraumeni human capital, the accounts take the recipients' point of view.

Human capital appears in all five accounts in some form as human capital is fully integrated into
the accounts. Each human capital component is attributed to the appropriate account construct.
All human capital components in the production account are allocated to labor as part of labor
services. The value of labor services provided by human capital that are not part of the value of
services provided in the market are imputed. Market labor factor outlay includes an imputation
for entrepreneurial labor income. In the receipts and expenditures account, the labor income
arising from human capital is included as a receipt to be consistent with the inclusion of market
labor compensation as a receipt; the labor income arising from human capital is identical to that
which appears in the income account. On the expenditures side, the sum of all human capital
components is identified as either consumption or savings. Time in household production and
leisure is recorded as consumption, while the other human capital components are included in
savings.14 Investment in human capital (education, births, and residual, the latter from 1976) is
entered into the savings and capital accumulation parts of the account.15 The final account is the
wealth account, which includes the sum of market wealth and human lifetime labor earnings.

In the analysis which follows, nominal value shares are shown in figures for selected boundary
years and contributions are shown for selected periods.16



13
   The original accumulation paper excluded the government sector because of the complications, data requirements,
and overall difficulty of including the government sector.
14
   Time in household production and leisure is recorded as both income and consumption as the individual implicitly
receives income from himself because of the value of his time and uses this income to finance consumption.
15
   Human capital saving is equal to human capital investment in the accounts.
16
   The selected boundary years are 1948 (1949), 1973, 1995, 2000, 2007, 2009, and 2013. The selected periods are
1949­2013, 1949­2000, 1949 (1950)­1973, 1973­1995, 1995­2000, 2000­2013, 2000­2007, 2007­2009, and
2009­2013, in that order. The entire period is broken up into a period ending in 2000 and the subsequent 13 years
as frequently these major subperiods look quite different; smaller subperiods are chosen for similar reasons. If the
first year available from Jorgenson and Fraumeni (1987) is 1949, then nominal shares begin in 1949 and the
contributions begin in 1950 (listed as 1949­1950) as contributions depend on a growth rate from the previous year
to the current year.

Expanded account measures from the accounting tables appear in other tables and in figures. In
the first accounting table (table 2), factor outlay inputs to production are shown, where in that
table labor outlay equals factor outlay minus property outlay. In that same table, expanded
production (output) is built up from GNP, in other tables and figures the building blocks are
consumption and investment. Tables and figures using production constructs include accounting
table 2, nominal share figure 8, contribution figures 14, 15 and 16 and rates of growth appendix
tables 1 and 2. The second and third accounting tables (tables 3 and 4) use income, consumer
expenditures and consumer outlays constructs. Tables and figures using these constructs include
accounting tables 3 and 4, nominal share figures 9 and 10, contribution figure 18 and rates of
growth appendix tables 3 and 4. These feed into saving (accounting table 5, nominal share
figures 11, 12, contribution figure 17, and rates of growth appendix table 5) and wealth
(accounting table 6, nominal share figure 13, contribution figure 19, and rates of growth
appendix table 6).17

IV.     Analysis of the Accounts in Nominal Dollars

        IV.A. Expanded production and factor outlay

In the first account, the production account (table 2), production and factor outlay is increased by
the sum of investment in education and births and time in household production and leisure.18 19
As in the "new architecture" accounts (Jorgenson and Landefeld, 2006, 2009 and Jorgenson,
2010), the core NIPAs are modified in several ways. In the product section of the production
account, to allow for integration with productivity accounts, property-type taxes are included, but
some other types of taxes, such as primarily sales taxes, are excluded. Several capital services
that are not in NIPA GDP are added into gross private domestic product (GPDP). These
imputations, which appear in line 16 of the product section, include those for consumer durables
and real estate held by institutions and producer durable equipment held by institutions. The
other imputation included in line 16 of the product section is an addition to household real estate
capital services as this component is undercounted in NIPA. These modifications are relatively
minor in magnitude compared to NIPA GPDP.




17
   All rates of growth in the appendix tables are computed using logarithms.
18
   The residual, as previously described, is included in investment from 1976.
19
   All table numbers in the account tables refer to U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis NIPA table numbers unless
otherwise specified and are data published July 28, 2017.

            * The split between birth and education before 1976 is imputed from a somewhat later version of the accounts presented
            in Jorgenson and Fraumeni (1989).  Accordingly, here and in the associated graph is the only place in this paper where
            this split is shown.
                                                                     18
Figure 8 gives a sense of the relative size of the nominal dollar expanded components for the
boundary years. Education investment in human capital is always the largest component,
followed typically by time in household production and leisure. The nominal value of
investment in human capital comes from higher levels of education attainment (figure 4) and the
higher levels of female labor force participation, particularly by 1970 by married women (figures
2 and 3). Nominal birth investment in human capital is larger than nominal GPDP only in the
first two years shown. This reflects the post-World War II baby boom in 1948 and the recession
in 1973 (table 1). The value of time in household production and leisure follow the trends in
births until wages paid to females rose sufficiently to counteract the decrease in time as time in
household production and leisure is evaluated at the opportunity cost market wage (Fraumeni
and Christian, 2019, p. 524). After 2007, the nominal births share decreases and the nominal time
share stays relatively constant. Beginning in 1976 a new component of expanded production
exists, the residual investment in human capital, which is the impact of measured changes in the
size and distribution of the population by sex, age, and education that cannot be attributed to
measured births, deaths, or schooling as previously described. Nominal shares do not always sum
to 1.0 because of this residual. In 2007 this residual is such a small percent of expanded
production, just 0.4 percent, that it cannot be seen in the figure.

       IV.B. Expanded Private National Labor and Gross Private National Property
       Income

The account shown in table 3 separates income into labor and property income. Property income
includes only market components; only labor income has nonmarket (human capital related)
expanded components. The nonmarket components are by far the largest of nominal income
components (figure 9). Looking back at figure 8, it is the trends in the nominal shares of
education and births investment that underlie the nonmarket labor trend between 1948 and 1973,
with the birth share in expanded GPDP dropping by 31 percent and the corresponding education
share increasing by 45 percent. The nominal share of nonmarket labor drops below 80 percent by
2000 (figure 9). The nominal share of market labor rose between 1995 and 2007; the share of
nominal property income rose significantly between 1973 and 2009. The nominal share of
residential property income in total property income fell to 31 percent in 2013 after reaching a
1948­2013 period high of 40 percent in 2009, the 2013 figure as a result of the housing crisis.
The nominal share of gross private national market labor income, as a share of gross private
national market income, is at its highest at 66 percent in 1948 and 1973 and at its lowest at 59
percent in 2009. The nominal share is 60 percent in 2013, very close to the 61 percent figure in
1995 and 2007.

expanded gross private national income, accounting for more than one percent of it for only three
years. Since expanded gross private national income is split into its two component parts--
property income and expanded labor income in table 3-- only the expenditure section of the
third account is shown in table 4. This expenditure section splits expenditures into market
consumer outlays (lines 4 plus 7 plus 8) versus saving (line 10). The fourth accounting table,
table 5, further splits saving into gross private national saving and human capital saving; this
split is incorporated into figure 10. After falling between 1948 and 1995, the nominal share of


                                                 23
consumption outlays in total outlays including nonmarket outlays rose 7.5 percentage points
between 1995 and 2007, amounting to about 40 percent of the total for the last three years
shown. Nominal gross private national (market) saving is a small percentage of expanded
private national expenditures and varies by at most .7 percentage points. The percentage of
nominal market saving increases between 1948 and 1973, subsequently declining between 1973
and 2000, increasing again between 2000 and 2009, before settling to 6.3 percent in 2013. As
the percentage of nominal market saving is very small compared to human capital saving, the
fluctuations in total saving and total consumption arise mainly from fluctuations in the nominal
share of human capital saving in expanded private national saving. Nominal human capital
saving is about 90 percent of total saving for all years shown; accordingly, when the total
nominal saving share of total private national expenditures increases (decreases), the total
nominal consumption share of total private national expenditures decreases (increases).

           IV.D. Expanded Gross Private National Capital Saving

The saving section of this accounting table (table 5) shows how change in expanded private
national wealth is derived from expanded gross private national saving. Since expanded private
national capital accumulation is always equal to private national saving, only the saving section
of the account is shown.20 There is a great deal of variation in the nominal shares of gross private
national saving, human capital saving, private national saving, revaluation, and depreciation in
change in expanded private national wealth (figure 11). In this table and in the associated figures,
1949 is the first year shown instead of 1948 because Jorgenson and Fraumeni (1989) published
estimates for saving and wealth starting in 1949. Recall that between 1948 and 1973, the


20
     Similarly, human capital accumulation is always equal to human capital saving.

                                                          26
nominal share of births in GPDP decreases and the nominal share of education investment in
GPDP increases by enough to offset the decrease in the nominal birth share (refer back to figure
8), reflecting the end of the post-World War II baby boom and the continuing increase in the
average number of years of school completed, particularly for younger females (figures 4 and 5).
This is also true between 1949 and 1973. In 1973, the nominal share of human capital saving in
change in expanded private wealth decreases in spite of this fact because the increase in the
nominal value of the change in private national wealth is more than a third greater than the
increase in education investment between 1949 and 1973; this is due to the significant size of
revaluation. The nominal value of revaluation increases tenfold between 1949 and 1973, 50
percent greater than the rate of increase in education investment, and the share of nominal
depreciation in change in expanded saving is substantially less negative (figure 11).

Since revaluation and depreciation can be broken out into human capital and market components
beginning in 1976, further analysis refers to figure 12. In this figure for years in which there is
data, the sum of the nominal share of human capital revaluation and private national (market)
revaluation and the sum of the nominal share of human capital depreciation and private national
(market) depreciation are identical to the total revaluation and depreciation shares shown in
figure 11.21 In all years, the absolute value magnitude of the nominal share of human capital
depreciation is at least three-quarters of the nominal share of human capital saving. In 2007 and
2013, the ratios of the absolute values of the nominal shares of human capital depreciation to
human capital saving are notably higher than in other years. In 1995 and 2013 human capital
saving and human capital depreciation play a larger role in change in expanded private national
wealth than in other years. By 2000, the pace of increase in average number of years completed
and the difference between the average years of school completed by younger individuals, those
25-34, and older individuals, those aged 55-64, had narrowed considerably (figure 4). Beginning
in 2000, the absolute value magnitude of both the nominal share of human capital saving and
depreciation in change in expanded private national wealth increase. In 2007 and 2009, the

21
  Human capital depreciation includes the change in the present discounted value of lifetime earnings as people
age. When an individual ages as retirement is closer, the present discounted value of lifetime earnings normally
decreases as there are fewer years left to earn. When an individual retires, reaches 75, or dies, the present discounted
value becomes zero.

(table 1).

       IV.E. Expanded Wealth

The final set of accounts is the wealth account (table 6). The nominal share of human wealth in
expanded private national wealth is always at least 90 percent, while the nominal share of net
claims on government and the rest-of-world is always very small (figure 13). Human wealth, a
stock, fluctuates less than human capital investment as the latter is an annual change. As
previously shown in figure 8, as the nominal shares of both birth and education investment in
GPDP decline between 1973 and 1995, the nominal share of human wealth in expanded private
national wealth declines. However, it is not surprising to see a smaller decline in the share of
human wealth in expanded private national wealth than in the share of birth and education
investment in GDP between the same two years. The second largest decline in the nominal
human wealth share, which occurs between 2000 and 2007, reflects the slower pace of education
investment noted earlier, as well as the continuing drop in the percentage of males with years of
tertiary education who completed (figure 5). The temporary recovery of the nominal share of
human wealth in 2009 is due to the percentages of individuals aged 18 to 24 enrolled in a post-
secondary degree-granting institution increasing substantially from 2006 to 2009 (Fraumeni and
Christian, 2019, p. 509 ).

V.     Analysis of Contributions and Rates of Growths

Contributions (figures 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19) are weighted rates of growth, where the
weights are average nominal shares and the rates of growth are the rates of growth of the
quantities.

       V.A. Contributions to Expanded Gross Private Domestic Product and Economic
       Growth and Rates of Growth

This contribution figure is presented without (figure 14) and with human capital (figure 15)
components for comparison purposes. The total growth rate with human capital is always less
than the total growth rate without human capital. As figure 8 shows, nominal human capital
components are always very large relative to GPDP. Growth in human capital components
depends upon population and wage or income growth and increasing levels of education, as
reflected in lifetime income weights. These all grow slowly relative to GDP (see appendix table
1). GDP grows at an average rate of 3.2 percent per year between 1949 and 2013. The progress
in raising the average number of years in school for the population aged 15 to 74 (figure 4) is
notable, but the average increase per year between 1950 and 2010 is 0.7 percent. The average
population increase per year between 1949 and 2013 is 1.2 percent per year (appendix table 1).
Female mean earnings in 2018 dollars grows at an average annual rate of 1.6 percent per year
between 1967 and 2013; the corresponding figure for males is .7 percent per year (figure 6). In
this chapter, human capital depends on lifetime earnings. Lifetime earnings estimates assume a
real labor earnings growth rate of two percent per year across the demographic groups following
Jorgenson and Fraumeni (1989), which is fairly high, but the impact of this on human capital
growth is tempered as future earnings are discounted to the present value. Accordingly, for the
first major subperiod, 1949­2000, the total growth rate without human capital is almost double
that of the version with human capital, although in 1995­2000 it is three times as large.

In addition, the absolute value magnitude of multifactor productivity change is always
substantially less in the version with human capital than in the version without human capital as
it is implicitly assumed that there is no multifactor productivity associated with any of the human
capital components. The human capital components quantities on the output side are identical to
those on the input side of the accounts. The absolute value magnitude of multifactor productivity
change without human capital is usually around five times or more that of the version with
human capital.

The two most unusual subperiods in this comparison, aside from the differences between the two
major subperiods, 1949­2000 and 2000­2013, are the 1995­2000 and 2007­2009 subperiods
(see figure 16), and to some extent the recession recovery subperiod 2009­2013. Note that time
in household production and leisure is added to expanded consumption, human capital
investment is added to expanded investment and both human capital components--time and
investment--are added to expanded labor input. Property outlay, labeled capital in the figures, is
only a market concept.22 The share of expanded investment contribution in total output is always
larger in the version with human capital than in the version without human capital in the first
major subperiod, 1949­2000. This typical share relationship is due to nominal time in household
production and leisure being substantially less than nominal human capital investment. In 1995-
2000 and 2009-2013 in the version without human capital and in 1973-1995 and 1995­2000 in
the version with human capital the expanded investment contribution share is 47 to 51 percent,
not much different from the expanded consumption contribution share in total output. The share
of expanded labor contribution in total input is always larger in the version with human capital
than in the version without human capital in the first major subperiod, 1949­2000. This is a
result of the size of human capital components. With respect to the shares of expanded output
and input, in the other major subperiod, 2000­2013, the relationships are complicated because of
a negative contribution in one or the other version. As expected, in both versions, multifactor
productivity growth falls beginning in the 1973­1995 subperiod, recovers strongly in 1995­
2000, but falls in 2007­2009 during the Great Recession and recovers in the subperiod 2009­
2013. In all subperiods starting with 1995 or later, there are notable differences in the
contributions with and without human capital, as well changes in the relative growth rate of
GPDP across subperiods.23 24 Between 1995 and 2000 and 2000 and 2007, the quantity of human
capital investment either rose slightly or fell. By 2000, the difference between the average years
of school completed by younger individuals, those 25-34, and older individuals, those aged 55-
64, narrows considerably (figure 4). In addition, by 1995 tertiary education completion by males
aged 25-34 dropped (figure 5). The subperiod 1995­2000 is a remarkable time for the impact of

  Contributions are calculated as a weighted rate of growth of quantities in logs, where the weights are the average
share of this period's nominal values and last period's nominal values. The multifactor productivity change
contribution is the exception as it is the rate of growth of the quantity of output minus the contributions of all inputs.

computers on economic growth, but not for human capital investment.25 When human capital is
included, the 1973­1995 and 1995­2000 contributions look much more similar.
During the Great Recession years of 2007 through 2009, tertiary education enrollment differs
compared to other subperiods, as previously noted, and in time use. Changes in tertiary
enrollment percentages and time use shares by either gender are small or nonexistent in the prior
period and the later subperiod. From 2006 to 2009, the percentage of individuals aged 18 to 24
enrolled in a post-secondary degree-granting institution increased substantially. From 2006 to
2009, the percent of 18­24 year-old males enrolled in a post-secondary degree-granting
institution increased by 4.3 percentage points, from 34.1 to 38.4 percent; for females the
comparable figure is 3.6 percentage points, from 40.6 to 44.2 percent. In addition, time use in
household production and leisure increased. The share of time devoted to work drops by almost
the identical amount that the share of time in household production changes (Fraumeni and
Christian, 2019, p. 522). Except for multifactor productivity change, all contributions are
positive in 2007­2009 in the version with human capital; in the version without human capital,
only two contributions are positive. In 2009­2013, given the trends in human capital investment
(years of school and tertiary education completion by males), the economy is weak in the version
with human capital.

Appendix table 1 breaks out changes in nominal dollars of major aggregates into quantity and
price changes and includes quantity per capita changes, as well as NIPA GDP rates of growth.26

      Looking at expanded product, the subperiod rates of growth before the 1995­2000
subperiod look different than those after the 1973­1995 subperiod (table 7), except for the 2007­
2009 subperiod. Growth rates for subperiods after the 1973­1995 subperiod almost all drop.
Since 1995­2000 is a subperiod of relatively high GDP growth, this may seem surprising. NIPA
GDP quantity growth rates are high in the 1949­1973 subperiod, drop in the 1973­1995
subperiod, then return to their previous 1949­1973 level in the 1995­2000 subperiod (see
appendix table 1). Similar growth rate trends comparing before the 1995­2000 subperiod and
after, except for in the 2007­2009 subperiod, can be seen in the components of output and input

subperiod, sometimes called the "New Economy" time period, is human capital and multifactor
productivity.29 Although this chapter breaks out time into two major subperiods, the last
beginning in 2000, once human capital is included arguably perhaps the last should begin in
1995.

     V.B. Contributions to Expanded Gross Private National Saving and Rates of
Growth

Figure 17 divides gross human and market saving contributions into the contributions of
depreciation and net saving. Here, although depreciation reduces net saving, depreciation is
shown as an additive component rather than a subtraction from gross saving. For the subperiods
1995­2000, 2000­2007, and 2009­2013, the changes between the previous subperiods 1949­
1973 and 1973­1995 show reductions in expanded components growth similar to those shown in
table 7 (appendix table 5). The 2007-2009 subperiod again is an exception. All contributions are
positive and higher than in previous subperiods. The contribution of human saving is a result of
the impact of school enrollment, as previously noted, and the contribution of depreciation is a
result of the aging of the work force, as well as retirements and deaths, and possibly lower
earnings per hour as a result of the Great Recession. The negative contribution of human saving
in 2009­2013 is a return to pre-2007­2009 trends; the negative contribution of market saving is a

sign of the weak recovery from the Great Recession. With negative market and human saving
contributions, accordingly the contribution of net saving is negative.

       V.C. Contributions to Expanded Private National Expenditure and Income and
Rates of Growth

Most of the major subperiod patterns can be seen in figure 18. The contributions of all the
components, except that for property income, decline between 1949­1973 and 1973­1995. In
1995­2000, the contributions of labor income, property income, nonmarket consumption, and
net saving are lower than in the previous subperiod. In this figure, the contribution of the level
of living is defined as the difference between the contribution of income and expenditures
(Samuels, 2018). The contribution of net saving is negative as the contribution of total income is
decreasing and the contribution of total consumption is increasing. The contribution of the level
of living increases slightly as the negative contribution of net saving offsets to a large extent (and
is a result of) the difference between the contribution of total income and the contribution of total
consumption. The 2000­2007 subperiod components look somewhat similar to 1995­2000
subperiod components, although the contribution of labor income, market consumption, and net
saving fall. Looking at the rates of growth in appendix tables 3 and 4, which underlie
contributions, they fall between the periods before 1995­2000 and the 1995­2000 and 2000­
2007 subperiods except for the rates of growth of consumer outlay and property income quantity
or quantity per capita. In 2007­2009, primarily because of the impact of investment in education
on the contribution of labor income along with the contribution of market consumption being
close to zero during the Great Recession, the contribution of net saving becomes a large positive.
The probability of 18- to 24-year olds enrolling in post-secondary degree-granting institutions
rose significantly as previously described, before declining substantially between 2009 and
2013.30 By 2009­2013, the housing crisis had a significant impact on both quantities and prices
of residential units, including those that are owner-occupied.31 Accordingly, in the 2009­2013
subperiod, the quantity of property income fell and the price of property income rose slightly. In
2009­2013, the contribution of both property income and expanded labor income are negative.

V.D. Contributions to Expanded Private National Wealth and Rates of Growth

The creation of two major subperiods. 1949­1995 and 1995­2013, is supported by the decrease
in rates of growth between the earlier and the later subperiods shown in appendix table 6. Except
for all price changes and the quantity of market wealth per capita, the downward trend began as
early as the 1973-1995 subperiod. The largest drops are for a wealth subcomponent is for market
wealth quantity and quantity per capita between 1995­2000 and 1973­1995. As national
population growth slowed in the later subperiods beginning in 2000­2007, it is not surprising
that human wealth accretion slows (see appendix table 1 for population rates of growth). The
human wealth quantity per capita rate of growth is negative in 1995­2000 and all later
subperiods as the rate of national population growth, although low, is higher than the rate of
growth of the quantity of human capital.

Beginning in the 1973­1995 subperiod, growth in wealth is less than in 1949-1973 (figure 19).
In 1995­2000, this is equally due to a reduction in the contribution of human and market wealth.
The contribution of human wealth recovers in 2000­2007 and 2007­2009 and the contribution of
market wealth increases between 2000-2007 and 2007-2009. The impact of the Great Recession
is finally felt by the 2009­2013 subperiod. As previously noted, increases in enrollments in post-
secondary degree institutions by those 18­24 bolstered the 2007­2009 subperiod. The share of
human wealth contributions in contributions in total wealth is lower in the second major
subperiod, 2000­2013, than in the first major subperiod, 1949­2000, as advancements in the
average number of years of school slowed (figure 4).

VI.    Conclusion

The accounts that we have presented in this paper demonstrate how to integrate GDP and human
capital accounting to assess the sources of economic growth. Including human capital in any
analysis of growth is important to understand the drivers of economic growth for any period of
time, but particularly so beginning with the 1995­2000 subperiod in the United States. Before
1995­2000, increasing educational attainment is a dependable source of growth, benefitting both
the country and individuals. The 1995­2000 "New Economy" subperiod stands out as a
subperiod in which market economic growth recovered after the post-1973 slowdown.
However, increases in educational attainment noticeably slowed, human capital depreciation
from an aging work force became a larger factor, and net saving actually decreased from the
previous subperiod. In 2007­2009 total market and human capital growth is less than in 1995­
2000. A bright spot in the 2007­2009 Great Recession subperiod is that human capital
investment increased, as the probability that younger individuals would enroll at the post-
secondary level went up. This development, which did not continue into the 2009­2013
subperiod, would be missed if human capital was not included in the analysis. In 2009­2013, the
contributions of human capital components to economic growth fell. In the future, a positive net
contribution of human capital components to economic growth is in doubt given trends with the
workforce continuing to age and average educational attainment through higher enrollments no
longer surging. Including human capital components in their analysis enables researchers and
policy makers to understand the prospects for future growth, as well as how human capital
development has interacted with the market sources of growth in the past.
