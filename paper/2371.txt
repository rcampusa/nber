                  Exchange Rates and U.S. Auto Competitiveness




                                    ABSTRACT

    This paper develops unique disaggregated data for three U.S. automakers and
three Japanese to assess how changes in exchange rates, factor costs, and volun-
tary export restraints have affected recent price competitiveness in the U.S.
passenger car market.

    We find support for several familiar relationships. The support provided
by the experience of the late 1970s is straightforward. The dollar's foreign-
exchange value fell below its historical trend, in both nominal and cost-
adjusted (real) terms, relative to the major suppliers ol U.S. auto imports.
U.S. price competitiveness tracked U.S. cost competitiveness quite closely,
as average prices of U.S. automakers rose more slowly than those of their
principal rival firms (all Japanese). "Misalignment" of the dollar toward
weakness by historical norms was reflected in competitive relative pricing by
U.S. auto firms, again with respect to a historical norm.

    The support provided by the experience of the years 1980-1985 is more
complex and interesting. Strong offsetting forces appear to have been at work.
Relative to major auto suppliers, the effective nominal dollar rose gradually
toward its level of the mid-1970s, but the effective real "auto dollar" rose
much faster, increasing to a level well above its historical norm by early 1985.
U.S. cost competitiveness deterioriated not so much because of exchange rates,
but because unit labor costs in manufacturing rose in the U.S. relative to those
in major auto suppliers. U.S. auto price competitiveness began to deteriorate
correspondingly, but soon stopped, and instead improved gradually between 1982
and 1985, ending up at about the same level in 1985 as in 1980. The Voluntary
Restraint Arrangements (VRAs) with Japan, which began in 1981, seem to be the
explanation for why the negative effects of exchange rates and costs on U.S.
auto price competitiveness were offset. The VRAs are also a reason why average
prices of U.S. automakers rose faster than other U.S. prices as measured by the
consumer price index, and why in Japan, average prices on auto sales to the U.S.
rose much faster than other Japanese prices. In sum, "misalignment" of the
dollar toward strength by historical norms and deteriorating labor cost com-
petitiveness, which tended to undermine the competitiveness of U.S. auto firms,
were offset by the Japanese VRAs, which buttressed it. The VRAs, however,
undermined the inter-sectoral competitiveness of autos.

                            INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW



     This paper develops unique disaggregated data to assess how changes in

exchange rates, factor costs, and voluntary export restraints have affected

recent price competitiveness in the U.S. passenger car market. The changes

share a common feature. Each alters the relationship of the auto sector's

prices abroad to those at home. This would seem in turn to influence various

measures of competitiveness in predictable ways; indeed that is one of the

principal purposes of sectoral policies like voluntary export restraints.

Such sectoral policies also alter the relationship of the auto sector's prices

to prices of other goods.

    We find support for several familiar relationships. The support provided

by the experience of the late 1970s is straightforward. The dollar's foreign-

exchange value fell below its historical trend, in both nominal and cost—

adjusted (real) terms, relative to the major suppliers of U.S. auto imports.

U.S. price competitiveness tracked U.S. cost competitiveness quite closely,

as average prices of U.S. automakers rose more slowly than those of their

principal rival firms (all Japanese). "Misalignment" of the dollar toward

weakness by historical norms was reflected in competitive relative pricing by

U.S. auto firms, again with respect to a historical norm.

    The support provided by the experience of the years 1980-1985 is more

complex and interesting. Relative to major auto suppliers, the effective

nominal dollar rose gradually toward its level of the mid—1970s, but the

effective real "auto dollar" rose much faster, increasing to a level well

above its historical norm by early 1985. U.S. cost competitiveness

deterioriated not so much because of exchange rates, but because Unit labor
                                      2


costs in manufacturing rose in the U.S. relative to those in major auto

suppliers. U.S. auto price competitiveness began to deteriorate

correspondingly, but soon stopped, and instead improved gradually between

1982 and 1985. The Voluntary Restraint Arrangements (VRAs) with Japan,

which began in 1981, seem to be the explanation for why the negative effects

of exchange rates and costs on U.S. auto price competitiveness were swamped

between 1982 and 1985. Average prices of U.S. automakers in fact rose more

slowly than those of Japanese rival firms over this period; but they rose

faster than other U.S. prices as measured by the consumer price index. In

Japan, average prices on auto sales to the U.S. rose much faster than other

Japanese prices.

    "Offsetting strong forces" seems the best phrase for summarizing U.S.

auto price competitiveness in the early 1980s. Average prices of U.S.

automakers were at about the same level relative to Japanese rivals in 1985

as in 1980. "Misalignment" of the dollar toward strength by historical norms,

and deteriorating labor cost competitiveness, which tended to undermine the

competitiveness of U.S. auto firms, were offset by the Japanese VRAs, which

buttressed it.

    To arrive at these conclusions, we compiled a unique data set for effective

exchange rates relevant to auto trade and for three U.S. automakers and three

Japanese. The data were aggregated in ways suitable to detecting the influence

of exchange rates, factor costs, and voluntary export restraints. Existing auto

data, although abundant, was unsuitable for our purposes --   inadequately
disaggregated or inappropriately (even peculiarly) aggregated.

                       I. INADEQUACIES IN EXISTING DATA


     Studies of recent U.S. auto trade1 encounter a number of data problems.

 Lack of data is not one. There is a veritable car-nucopia of facts and

 figures. Yet not many are in a format suitable for empirical analysis.

 There are at least four important difficulties, each of which is addressed

 in this paper.

     (1) Lack of Suitable Exchange-Rate Series. Most researchers are confident

 that exchange rates have had some important influence on recent U.S. auto

 trade. Those who have attempted to estimate it have
                                                     generally employed
 bilateral rates (e.g. between yen and dollars) or measures of overall effec-

 tive exchange rates -- based on aggregate trade dependence in all products.2

 Over most of the 1970s and 1980s, however, more than 90 percent of U.S. trade

 in passenger cars has involved just three trading partners: Canada, Germany,

and Japan. An attempt is made below to compute effective exchange rates for

these three suppliers and Britain that are "aPpropriate" for U.S. passenger-

car imports. Some surprising insights emerge.

    (2) Lack of Suitable Disaggregatjon. Some of the most readily accessible

series on autos lump all domestic suppliers together, and their counterparts

for U.S. auto imports lump all foreign suppliers together. This causes

difficulties in several ways. First, exchange rates among the various import

suppliers have moved quite differently over the past fifteen years. Second,

during the 1980s U.S. imports from Japan were restrained, and the effects of

such discriminatory restraints on aggregate data may be hard to detect if

imports from Canada or Europe expanded through trade diversion (see Dinopoulos

and Kreinin (1987)). Third, the U.S. and Canada produce virtually identical

passenger cars and intra-corporate trade is free of border restraint; for some
                                          4



purposes, it may be better to count net auto imports from Canada as part of

the U.S. auto sector, rather than as shipments from "abroad." Fourth, firm-

by—f irm competitiveness is interesting in its own right: General Motors (GM)

and Honda may be more sheltered than other firms from exchange rates because

of their global diversification. Disaggregation along all these lines is

begun below, again with some surprising insights.

    (3) Inadequate Price Indexes. A number of price indexes for autos exist,

yet some of the indexes mix together domestic and imported auto prices, and

some mix together new and used car prices. Other indexes are relative

newcomers, and many of the indexes are incestuously related to each other.3

A first-pass attempt is made below to construct several price indexes that

would be helpful for empirically assessing the impact of trade policy and

exchange rates on the U.S. auto market.

    (4) Inadequate Measures of "Real" Variables. Some "real" variables that

are available are untrustworthy principally because of the inadequate price

indexes.4 Other "real" data embody a surprising tolerance for simply adding up

numbers of autos produced and imported, as if relative prices of foreign and

domestic cars, large and small cars, stripped-down and spruced-up cars were

always the same. An attempt is made below to recompute several important

real variables for the auto sector as a natural extension of having recomputed

the price indexes.

                   II. EFFECTIVE EXCHANGE RATES FOR U.S.
                            PASSENGER AUTOMOBILES


    Central to any assessment of how exchange rates affect U.S. auto

competitiveness are measures of what is meant by "exchange rates" and

"competitiveness." This section evaluates alternative measures of effective

exchange rates for passenger automobiles in the U.S. market and one measure

of U.S. auto cost competitiveness, comparing them to their counterparts for

overall trade. Section III examines alternative measures of the price com-

petitiveness of U.S. automakers and their Canadian affiliates relative to

Japanese automakers and their U.S. affiliates, and assesses their co-variation

with the auto exchange rates calculated below.

    Figures 1 through 5 record six alternative measures of effective nominal

auto exchange rates for the United States since 1974, computed quarterly.

Figure 6 compares one of these to a labor-cost-adjusted ("real") measure of

auto exchange rates. An "effective" exchange rate is a weighted average

of bilateral exchange rates, where the weights often reflect trading-partner

transaction shares. In all tables the weights are the value shares of total

U.S. passenger-car imports accounted for by Britain, Germany, and Japan, with

and without Canada.5 Bilateral exchange rates are expressed as index numbers

of the strength (price) of the "auto dollar," with March 1973 = 100.

   These series for the "auto dollar" are arguably broader measures of

exchange-rate pressures on U.S. auto manufacturing than the bilateral

exchange rates used in other research. Effective exchange rates like these for

other sectors have also been calculated recently by Arndt (1986), Belongia

(1986), Clifton (1985), Dutton and Grennes (1985), Hartman (1986), and Marston

(1986).
                                       6


    The first important question in calculating a measure of the "auto dollar"

is whether the Canadian dollar should be included or excluded. In principle,

the answer depends on the purpose of the calculation. Inclusion seems

advisable for purposes of assessing the impact of exchange rates on U.S.

geographical variables such as auto employment. Exclusion seems advisable

for purposes of assessing the impact of exchange rates on U.S. corporate

variables such as Chrysler Corporation market share --   Chrysler   is free to

trade across the U.S.-Canadian border without barriers. Inclusion or

exclusion of Canada makes a significant difference in measuring the exchange

value of the "auto dollar." Two issues that turn out to make much less dif-

ference are whether the effective exchange-rate index should be fixed-weight

or current-weight, and whether fixed weights should represent trade shares

from distant periods or from recent periods.6

    Figures 1, 2, or 3 reveal the effect of Canada's inclusion or exclusion for

alternative weighting schemes. Figures 1 and 2 differ from Figure 3 in

displaying fixed-weight indexes. One set of fixed weights represents average

value shares of U.S. passenger-car imports over the period 1972-1976. These

weights were chosen to make the auto indexes as comparable as possible to the

Federal Reserve System's index of the overall weighted-average value of the U.S.

dollar, based on 1972-1976 global trade of the Group of Ten countries plus

Switzerland. This aggregate index is plotted in Figure 1 for reference, is also

equal to 100 in March, 1973 and is published monthly in the Federal Reserve

Bulletin.7 The other set of fixed weights represents average value shares of

U.S. passenger-car imports over the first two quarters of 1980. These weights

were chosen because the period from late 1979 to late 1980 is often thought to

represent a watershed in a number of ways for both auto trade and global econo-

mic trends.8 Figure 3 differs from Figures 1 and 2 in displaying current-weight

indexes. Each period's set of bilateral exchange-rate indexes is weighted by

that period's value shares of trade. In general the choices of weighting system

and of base year for the fixed weights make very little difference to the effec-

tive value of the "auto dollar." This can also be seen in either Figure 4 or

Figure 5, where the alternative time trajectories for the effective "auto

dollar" are tightly packed together.9

    Excluding Canada makes a significant difference. The U.S. dollar was

much weaker during most of the period in its command over non-Canadian autos

than in its command over Canadian autos (which are, of course, usually iden-

tical to U.S. manufactured models). This finding arises, naturally, from

the general weakening of the Canadian dollar, but its implications for U.S.

auto competitiveness need emphasis. The exchange rate between the U.S. and

Canadian dollar since the mid 1970s has worked against U.S. geographical

competitiveness in auto production. One can interpret the gap between the

trajectories in Figures 2 or 3 as one component of a Canadian "competitiveness

edge" in autos, which developed in the late 1970s and which has been more or

less stable since then. This edge may have little impact on the global com-

petitiveness of integrated U.S. automakers (GM, Ford, Chrysler) but a large

impact on where in North America they expand and contract)0 A second

important question in calculating a measure of the auto dollar is whether the

"real" auto dollar moves differently than the nominal. One familiar way of

measuring a real exchange rate is to adjust the nominal exchange rate for rela-

tive national factor costs. Indexes of Unit labor costs are often employed for

this purpose. In focussing on auto competitiveness, the natural choice might

seem to be unit labor costs among major producing countries in that sector

alone. Yet unit labor costs in all manufacturing, not just the auto sector,

give an arguably better indicator of exogenous factor-market pressures on auto

producers --   pressures beyond their ability to influence, in the same way as are
exchange-rate pressures. We have chosen this method of cost adjustment below.

It is a way of detecting how endogenous auto price competitiveness measured in

Section III corresponds to (arguably) exogenous cost and exchange-rate pressures

measured in this section. Our inferences are, of course, less meaningful the

more insulated or divergent are labor-cost trends in each country's auto sector

from labor costs in other sectors.

    Figure 6 reveals the effect of adjusting the nominal auto dollar for

manufacturing unit labor costs in the U.S. relative to manufacturing unit

labor costs in rival automaking countries.11 Fixed weights are used in

averaging cost trends across Britain, Germany, and Japan (Canada excluded),

for 1972-1976 trade shares as described above. The resulting cost—adjusted

exchange-rate index can be called a measure of the "real" auto dollar, but

is more revealingly a measure of the cost competitiveness of the U.S. auto

sector. Figure 6 shows that there is a significant difference between auto

cost competitiveness measured by the real auto dollar and the contribution

that the nominal auto dollar alone makes to it.

   Taken together, Figures 1 through 7 reveal some striking observations on the

effective value of the U.S. dollar for purposes of assessing U.S. auto

competitiveness.

    (1) The nominal "auto dollar" has been far weaker than the overall nominal

dollar ever since 1975, as Figure 1 reveals. Focussing on nominal rates alone

makes it appear that U.S. automakers were protected more by the general

weakening of the dollar in the late 1970s than other U.S. producers;12 and

that U.S. automakers were penalized less by the general strengthening of the

dollar in the early 1980s than other U.S. producers. Indeed if exchange rates

of the mid—1970s are taken as an alignment norm, Figure 5 shows that the nomi-

nal auto dollar has been weaker than "normal" from 1977 to date except from

early 1984 to early 1985. By this norm the past fifteen years' nominal

exchange rates have almost all been pro-competitive (or protectionist) for

U.S. auto firms, and not just those of the late 1970s.

    (2) But the account is quite different for the "real" auto dollar. The

cost-adjusted auto dollar of Figure 6 tracks the nominal auto dollar reasonably

closely during the 1970s. Adjusting for trends in unit labor costs in the U.S.

and its auto rivals if anything accentuates the pro-competitive weakening of the

dollar in this period. During the 1980's, however, the parallelism between real

and nominal measures vanishes. The real auto dollar becomes progressively

stronger than the nominal beginning around 1979. A marked anti-competitive rise

in unit labor costs in the U.S. relative to the (auto-trade-weighted) average of

Unit labor costs in Britain, Germany, and Japan essentially eclipses the pro-

competitive sluggishness with which the nominal auto dollar creeps back toward

its historical norm.13 The result is remarkably similar 1980s trajectories for

the overall nominal dollar in Figure 1 and the real auto dollar in Figure 6.     In

other words, whatever the advantage that the U.S. auto sector enjoyed in the

1980s relative to other U.S. producers from confronting rivals whose curren-

cies fell relatively slowly, this advantage was offset by a rapid rise in U.S.

unit labor costs relative to these same rivals. In fact, it was perhaps more

than offset, as the next paragraph suggests.

    (3) The real "auto dollar" tracks the overall real dollar reasonably

closely during the 1970s, as Figure 7 reveals. During the 1980s, however,

the real auto dollar rose progressively more steeply than the overall real

dollar. So when exchange rates are adjusted for Unit labor costs relative
                                       17



to principal foreign rivals, the U.S. auto sector appears increasingly

uncompetitive in world markets relative to other U.S. producers during the

1980s14 -- whereas unadjusted nominal exchange rates suggested exactly the

opposite. 1980s trajectories for the overall dollar and the "auto dollar"

have an opposite relation to each other in Figure 1 (nominal trends) and

Figure 7 (cost—adjusted trends).

    Exchange rates and factor costs are obviously some of the most important

exogenous contributors to sectoral competitiveness.15 We turn in the next

section to two of its most important indicators, relative product prices and

market shares.16 We see if we can detect any of the expected correlations bet-

ween relative prices or market shares and exchange rates or factor costs. The

indicators of auto competitiveness we calculate are unique, applying to the

three largest integrated North American automakers and to their largest three

rivals (all Japanese).

                              PASSENGER AUTOMOBI LES


    To what extent did U.S. auto prices and market shares reflect the

international cost and exchange-rate pressures described above? To what

extent did they reflect other important changes, such as the Japanese VRAs?

This section attempts an answer by describing measures of prices and market

shares in the U.S. auto market and assessing their co-variation with

exchange rates, factor costs, and trade policy. Because of inadequacies

in existing data aggregates (described in Section I), data were collected and

constructed for the six firms with largest recent passenger car sales to U.S.

buyers. The data were then re-aggregated with an eye to detecting the co-

variations of interest. The six largest suppliers were General Motors (GM),

Ford, Chrysler, Toyota, Nissan, and Honda. A Data Appendix to this paper outli-

nes details for what follows, and is available from the author on request.

    Disagregated Prices by Firm. The U.S. Department of Commerce regularly

publishes data on average transaction price per new car, broken down by U.S.

domestic sales and imports.17 Through 1985, the U.S. International Trade

Commission regularly published data on maximum and minimum retail list prices by

domestic and foreign automaker.18 Remaining retail prices are, of course,

distributed between the maximum and minimum in a way that could be described by

a frequency distribution--one for each automaker. By assuming that each auto-

maker has a comparable and symmetric distribution of model list prices between

its own unique maximum and minimum, yet around the relevant average transaction

price,19 we have blended the two data sources to obtain a time series of average

transactions price per new car for each of the six largest automakers.

   These average transaction prices by firm are plotted in Figures 8 and 9,

normalized so that 1982's price = 100.        Several features are notable. One is

that some U.S. firms' average prices turn down after 1983, not only because the

component price indexes do (e.g. Chrysler's maximum prices), but because U.S.

automakers' market share of the highest-price models begins to fall of f.20 A

second feature is that variation across firms in these price trajectories is

quite moderate, and especially slight for the Japanese firms.21 Third, as a

result, there is little indication that exchange rates or other exogenous fun-

damentals affect different Japanese firms differently or different U.S. firms

differently. One might have surmised some such differences due, for example, to

different multinationality of production among the firms (GM and Honda having

more multinationality than others). In this regard there is only a very slight

tendency for GM prices to be more stable over the period than Ford or Chrysler

prices.

    U.S. and Japanese Auto Price Indexes. These disaggregated average price

indexes were then aggregated across firms by nationality to obtain an index of

U.S. auto prices and an index of Japanese auto prices, both measuring average

transaction prices on sales to U.S. buyers. Each index was a current-period

weighted average of three firms' average prices, with weights representing

each firm's share of "real" (constant 1982 dollar) U.S. sales of passenger

cars.22

    Figure 10 plots the resulting indexes and Figure 11 normalizes them by the

U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI for all items). Table 1 records the year-to-

year change in the U.S. auto price index relative to that for the Japanese

firms. Several observations are notable.

    (1) The 1970s feature auto price variation that is consistent in a

straightforward way with the trends in the nominal and cost-adjusted exchange

rates from Figures 1-7. The relative price of U.S. to Japanese autos falls

(U.S. price competitiveness improves) as the auto dollar declines from 1977

through 1979, and by a roughly comparable magnitude.

    (2) The 1980s feature auto price variation that is more complex and

more interesting. As the nominal and cost-adjusted auto dollar begin

rising after 1979, U.S. auto price competitiveness begins to decline (with a

slight lag) as expected. But it does not continue to decline as the dollar

continues to rise. On the contrary, U.S. auto price competitiveness improves

(U.S. auto prices fall relative to Japanese) from 1982 through 1985. This

improved price competitiveness is especially striking in contrast to the

deterioration in U.S. cost competitiveness suggested by the real exchange

rates of Figures 6 and 7. The contrast between price and cost competitiveness

hints at either a profit squeeze among U.S. automakers or a profit surge among

their foreign rivals on sales in the U.S. market.

    (3) The Japanese VRAs and oligopol-istic auto market structure are

ingredients that give these trends explanation and coherence. Trends in cost

competitiveness and price competitiveness need not be parallel when abnormal

profits can persist due to entry barriers. Since a VRA pressures Japanese

suppliers to raise their prices relative to U.S. automakers, its effects

counteract the opposing pressures from the stronger dollar and rising U.S.

labor costs. Indeed, U.S. auto price competitiveness begins improving around

the time the VRAs are first imposed (Spring 1981), and relative

U.S.-to-Japanese auto prices end up in 1985 at roughly the same level as in

1980.

    (4) Figure 11 shows how both auto price indexes begin rising relative to

other prices, as measured by the CPI, around the time that the VRAs are imposed.

This also is a familiar effect of a sectoral trade barrier, in contrast to
                                       26


exchange rates and labor costs, which should probably not be expected to produce

strong effects on auto prices relative to other prices.

    (5) Figure 12 sheds interesting light on the possible benefits to

Japanese automakers of developments in the U.S. auto market, suggestive of

surging profits. It converts the dollar price index of Japanese sales in the

U.S. into yen (using the corresponding yen-dollar exchange rate), and compares

the implied yen price received to other Japanese prices, measured by their

GNP deflator. The yen price of autos exported to the U.S. rises steeply and

continuously from 1978 on, relative to other Japanese goods, signalling either

reallocation of production and resources toward U.S. activities in the

Japanese auto sector, in a competitive model, or rising profitability if

there are entry barriers.


    "Real" Auto Sales and Market Shares. One of the products of the disaggre—

gation described above is an ability to refine aggregate measures of auto

sales volume, "real" market shares, and quantitative indexes. Instead of

simply adding together Units sold, as is the custom in many tabulations and

studies,23 we weighted each firm's unit sales by its average 1982 price, and

developed a time series for each firm of "real" (constant 1982 dollar) sales.

These were then aggregated to obtain a measure of "real" Japanese and U.S.

big-three auto sales in the U.S., along with corresponding market shares

which are often interpreted as ex post indicators of competitiveness.

    Figure 13 shows how the U.S. market shares of the big-three Japanese

suppliers (Toyota, Nissan, Honda) vary over time if measured in units and if

measured in real terms. The real market shares lie uniformly below the shares

of units because 1982 prices of Japanese autos were below their U.S. equiva-

lents. The co-variation in the series over time, though, is very strong. For

this period, indexes of real change and measures of growth and are not much

affected by choosing simple or more refined aggregation of quantities. If there

had been sharper changes in average prices across Japanese firms, there would

have been less co-variation in the two series in Figure 13.

    Figure 14 shows how mild recent variation has been in the real shares of

the six principal auto suppliers in their own summed sales.24 It also suggests

only modest co-variation with the exchange-rate and cost pressures described

above. The Japanese incursions of the late 1970s came in spite of adverse

trends in exchange rates, and at the expense of Ford and Chrysler. Ford's and

Chrysler's gradual rebound in the 1980s came at the expense of all other firms

except Honda, whose market share continued to rise gradually, as might be

expected in light of Honda's 1982 entry into U.S. production facilities that

allowed it to avoid the full impact of the Japanese VRAs. Controlling for

Honda's unique situation, there is some suggestion of the expected negative co-

variation between firm-by-firm price competitiveness from Figures 8 and 9 and

market shares from Figure 14.

                                 IV. CONCLUSION

    Trends in U.S. automakers' competitiveness relative to foreign rivals, espe-

cially as measured by relative prices, seem reasonably consistent from 1976

through 1985 with trends in exchange rates, relative labor costs, and U.S. trade

policy. Table 2 summarizes how auto price competitiveness might be very roughly

decomposed over this period, as described above. A sensible agenda for ongoing

research along these lines would focus on measurement of trends in quality, pro-

duct mix, and market share, largely ignored above, and on more subtly con-

ditioned co-variations and explanations.

      "Residual impulse't denotes pressure on relative auto prices that is
unaccounted for by exchange rates and labor costs, and is defined by subtracting
the first two rows of the table from the last.

      That is, impulses that tended to raise prices of Japanese automakers
relative to their U.S. rivals.

Levinsohn (1987), Mannering and Winston (1987), Tarr and Morkre (1984), and
USITC (1985a).

    2See, for example, Branson and Love (1986), Day (1985), and Schwartz (1985).
    3
     For example, the imported auto price series from the U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics (BLS) does not seem to exist in published form prior to 1980. In
the U.S. Commerce Department's Survey of Current Business, for further example:
the price deflator for passenger-car imports is calculated to follow the BLS
1980—on series for non-Canadian imports and to follow the U.S. producer price
index for Canadian imports; and price deflators for purchases of new domestic
autos and for purchases of new imports are identical to each other, and made
to follow the U.S. consumer price index for new cars.

    4For example, the Commerce Department's constant—dollar auto series in the
Survey of Current Business come from deflating current-dollar purchases of
imports by an index measuring both import prices and domestic prices, and
from deflating current-dollar domestic purchases by the same mixed-breed index.

    5Weights that are shares of world trade, rather than focus-country trade,
are sometimes recommended when there is export competition in third-country
markets as well as import competition at home. For illustration, see
Feldstein and Bacchetta (1987), Pauls and Helkie (1987), and Pauls (1987).
U.S. trade weights are used here because U.S. passenger car exports, except to
Canada, are quite small.

    6See Ott (1987) or Hervey and Strauss (1987) for a general discussion of
these issues.

    7me 1972-1976 weights were (numerators represent shares of total U.S.
car imports)

                  British pound          0.03/0.94
                  Canadian dollar        0.40/0.94
                  German mark            0.26/0.94
                  Japanese yen           0.25/0.94
                  Sum of four            0.94/0.94

   8The 1980 I and II weights were

                  British pound          0.020/0.932
                  Canadian dollar        0.211/0.932
                  German mark            0.233/0.932
                  Japanese yen           0.468/0.932
                  Sum of four            0.932/0.932
                                     34


    9The undulating path of effective exchange rates during this period may
help explain the invariance of the trajectories to the choice of fixed and
current weights. Fixed-weight (Laspeyre's) indexes overstate inflation, but
understate deflation; current—weight (Paasche) indexes understate inflation
but overstate deflation. Over an undulating price path the biases offset
each other within each weighting system.

    °The Canadian share of North American passenger cars (units) produced by
GM, Ford, and Chrysler averaged 9.8 percent in 1976-78 and 11.5 percent in
1979-85 -- after the Canadian competitiveness edge developed.

    111 am indebted to Dick Marston for sharing the data with me necessary
to do these calculations and, more importantly, the benefits of his insights
on what they imply. The unit labor cost series are national-currency indexes
of compensation of employees per unit of real output (in the value added
sense) in the manufacturing sector.

           seems likely to be true with respect to weakening of the dollar from
1985 to 1987, too, concentrated as it was on yen and marks.

    3The eclipse would be only partial if the U.S. measure of unit labor
costs had been drawn from the auto sector alone, not from overall U.S. manu-
facturing. Wage givebacks and technological developments of the early 1980s
caused unit labor costs in autos to rise somewhat more slowly than in other
U.S. manufacturing (Collyns and Dunaway (1987, p. 154)). With similar inter—
sectoral divergence in Britain, Germany, and Japan, however, the eclipse would
be restored, since nation-to-nation relative unit labor costs would move
comparably for autos and overall manufacturing.

    141he measures and weights employed allow a broader conclusion. Every U.S.
sector whose dominant rivals were Germany and/or Japan appeared increasingly
uncompetitive in world markets relative to other U.S. sectors during the 1980s.
Obviously, though, these conclusions might (or might not) be moderated by
employing sectoral unit labor costs, as discussed in the previous footnote.

     5Another that plays an important role in Section III is border trade
policy, specifically the VRA5 with Japan.

    16Quality is still a third important contributor to sectoral com-
petitiveness, although it is largely an endogenous choice of automakers.
Quality will usually be reflected in price as well as in inherent product
characteristics. Disentangling the price influence of trends in relative
quality and in relative competitiveness is discussed in more detail by
Feenstra (1984), and Collyns and Dunaway (1987), among others.

    7See tabulations of these data in MVMA (1986, p. 38) and Kaplan (1986,
Table 2).
                                       35


    18The last and most recent of its compilations is USITC (1986b). The
price series have some interest in their own right. For example, the
minimum-price series show very little divergence around trend or dispersion
across firms, and especially little for the Japanese firms. The maximum-price
series, by comparison, show much more divergence and dispersion, especially for
the U.S. firms.

    19An obvious objection to this procedure is that percentage discounts on
autos with high list prices are probably larger than on autos with low list
prices.

    20Calculated Japanese market shares of these highest-price models rise from
1984 to 1985, but European market shares rise even more sharply.

           could be due, of course, either to competitive pressures or to
implicit price parallelism among oligopolistic firms.
    22                             .
      The Japanese and U.S. price indexes
                              .               .
                                          are implicit price deflators, and the
'real" sales data, compared below to simple aggregates of units sold, record
annual sales valued at 1982 prices.

    23Collyns and Dunaway (1987) is a noteworthy, although fairly primitive,
exception.

    241n total U.S. market sales, however, real shares of smaller suppliers,
both European and Japanese, began rising in 1984.
