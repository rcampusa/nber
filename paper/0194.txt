                                  Daniel A. Graham


I.     Introduction

         The implications of uncertainty for cost-benefit analysis remain con-
troversial. Two related problems are the subject of this analysis. First,
for any given future period a dollar magnitude must be identified which
appropriately      represents the value of the uncertain benefits (costs) to

accrue in that     year.   Second, an appropriate discount rate for converting

this future value into present value must      be   identified.

         For illustrative purposes consider a simple problem. The construction

of a dam    is   being considered. Potential benefits include flood control in

wet    years and the                                   years. A standard
                       provision of irrigation water in dry

approach to determining the value of this darn employs the probabilities of

wet and dry years together with the value of benefits to accrue under each
circumstance to calculate the expected value (mathematical expectation)
of benefits in each year. Thus, for exarnile, if there were two possible
states of nature within a given year——"wet" and "dry" with probabilities
.7 and .3 respectively, and if a particular farmer were willing to pay up
to $50 for the darn if a wet year were certain and up to $100 if a dry year
were   certain, then $65 would be counted as the value of benefits accruing
to the farmer in the given year. Adding across affected individuals would
then yield the total benefit for the year.
        Having obtained a measure of the total value of the darn within each
year, the standard approach then involves discounting these       benefits to
                                             —2—



obtain    the present value, with the discount rates to be selected so as to

appropriately reflect the riskiness of the benefits. Needless to say,

there    has been     considerable controversy     regarding the appropriate dis-
count rate.1
         In addition to the debate regarding the discount rate there has
recently surfaced a second controversy regarding the use of expected
value as a measure of benefit within a period. If the farmer in the
example were willing to pay $50 for the            dam   contingent   upon the occur—

ence    of the state "wet" and $100 contingent upon "dry"             what   is the
maximum sure payment that he would be willing to make in both states?
Following      Burton Weisbrod    (1964) the term "option price" has been used
to   describe this maximum sure payment. Millard Long (1967) asserted

that option price is nothing more than the expected value of surplus or

$65 in our example. Cotton Lindsay (1969) disagreed and Charles J.

Cicchetti and A. Myrick Freeman III (1971) and then John Krutilla et al

(1972) argued that option price should generally exceed the expected

value   of surplus so that       in   our example the    farmer   should be willing to
pay more than $65 to insure the availability of the dam. More recently,
Richard Schmalensee (1972)         and Claude Henry (1974) have       shown that option
price   depends upon individual preferences and may           either   exceed or      be less

than the expected value of surplus. This result is, of course, trouble-
some for the analyst wishing to employ cost-benefit analysis. Having
available estimates of the expected value of surplus for the farmer as
well as      his   option price, which number is to be used as a measure of his


     LSee,    for example, the   discussion   in Arrow and    Lind    (1970).
                                     —3—



 benefit    for the period? To what extent does the answer to this question

 affect the choice of the appropriate discount rate?

       In    what follows we provide a   conceptually correct procedure for

 determining    whether a risky project passes the "potential Pareto
 improvement" welfare criterion which forms the normative basis of       cost—
 benefit analysis. In this approach the role of secondary markets in
 providing opportunities for redistributing risk is made transparent and
 the modifications    necessary when such markets do not exist are suggested.

 Some of the more interesting results include:

       (1)    Option price is the appropriate measure of benefit in
              situations involving similar individuals and collective
              risk.
       (2) Expected value calculations are               to situations
                                                appropriate

              involving similar individuals and individual risks.
       (3) Whether or not option price exceeds the expected value of
           surplus is largely irrelevant to the evaluation of risky
              projects.
      (4) In a wide range of circumstances,
                                                  including incomplete

             markets, discounting for risky projects should be done
             at the riskiess rate.


2. The Willingness to Pay tciis

      To   gain insight        appropriate measure of uncertain benefits
                          into the

within a given period we shall continue the example of the dam. To make
matters more precise suppose there are two goods the first of which will
                                               —4—

be called "dollars" while the second is the proposed darn. As before there

are    two possible   states of nature, "wet" and             "dry"   with probabilities .7

and    .3,   respectively. Following          the   state preference approach of Arrow

(1964) we suppose that the farmer is endowed with claims to the first

good contingent upon which            state   occurs; e dollars to be received if

"wet"   occurs and eD dollars if          "dry."        Using the von Neuman—Morgenstern
theorem as extended by Hirshleifer (1965) the farmer's utility function
can be represented as


                U=.7Uw(cw,6)+.3UD(cD,6)

where   c and CD represent claims to dollars contingent upon "wet" and "dry,"
respectively, and 6         depicts   the availability of the dam (6          = 1   indicates
that the services of the dam are available to the farmer under specified
terms   and 6 = 0 indicates        that they are not).
        The standard        assumutions are made that

   2There  seems to be some confusion in the literature regarding the meaning
of the term risk—aversion; see, for example, Schmalensee (1972), p. 815.
The assumption as stated is sufficient to assure that the farmer would de-
cline any fair, independent gamble. Suppose, for example, that given his
endowment ei eD he were given the chance to make any fair bet he wished on
the toss of a (fair) coin. Supposing the outcome of the coin toss to be

                                                                      (continued   on next   page)

        The terns "expected surplus" and "option price" may now                                be   made precise.
Define S, i =     W,    D by the requirement

(1)            U (e — Si, 1) — U (e', 0)                                  i—   W, D



Then the expected value of surplus is

(2)            E (Si)           .7 Sw + .3         SD



      2 (concluded)
distributed independently of the states "wet" and "dry" we have four states:
"wet" and heads," "wet and tails," etc. Let the bet pay x if heads and y if
tails with .5x + .5y = 0, then the utility of accepting the gamble is

               UE •7(.5U(e+x,ä) +                                   .SU(e+y*5)]
                  + .3 (.5 UD (eD + x , 6)                      +   .5   % (e + y         ,   6)]

while   the utility of declining the bet                   is

                        .7 U (e ,        6)       +     .3   UD (eD '


But risk   aversion and    x,   yI   0 imply that



               .5 Ui (e +    x ,   *5)        +       .5   Ui Ce. +      y,   5) <   U.       (er 6)
                                              i=      W, D

Thus U < U and the bet would be declined. On the other hand, gambles which
are not independent of existing risks afford the individual an opportunity
to buy insurance. It would surely be a misnomer to define risk aversion
in a way that requires an individual to refuse the chance to buy fair in-
surance against an existing risk and yet this is the definition Schmalensee
proposes.

Option   price, on the other hand, is defined by the requirement:

              .7    (en,
                               0) + .3 % (en,       0)     U



Option   value is defined as the difference

(4)           OV     OP — E(S.1




      We may now introduce a concept which will                prove crucial to subsequent

analysis.    The "willingness to pay locus" consists of ordered pairs
w satisfying

                                                  U (eD   TD' 1)


where U is defined in equation (3). By construction, the farmer would as
soon make any of the contingent payments                         for the dam as do without
it. Notice, moreover, that the previously defined magnitufes                    SD and OP
correspond to particular points along this willingness to pay locus, i.e.

              ''   'D   =
                                (sn,   SD)

is another. This is illustrated in Figure 1. The concavity which is illus-

trated for the locus follows directly from the assumption of risk aversion.

         A   further point along the locus which might be called the "certainty
point" may be identified for expository purposes. Let (-y, y) be that
point on the locus satisfying3

Were the farmer to contract for these contingent payments for the dam he
would be indifferent as to which state of nature occurs. Put somewhat
differently,       he would   have,   in the process of contracting for these

contingent     payments, simultaneously acquired a completely insured position
against the uncertain state of nature.
      A related reference point on the locus may be labeled the "fair bet"
point and defined by the requirement that (y, y) belong to the locus
               4
and    satisfy


   3This existence of this point is assured by continuity of the willing-
ness to pay locus,      f ('y), together with the assumption

   4The fair bet point corresponds to that point where the absolute value
of the slope of the locus is equal to the odds of a wet year, .7/.3. To
see this notice that the slope of the locus at          is given by

Precise relationships among the surplus, certainty and fair bet points are
developed in an appendix; here it is sufficient to point out that in gen-
eral these are distinct points along the willingness to pay locus.

3. ption Value
       The willingness to pay locus can        be   used to indicate the factors

determining whether option value (equation (4)] is positive or negative.

The possibilities are illustrated in Figures 2a—c.             Figure 2a is charac-

terized by the fact that the fair bet point lies to the right of the 45°

line. Since the slope of the locus at this point gives the relative

probability of "wet" versus "dry," a parallel through          the   surplus point

Now the locus   is only defined for                   andeD since negative
consumptjoris are not defined. Thus, in general there may be no actual
tangency of the locus to a line shose slope represents the relative
probabilities of the states but only a "corner solution." In such cir—
cl.unstances the corner solution can be used to define the fair bet point.
Alternatively, the assumption

 S yields all payment combinations with the same expected value as the        sur-

 plus   point. Where this line crosses the 450 line payments are equal in
 both   states and thus also equal to the expected value of surplus. Here
option price necessarily exceeds the expected value of surplus       and thus

option    value is positive.

         In Figure 2b the fair bet point lies to the left of the surplus point

and    a similar   construction reveals that, in this case, the expected value

of surplus must exceed option price yielding a negative option value.

         The third case illustrated in Figure 2c is characterized by the fair

bet point lying between the 45° line and the surplus point.        Here there

is ambiguity: option price may be greater or less than the expected value

of surplus.


4. The Potential Pareto Irthrovement Test

         Figures 2a—2c not only summarize the considerations affecting the

sign of option value, they also suggest that there may be little to

recommend either option price or expected surplus for a role of prominence

in cost—benefit analysis. They are, after all, only two        arbitrarily se-
lected points      along the willingness to pay locus and have no obvious claim
to preference      over other points along the locus including the fair bet and

certainty points. The question to be resolved ultimately is whether or

not there exist payments for each individual which, when       aggregated,   yield
sufficient resources to build the dam and which, when coupled with the

provision of the dam, leave no individual worse     off   then he would othexwjse
have   been. This question can be    answered as follows. Having developed
the    idea of the willingness to pay locus for one individual let us suppose

         The   method of aggregating these curves is illustrated in Figure 3 and
will immediately be recognized as analogous to the "community indifference
curve" construction from international trade theory. The curve labeled
wtp1 is drawn  relative to an origin at and represents the willingness
to pay locus of the first person. Similarly wt2 is drawn relative to an

origin at 02, and represents the locus of the second person. 02 is posi-
tioned relative to 01 so that (1) the two curves will be tangent and (2)
                                                                 2
the respective axes      are   parallel. The curve labeled       E   wtp1 represents
                                                      i=l
the locus of all such possible positions for 02 and can be interpreted as
the set of maximum payments that the first two individuals           would collec-

tively make for the dam.5          Notice   that the slope of the aggregate curve
at a given point is the same as the slope of the individual curves at the
associated tangency point.

         To this aggregate locus for the first two         people   is "added" the locus

for   the third individual and so forth obtaining in the end the aggregate
locus for the entire society illustrated in Figure 4. The point labeled
V is the maximum sure payment that society as a whole would be willing to
make for the dam and represents the magnitude that should be compared with
a sure resource cost of building the dam. Should the cost of the dam it-
self be uncertain no appreciable difficulty is added.               If, for example,

the cost is to be a        in the state "wet" arid aD in the state "dry," then
the dam should    be    built on the potential Pareto imnrovement criterion
since reference to Figure 4 indicates that society would be willing to
sacrifice resources sufficient to cover actual costs in each possible
state.     (There are points on the aggregate locus to the northeast of A.)
On the other hand, if resource costs are described by a point such as B
which lies above the aggregate locus then there does not exist a Pareto
improving way of providing the dam.

         It should be   noted   that if   an   aggregate payment such as V   were
actually to be collected with each person making a payment along his own

willingness   to pay locus, than a Pareto efficient distribution of risk

would result. To see this notice first    that the slope of the aggregate
locus   at V is the same as the slope of each individual' s locus at the
implied payments point. But the slope of an individual's willingness to
pay locus at a particular payments point is equal to his marginal rate of
substitution between the two goods once the payments are contracted. Thus
the marginal rates of substitution         between "dollars if      wet" and "dollars
if dry" are equated for all individuals. Such a taxation scheme, therefore,
is equivalent to establishing competitive markets for contingent dollar

 claims against the two states         with relative prices equal to the       coiimion mar-
 gina]. rate of substitution.
          This,   then,    is the general answer    regarding   which of the points along
 the individual's         willingness to pay locus is relevant to cost—benefit

 analysis. For each possible pair of contingent claims              prices   for the two
 states, select that payment combination for each individual which has the
 greatest value at these prices. Adding these payments across individuals
 yields    a point on     the   aggregate willingness to pay locus. Justification
 of the   project hinges upon the question of whether or not contingent

prices    exist at which aggregate willingness to pay in each state exceeds
the    corresponding resource cost of the project. Should such prices exist

that point from an individual's locus which has the greatest value at

these prices is the         one relevant for cost—benefit analysis and       the cor-
responding value at these prices is the appropriate measure of benefit.


5. pecial Cases

        It remains    to    determine whether option price or expected value cal-

culations have any potential relevance to cost—benefit analysis. Consider

first a special case in which (1) the resource cost of the dam is certain

and (2) all individuals are alike-—same
                                                   utility functions and same endowed
claims. Here we are concerned with the intersection of the aggregate

locus with the 45° line (point V in Figure 4) since this point represents

the largest possible sure payment. But with all individuals alike this

aggregate payment entails each individual making           a payment   corresPonding
to the intersection of his individual
                                              willingness to pay locus with the
450   line.   This payment, nreover, is simply the individual's option
                                         — 13   —




price. With individuals alike the initial distribution of risk         is efficient

and   collecting the sure,   option—price   payment from each preserves this
efficiency.    Thus there exist circumstances in which option price is the
appropriate   measure of benefit.
        The second type of special case to be considered      involves the concept
of   "individual risks" discussed by Nalinvaud (1973). The dam problem in-

volves a "collective risk" since everyone will experience the state "wet"

or everyone will experience the state "dry." Consider an alternative

situation based upon an example from Schmalensee (1972). Here an individ-

ual can be in one of two "individual states." In the first he will have

"a strong desire" to go to Yellowstone Park next. summer. In the second

he will have no desire to go. What is different about this situation is

that it is possible for one person to experience "individual state 1"

while another experiences "individual state 2."

        It is possible, of course, to place this problem within the original

framework by identifying states of nature according to the experience of

each individual. Thus "state 1" might correspond to the situation in which

each of the N members of society experiences "individual state 1."

Similarly,   "state 2"   might   denote the case in which everyone except the      Nth

person experiences "individual       state 1" while the Nth experiences "individ-
ual state 2." By expressing       each person's willingness to pay locus in terms

of   contingent dollar   claims against each of the 2N   possible states it   is

possible   to proceed exactly as before.
        A considerable simplification    is oossible, however, if we assume (1)

again   that individuals are alike and have the same endowments (the same

"individual state 1" and "individual      state 2"   utility functions and the
                                       — 14   —




 same endowed claims to dollars contingent
                                           upon these individual states)
 and (2) that the probability distribution of states takes
                                                           a particular
 form.     For simplicity suppose that N is large and that the probability
 can be    taken to be one that a total of .3N individuals will be in
 "individual state 1" in a given period and     will be in "individual
                                                  .7N

 state 2" While it is known with certainty what fractions of society
 will experience the alternative individual states, the fates of par-
 ticular individuals are uncertain.6 For any given person we simply
 suppose that the probability that he will be in "individual state 1"
 is .3 while the probability of "individual state 2" is .7. The
                                                                 willing-
ness to pay locus of a representative individual is illustrated in

Figure 5. The surplus point S indicates that the individual would be

willing to pay up to $100 above the costs of the trip for a visit to

Yellowstone if he were certain of "individual state 1" and nothing if

"individual state 2" were certain. This yields an expected surplus
                                                                               of
$30.

         As previously mentioned the   discussion in Schmalensee (1972)
focuses    upon whether or not the individual's option price
                                                                  exceeds $30.
Here we will, be concerned with the imolications
                                                        of individual risks.
The fair bet point (labeled fb in Figure 5) represents that point where

the slope of the locus equals (in absolute value) the odds of being in

"individual state 1." The tangent to the locus at this point, then,




   6This situation is analogous to knowing how
the fourth of July weekend                     many wrecks will, occur on
                           without knowing who will have them.

 represents alternative payment combinations with the same expected value.
 Since   individuals are alike each is willing to make           payments of   Oa "S   if
 individual,    state 1" and Ob "S if individual state 2." The expected value

of these payments is OV for each person.               Moreover, since it   is known
 that   .3N individuals will experience "individual state 1" while .7N

will experience "individual state 2" the aggregate payment resulting

from    these individual payments would be


                .3N.Qa+.7N.Ob=            (.3•Oa+.7.ob)N
                                     =   OV   •    N



Thus    it is possible to collect an aggregate sure payment equal to N times
the    expected value of the fair bet point. Since no larger sure payment

is possible, the&. fair bet point may, in these circumstances, be identified
as the one appropriate to cost-benefit analysis. Alternatively, the ex-
pected value of the fair bet point is the appropriate measure of benefit.

        This special case is an illustration of a more general proposition

developed by Malirwaud (1973) which indicates circumstances in which

equilibrium prices for contingent dollar claims against alternative states

tend   to be   equal to the probabilities of the states. The simplified pro-

cedure followed in this case is made possible, in essence, by the knowledge

that prices equal to the probabilities of the individual states will yield

an efficient distribution of risk. Reference to Figure 5 indicates that

this case is further characterized by the fact that the expected value of

surplus, $30, is greater than option price and, therefore, option value
                                        — 16 —




is   negative. It would obviously be easy to illustrate a case in which

option value is positive simply by drawing the willingness to pay locus

so that it crosses the 45° line above $30. The sign         of   option value is,

however, irrelevant. If expected values are relevant at all, i.e., if

the situation involves individual—insurable risks, then the expected

value of the fair bet point is the largest of all points along the locus
and is, therefore, the appropriate measure of benefit. If the situation
does   not involve individual—insurable risks then prices which support an

efficient allocation of contingent claims will not in general be equal

to probabilities and expected values have no bearing upon the appropriate

"market price" value.7

        To restate, if individuals are alike then option price measures

benefit in cases of collective risk while expected willingness to pay

(the expected value of the fair       bet point) measures benefit in cases
of   individual-insurable risks.


6. Second Best Considerations

        The   "hypothetical   compensation test" of Kaldor—Hicks and Scitovsky

is the normative basis of cost—benefit analysis as it is          normally applied.
In   this approach it is sufficient for the      justification   of a project that


     7Estimates
              of option price and the expected value of surplus may, of
course, be used as lower bounds for the expected value of the fair bet
point. It should be noted in this regard that an estimate of consumer
surplus (the Hicksian compensating variation) derived from demand data
for Yellowstone visitors would ideally estimate the expected value of
surplus. To see this note that since .3N individuals visit the park
each period with each having a surplus of $100, one would obtain $30N,
the aggregate expected value of surplus, from an ideal "area under the
demand curve" type calculation. Since this measure is a lower bound
for the true value Krutilla et al (1972) were correct in their
suspicion that expected surplus understates the true benefit.
                                             — 17   —




a set of payments be identified for a project which (1) individuals would

willingly make      for   the project rather than do without it        and (2)    cover

the    actual costs of the project. It is not co=only required that a
taxation scheme be identified which collects from each individual pay-
ments conmensurate with his           willingness to pay. Thus actual financing
of   a justifiable project may collect an amount             exceeding benefits from
some      individuals and    an amount   less   than    benefits from others. In such
cases it      is simply argued that the winners could, in principle, compen-

sate the losers.

          The issue of the actual method of financing a project assumes a

more crucial role in cases of uncertainty for reasons               which will soon
be apparent. Consider the situation illustrated in Figure 6. Here a

society consisting of two           people   (who face a collective risk regarding

the occurence of state 1 or state 2) is willing to make               an aggregate
sure   payment corresponding to point C          for a particular project.

Suppose that actual       financing    of the project entails a sure collection

of D from each.       (C =   2D).     This yields a surprising situation in which

both people are worse off than they would have been without the project

since D exceeds the option price of each person. The difftculty stems

from the fact that being willing to make an aggregate payment of C is

predicated upon achieving an efficient distribution of risk. Collecting

payments corresponding to A and          B, respectively, from the      first and

second people equates their marginal            rates    of substitution between
"$   if   state 1" and "$    if state 2 and is, therefore, consistent with
efficiency.      Collecting payments corresponding to D from           each, on   the

other hand, does not equate marginal rates of substitution and     is    incon-
sistent with    efficiency unless secondary markets are available in which

the individuals can buy and sell contingent clng.

         The case of independent risks poses similar problems.   Looking
back   at Figure 5 we see that both expected willingness to pay, V, and

expected    surplus exceed option price.   Should actual financing entail

sure collections of either V     or $30 from each individual, everyone
would be a loser in that situation as well unless a secondary market
for insurance exists.

         It is implicit in the original discussions of the "hypothetical

compensation test" that complete markets exist for all goods. One

need not be   concerned with   the allocational efficiency of taxation

schemes in such curcuimstances since trade in the perfect secondary
markets assures ultimate allocational efficiency. However appropriate
this "complete markets" assumption was for the riskless world of these
original debates, it is generally conceded that many of the contingent
claims markets required for allocational efficiency in a risky world
do not exist.8 It is crucial in such circumstances that either (1) the
particular method   of financing   the project be evaluated with respect to
its implications for the distribution of risk or (2) the analysis be
modified in such a way as to avoid dependence on non-existing    markets.




   8There are at least two important reasons why many types of contingent
claims markets do not exist. The first is moral hazard: a person buying
claims contingent uton a particular state may have incentives to alter
his behavior in a way that is adverse to the seller. Second, such mar-
kets require complicated and specialized contracts which may be costly
both to write and to enforce.
                                            — 19 —




The problem can     be   put rather simply. The magnitude        corresponding     to C

in Figure 6 represents society's willingness to pay for two things:                   (1)

the project itself and         (2) an efficient allocation of risk. If the
method of financing the project yields an efficient allocation it is

legitimate to use C as a measure of total benefit. If, on the other

hand, the financing scheme does not produce efficiency then collecting

C    amounts to   charging society for a benefit that has        not   been produced.9

For   these reasons option price may be regarded as a "second—best" measure
of benefit appropriate to situations in which           (1)   actual financing in-
volves   sure collections from individuals and         (2) secondary     contingent

claims markets are       not   available.


7.    Discounting   for Time and     Risk
        The modifications required to introduce time into the analysis are

straightforward. In the case of the dam consider now              a   two period

situation in which the services of the darn          will   be available at the

beginning of the second period and          simultaneously    it will be discovered

whether the second period is to be "wet" or "dry." For simplicity




   91t might be thought that state—dependent collections represent an un-
realistic method of financing projects. This is not necessarily true,
however. In the case of the darn, for example, a combination of sure
taxes and water charges might produce exactly the combination of contingent
payments required for allocational efficiency. Sure taxes and               visitor
charges might similarly be used in the case of Yellowstone Park. In Figure
5 a sure tax of Ob in both states plus a visitor charge of Oa—Ob would produce
exactly the desired result. In general, however, the same factors that
prevent contingent claims markets from being privately organized would pre—
sably inhibit the use of state—dependent collection schemes.
                                          — 20   —




suppose      there is no uncertainty regarding the first period. The first
good, dollars, may now      be   taken   to   form three elementary commodities:
(1) sure dollars for consumption during the first period, (2) dollars
for consumption in the second period contingent upon the occurence of
"wet"    and (3) second period dollars contingent upon "dry." Supposing

the individual to have a utility function representing his preferences

for consumption programs involving these three goods and the proposed

dam and supposing that he is endowed with claims against the three

types of state/time     dependent dollars, we may illustrate his willing-
ness    to pay locus in Figure 7.

         By   aggregating these loci across individuals in the manner sug-
gested earlier one obtains the aggregate willingness to pay locus. As
before the project is justifiable if the vector describing its resource
costs lies below this aggregate surface. If, for example, all costs
are to be incurred during the first period then the relevant measure
of benefit is the intersection of the            aggregate   surface with   the
"$ in   period   1" axis.

        As   in the timeless   case this construction supposes either that (1)

competitive markets exist for the three types of dollar claims              or that
(2) the method of financing the project involves time and              state depend-
ent payments compatible with an efficient allocation. In either case

discounting is done implicitly at a riskiess rate. This may be shown

as   follows. At the payments points associated with an efficient collec-

tion scheme the marginal rate of substitution between any two               types   of

dollars is the same for all individuals. Thus relative "shadow prices"

for the three types of dollars are            determined.    By choosing "$   in

    uniquely for p and as the prices (in terms of sure period 1 dol—
•   lars) of claims paying one dollar in period 2 if "wet" occurs and one
    dollar in period 2 if "dry" occurs, respectively. Since one can pur-
    chase   at these prices claims assuring a sure dollar in period 2 at a

    cost of      +           in period   1 dollars, it follows that the riskiess dis-

    count rate is given by

            p invested in period 1 at rate r returns one sure dollar in pe-
    riod 2). Now suppose an individual is willing to make payments of

    (a, bs bD) in the three types of dollar claims. The present value

    (the value in terms of period 1 dollars) of this payments rograxn is



                     V         a+pWbW+PDbD

    Alternatively, the value of period 2 payments in terms of sure period 2

    dollars is

         The case   of   individual-insurable risk illustrated in the Yellowstone

Park example again represents an interesting special case. By making the

analogous modification to two periods and adopting the obvious notation

the relative price p1/p2 will in this case equal the relative probabilities

of state 1 versus state 2. Here the present value of a payments program

is obtained by discounting the expected value of period 2 payments at the

riskiess rate corresponding to



                  1      =
              l+r              p1 +p 2



This results from        the   fact that if



                         =     .3/.7   =       "odds" on state 1


then



                         +
                             p2)
                                   =     .3       =   probability   of state 1



and



                         +               .7           probability of state 2
              p2/(p1         p2)
                                        — 23   —




Thus a payment program (a, b1, b2) would have a present value of


             V —                                a+ ir         b

                     .3b1 + .7b2

                 E   expected   value of (b1, b2)


        Second best considerations remain crucial in the temporal case. A
method appropriate to cases of incomplete markets and sure collection
schemes can be illustrated with an example. In the case of the dam,
suppose   that a market exists in which individuals can exchange        period 1
dollars   and sure period two dollars. On the other hand, no markets for

trade in claims contingent upon the occurence of "wet" or "dry" exist.

Although the individual depicted in Figure 7 is prepared to make any of

the payments combinations along his willingness to pay surface the

available market only allows payments lying within the plane determined

by the "$   in period   1" axis and the 450     line   lying between the "$   in
period 2 if wet" and the "$      in   period 2 if dry" axes. That portion of

his willingness to pay surface which lies in this plane is relevant to

this incomplete market case and is reproduced in Figure 8. Once again

it    is possible to aggregate the willingness to pay schedules of iridivid—

uals   to obtain the aggregate locus depicted in Figure 9 for the case of
two individuals.       Here the maximum payment that society would      willingly
make   for the dam in period 1 dollars   is    given by 01 02. Implicit in this
aggregate payment is the fact that     the    first   individual   "borrows" an
amount 01a from the second at the riskless rate corresponding to


               1+r         tane

Equivalently, the present value of benefits for each individual is computed

by discounting his willingness to pay at this riskiess rate. Notice that

this   analysis in no way assumes the   existence of markets allowing trade

in   contingent claims. Discounting at the riskless rate is the direct con-
sequence of the    existence of a market for exchange of riskiess clairns)0




     10The matter of discounting for risk may be clarified by a complete mar-
ket   example. Suppose there are S states with iT denoting the objective
probability of state s. Complete contingent claims markets exist with
                                                                       PS
the current price of a claim to one dollar in period two contingent unori
the occurence of s. The riskiess discount rate is then 1/Cl + r)    E p.
Suppose now that ownership of an asset, a, entails claims to a dollars in
period two if state s occurs s = 1, ..., 5. The current marke price of
this asset must be V = Z p a . This market value may also be calculated
                           $ S S
by determining the value of the asset in period two sure dollars
Z (p /E p.) a

8. Generalizations
         The approach   to the     illustrative         cases examined thus far may              easily

be   generalized to situations involving an arbitrary number                           of   periods
and states. Consider a general situation involving S states and Q +                                   1


periods and    suppose   that markets exist in              which individuals can exchange
current sure (time zero)       dollars for M different types of                       assets. 0iner-

ship of one unit of the ith asset entails claims to receipts of

dollars    at time q (the end of period q) if state s occurs. For nota-
tional convenience      let current sure dollars be that asset indexed                         by zero.
A portfolio, then, is an       M + 1 tuple,         x, where the ith..coxrponent, x,                      de-

notes the quantity of the ith asset, i —                    0,   ...,   N.       Rolding   the portfolio

Now if one wished to discount the expected value of period two claims
rather than their true second—period market value then one would re-
quire the risky discount rate corresponding to

        The   utility function of the individual for consumption programs in-
volving the SQ +       1   possible types of time—state dependent claims, TJ(c),
can be   used to derive a utility function                for portfolios by defining the
                                              — 27      —




utility of the portfolio to be equal to the utility of the associated
vector of time—state dependent claims:U

                 u(x)         U(Ax)


         Similarly,   if the list of goods             is expanded to   include the services

to be derived from a proposed public project, then the notation u(x, cS)

may be used    to   denote the utility of holding the portfolio x when the

services are    provided (6       1) and      when the services are not provided

(6 =   0).   Supposing the individual to be endowed, following market trade,

with the portfolio e the willingness to pay locus may be defined as con-

sisting of those vectors y which satisfy


                 u(e —   y,   1) =     u(e,       0)



       Aggregation across individuals may then be accomplished in the

manner   suggested    earlier and     our   previous analysis applied. In par-
ticular, the   matter of risk discounting may be examined as follows.
Suppose the markets for assets afford                  opportunities for riskless in—
vestments,    i.e., there exist portfolios x satisfying




                Z ti
                                         s    —
                                                   1, ...,   S


                j ix sqa =       I

                                  L0 otherwise


   11Notice    that this general formulation recuires only that an individual
have a utility function ranking alternative consumption programs • This
is less restrictive than the von Neuman-Morgenstern formulation and
compatible with other approaches, e.g., the certainty-equivalence formu-
lation of Handa     (1977).

for   t 1, ..., Q. (Ownership of x returns a sure dollar at time t and
nothing at other times.) The existence of these riskiess portfolios

                 1/Cl + r)        px             t —    1,   ...,   Q



where p      (1, p1, •••    p) is the vector of         time   zero     sure dollar—prices

of the assets. Now supose        another     portfolio, x. offers risky returns

at time T, i.e.


                                rz5
                                              — , ...,
                 Ex a EII                   q—T

                                            otherwise



The current market price of this risky portfolio must be px. This present

value may equivalently be determined by noting that                 the   ratio px/pxT

represents    the price of the risky portfolio in terms of tiuie T sure
dollars.     This is the future, time T, value of the risky portfolio.                   To

determine    its present   value notice that



                             px(l + rT)

or   that

                px — 1/Cl +rT)         px
                                       PXT


Thus the present value of the risky portfolio is obtained by discounting
its future value at the riskiess rate. Again, this is the direct result
                                         — 29   -


of    the existence of markets which afford opportunities for riskiess invest-

ment.

         It   should be noticed that this analysis supposes only that free
competitive exchange is possible in the existing markets for assets.
Although this is not equivalent to assing the existence of complete
contingent     claims markets it   does include the case of complete markets
as a possible special case. To see this             notice first that   the   ability

to buy and sell assets at prices

                  p      (1, p1'     '




implies   that an individual endowed with the portfolio e faces the "port-

folio" budget constraint



                  px — pe


Suppose now that the rank of A is equal to SQ + 1,           i.e., there are     as
many   linearly independent assets as there are types of contingent dollar
claims. Then we may write

                  x — A1 C


and   the portfolio budget constraint is equivalent to the "contingent
claim" budget constraint given by

                  Pc —   PE


where E       Ac and P pA1. Here the ability to buy and sell             assets at

prices   p is equivalent to the ability to buy and   sell   contingent claims

at prices P. This situation is therefore equivalent to one in which
complete markets exist for trade in contingent claims. In general,

however, the rank of A may be less than SQ +1 in which case existing
markets   for   assets do not provide opportunities for exchange of risk
equivalent to those which    would be afforded by a complete set of con—

tingent   claims markets)2

matrix to the opportunities for achieving efficient distributions of risk

       Here we examine the relationships among the fair—bet, certainty and
surplus points defined in Section 2. The fair bet and certainty points
are closely related and may, in certain circtmtstances, coincide. Suppose,
for example, that           and        are the same functional forms.

Then


               U (e —             , 1)     —

                                                          —
                                                              ' 1)
               iff
                            e—y e)Y)
Similarly,

                       +          1)                            1)

               iff eqy =                       eD?D

In this case the certainty point and the fair bet point coincide. This
may also occur under more general circi.mstances as can be seen by making
use of the "ransom" approach developed in Cook and Graham (1977) and
defining R(e) by the requirement

(8)                  Ce —   R(e),      1) =     TJD
                                                       (e, 1)


Notice that R represents the maximum amount an individual                    endowed with

a   certainty of a dry year and dollar                clairs of   e would pay to   obtain a
                                              A- 2

certainty of a wet year. (R may either be positive or negative depending
upon which state is preferable.) Thus R represents a measure of the ex-
tent to which the   state "wet" is in itself preferred to the state "dry"

(or vice versa). Differentiating both sides with respect to e we obtain



               U Ce — 1(e), 1) (1— R'(e)]                        Ce, 1)




Now if R' Ce) is zero, i.e., there is no effect of a change in endowed

wealth upon the "ransom" the individual would pay,

then


                    Ce —   R(e),    1) =          Ce, 1)



In this case the certainty point and             the   fair bet point again coincide as

can be seen by letting e =               —     and making use of equations C6), (7),
                                   eD
and (8). In general we may state that


                    (e —   R(e),    1)            Ce, 1) as R'(e)         0



or that



               U (e —              1)        U (eD —   ',, 1)   as R' (eD —



This means that the fair bet point lies along the willingness to pay locus
to   the left or to the right of the certainty point depending upon whether
R' is positive or negative.

         Turning   now to the surplus point we see that if



                   U (en, 0)             UD (eD 0)


(the   farmer is endowed with claims that             leave him indifferent as to which

state,    "wet" or "dry," occurs in the absence of the dam) then

                   U—         SW,
                                    1)        UD (eD — SD? 1)        (by equation 1)

and


                   (y, )            (sn, SD)                         (by   equation 6)



In   this case the certainty point and the surplus point coincide. In gen-
eral the surplus point lies along the willingness to pay locus to the
left or      to the right of the     certainty point depending upon whether "wet"
or   "dry"    is preferred   in the original endowment, i.e., upon whether



                      (eu, 0)            UD (eD, 0)
