                                           ABSTRACT

Even if an asset has no fundamental uncertainty with a constant dividend process, a stochastic
sentiment-driven equilibrium for the asset price exists besides the well-known fundamental
equilibrium. Our paper constructs such sentiment-driven equilibria under general utility functions
within an OLG structure. Our paper further shows that the existence of sentiment-driven
equilibria is robust in a standard infinite-period model as long as the pricing kernel is affected by
the asset price.

1    Introduction

Asset prices in the ...nancial market can be extremely volatile. For instance, volatility, as measured
by the VIX index, in the 2007-2009 global ...nance crisis and the 2010 eurozone debt crisis seemed to
be too high to be justi...ed by fundamental uncertainty. Bacchetta, Tille, and Wincoop (AER, 2012)
(BTW hereafter) propose a theory of "self-ful...lling risk panics", i.e., the perception of the presence
of high risk tomorrow leads to high risk today. BTW show that even if an asset has no fundamental
uncertainty with a constant dividend process, a stochastic sentiment-driven equilibrium for the asset
price exists besides the well-known fundamental equilibrium which is unique. The core result of
BTW can be described as follows. Consider the following asset pricing equation:

                                  qt = Et (qt+1 + d)       vart (qt+1 )

where qt is the asset price, d is interpreted as the constant dividend in each period, and        and
are constant coe¢ cients. Then, clearly, there exists a fundamental equilibrium given by qt =      1    d
and vart (qt+1 ) = 0. Surprisingly, the authors show the existence of another equilibrium, in which
the asset price qt is a function of a state variable -- sunspot St , and St follows a stochastic process.
    The microfounded model of BTW is built on two key assumptions: 1) the mean-variance utility
of agents, i.e., the variance of wealth or consumption directly enters the utility function, and 2)
an overlapping generation (OLG) structure. These two assumptions, however, deserve some close
scrutiny. First, the mean-variance preference has been severely criticized in the long-standing
literature. Notably, Borch (1969) and Feldstein (1969) proved that mean-variance preferences are
inconsistent with the basic axioms of choice under uncertainty. The criticism forced James Tobin
(1969), one of the pioneers of the mean-variance analysis of portfolio choice, to acknowledge that
the mean-variance preference is applicable only under some special circumstances (Tsiang (1972)).
Second, the OLG structure in BTW gives rise to the question on the source of multiplicity --
whether the results derived under OLG is robust in a general in...nite-period model. We know that
a standard Ramsey in...nite horizon model of a representative consumer with strictly concave utility,
constant returns to scale production, and the initial capital or asset given, has a unique optimal
solution. The model also can be interpreted as a GE solution where prices faced by the consumer
represent marginal utilities, factors are paid their marginal products, and all markets clear. All
relative prices fall out and are determined as a by-product of the agent'
                                                                        s optimization problem.
Now suppose there were other price sequences that cleared all markets and optimized the sum of
discounted utilities of the consumer at those prices. This would contradict the uniqueness of the
optimization problem and imply that the second equilibrium may not be optimal so that there is
a distortion somewhere.



                                                   1
   In this paper, we generalize the model of BTW. We ...rst show that sentiment-driven equilibria
can exist under the OLG setting of BTW with general utility functions, and we construct such equi-
libria. The construction with analytical solutions is challenging particularly because the functions
involved are non-linear. The intuition nevertheless is easy to understand. If all agents believe that
sunspots a¤ect asset prices, then the agents face price risk and hence demand risk compensation.
Rational self-ful...lling expectation equilibria arise when risk compensation and price jointly satisfy
the agents'utility maximization conditions.
   The stochastic sunspot equilibrium constructed in our model features the time-varying, path-
dependent volatility of the sunspot. This is in sharp contrast with the sunspot processes in the
literature on local indeterminacy, where the sunspot is the expectation error, an i.i.d. process
under rational expectations by de...nition. The asset price generated in our model exhibits asym-
metric volatility, i.e., volatility varies with the price level. This is in line with the well-documented
empirical fact of asymmetric volatility in the asset pricing literature (e.g., Black (1976), Christie
(1982), Schwert (1989, 1990)). The sentiment-driven equilibrium in our model also generates en-
dogenous crashes in asset price. Most times, the sunspot price randomly uctuates slightly below
the fundamental price, but occasionally the price experiences a signi...cant drop.
   One key contribution of our paper is to aim to provide a very general characterization of
self-ful...lling risk panics (Section 6). Speci...cally, we further investigate whether it is the OLG
structure that is responsible for the existence of sentiment-driven equilibria. We show that as long
as stochastic asset price realizations can a¤ect the contemporaneous consumption, so that the price
and the stochastic discount factor (the price kernel) are not independent, it is possible to construct
a stochastic equilibrium. This is the key feature that allows us to construct sunspot equilibria in
the models and examples that we study. The OLG structure is a convenient device that allows asset
price realizations to a¤ect consumption and stochastic discount factors. In an in...nite-period model,
many mechanisms can generate this e¤ect under some realistic frictions such as incomplete market
and borrowing constraints (see, e.g., Geanakoplos and Polemarchakis (1985), Kiyotaki and Moore
(1997)). In this sense, the OLG setting, where not all generations are present and trading at the
beginning of time, can be regarded as a market incompleteness friction in a standard in...nite-period
model.
   There is one caveat to mention. In an in...nite-period model, sunspot equilibria may actually
increase the price above that in the unique certainty equilibrium. This seemly surprising result is
also intuitive. Since sunspots make the asset risky, the asset holders need to be compensated for
the additional risk. For any given future price expectation, a lower current price would make the
asset return more attractive. This explains why the asset price in a sunspot equilibrium is below
that of the certainty equilibrium in an OLG setting. However, the asset holders can be alternatively
compensated if the future price is higher for any given current price. In short, asset prices can be

                                                   2
either undervalued (as in a large literature on ...re sales; see, e.g., the survey by Shleifer and Vishny
(2011)) or overvalued (as in a large literature on bubbles; see, e.g., the survey by Brunnermeier and
Oehmke (2013)). Our results hence complement the original insight of BTW where the sunspots
always reduce the asset price below that of the certainty equilibrium.
       Our paper is related to the literature on sunspot equilibria, pioneered by Cass and Shell (1983).
The literature has since become vast, so we do not attempt to make an exhaustive review on it here.
Broadly speaking, there are two types of sunspot equilibria. The majority of sunspot equilibria are
conditional on the existence of multiple certainty equilibria. Sunspot equilibria can be constructed
by some randomization over these certainty equilibria. In a dynamic model of sunspot equilibria,
this often means that there exists a continuum of certainty equilibria all converging asymptotically
to the equilibrium steady state.1 Our sunspot equilibria belong to the second type: the certainty
equilibrium is unique, yet there exists a continuum of sunspot equilibria. Hence, our sunspot
equilibria are not merely randomizations over certainty equilibria. Cass and Shell (1983) provide
the ...rst example of such sunspot equilibria in a simple two-period exchange economy model in their
appendix. But their model is too stylized to study actual uctuations in asset price or aggregate
uctuations. Benhabib, Wang, and Wen (2005) show that such sunspot equilibria co-existing
with a unique certainty equilibrium can exist in a monopolistic competition model à la Dixit­
Stiglitz (1977) when ...rms make production decisions based on their expectations about aggregate
and idiosyncratic demand shocks. Because of imperfect information, ...rms confuse sunspots with
fundamental demand shocks. Our model di¤ers from that of Benhabib, Wang, and Wen (2005)
in that, in our model, agents fully observe the sunspots. The sunspot equilibria in both Cass and
Shell (1983) and Benhabib, Wang, and Wen (2005) are based on a static or ...nite-period model. In
contrast, in our model the sunspot equilibria are not possible if the economy is ...nite because, by
backward reduction, the only equilibrium would be the certainty equilibrium.
       The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 lays out the baseline model with an OLG setting.
Section 3 presents the certainty equilibrium, and Section 4 presents the sunspot equilibrium. Section
5 gives the equilibrium with switching across states. Section 6 studies the in...nite-period model.
Section 7 conducts an extension of the model. Section 8 concludes.

     Important early contributions in this line of research include Azariadis (1980), Tirole (1985), Azariadis and
Guesnerie (1986), and Woodford (1986). Following Benhabib and Farmer (1994), it has been shown later that
sunspot equilibria can emerge in a standard RBC model with increasing returns to scale or endogenous markups,
opening the possibility of explaining the actual business cycle uctuations without resorting to technology shocks (see,
e.g., Farmer and Guo (1994), Benhabib and Farmer (1999), Benhabib and Wen (2004), Jamovich (2008), and Wang
and Wen (2008)). The recent 2007-2009 ...nancial crisis has spurred several studies on sunspot equilibria through
credit constraints (see, e.g., Benmelech and Bergman (2012), Benhabib and Wang (2013), Liu and Wang (2014),
Perri and Quadrini (2018), Miao and Wang (2018), and Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2020)).

2        Baseline Model

We consider a standard asset pricing model à la Lucas (1978), but in an OLG setting. Agents live
for two periods. An agent born in period t, with an endowment W , derives utility at period t + 1:

                                                         U (Ct+1 ),

             0                00
where U ( ) > 0 and U ( ) < 0. An agent can trade two assets. One is a risky asset, and the other
                                                      s gross return is exogenously given as R > 1.2
is a risk-free asset (e.g., bond). The risk-free asset'
The risky asset has a constant dividend, D, in each period, and the trading price of the risky asset
at t is denoted by Qt . There is totally one unit of the risky asset in the economy. An agent solves
a simple portfolio problem

                                     max Et U (Ct+1 )
                                       t

                                                                                 Qt+1 + D
                                     with Ct+1 = W (1           t)   R+W     t            ,                (1)
                                                                                    Qt

where       t    is the proportion of wealth invested in the risky asset.
        The ...rst-order condition of (1) yields

                                   Qt+1 + D                                          Qt+1 + D
                      Et W                    R U0 W           (1     t )R   +   t                 = 0.    (2)
                                      Qt                                                Qt

Note that if realizations of asset prices Qt are stochastic they a¤ect marginal utility and, therefore,
the stochastic discount factor uctuates. In equilibrium, market clearing means

                                                    W     t   = Qt 1,                                      (3)

by considering that there is one unit of the risky asset in the economy.
        Let us normalize W = 1 and D = d                W . Then (2), together with (3), implies the following
Euler equation:
                              Et (Qt+1 + d      RQt ) U 0 (Qt+1 + d + (1             Qt )R) = 0.           (4)


3        Certainty Equilibrium

The certainty equilibrium is a collection of prices Qt for t = 0; 1; 2; :::, such that Equation (4) is
satis...ed. Then we have
                                                              Qt+1 + d
                                                   Qt =                ;
                                                                 R
    2
   The economy can be interpreted as a small open economy with an exogenous R. In Section 6.4, R will be
endogenous in general equilibrium.


                                                               4
which yields a constant asset price
                                             1
                                             X 1       d
                                        Qt =     j
                                                   d=                  Qf .
                                               R      R 1
                                               j =1


Clearly, the certainty equilibrium is unique. If Qf < W , agents save W                    Qt > 0 in the bond
market besides holding the risky asset; otherwise, agents borrow and invest in the risky asset.
    We can provide a general equilibrium interpretation of our model if the asset giving a constant
real return R > 1 is capital K; with production function F (K ) = RK + W L; where W is the
constant marginal product of labor L; inelastically supplied, and R is the constant return to K .
We can normalize earnings so W L = 1: Note also that the second asset yielding nominal dividends
D can be interpreted as money if D = d = 0; but then Qf = 0 so the return on the money asset
is dominated by R > 1; and therefore money is not held. Then all earnings of the young are then
saved as capital, and we have Kt+1 = W L = 1; equivalent to a constant endowment of capital. In
this general equilibrium interpretation with a capital asset, the certainty equilibrium is unique; and
therefore the sunspots we construct below are not a randomization over certainty equilibria.3 If,
on the other hand, D > 0, the returns on the two assets are equalized in the certainty equilibrium
and the agent is indi¤erent about the portfolio allocation given by                 . In the sunspot cases we
discuss below, the second asset become risky, so the portfolio allocations of the two assets become
determinate under risk aversion.


4    Sunspot Equilibrium

We now consider possible sunspot equilibria. De...ne qt           Qt    Qf , the di¤erence between the actual
price and the fundamental price of the risky asset. In a sunspot equilibrium, Qt is stochastic and
uncertainty requires the risky asset to bear a premium, so we expect that qt < 0 in general. With
the notation qt , we rewrite the Euler equation, (4), as

                                 Et (qt+1     Rqt ) U 0 (qt+1    Rqt + R) = 0.                                  (5)

We are interested in whether there are equilibria other than the certainty equilibrium and, in
particular, whether qt is simply a function of a sunspot variable.
   3
     We can also introduce endogenous leisure if the utility of the agent is ln Ct+1 + (1  ) (1 Lt ) where the time
endowment is 1: Since returns on the two assets are equalized to R in the certainty equilibrium, Ct+1 = Rt+1 Wt Lt .
Then we have the optimally chosen Lt = , a constant.

the property Et (xt+1 ) = 0, characterizes the volatility of the discounted capital gain.
     We limit our attention to a stationary process of price qt . Speci...cally, suppose qt is a linear
function of a sunspot variable, i.e.,
                                                           qt = a + b ( z t    z) ,                                                (7)

where zt is a sunspot following the process

                      zt+1 = z + (zt                z ) + "t+1 ,    with z > 0, 1 >          0, Et ("t+1 ) = 0.                    (8)

When      > 0; zt is an AR(1) process; when                         = 0, zt is i.i.d. across time. Given (7) with (8), we
can calculate the two terms in (6); that is,

                                        qt+1                  a (R        1)   b (R      ) (zt     z)
                                   Et                 qt =

and
                                                             qt+1          qt+1  b
                                                xt+1                  Et        = "t+1 ,

                                                                                                                              q1;t+1
Considering that Et qtR
                      +1
                                  qt is a linear function of zt , to simplify the algebra, we can make Et                       R
                                                                                          R                       R
q1;t = zt , in which case parameters a and b need to be a =                              R 1z    and b =         R    , implying that
               1
xt+1 =     R       "t+1 .
     Then Euler equation, (5), becomes

                                        Et (zt + xt+1 ) U 0 (R (zt + xt+1 + 1)) = 0                                                (9)

or

(10) de...nes a relationship between zt and "t+1 . Therefore, the existence of a stochastic equilibrium
means that we need to ...nd the sunspot process of zt in (8) such that the realization zt and the




                                                                      6
innovation "t+1 for any t has the relationship in (10). The asset price qt then is given by

                                                                      R                  R
                           qt = a + b (zt         z) =                        z               ( zt        z) .
                                                                  R       1        R

   To obtain analytical solutions and without loss of generality, we focus on the cases in which
"t+1 follows a uniform distribution or a binomial distribution.


4.1     Uniform distribution of "t+1

Assume that "t+1      U nif [ (R             ) Bt ; (R            ) Bt ] or equivalently xt+1                     U nif [ Bt ; Bt ]. Then
(9) implies
                                Z   Bt
                                           1
                                              (zt + x)U 0 (R(zt + x + 1)) dx = 0.                                                   (11)
                                     Bt   2Bt
This de...nes an implicit function between Bt and zt . Write the function as Bt = B (zt ). As long
as the utility function U ( ) is given and known, we can ...nd Bt = B (zt ). We have the following
property for B (zt ) under a general utility function U ( ).


Lemma 1 The solution Bt = B (zt ) given by (11) is continuous and increasing in zt                                                0 and
B (zt = 0) = 0.


   To guarantee Bt      0, we need zt            0, which requires

                           (1        ) z + zt      (R             )B (zt )         0 for all zt            0,

that is,
                                    (1      )z + min [ zt             (R          )B (zt )]          0,
                                                  zt 0

which is true under a su¢ cient condition that R                          is small enough.


Proposition 1 Under a su¢ cient condition that R                                  is small enough, there exists another type
of equilibrium, in which
                                                      R                   R
                                          qt =                z                   ( zt       z)
                                                  R       1           R
where
              zt+1 = z + (zt         z ) + "t+1     with "t+1                 U nif [ (R                  ) Bt ; (R    ) Bt ]

and Bt = B (zt ) is given by (11).


   The sunspot equilibrium in Proposition 1 features the time-varying, path-dependent volatility
of the sunspot. This result is in sharp contrast with the sunspot process in the literature on local


                                                                  7
indeterminacy, where the sunspot is the expectation error, which is an i.i.d. process under rational
expectations by de...nition.

      Example Consider log utility, that is, U (C ) = log C . Then (11) becomes                          Bt zt +x+1 dx   =0
or
                                                      2
                                        zt =                         + 1 Bt        1,                                    (12)
                                                exp (2Bt )       1
which implicitly de...nes function Bt = B (zt ). We can show that, for any zt                        0, there is a unique
solution of Bt that satis...es Bt       0, and that Bt is increasing in zt and bounded from above by zt +1.
Figure 1 plots a simulation of Qt , where parameter values are R = 1:04,                         = 0:96, z = 0:1251, and

      Calculate qt+1    qt =       R    (zt+1    zt ) =      R       [(   1) (zt        z ) + "t+1 ]. Since V art ("t+1 ) is
an increasing function of zt , it means that both the (local) drift and the di¤ usion of the price
process qt are path-dependent. This pattern is along the line of the continuous-time ...nance models
(see, e.g., Merton (1969)). This literature often models an asset price as a stochastic process:
X (t + 4t)      X (t) =       (t; X (t)) +     (t; X (t)) 4 W (t), where W (t) is a Wiener process and the
di¤usion term      (t; X (t)) is path-dependent. Also, one well-documented empirical fact in asset
pricing is asymmetric volatility, i.e., volatility varies with the price level (see, e.g., Black (1976),
Christie (1982), Schwert (1989, 1990)). The result generated in our model coincides with this
empirical pattern.

4.2     Binomial distribution of "t+1

Assume that "t+1 , or, equivalently, xt+1 , follows a binomial distribution. For simplicity and without
loss of generality, suppose the upper realization of xt+1 is simply zt , so the binomial distribution
takes the form of                                  (
                                                                                    mt

by considering that xt+1 must satisfy Et (xt+1 ) = 0. Then (9) implies

This de...nes an implicit function between mt and zt . Write the function as mt = m(zt ). As long as
the utility function U ( ) is given and known, we can ...nd function mt = m(zt ) > 0. Guaranteeing
zt    0 requires that
                              (1       )z + z t       (R              ) zt        0 for all zt             0,

Figure 2 plots a simulation of Qt , where parameter values are the same as in Figure 1, that is,

between the fundamental price (Qf ) and the sunspot price is small but, occasionally, there is a
signi...cant drop in the asset price.

5     Equilibrium with Switching across States

We now consider the equilibrium in which there are two states, a sunspot state and sunspot-immune
state. Switching across the two states is driven by an exogenous Markov process. The economy
will switch from the sunspot state to the sunspot-immune state with probability                                          1,   and switch
from the sunspot-immune state to the sunspot state with probability                                       2.

     Denote by q1;t the asset price in the sunspot state and by q0 the asset price in the sunspot-
immune state. For simplicity and without loss of generality, we assume that when the economy
switches from the sunspot-immune state to the sunspot state, the asset price always starts with
the same initial ("reset") value, denoted by q1 . (5) implies two equations:


                                  1 (q0        Rq1;t ) U 0 (q0      Rq1;t + R)
                                 +(1           1 )Et    (q1;t+1     Rq1;t ) U 0 [q1;t+1       Rq1;t + R] = 0                        (15)

and
               2 ( q1   Rq0 ) U 0 (q1             Rq0 + R) + (1               2 )(q0     Rq0 )U 0 (q0         Rq0 + R) = 0,         (16)

where the ...rst equation corresponds to the current state being the sunspot state and the second
equation corresponds to the current state being the sunspot-immune state. With the two equations,
we need to solve the endogenous variable q0 and the endogenous process q1;t .



                                                                      10
   Again we are looking for the sunspot process

                                                                          R                    R
                                                     q1;t =                       z                  ( zt         z) ;                                           (17)

Consider the case in which "t+1 is uniformly distributed within [ (R                                                                       ) Bt ; (R    ) Bt ]. (17)
                  q +1                                                    q1;t+1             q +1                      1
implies that    Et 1;t
                    R                   q1;t = zt and xt+1                  R              Et 1;t

can be rewritten as

   Consider the case of log utility U (C ) = log C . Equation (16) becomes

Since q0 has been solved, (20) gives function Bt = B (zt ), namely,

                                                                                                                             (zt   z )+1

                                               z t Bt + 1

Note that when                1   = 0, the solution in (21) becomes the one in (12) in the baseline model without
state switching. For any zt , the value of Bt (zt ) is higher in the case with                                                             1   > 0 than in the case
with    1   = 0. This is because for the same level of price qt , with a positive probability                                                           1,   the asset
price may jump to the higher state in the next period. To accept the same level of price in the
current period, there must be a higher degree of uncertainty in the next period.

Proposition 3 Under a su¢ cient condition that R                              is small enough, there exists another type
of equilibrium, in which the asset price switches across two states according to a Markov process.
In the case of log utility, q0 is given by (19) and q1;t is given by

The other parameters are given by R = 1:04,                              = 0:96, z = 0:1251, and again d such that
         d
Qf =    R 1   = 12. The ...gure shows that the price alternates between two regions. In one region,
the asset price is constant q0 , which is slightly below the certainty equilibrium price, Qf , without
sunspots.

6    In...nite-Period Model

In the section, we investigate whether the existence of a sentiment-driven equilibrium under the
OLG structure is robust under a standard in...nite-period model. We show that as long as the asset
price impacts consumption and thereby the pricing kernel, a sentiment-driven equilibrium can
exist. The OLG structure is a convenient device to model asset price a¤ects consumption. In an

                                                              12
in...nite-period model, there are many mechanisms to generate the e¤ect that the asset price impacts
consumption, for example, under some realistic frictions such as incomplete market and borrowing
constraints (see, e.g., Geanakoplos and Polemarchakis (1985), Kiyotaki and Moore (1997)).


6.1   Basic asset pricing equation

Consider a general asset pricing equation with two assets. One has the risk-free gross return R
and the other is a Lucas tree, which yields a constant dividend d in each period. Denote the Lucas
tree'
    s price by Qt and the pricing kernel by Mt;t+1 . There is no uncertainty except that the price
of the Lucas tree may uctuate. We have the standard asset pricing equation for risk premium

                                                         Qt+1 + d
                                0 = Et Mt;t+1                          R    .                  (22)
                                                           Qt

If there is no uncertainty in Qt+1 , then this equation implies

                                             Qt+1 + d

6.2   Independence between asset price and pricing kernel

If Mt;t+1 does not depend on the asset price Qt+1 , then (22) becomes

                                                   Qt+1 + d
                                  Et Mt;t+1 Et                     R     = 0,
                                                     Qt

which implies
                                             Qt+1 + d
                                      Et                     R    = 0.
                                               Qt
Again, we have
                                                1
                                                X 1
                                           Qt =      d = Qf .
                                                  Rj
                                                 j =1

The price Qt is unique.


6.3   Dependence between asset price and pricing kernel

If Mt;t+1 depends on Qt+1 , however, we can construct a sunspot equilibrium. Take an example

                                     Mt;t+1 = mt;t+1 (           bQt+1 )


                                                        13
where mt;t+1 is the deterministic component conditional on information up to t. Equation (22))
becomes
                                                                                        Qt+1 + d
                                  0 = Et mt;t+1 (                      bQt+1 )                                 R
                                                                                          Qt
which is equivalent to
                                                                                Qt+1 + d
                                         0 = Et (              bQt+1 )                                R         .
                                                                                  Qt
De...ning qt = Qt       Qf , we then have
                                               h                              qt+1              i
                                             Et (      0       bqt+1 )                  qt          = 0,                                       (23)
                                                                               R

where    0        bQf .
     Again we are looking for the sunspot process

                                                               R                  R
                                              qt =                     z                (zt         z) ;                                       (24)
                                                           R       1          R

where
                        zt+1 = (1            )z + zt + "t+1 , where z > 0 and Et ("t+1 ) = 0.

(24) implies that Et qtR
                       +1
                                     qt = zt and xt+1                  qt+1
                                                                        R          Et qtR

                                                                                           =           R
                                                                                                           1
                                                                                                                "t+1 , so (23) can be rewritten
as

                                     R                R                                                                 1
             Et         0   +b               z+            [ ( zt           z ) + "t+1 ]              zt                         "t+1   = 0.
                                 R       1        R                                                             R
This can be reduced to

                                     R             R                                            R          1

                                 R       1        R                                         R         R

or                                                     h                                                            i
                                                                            R           R
                                                           0    +b         R 1z     +  R        (zt        z)           zt

                                                                                  b (R R )2

Therefore, the asset price process of qt given in (24), with a variance restriction on innovation "t+1
in (25), constitutes a sunspot equilibrium.


6.4     Example 1

We ...rst use a production-economy general-equilibrium model as a concrete example. Let us consider
log utility again. There is a continuum of entrepreneurs, and each of them is initially endowed
with one Lucas tree. A Lucas tree yields a constant dividend d in each period. In each period,
entrepreneurs can also hire labor to produce. Each unit of labor produces A > 1 units of output

                                                                           14
and the real wage is normalized to unity.4 However, entrepreneurs need to borrow working capital
in advance to hire labor. We assume that the total amount of borrowing is limited to the asset
price Qt (e.g., collateral constraint). An entrepreneur solves
                                                            1

where bt+1 is the face value of the bond invested in period t with return Rt between period t and
t + 1, st is the number of Lucas trees held in period t, and                                    t   is the net pro...t of labor hiring with
nt being the units of labor hired.

      However, any process of Qt+1 satisfying

also constitutes an equilibrium.5 Notice that (28) only puts a restriction on the expectation, Et Qt1

but not on the particular realization of Qt+1 . If there is no uncertainty, then Qt+1 = Qf will be
the only equilibrium. But there can also be other types of stochastic equilibria.
      Let us assume

6.5      Example 2

We present another example based on the turnpike model of exchange by Townsend (1980).7 The
model economy is inhabited by two representative in...nitely-lived agents. We label them A and
B . Agent A receives an endowment only in every even period, t = 0; 2; 4; 6; 8; :::, whereas agent B
receives an endowment only in every odd period, t = 1; 3; 5; 7; ::: The endowment is constant Y .
There are two assets for the agents to smooth their consumption. One is an investment technology
that generates a risk-free gross return R > 1 between two periods. The other is a Lucas tree which
yields a constant dividend, D, in each period. Due to self-ful...lling prophecy, the Lucas tree's price,
denoted by Qt , may uctuate. In period 0, the Lucas tree is owned by agent B . The utility for

Market clearing implies that
                                                         sit+1 = 1 for yit = Y

So the ...rst-order condition, (30), becomes

                                                          Qt+1 + D RQt

which is the same as the ...rst-order condition, (4), in the OLG model. It is, of course, not very
surprising; as Townsend (1980) points out, there is a similarity between the turnpike model of
exchange and the overlapping-generation (OLG) model by Samuelson (1958).


7        Model Extension

To obtain sharp insight, so far we have assumed that the dividend is constant across periods. We
can extend our model by allowing for a stochastic process of dividends. Speci...cally, to demonstrate
the main mechanism and for simplicity, we modify the setting of the baseline model in Section 2
by instead assuming D = d~ W , where d  ~ 2 dH ; dL ; that is, the dividend d~ follows a two-state
                      ~ switches from state dL to state dH with probability ! 1 and switches from
Markov process, where d
state dH to state dL with probability ! 2 . All other assumptions remain the same.
        The Euler equation in (4) now becomes
                                     h                                                       i
                                Et               ~
                                          Qt+1 + d                     ~ + (1
                                                        RQt U 0 Qt+1 + d             Qt )R       = 0.                       (31)


        Fundamental equilibrium                    We ...nd the fundamental equilibrium. Denote the asset price in
state     dL   by   QL   and the asset price in state dH by QH . (31) implies that

                           !1     QH + dH          RQL U 0 QH + dH + (1            QL )R

                           + (1          !1)    QL + dL     RQL U 0 QL + dL + (1           QL )R       =0

and
                         !2     QL + dL          RQH U 0 QL + dL + (1            QH )R
                                                                                                                            (33)
                         + (1        !2)       QH + dH     RQH U 0 QH + dH + (1            QH )R        = 0.

We can solve the two unknowns QL ; QH with the above system of equations. When dH                                          dL is
                                                                                                         dL                dH 9
not too large, the solution is unique with QL    L   H   H          L

        Write (32) as F QL ; QH            = 0 and (33) as G QL ; QH    = 0. It follows that     dQL

Figure 4: Asset price Qt in fundamental equilibrium with a two-state Markov process of dividend

      Sunspot equilibrium              In a sunspot equilibrium, the asset price at each period t is a function
of two state variables, the fundamental (i.e., the dividend realization, dH or dL ) and the sunspot.
For simplicity and without loss of generality, we assume that when the economy switches from state
dL to state dH , the asset price always starts with the same initial ("reset") value, denoted by QH
                                                                                                  0 ;
similarly, when the economy switches from state dH to state dL , the asset price always starts with
the same initial value, denoted by QL
                                    0 . (31) implies the following two equations:

8    Conclusion

Our paper demonstrates that the result of Bacchetta, Tille, and Wincoop (2012) on self-ful...lling risk
panics can apply to a general standard setting. Our model not only shows the existence of stochastic
sentiment- or sunspot-driven equilibria but also constructs such equilibria in a general setting in
which non-linear functions are involved. To deliver clean results, we have deliberately made the
model simple. Our results and approach can be potentially incorporated into a more complicated
model to explain and quantify sentiment-driven asset prices and sentiment-driven business cycles
through the channel of self-ful...lling risk.

    Appendix

A      Proofs
                                                               R Bt
Proof of Lemma 1: Consider that Bt = B (zt ) is de...ned by B       t
                                                                            ^)U 0 (R(zt + x
                                                                      (zt + x             ^ + 1)) dx
                                                                                                   ^=
                                          0             00
0, where the utility function satis...es U ( ) > 0 and U ( ) < 0. Then, B (zt ) is continuous and
increasing in zt 0 and B (zt = 0) = 0.
    By changing the variable to x = zt + x  ^, we have
                                                        Z   zt +Bt
                                     G (zt ; Bt )                      xU 0 (R(x + 1)) dx = 0.
                                                         zt Bt


     When zt = 0, it is true that G (zt ; Bt = 0) = 0 and so Bt = 0 is a solution. Since G (zt ; Bt ) is
continuous in zt and Bt , B (zt ) is a continuous function. Now we prove that B (zt ) is a increasing
function.
                                                                               00
     Denote f (x) xU 0 (R(x + 1)). Then, f 0 (x) = U 0 (R(x + 1)) + xU (R(x + 1)) R. So, for any
                                                                0
pair (x ; x+ ) with x < 0 < x+ , we have that f 0 (x ) > f (0) = U 0 (R) > f 0 (x+ ) (result 1); that
is, the slope of f (x) is always higher at a negative x than at a positive x.
                                                                                          R zt +Bt
     In the ...rst step, we prove that at any solution Bt = B (zt ) given by G (zt ; Bt )  zt Bt f (x) dx =
0, it must be true that f (x = zt Bt ) + f (x = zt + Bt ) < 0 (result 2). We prove by contradiction.
Suppose f (x = zt Bt ) + f (x = zt + Bt ) 0, that is, jf (x = zt Bt )j f (x = zt + Bt ). By re-
sult 1 and applying the mean value theorem, we have jf (x = zt Bt + m)j < f (x = zt + Bt m)
(that is, f (x = zt Bt + m) + f (x = zt + Bt m) > 0) for any m 2 (0; Bt zt ]. In this case, it
follows that
  Z   zt +Bt                Z    0                      Z       2zt                Z   2zt +(Bt zt )
               f (x) dx =               f (x) dx +                    f (x) dx +                       f (x) dx
    zt Bt                    zt B t                         0                       2zt
                            Z Bt zt                                          Z    Bt zt                           Z   2zt
                       =                 f ( zt        Bt + m) dm +                       f ( zt + B tm) dm +               f (x) dx
                             0                                                0                                   0
                            Z    Bt zt                                                               Z 2zt
                       =                 [f (zt        Bt + m) + f (zt + Bt                 m)] dm +       f (x) dx
                             0                                                                             0
                       > 0.
                                           R zt +Bt
This forms a contradiction with             zt Bt      f (x) dx = 0.
                                            dB (zt )
   In the second step, we prove         > 0. By applying the implicit function theorem, it follows
                                             dzt
that
                 dB (zt )    @G (zt ; Bt ) =@zt   f (zt + Bt ) f (zt Bt )
                          =                     =                           > 0,
                   dzt       @G (zt ; Bt ) =@Bt   f (zt + Bt ) + f (zt Bt )
where the last inequality follows based on result 2.

Proof of Propositions 1-3: Based on the discussions in the main text, the proof is straightfor-
ward and hence omitted.
