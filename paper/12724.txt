Security Issue Timing: What Do Managers Know, and When Do They Know It?

                                             ABSTRACT

We study put option sales undertaken by corporations during their repurchase programs. Put sales'
main theoretical motivation is market timing, providing an excellent framework for studying whether
security issues reflect managers' ability to identify mispricing. Our evidence is that these bets reflect
timing ability, and are not simply a result of overconfidence. In the 100 days following put option
issues, there is roughly a 5% abnormal stock price return, and the abnormal return is concentrated
around the first earnings release date following put option sales. Longer term effects are generally
not detected. Put sales also appear to reflect successful bets on the direction of stock price volatility.

1   Introduction

    This paper examines corporate put option sales undertaken by U.S. corporations
during their repurchase programs in the 1991-2004 period. Using a comprehensive, hand-
collected dataset, we study the firms and the put sale transactions. Our contribution is
two-fold. First, put sales are an interesting financial innovation in their own right, and our
study is the only large-scale empirical analysis. Second and more importantly, put option
sales provide an excellent setting to study managers’ market timing ability. Put option
sales are gambles that the firm’s stock price will rise. Market timing is the main
theoretical justification for put option sales in previous work (see Section 2), and our
main tests focus on the evidence. More broadly, our study advances an extensive
literature on the relation between corporate transactions and market timing (see Eckbo,
Masulis, and Norli, 2006 and Baker, Ruback, Wurgler, 2006 for surveys).

    When the firm’s securities are mispriced and managers can identify the mispricing,
this can affect investment, financing, and other corporate decisions. For example, if
managers know that the firm’s stock is overpriced, they can take advantage by issuing
equity. Despite the extent of the literature, the importance of market timing explanations
for corporate behavior is hotly debated and still unresolved (Baker, Ruback, Wurgler,
2006).

    Since there are many motives for corporate security issues, distinguishing among
alternative explanations for why they occur is problematic. Other pieces of evidence on
timing ability are not very informative. Survey evidence shows that CFOs feel that their
security transactions can time the market (Graham and Harvey, 2001), but this may
simply reflect overconfidence. Potentially informative evidence on managers’ market
timing ability could come from insider trading studies. Yet recent studies raise serious
doubts about whether there is significant market timing ability within large firms (see
Lakonishok and Lee, 2001, Jenter, 2005).

    We provide direct evidence on whether key assumptions of market timing stories–
both mispricing and the ability to identify it–are empirically relevant in corporate
decisions. Our 137 sample companies are typically large, including firms such as Bank of



                                              3
America, Boeing, IBM, MacDonald’s, Microsoft, and Proctor and Gamble. The median
firm is in the S&P 500. If put option sales reflect timing ability, it shifts our priors and
increases our confidence in the potential importance of timing explanations for a broader
cross-section of firms and a wider range of transactions. If put option sales do not reflect
timing ability, this would lend credence to alternative hypotheses, in particular that
managers do not have private information but are overconfident about their own abilities
to predict future returns. Many papers examine the implications of managerial
overconfidence, and recent empirical work suggests that there is an association between
managerial overconfidence and aggressive corporate policies (Ben-David, Graham, and
Harvey, 2006). Put sales do represent an aggressive bet, but the underlying motivation is
ultimately an empirical question.

    The put option sale setting provides an experimental design with many useful
features. First, unlike debt or equity issues, put sales have no simultaneous effect on
investment activity. We argue that management’s belief that it can time the market (i.e.,
distinguish between prices and fundamental value) represents the most likely rationale.
Thus, any abnormal stock returns subsequent to these transactions cannot be attributed to
contamination from investment effects. Second, this setting could reduce errors of
inference because the typical put option issued has a maturity of only 6 months. Given
the short maturities, our timing tests can focus on the detection of short-horizon effects.
This avoids the well-known difficulties associated with long-horizon return studies (see
Fama, 1998, and Kothari and Warner, 2006 for overviews). Third, the fact that firms
issuing these options are choosing short maturities is itself of interest. It suggests that
what management thinks it knows about mispricing is short-term in nature. Whether in
fact such short term predictability exists is a question on which we provide evidence.
Finally, put option issues represent bets not only on the stock price, but on volatility. If
management has private information that volatility will be lower than what put buyers
expect, then put sales will be profitable. We examine volatility patterns to see if timing
ability and management’s information extends to higher order moments of the stock
return distribution.

    We find strong evidence that managers can predict future returns on the firm’s stock.
In the 100 trading days following put option issues, there is roughly a 5% abnormal


                                             4
return. Much of the abnormal return is concentrated around the first earnings release date
following the put sale. Further, the results are robust to specification of the abnormal
return model. Longer term effects are generally not detected. The evidence also seems
consistent with timing ability extending to volatility timing. Volatility declines after a
firm’s initial put sale and increases after a put sale program terminates.

      Our findings are also related to the literature on corporate hedging. Some papers in
this area raise questions about whether activities labeled hedging are actually attempts to
exploit information and make directional bets (see Baker, Ruback, Wurgler, 2006), and
statements by CFOs raise the same possibility. For example, in a 1999 interview, the
Microsoft CFO stated that “the vast majority of (hedging) programs are straight
hedges…I expect they will continue to make money” (CFO Magazine, October 1999).
Our evidence suggests that put option sales reflect timing ability. Although put option
sales undertaken in conjunction with repurchase programs are sometimes referred to as a
hedge by practitioners, this is true only in the sense that the option premium reduces the
cash required to repurchase shares. Since the return to the put selling firm is positively
correlated with the return on the firm’s shares, firm risk is increased, not reduced, by a
put option sale.

      Section 2 gives background and discusses institutional features of put option issues,
as well as the paper’s testable propositions. Section 3 describes the data. Section 4
discusses the stock return performance around put option issues. Section 5 concludes.

2     Background

2.1     Institutional Features

      Put option programs are a financial innovation characterized by a dramatic rise, and
an equally dramatic fall. A 1991 SEC ruling allows firms with repurchase programs to
issue puts in their own stock. The ruling, in the form of a “no action” letter, states that the
SEC will take no enforcement action against put issuers for manipulation of stock prices




                                              5
under the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934.1 Few specific restrictions apply to the put
issues, but they must be out of the money at issue.

      The use of put options in conjunction with share repurchase programs surged in the
1990s. Although the impetus for the 1991 ruling came from the CBOE, the put sales were
generally structured as privately negotiated transactions. The counterparty was typically
an investment bank, who hedged the purchase by buying shares. The transactions were
highly touted in the financial press.2 Advantages cited include the general profitability,
the tax-free proceeds3, and the minimal disclosure requirements. Players in this market
included Salomon Brothers and Morgan Stanley. In the latter case, Morgan purchased the
software which had been developed in-house by IBM, an early issuer, in conjunction with
its own put option sales.

      Since 2002, however, transactions have largely dried up. Many issuing firms lost
money in the Internet bubble, with Microsoft taking a reported loss of 1.3 billion
(McDonald, 2003). In addition, FAS No. 150 in 2003 likely had a damaging effect (see
Bear Stearns, 2006). It changed the balance sheet classification of all put option sales
from equity to liability. It also increased the transparency of put option sales and their
effect on earnings volatility, because changes in fair value of put options had to be
recorded through earnings.4

2.2     Firms’ Motivation

      While there is a practitioner and academic literature on put option sales, there is a big
gap in our knowledge. The literature is a mix of description, theory, and small sample or
case analyses.5 Because most firms do not publicize their use of such contracts, the
relevant data are difficult to obtain. To fill this gap, we assemble a comprehensive sample

  For further details of the history, see Posell and Eades (1992a, b). Regulatory issues are also discussed in
CBOE Investor Series Paper #2 “Corporate Stock Repurchase Programs and Listed Options” (2001).
2
  For example, The Business Week headline on February 23, 1998 stated that “Hedging techniques are
earning millions in tax free income for savvy companies”.
3
  Sale proceeds are tax free under Section 1032 of the Internal Revenue Code, and do not increase
accounting earnings.
4
  Under Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issue 88-9, put warrants were recorded at fair value in
permanent equity. EITF issue 00-19 during our sample period also appears to have increased disclosure
requirements.

  A Darden School case and teaching note provides an analysis of IBM’s 1992 put sales. (Posell and Eades,
1992a, b); the empirical analysis in McDonald (2003) focuses mainly on Dell and Microsoft.

of put option issuers, based on largely hand-collected data. We document the features of
put option sales, and provide evidence on firms’ motivation.

    We focus on whether managers appear to have private information. This explanation
pervades the put option sale literature. Other explanations are generally dismissed and
have attracted less attention. Angel, Gastineau, and Weber (1997, p. 111) argue that the
main rationale for using puts “is surprisingly simple: the underlying common stock is
cheap”; in addition, these authors argue that puts are undervalued if management has
private information that future volatility is lower than put buyers expect. Gibson, Povel,
and Singh (2006) also presume that firms issuing put warrants have private information.
In their model, put sales signal the firm’s prospects (see also Gyoshev, 2001 for a similar
argument). McDonald (2003) and Atanasov, Gyoshev, Szewczyk, and Tsetsekos (2004)
question the signaling motive because most firms do not announce put option sales.
Grullon and Ikenberry (2000, p.51) list managers’ market timing abilities as a reason for
the transactions, but they recognize that it is a strong assumption. At the same time, they
are hard-pressed to find any other reason why put options are sold. They argue that there
are potential costs: selling the options increases exposure to bad news and reduces
flexibility because it precommits the firm to buy shares.

    A number of explanations for put option issues are analyzed by McDonald (2003).
These include regulation, off-balance sheet treatment, and private information. He
generally dismisses all explanations he considers, concluding that “there is no one single
obvious and compelling explanation for put sales”. He is skeptical about private
information explanations on theoretical grounds, and raises interesting questions about
how firms could capture the gains. For example, since put sale transactions are not
anonymous, one would expect that in an efficient market, the nature of the information
would be incorporated into the put sale proceeds.6 This point is addressed, however, in
the theoretical model of Atanasov et al. (2004). In their analysis, investment bankers lose
money on the options they purchase, but in equilibrium their relationship with the issuing
firm allows them to make money by going long in the undervalued shares. Consistent
with this, for a sample of 17 firms, they show that there is abnormal positive stock price

6
 In addition, he argues that the put sales are inefficient because they are tax-disadvantageous relative to an
equivalent position which goes long in shares and borrows.


                                                      7
performance following initial put sales. Gyoshev (2001) finds similar evidence for a
sample of 38 initial sales.

      We treat the hypothesis that put sales are made because managers have private
information as the paper’s central economic question. While the literature offers little
insight into other reasons that put option sales could create value, an interesting
alternative hypothesis is that put sales are simply mistakes made by overconfident
managers. This kind of alternative hypothesis is implicit in our tests. Further, we have
data on each firms’ transactions. As discussed later, this allows us to better examine both
cross-sectional and time-series differences in abnormal returns subsequent to put option
sales, and whether the transactions reflect private information, or just luck.

3     Data collection and descriptive statistics

      We identify firms that sold put options on their own stock between 1991 and 2004 by
searching all annual and quarterly reports available on the Lexis-Nexis, Factiva, and
Edgar databases. We eliminate any put issues which are sold in conjunction with other
equity or debt securities by the same firm, and retain only stand-alone put sales. We
match the put sellers with data on firm characteristics from Compustat and data on stock
returns from CRSP. The final, comprehensive sample contains 137 firms and 796 distinct
put issues. Fig. 1 shows that the put sales start in 1991 (with two issues by Intel) and
increase in number throughout the 1990s. Put issues peak at 122 sales by 52 firms in
2000 before declining to 48 issues in 2002 and finally dropping to just two issues in
2004.

3.1     Firm characteristics

      Table 1 reports characteristics of the put selling firms, and presents the same
characteristics for all Compustat firms and for firms with ongoing share repurchase
programs. The latter comparison is relevant since put sale programs are framed and
announced as part of share repurchase programs, and it is interesting to see whether put
sellers differ from other repurchasing firms. We define a share repurchase program as
ongoing in a fiscal quarter when a firm repurchases shares worth at least 0.5% of its
prior-quarter book assets.


                                              8
      Table 1 shows that, on average, put issuers are larger than Compustat firms or firms
with standard share repurchase programs. For example, the average book value of assets
is $10.0 billion for put issuers, compared to $2.3 billion for both Compustat firms and
repurchasing firms. Put sellers have average sales of $6.1 billion, compared to $1.2
billion for Compustat firms and $1.8 billion for repurchasers. Their large size is reflected
in the fact that 75 out of 137 put sellers are in the S&P500 in some or all of the years in
which they sell puts.

      Put issuers are more profitable than other Compustat firms or repurchasers, with
average ROA of 9% compared to –4% and 3%, respectively. They also have higher
market valuations relative to book values: Put sellers have an average book-to-market
ratio of 0.38, compared to 0.74 for Compustat firms and 0.63 for share repurchasers. All
in all, put issuers tend to be large, profitable, and fast growing firms with high market
valuations, and they outperform firms with standard share repurchase programs on all
these dimensions.

3.2     Put characteristics

      Table 2 presents descriptive statistics on the put options issued by the sample firms.
Typically, put sellers make no pre- or post-sale announcements of specific put sale
transactions, and all our data is collected from subsequent financial statements. The detail
and quality of the reported information varies greatly across firms and is sometimes not
highly detailed. For this reason the summary statistics are based on fewer observations
than the total number of 796 put sales. The purchaser of the options is typically described
as a financial investor or an investment bank, and its name is disclosed in only a small
number of cases. None of the puts appears to have been issued on a public exchange. The
options are described as European whenever that information is provided, which is the
case for only a minority of the sales. Some of the puts have non-standard features, such as
allowing the issuer to settle the options before expiration, but the information on these
features is again incomplete.

      Panel A reports statistics on individual put sale transactions. The exact date at which
the put sale occurs is usually not reported, and we only know the month or quarter (or
occasionally an even longer time period) during which the sale takes place, with most


                                              9
sales reported as quarterly aggregates. This implies that the sales may reflect a single put
issue if there was only one sale during the quarter, or they may be the aggregate of
multiple issues that are reported together.

    The average sale transaction creates put options on 4.9 million shares, corresponding
to 0.88% of shares outstanding. The puts have an average face value, defined as the
number of puts times the average strike price, of $67.6 million, and the issuing firm
collects an average premium of $10.5 million per sale. The size distribution of the put
sales is right-skewed, with the largest face value of a single sale equal to $2.6 billion and
the largest premium collected equal to $402 million.

    The vast majority of the puts are sold out of the money, with an average ratio of strike
price to stock price during the put sale period of 0.95.7 The median put sale has a
maturity of six months, with a mean of 211 calendar days. Information on final put
outcomes is provided for 447 of the 796 put sales, and, for this sub-sample, 36% of the
put issues are exercised and 64% expire out of the money.

    Panel B reports summary information on the overall put sale programs. The average
program consists of 5.8 put sales that occur over a period of 2.1 years. If we restrict the
sample to the 103 firms that allow us to pinpoint each sale to (at most) a quarter, we find
that the majority of programs are concentrated in only a few quarters: 29 firms issue puts
in a single quarter, 21 in two quarters, 11 firms in three quarters, and 5 firms in four
quarters. Only 12 firms issue puts in ten or more quarters. The average put issuer in the
full sample sells options on 21 million shares or 4.2% of shares outstanding in total, and
receives proceeds of $53.4 million. The total face value, that is the total value put at risk
through the put sales, has a mean of $223.4 million. The highest proceeds collected by a
single firm are $2.1 billion by Microsoft, and the highest face value is $7.7 billion by
Intel.




7
  In a small number of cases it is certain that puts are issued in the money because the strike price exceeds
the stock price on all days of the put sale period. The 1991 SEC “no action” letter permits only the sale of
out of the money puts, but explicitly deals only with exchange traded options. The over-the-counter options
analyzed here are issued in a regulatory gray area, and some firms apparently did not feel bound by the
restrictions in the “no action” letter.


                                                    10
4     Can managers time the market with put option sales?

      We argue in Section 2 that market timing is the premier explanation for put option
sales, and in this section, we test whether managers can time the market successfully.

4.1     Stock price performance after put option sales

      Our first tests focus on detecting abnormal stock returns after put option sales. As
explained in Section 3, we typically do not know the precise date at which the puts are
sold. In most cases, we only know a time interval during which the sale occurs, usually a
fiscal quarter, a calendar month, or sometimes multiple fiscal quarters. We call this time
interval a “sale period” and we define an “event” as the last day of the sale period. If
more than one put transaction occurs within the same sale period, we treat these
transactions as one event in the subsequent analysis. In the following, we use the terms
event and put sale interchangeably.

4.1.1    Basic findings

      Fig. 2 shows average cumulative abnormal returns starting from trading day –100 to
day 150 after the event. We have 651 events with abnormal returns available on day –
100. To compute daily abnormal returns for each stock, we subtract the daily return on a
benchmark portfolio from the corresponding stock return. In Fig. 2, we use as
benchmarks the 49 industry portfolios and the 100 size and book-to-market portfolios
from Ken French’s website at http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/
(see also Fama and French, 1993 and 1997). The cumulative return from day –100 to t is
then the sum of the daily abnormal returns during that period.

      Fig. 2 is striking. The average cumulative abnormal return is close to zero during the
100 trading days leading up to the put sale, but increases immediately thereafter. For
example, the mean industry-adjusted return is –0.55% on day 0, it increases to 1.87%
during the first 50 trading days after the sale, and reaches 3.75% by day 100. The
cumulative return appears flat during the following 50 days.

      These findings suggest that managers are able to use private information to time put
option sales. Moreover, managers’ private information is relatively short lived: it affects



                                             11
returns immediately after the event and is fully incorporated into prices within the
following 100 trading days. This is much shorter than the long-run under- or
overperformance associated with other corporate events, such as stock issues or
repurchases.8 Interestingly, returns are zero or negative during the last fiscal quarter
before the event, even though in most cases the actual put sales occur during that quarter.
As we show in Section 4.2, however, most of the post-sale abnormal returns are realized
within a short window around the first post-sale earnings announcement, which is
consistent with the return pattern in Fig.1.

    In Table 3, we test whether the abnormal post-sale returns are statistically significant.
We divide the event horizon into six 50-day intervals: from trading day –100 to –50, from
trading day –50 to 0, etc., and report average cumulative returns and t-statistics for each
of the 50-day intervals. If a given interval (e.g. –50 to 0) overlaps for different events of
the same firm, we keep only the earlier event. The table confirms the findings in Fig. 2.
Benchmark adjusted returns are positive and statistically significant for the first two
intervals following the put sale. For example, the size and book-to-market adjusted return
is 2.73% for the first 50 days after the put sale (t-statistic, 3.67), and it is 1.93% for the
subsequent 50 days (t-statistic, 2.51). Benchmark adjusted returns are negative and not
significant for the two time intervals before the put sale.

    The t-statistics in Table 3 could be overstated because event horizons overlap for
some firms. To address this issue, we use the rolling portfolio approach suggested by
Fama (1998). Specifically, for each day in the sample period, we construct a backward-
looking portfolio consisting of firms that have an event during the past 70 calendar days
(we also look at the 140-day horizon; we choose the calendar-time horizons to match the
horizons in Table 3). We then regress the portfolio excess returns on the excess returns on
the market portfolio and the Fama and French (1993) size and book-to-market factors,
and test whether the regression intercepts (alphas) are different from zero. Intuitively, this
method collapses the overlapping stock returns for a given day into one portfolio return,
so that the standard errors are adjusted for cross-correlation. The tests confirm the results
in Table 3. The daily alpha obtained using the 70-day equal weighted portfolio is 0.07%

8
 See, for example, the survey articles by Fama (1998), Mitchell and Stafford (2000), Eckbo, Masulis, and
Norli (2006), and Baker, Ruback, and Wurgler (2006).

(t-statistic, 3.32), and it is 0.05% (t-statistic, 2.93) for the 140-day equal weighted
portfolio. The results for the value weighted portfolios are somewhat stronger with an
alpha of 0.09% (t-statistic, 3.33) for the 70-day portfolio, and an alpha of 0.08% (t-
statistic, 3.57) for the 140-day portfolio.

4.1.2   The put sale vs. the repurchase announcement effect

    Put issuers typically have ongoing share repurchase programs, and several studies
document positive abnormal returns following the announcements of repurchase
programs (e.g., Ikenberry, Lakonishok, and Vermaelen (1995), Peyer and Vermaelen
(2005)). Casual comparison suggests that the put sale effect is distinct from the
repurchase announcement effect. First, comparing the size and book-to-market adjusted
results in Table 3 to those in Peyer and Vermaelen, the repurchase announcement effect
persists much longer (48 months compared to 100 trading days for put sales), but it is
weaker at shorter horizons (after five months, it is only 1.89%, compared to 4.66% for
the 100 trading days after put sales). Second, Peyer and Vermaelen report that the
repurchase announcement effect is stronger for small high book-to-market firms, while
the put sellers are typically large and have low book-to-market ratios. In fact, Peyer and
Vermaelen find no abnormal returns at the five months horizon for either the top size
quintile or the bottom book-to-market quintile formed from all Compustat firms.

    To compare the two effects more directly, we re-run the results in Table 3 using size
and book-to-market portfolio benchmarks formed from a broad sample of repurchasing
firms. To match the put issuer sample as closely as possible, we define the “repurchaser
sample” based on completed repurchase transactions rather than just repurchase
announcements. Specifically, we define a firm-quarter as a “repurchase quarter” if the
firm repurchases shares worth at least 0.5% of prior-quarter book assets. We then form
the repurchaser sample consisting of all firms with at least one repurchase quarter. Each
firm enters the sample on the first day after its first repurchase quarter and exits the
sample two years after its last repurchase quarter. (We choose two years to match the
abnormal return horizon documented for repurchasing firms.)9 Finally, we form 25 size

 If a firm has a gap larger than two years between two repurchase quarters, the firm drops from the sample
after the initial two-year gap and re-enters the sample after the subsequent repurchase quarter.


                                                   13
and book-to-market portfolios from the repurchaser sample, again using breakpoints from
Ken French’s website (the number of repurchasing firms is too small to form 100
portfolios), and we re-run the tests in Table 3.

   We find that the put sale effect remains high after controlling for repurchases. For
example, the size and book-to-market adjusted returns are 2.61% for the first 50 days
after the put sale (t-statistic, 3.49), and they are 1.84% for the subsequent 50 days (t-
statistic, 2.48). For comparison, when the 25 size and book-to-market portfolios are
formed using all Compustat firms rather than just the repurchasing firms, the abnormal
returns are 3.12% for the first 50 days (t-statistic, 4.12) and 2.15% for the subsequent 50
days (t-statistic, 2.83). Given that Ikenberry (1995) and Peyer and Vermaelen (2005) find
little evidence of abnormal returns after repurchase announcements for large, low book-
to-market firms, i.e. firms comparable to our sample of put issuers, it is not surprising
that controlling for stock repurchases has little impact on our results.

4.1.3   Initiations and terminations of put option programs

   Finally, we look in more detail at the first and the last sale undertaken by each firm.
The first sale is close to the decision to initiate the put sale program, so first sales may be
better predictors of subsequent returns than the follow-up sales. Similarly, the last sale is
followed by the decision to terminate the program, which may be driven by negative
information, suggesting zero or even negative subsequent returns. Unfortunately, limiting
the analysis to the first or last sales substantially reduces the sample size. We have only
129 first sales and 122 last sales with available data on day one, after dropping seven last
sales that occur during or after 2003 (the 2003 accounting changes described in Section 2
could be responsible for terminations during that period). A further complication is that a
last sale indicates that managers continue to bet on rising stock prices, so subsequent
returns may reflect either managers’ positive inside information at the time of the sale, or
negative news that lead to the program termination.

   We find similar return patterns around put option sales, independent of when in a put
sale program they occur. For initiations, the size and book-to-market adjusted return for
the first 50 trading days is 3.45% (t-statistic, 2.26), followed by 1.17% for the subsequent
50 days (t-statistic, 0.74). For comparison, the corresponding point estimates for all sales


                                              14
in Table 3 are 2.73% and 1.93%. This suggests that managers are able to time the follow-
up sales at least as successfully as the initial transactions. The point estimates for last
sales are again similar: 3.55% for the first 50 days and 1.77% for the subsequent 50 days
(the t-statistics are 1.88 and 0.79, respectively). This is consistent with the idea that the
terminations results are driven – at least partly – by the positive post-sale effect
documented in Table 3.

4.2     Stock price reaction to earnings announcements after put option sales

      The positive excess returns after put sales raise the question what kind of inside
information managers have. The prior literature on share repurchases (Grullon and
Michaely (2004), Lie (2005)) examines whether managers have information about future
changes in profitability at the announcement of a share repurchase program and finds
mixed results. If managers use private information about future cash flows when they sell
put options, then investors should be positively surprised by earnings announcements
following put option sales. To test this hypothesis we examine abnormal stock price
reactions around the first, second, and third quarterly earnings announcement after the
sale.

      Fig. 3 shows the average benchmark adjusted cumulative returns for trading days –40
to 40 around the first quarterly earnings announcement. Similar to Fig. 2, we use 49
industry portfolios and 100 size and book-to-market portfolios as benchmarks.
Interestingly, the cumulative returns are almost zero up to 5 days before the
announcement and increase sharply during the subsequent 35 trading days. For example,
the industry-adjusted return is 0.1% on day –6 and reaches 2.75% on day 30. More than
30% of the 100-day post-sale effect documented in Table 3 occurs during the 10-day
window around the first quarterly earnings announcement.

      Table 4 shows the average cumulative returns and t-statistics for various windows
around the first, second, and third earnings announcement after the sale. The bottom
panel focuses on the 5-day, 11-day, and 21-day windows centered at the announcement.
Consistent with the results in Fig. 2, the cumulative abnormal returns are positive and
statistically significant for all three windows around the first announcement. For the
second announcement, the returns are still positive but – except in one case – not


                                             15
statistically significant, and there is no evidence of abnormal returns around the third
announcement. Thus any mispricing disappears relatively quickly after investors learn the
most recent earnings results.

      Overall, the return analysis suggests that managers use inside information about
future profitability to time corporate transactions, and that they do so successfully.
Although we cannot reject the notion that some managers are overconfident, our results
show that, on average, overconfidence does not inhibit managers’ ability to time
securities sales.

4.3     Changes in operating performance around put option sales

      Given that the market is positively surprised by the post-sale earnings
announcements, we next analyze the put issuers’ operating performance before and after
the sales. We examine both raw and benchmark adjusted performance to better
understand what type of information investors miss when forecasting post-sale earnings.

      Following Lie (2001 and 2005), we use two sets of control firms. We calculate
industry adjusted performance by selecting control firms that are in the same 2-digit SIC
industry and are closest to the sample firms in terms of beginning-of-quarter book assets.
We construct a second set of control firms by selecting firms that are from the same 2-
digit industry, have similar pre-sale operating performance (measured as ROA in the four
quarters ending in the pre-sale quarter), and similar pre-sale market-to-book ratios
(measured in the beginning of the sale quarter). The matching procedure is described in
detail in the Appendix. Matching on pre-sale performance allows us to control for
predictable mean reversion in accounting earnings.

      Table 5 presents operating performance around the 606 put sale quarters for which
the matching procedure was successful. There are three interesting findings in the table.
First, the unadjusted operating performance of the put sellers deteriorates starting before
the put sale and continuing after the sale. For example, the mean change in operating
ROA from quarter –1 to quarter 4 (the sale quarter is denoted as quarter zero) is –0.54
percentage points (t-statistic –2.48), and the mean change from quarter –1 to quarter 8 is
–0.69 percentage points (t-statistic –2.90). Second, the industry adjusted numbers show



                                            16
that put sellers strongly outperform their size matched industry peers both before and
after the put sales. There is some evidence that the outperformance declines after the put
sale, which may be caused by predictable mean reversion in ROA.

      The final two columns in Table 5 report put issuers’ operating performance relative to
their industry, performance, and market-to-book matched control firms. The put issuers
outperform their benchmarks starting in the quarter of the put sale, and the
outperformance increases over time. For example, the mean change in adjusted ROA
from quarter –1 to quarter 4 is 1.27 percentage points (t-statistic 3.82), and the mean
change from quarter –1 to quarter 8 is 1.63 percentage points (t-statistic 4.56). Hence,
even though ROA declines after put sales, the decline is smaller than that of control firms
with similar pre-sale performance. This pattern is qualitatively similar to the results found
by Lie (2005) for the announcements of share repurchase programs, but the
outperformance after put sales is several times larger than the outperformance after
repurchase announcements. The results in Table 5, combined with the positive excess
returns around post-sale earnings announcements in Table 4, suggest that investors may
have overestimated earnings declines for put issuers, and that firms sold puts to take
advantage of the resulting undervaluation.

4.4     Do managers time volatility?

      The value of a put option increases with the volatility of the underlying stock, so it is
possible that managers sell put options when they expect future volatility to be lower than
predicted by the market. In this section, we examine volatility changes around the
initiations and terminations of put sale programs, as well as around intermediate sales.
Finding that volatility declines after programs are initiated, stays low or declines further
after subsequent sales, and finally increases after programs are terminated would be
consistent with volatility timing. One limitation of this analysis is, however, that we do
not know investors’ actual volatility forecasts and have to rely on changes in realized
volatility instead.

      Fig. 4 shows volatility around the firms’ first, last and all other put sales. Volatility on
a given day is estimated as the standard deviation of daily stock returns over the prior 50
trading days. The figure shows that average volatility declines around the time when put


                                                17
option programs are initiated: it is 3.1% on day –20, drops to 2.7% on day 20, and stays
close to this level for the subsequent 180 trading days. Consistent with this pattern, there
are no significant volatility changes around the intermediate sales: it appears that
volatility remains low – compared to the pre-initiation level – throughout the duration of
the programs. Interestingly, volatility increases again around the time of the final sale: it
is 2.9% on day –20, compared to 3.1% on day 20 after the last sale. This suggests that
private information about volatility may influence both the initiation and the termination
decisions. The pattern of volatility shifts in Figure 4 is similar if instead of using mean
volatility we examine the median (cross-sectional) volatility. This suggest that the results
are not driven by a small subsample of firms.

    In Table 6 we test whether the volatility changes documented in Fig. 4 are statistically
significant. Panel A shows average changes in volatility from before to after put option
sales. We estimate volatility as the standard deviation of daily stock returns over 50, 100,
or 200 trading days before or after the put sale. We control for changes in market
volatility in two ways, either by subtracting a benchmark portfolio returns from the raw
returns before computing volatility (Panel A), or by subtracting a benchmark portfolio
volatility from the volatility of the raw returns (Panel B). We use the same benchmark
portfolios as in Table 3, and the results are similar across the different specifications.

    Consistent with the results in Fig. 4, we find that, on average, volatility declines after
initiations and increases after terminations, and that there are no significant volatility
changes around all other issues. The volatility declines around the initial sales are
statistically significant for the 100-day and the 200-day horizons (t-statistics from –1.99
to –4.26) and are not significant for the 50-day horizon (t-statistics from –1.00 to –1.65).
Similarly, the volatility increases around the final sales are statistically significant for the
50-day and the 100-day horizons (t-statistics from 1.88 to 3.15) and are not significant for
the 200-day horizon (t-statistics from 0.47 to 1.79). Thus it appears that put option
programs coincide with periods of relatively low volatility, which is consistent with
market timing.




                                              18
5   Conclusions

    The relevance of market timing explanations for corporate behavior continues to be
an unresolved issue. We provide some of the first evidence that firms issue securities for
the sole purpose of taking advantage of mispriced equity. Prior literature on market
timing examines equity issues, equity repurchases, and debt issues, all of which can be
motivated by reasons other than mispricing. Put sales, on the other hand, have no obvious
motivation in investment activity or capital structure, and management’s belief that it can
time the market seems the only plausible rationale.

    We find strong evidence that managers are able to predict future stock returns. Put
issuers outperform their risk-based benchmarks by 4.66% in the 100 trading days after a
put sale. Much of the outperformance is realized around the first earnings announcement
following the put issue, suggesting that managers may base their put sale decisions on
inside information about future profitability. We also find evidence that managers
successfully time the volatility of their stock returns. Realized volatility declines
significantly after the first put sale and increases following the last sale. Hence put sale
programs seem to coincide with periods of unusually low volatility for issuers, as would
be expected if they have information about future volatility which put purchasers do not.

    Our results provide support for the idea that managers can identify mispriced equity
and use securities issues to time the market. This is consistent with managers’ self-
professed belief in their ability to market time, but shows that this belief is based on more
than managerial overconfidence. While our study does not provide direct evidence that
market timing is a factor behind equity issues and repurchases, the results shift our priors
on the potential importance of timing explanations for a broader set of securities
transactions than examined here.




                                             19
Appendix

     We construct the performance-based matching sample in Section 4.3 based on
methodology in Lie (2001 and 2005). We measure performance as return on assets
(ROA) defined as operating income in percent of the average of beginning- and end-of-
quarter cash adjusted assets (cash adjusted assets is the book value of assets less cash and
short-term securities10). For each put issuer, we identify all Compustat firms in the same
2-digit SIC industry that have: (1) ROA in the quarter before the put sale (quarter −1)
within ±20% or within ±1 percentage point of the put issuer; (2) ROA for the four
quarters ending in quarter −1 within ±20% or within ±1 percentage point of the put
issuer; and (3) market-to-book ratio in the beginning of the sale quarter within ±20% or
within ±0.1 of the put issuer. If no firm meets all criteria, we select firms from the same
1-digit SIC industry, and finally without any industry requirement. If still no suitable
firms are found, we disregard the performance and market-to-book criteria. Finally,
among all candidate firms, we select the matching firm with performance characteristics
closest to the put issuer, where distance is defined as:

                 |ROAQuarter −1, put seller – ROAQuarter −1, matched firm|
               + |ROAQuarters −5 to −1, put seller – ROA Quarters −5 to −1, matched firm|
               + |M/BQuarter −1, put seller – M/BQuarter −1, matched firm|

     This procedure requires that both put issuers and matching firms have ROA data for
the four quarters preceding the put sale available. To avoid matching with very small
firms, we exclude matching firms with book assets less than $10 million.

  Lie (2005) advocates subtracting cash from book assets since the scaled operating performance of firms
that repurchase shares may increase solely because cash is removed from the balance sheet to fund
repurchases.

Descriptive statistics for put issuers, repurchasing firms, and all Compustat firms during 1991-2004. The samples consist of 137 put issuers (355 firm-years),
5,523 repurchasing firms (13,087 firm-years), and 14,263 Compustat firms (99,546 firm-years). A firm-year is included in the put issuer sample if the firm has at
least one put option sale in the fiscal year. A firm-year is included in the repurchasing firm sample if the firm repurchases shares worth at least 0.5% of the prior-
quarter book assets in at least one quarter of the fiscal year. ASSETS and SALES are book assets and sales ($billions). B/M is the ratio of the book value to the
market value of common stock. R&D, PPE, and CASH are R&D expense, PP&E plus inventory, and cash plus short-term investments scaled by book assets.
R&D and PPE are set to zero if they are missing on Compustat. ROA is net income scaled by the prior-year book assets. Dividend is a dummy variable equal to
one if the firm pays a dividend. Leverage equals total debt divided by the sum of total debt and the book value of common stock. Net stock sale is the difference
between the sale and the purchase of common and preferred stock scaled by the prior-year market value of common stock. Some variables are not available for
the full samples. All variables are winsorized at the 1st and the 99th percentile in the Compustat sample.

Table 2
Summary statistics for put option sales and programs. The total number of firms with put sales programs is
137, and the total number of put sales is 796. We exclude 32 maturity extensions of previously sold puts
from the sample. The number of observations is reduced further because of missing data. The face value of
a put issue is the number of puts sold times the average strike price. The moneyness of a put issue is the
ratio of the average strike price to the issuer’s stock price on the put sale date, or averaged over the sale
period (usually the fiscal quarter of the sale). The maturity of a put issue is the number of days between the
put sale date (or the midpoint of the sale period) and the maturity date (or the midpoint of the maturity
period). The fraction of all put issues exercised or settled is reported only for issues that can be traced from
sale to maturity and for which the final outcome is reported by the issuer.

Table 3
Abnormal returns around put option sales. The table shows average abnormal cumulative returns and t statistics for various windows around the put sale event.
The precise date of the put sale is usually not reported, and we define an event as the last day of the “sale period”, which is usually the fiscal quarter during which
the sale takes place. If multiple sales occur during one sale period, we treat these sales as one event. There are 137 put selling firms and 664 put sale events from
1991-2004 with available return data on the event day. Cumulative returns are computed for six 50-day intervals: from trading day –100 to –50, from trading day
–50 to 0, etc. If a given interval (e.g. –50 to 0) overlaps for different events of the same firm, we keep only the earlier event. Cumulative return is the sum of
daily returns during the 50-day interval. Daily abnormal returns are computed by subtracting the daily return on a benchmark portfolio from the corresponding
stock return. We use three benchmarks: the value-weighted CRSP index, the 49 industry portfolios and the 100 size and book-to-market portfolios from Ken
French’s website (see Fama and French, 1993 and 1997).

Table 4
Cumulative returns around earnings announcements following put option sales. The table shows average
cumulative returns and t-statistics around the first three earnings announcements (EA) following a put sale
event (put sale event is defined in Table 3). The sample consists of 137 put selling firms and 631 earnings
announcements from 1991-2004. Panel A shows cumulative returns from trading day –5 to 40 after the first
announcement; Panel B shows cumulative returns for shorter windows centered around the first, second,
and third announcement. In Panel B, the sample of 338 second announcements does not include
announcements numbered second and first for subsequent events of the same firm. Similarly, the sample of
242 third announcements does not include announcements numbered third as well as second and/or first.
Cumulative return is the sum of daily returns during the even window. Daily abnormal returns are
computed by subtracting the daily return on a benchmark portfolio from the corresponding stock return (the
benchmarks are described in Table 3).

Table 5
Quarterly operating performance around put sales. Operating performance is measured as operating income
scaled by average cash-adjusted assets. The put sale occurs in quarter 0. Industry-adjusted performance is
the performance of put issuers less the performance of industry- and size- matched control firms.
Performance-adjusted performance is the performance of put issuers less the performance of industry-,
performance-, and market-to-book-matched control firms. The matching procedure is described in Section
4.3 and Appendix 1. T-statistics for means and Z-statistics from Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for medians are
reported in brackets.

Table 6
Changes in stock return volatility from before to after put option sales. The table shows the average change
in volatility from before to after a put sale event (put sale event is defined in Table 3) and the
corresponding t-statistics. All statistics are shown separately for the firms’ first, last, and all other put sale
events. In Panel A, volatility is the daily standard deviation of benchmark adjusted stock returns; in Panel
B, volatility is the daily standard deviation of raw returns minus the daily standard deviation of a
benchmark portfolio returns computed over the same period. We use three benchmarks: the value-weighted
CRSP index, the 49 industry portfolios and the 100 size and book-to-market portfolios from Ken French’s
website. Volatility is computed over 50, 100, or 200 trading days before and after the event, and we require
that returns are available for at least 50 trading days for each estimate. For “all other” sales, if a given
horizon (e.g. 50-day after sale) overlaps for different sales of the same firm, we drop the overlapping days
before computing volatility. More precisely, for each volatility estimate after (before) the sale, we drop
days that overlap with the same-length horizon for the subsequent (previous) sale. There are 129 first sales,
122 last sales, and 361 all other sales with available estimates of volatility changes.
