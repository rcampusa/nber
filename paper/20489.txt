                                              ABSTRACT

We estimate the elasticity of reported income with respect to tax rates for high earners using subnational
variation across Canadian provinces. We argue this allows for better identification of tax elasticities
than the existing literature. We find that elasticities of reported income at the provincial level are large
for incomes in the top one percent, but small for lower earners. There are strong indications that the
response happens both through earned and capital income. While our estimated elasticities are large,
changes in tax rates cannot explain much of the overall long-run trend of higher income concentration
in Canada.

1 Introduction

An enduring controversy in the study of high earners is the role of taxation in understanding the evolu-

tion and composition of income at the top of the income distribution. Piketty and Saez (2003) uncov-

ered a strong trend in concentration of incomes in the highest fractiles in the United States starting in

the 1980s. That decade also saw large cuts to marginal tax rates faced by higher earners. While these

two trends lined up quite well in the United States, evidence from other countries has been less persua-

sive for the link between the surge in income concentration and high income taxation. Looking at the

case of Canada, evidence from Saez and Veall (2005) and Veall (2012) suggests much less correspondence

between taxes and the evolution of high incomes.

    One of the challenges in this literature has been the necessary reliance on time series trends to make

inferences. Given the national basis for most income tax systems, it has proven difficult to separate the

impact of tax changes from other developments in the economy. Moreover, the usual route of exploit-

ing large reforms within a country to make inferences is difficult in this case because the tax-response

parameter being estimated may itself be different before and after the reform.1

    In this paper we estimate the elasticity of reported income using the sub-national variation across

Canadian provinces. We argue this allows for better identification of elasticities than the existing litera-

ture. There are two primary advantages. First, we have data and variation in tax rates within one national

economic space, which allows us to control for common trends in a more rigorous way than in much of

the literature. Second, we have an extended opportunity, both in time and across provinces, with a very

similar tax base. This is important because theory and evidence suggests that the response of incomes to

taxation should vary when the tax base changes. Anchoring our estimates in a period of tax base stability

allows us to be more sure of the parameter we are estimating.2

    An important limitation of our approach also results from our use of provincial-level variation. If

some of the response to higher tax rates at the provincial level reflect movements of taxable dollars

within-Canada across provinces, then the elasticity we estimate here based on provincial-level variation
   1 The Canadian tax reform of 1988 was used as the basis for estimation in Sillamaa and Veall (2001). However, Fullerton (1996)

argues that times of large tax reforms are especially difficult for identifying the impact of taxation on one particular element of
behaviour because so many things change at once.
   2 Our strategy aligns well with the suggestion in the survey by Saez, Slemrod and Giertz (2012) to seek "better sources of

identification; for example, parallel income tax systems that differentially affect taxpayers over a long period of time."



                                                                2
cannot be applied without reservation to predict the impact of federal tax policy changes. The provincial

estimates may embed some of this inter-provincial response that would not be present with a federal tax

rate change. In related and ongoing research, Milligan and Smart (2013) develops a theoretical and em-

pirical framework for evaluating the complex federal interactions in considering the federal and provin-

cial aspects of high income taxation. The limitations of the approach in this present paper, though, mean

that the estimates presented here are most useful for understanding changes at the provincial level.

    Comparing across provinces and through time, we find that elasticities are large for incomes at the

top of the income distribution, but small elsewhere. We also find that the overall long-run trend of higher

income concentration in Canada is largely unrelated to taxes, as the long-run changes in tax rates are not

large enough to explain the big changes in income concentration. Finally, we look at the composition of

income, finding evidence that both earnings and capital income respond strongly to taxation.

    We begin with an overview of the relevant institutions in Canada. This is followed by an extensive

discussion of our empirical strategy. We then describe the data, before heading into our results. We

conclude with a short discussion.



2 Personal income taxation in Canada

In the Canadian federation, the constitutional division of powers allows both the federal and provincial

governments to assess direct taxation on personal incomes. Each province and the federal government

set tax brackets and rates based on a definition of taxable income, with various credits applied against

the calculated tax liability. For the provinces, this is called the ‘tax on income’ system, as provincial

taxes (outside Quebec) are levied on federally-defined taxable income. In 2009, 39.6 percent of the total

$189.2 billion in income tax revenue in Canada was collected by provincial or territorial governments.3

So, provincial income taxation in Canada is sizeable.

    Nine of the provincial governments collect personal income taxes through tax collection agreements

with the federal government, with only Quebec operating its own income tax system. Under these tax

collection agreements, the federal government collects the income tax on behalf of the nine ‘agreeing’

provincial governments. The tax collection agreements also require the use of the federal definition of

taxable income. As noted in the introduction, this common tax base is useful both for estimation and for

interpretation of the sensitivity of taxable income to tax rates.

   The provincial tax rates for high earners vary strongly across the country, ranging from a low of 10

percent in Alberta to a high of 25.75 in Quebec. Figure 1 displays the provincial and combined marginal

tax rates for 2013. The federal income tax rate for the highest bracket is 29 percent outside of Quebec,

but drops to 24.2 percent in Quebec because of a federal tax abatement for residents of that province.

The combined rate is lowest in Alberta (at 39 percent) and highest in Nova Scotia (at 50.0 percent).

   This personal income tax system took its current ‘tax on income’ form in 2000/2001. Previous to

then, the bulk of provincial income tax in the agreeing provinces was levied using a ‘tax on tax’ structure.

Under ‘tax on tax’, the provincial liability was not calculated directly on federal taxable income, but as




                                                             4
a percentage of a measure of federal taxes called Basic Federal Tax.4 A province did not choose its own

brackets and rates, just one flat percentage that was applied to Basic Federal Tax. In 1999, this rate varied

from a high of 69 percent in Newfoundland and Labrador to a low of 39.5 percent in Ontario. So, if a

taxpayer had $100 of Basic Federal Tax, the initial provincial tax liability (before surtaxes) was $39.50 in

Ontario and $69.00 in Newfoundland and Labrador. This structure limited to some degree the scope

of progressivity a province could apply to its tax schedule. However, provinces had the ability to add

surtaxes and ‘flat taxes’ levied against taxable income.5

    In Figure 2, we plot the provincial high income tax rate for each province for the years 1988 to 2011.

We calculate this using the tax rate at the national income threshold of the 99.99th percentile income

group, which is far above the top tax bracket threshold for each of the years and provinces included. It

is difficult in places to pick out the different provincial lines, but this is a virtue for our identification

strategy which relies on substantial variation across provinces. At the bottom of the graph, Alberta is a

clear outlier after 1991 with rates substantially lower than the other provinces. British Columbia went

from the lowest in 1988 to among the highest in the mid-1990s and then back to the second lowest in

2002. In all provinces, the ‘tax on income’ reform put in place in 2000-2001 is evident. In the 2000s,

British Columbia moves from among the highest to the lowest outside Alberta, while Nova Scotia and

Newfoundland and Labrador move in opposite directions.

    We chose the year 1988 as the starting point for Figure 2 because 1988 was the year of a major reform

to the tax base. Previous to 1988, the tax base was smaller with deductions from total income for many

items that became credits in 1988.6 This motivates our decision to begin the analysis with the year 1988.

While there have been some base adjustments in the period since 1988, we view the tax base during this

1988 to 2011 era as relatively stable.7

    One way to assess the extent of the province-year variation in the tax rates is to run a simple regres-

surtaxes or abatements.
   5 That same Ontario taxpayer in 1999 was subject to surtaxes of 20 percent of provincial tax for each dollar of provincial tax

over $3,750 and an additional 36 percent for each dollar of provincial tax over $4,681. Also in 1999, Manitoba, Saskatchewan,
and Alberta had flat taxes ranging from 0.5 percent to 2.0 percent on taxable income.
   6 For example, the basic amount, the amount for Canada Pension Plan contributions, and the amount for medical expenses

(among many others) were all transformed from deductions to credits.
   7 The most important changes to the tax base over this time period involve capital income, with the capital gains exclusion

rate changing from 75 percent to 50 percent in 2000 and the dividend tax credit and gross-up also changing through time.

sion of the top marginal tax rate on year and province dummies and record the R-squared to see how

much of the variation in tax rates is within province through time. Running this regression on the whole

1988 to 2011 dataset yields an R-squared of 80.9 percent, leaving a fairly substantial 19.1 percent of the

variation explained by within-province movements through time. The R-squared is lower in the ‘tax on

tax’ 1988-1999 period (at 71.6 percent) than in the ‘tax on income’ 2001-2011 period (at 88.2 percent).

There is also more within-province variation in the five most easterly provinces (with an R-Squared of

65.8 percent) than in the five more westerly provinces (with an R-Squared of 88.2 percent).



3 Empirical Approach

We employ an aggregate shares approach to estimating the elasticity of reported income.8 Very simi-

lar methods to our approach have been used in Saez (2004), Saez and Veall (2005), Atkinson and Leigh
  8 The different approaches taken in the literature are reviewed by Saez et al. (2012).




                                                                                     6
(2010), and Department of Finance (2010). In this section, we construct our empirical specification and

discuss how our approach treats empirical challenges that arise.

    The basic economic relationship we wish to estimate is between reported total income y i t of an

individual i in year t and the marginal tax rate he or she faces τi t . Since the work of Feldstein (1995), the

basic empirical specification for estimating the elasticity of taxable income often takes the form



                                    log y i t = αi + δt + β log(1 − τi t ) + ϵi t                           (1)


where αi and δt are individual and year fixed effects affecting mean reported income, β is the elasticity

of reported income to the net-of-tax rate, and ϵi t is an IID error term. This model has frequently been

estimated with panel data on individual incomes using quasi-experimental methods, exploiting tax re-

forms that change the tax rates facing some taxpayers but not other taxpayers, who serve as a “control”

group for estimating the unobserved time fixed effects δt driving income variation contemporaneous

with the tax reforms. However, Saez et al. (2012) point out several challenges confronting panel data

studies, including the availability of long panels encompassing repeated tax reforms, and the problem of

disentangling mean reversion after temporary income shocks from changes to the income distribution

caused by taxes.

    An alternative approach is to estimate elasticities using only aggregate data on the income shares of

fractiles of the income distribution over time. For simplicity, let us divide the population into a group of

high income taxpayers H , all facing a common tax rate τH t , and a complementary group of lower-income

taxpayers L. The H group is some top fractile of the distribution, say the top one percent. For reasons

that will become clear, we are primarily interested in estimating the elasticity of reported income β for

the sub-population of H taxpayers, but the L group remains useful as a control for unobservable factors

affecting incomes over time. In particular, to identify β using the share data approach, we assume that:

(i) reported incomes in group H have a common tax elasticity β, but incomes in group L are not affected

by tax rates; and (ii) the two groups are affected by temporal shocks in the same way on average—i.e. the

usual parallel trends assumption.

    Letting Y H t be aggregate income in the top fractile in year t and YLt be aggregate income of others,




                                                         7
the underlying model is therefore


                                              log Y H t = αH + δt + β log(1 − τH t ) + ϵH t                                          (2)

                                              log YLt = αL + δt +                        +ϵLt .                                      (3)


Formally, this specification corresponds to the individual income model (1) only if membership in the

top fractile H does not vary from year to year, i.e. there are no income ranking reversals. However, Saez

(2004) argues that if the goal is studying the tax-induced change to the income distribution rather than

to individuals, then the elasticity estimated from share data is the relevant one.

    Given time series data on aggregate incomes of the two groups and top tax rates, we can therefore

difference the two equations to eliminate time effects and estimate β by OLS regression of log Y H t −

log YLt on the tax rate term. As a practical matter, it is more useful to define the income share of the top

fractile to be
                                                                       YH t
                                                           sH t =                                                                    (4)
                                                                    Y H t + YLt

                                          1 − sH t


From (5) we see that fixed effects estimation of our model (2)-(3) is equivalent to the simple OLS regres-

sion model

                                                    z H t = α + β log(1 − τH t ) + u t                                               (6)


which is the basis for regressions reported in this paper.9

    As noted, a key assumption in deriving (6) is that the control group is unaffected by taxes, or that

the control group’s own tax rate is unchanged in the regression sample. Previous research and our own

investigations with the data suggest that behavioural response to taxes is much larger in the top one

percent of the income distribution and above than among any lower fractiles. (See below for evidence
   9 In contrast, most of the literature surveyed in Saez et al. (2012) uses log s
                                                                                   H t as the dependent variable rather than z H t . That
regression consistently estimates β under slightly different and arguably less plausible identifying assumptions. It turns out
that the differences in estimates under the two approaches is small for our data.

in larger variability of marginal tax rates for the top one per cent than for the lower fractiles. As one

measure, the standard deviation of the marginal tax rate at the 50th percentile is 0.0294, but 0.0358 at the

99th percentile. Taking a taxfiler-weighted national average, the marginal tax rate at the 50th percentile

ranged between 30 and 34 percent over 1988 to 2011, while at the 99th percentile the range was from 45

percent to 53 percent.

    There remains the usual endogeneity concern that top tax rate changes may be correlated with unob-

servable factors driving income distribution over time so that corr(τH t , u t ) ̸= 0 and OLS on (6) is biased.

While there is much debate in the literature about the contribution of taxes to increasing income concen-

tration, it seems extreme to assume all movements in income concentration are tax-driven. Solutions to

this challenge in the literature have included trying to specify and include the non-tax factors that may

drive trends in the top fractile share, or to include general polynomial time trends. For example, Saez

(2004) uses time trends, while Saez and Veall (2007) uses the top one percent income share from the

United States.

    One approach to this problem that is possible with Canadian data is to exploit tax differences among

Canadian provinces. If the non-tax determinants of high income concentration that are correlated with

tax rate trends are common to all provinces, then the cross-province difference-in-difference estimator

purges the national trends and looks instead at changes in tax rates within provinces over time. Thus

we introduce a further set of time fixed effects common to all provinces into the income share equation

equation (6), as well as a set of jurisdiction dummies to estimate



                                          z H pt = αp + λt + β log(1 − τH pt ) + u pt .                                     (7)


    This estimator was also adopted in Atkinson and Leigh (2010), who estimate elasticities using time-

series data on national top fractile shares in the English-speaking developed countries.11 Arguably, our

top elasticity changes little. We report the relevant coefficients in the discussion of Table 3 below.
  11 That is, the US, UK, Canada, Australia , and New Zealand.




                                                                 9
approach using provincial data is preferable for two reasons. First, many of the time-varying institutional

factors that lead to a concern about the correlation of u t and τH t are not common across countries.

For example, wage-setting patterns or executive compensation practices have strong country-specific

features. Second, it is not clear β is the same across countries. As noted by Slemrod and Kopczuk (2002),

the elasticity of response to taxes will depend on the particular tax base. If a country’s tax system allows

easy shifting of income out of the personal income tax base, then the elasticity will be high; if the tax

base is tighter the elasticity will be low. The elasticity is not a structural behavioural parameter, but a

reflection of a particular tax system.

   By using Canadian provinces to estimate equation (7), we get the benefits of the Atkinson-Leigh ap-

proach, but can improve on both of the shortcomings noted above. First, we argue that the non-tax

determinants of high income concentration listed above are more likely to be common across provinces

within Canada than they are across countries. Second, the tax bases across nine of the ten provinces are

identical through the tax collection agreements, meaning we are estimating the response in the context

of the same tax base.

   The same province-year estimation strategy was also used in Department of Finance (2010). They

implement the same basic strategy over the 1995-2006 period. In some specifications, they augment their

analogue to equation (7) with a ‘high oil price’ dummy for certain years for Alberta. In some robustness

checks, we include province-specific time trend polynomials that control (up to a polynomial) for such

province-specific episodes in any province.

   There are some limitations to this approach however. Our estimated elasticity parameter is most

relevant from the point of view of a provincial government. If income shifting across provinces is em-

pirically important, then a unilateral increase in the tax rate in one province will cause a larger decline

in the tax base there than in the nation as a whole. Thus the elasticity of the provincial tax base may

exceed the elasticity of the federal base. In the presence of interprovincial income shifting, a tax increase

in one province may therefore have offsetting effects on reported income in the home province and in

the other provinces that implicitly serve as the control group for our difference-in-difference estimator,

which would tend to bias our estimated elasticity upward.

   Our estimates would also be affected if individual taxpayers are physically mobile between provinces



                                                     10
or across countries in response to tax rate changes. Our income share approach relies on changes in

the income share of top fractiles within each province over time, but does not account for changes in

the identity of those taxpayers. If, for example, some high income taxpayers were to leave a province

in response to a tax rate increase, the right reported income to record for those who shifted residence

would be zero, as those taxpayers responded to the tax change by moving all of their reported income out

of that jurisdiction. However, in our approach those who depart are “replaced” in the data by taxpayers

with incomes right at the fractile threshold. This understates the true decline in provincial income in

response to the tax change. Therefore, with interjurisdictional mobility, we tend to under-estimate the

tax base elasticity under our approach. Thus the two biases are in offsetting directions.



4 Data

We combine various sources of information to form our dataset. Below we describe the data sources in

detail, then provide some graphical analysis of the broad trends in our data.


4.1 Sources

Our empirical strategy relates the the tax rate faced by top earners to the income reported by the top

earners. So, our analysis requires both a measure of tax rates and measures of incomes. Below we de-

scribe how we use the Canadian Tax and Credit Simulator (CTaCS; see Milligan 2013a) to form our tax

rates. We then describe our manipulation of the CANSIM high income database to form our measures of

top incomes.

   The CTaCS calculator produces a tax liability for an individual given a certain income, year, and

province of residence using the tax system parameters in effect during that year in the given province. By

repeating the calculation with an increment of $100 to the income, a marginal tax rate can be estimated

by taking the difference of the two tax liabilities and dividing by 100. We perform this calculation for each

year between 1988 and 2011 and for each province. For incomes, we perform the calculations both for

the average and for the threshold level of each income group under consideration. For example, for the

‘top 1 percent’ income group, we calculate the marginal tax rate at both the income threshold for entry

into the income group, and the average income among those in the income group.


                                                     11
    Our focus on top earners means that Canada’s vast and important system of refundable tax credits

does not play a large role in our analysis. For middle and lower income Canadians, proper attribution

of tax liabilities and calculation of marginal tax rates requires careful consideration of refundable tax

credits like the Goods and Services Tax Credit and the Canada Child Tax Benefit. However, at the income

ranges necessary for membership in the top fractiles of interest here, individuals are not eligible for the

refundable tax credits.

    The simulation of individual taxation at higher income ranges does require more attention be paid

to deduction and credit items that may reduce taxable income or tax paid. We impute the most common

of these items to our individuals using available data.12 However, these imputations will only affect our

estimates of marginal tax rates to the extent that the simulated individual is pushed into a lower tax

bracket. Given the relatively low thresholds to be in the highest tax bracket in Canada (all members of

the top one percent are in the highest tax bracket in most province-years), being pushed into a lower tax

bracket is uncommon. Overall tax liabilities may be affected by these imputations, but marginal tax rates

are unlikely to be affected by the imputations at higher fractiles.

    Our income data come from the CANSIM high income database, which reports various measures

of income for several income fractiles.13 The CANSIM data distinguish between ‘market income’ and

‘total income’, which differ by the inclusion of government transfer income in total income, but not in

market income. The other main distinction is whether or not to include capital gains income. We focus

our analysis for the most part on total income excluding capital gains, but show sensitivity to the other

income definitions as well. We transform all income data to 2010 values using the Consumer Price Index.

The data are available for various income groups, including for those above cutoffs at the 90th, 95th, 99th.

and 99.9th percentiles of income.

    For our last set of results which look at the composition of income among high earners, we assemble

a dataset based on the annual Canada Revenue Agency Income Statistics publications. These data report
  12 We impute based on data from the Canada Revenue Agency’s Tax Statistics on Individuals. We define cells by province,

year, and narrow income groups. We impute an amount and a probability of any amount to each cell based on these Canada
Revenue Agency data. We include the following tax measures: donations and gifts, RRSP contributions, RPP contributions,
union dues, childcare expenses, other deductions, and additional deductions from net income. We repeat this simulation 100
times and average the results.
  13 The relevant CANSIM table is 204-0002. This table provides average, median, and threshold cutoff income levels (among

other statistics) for different income groups with a particular focus on high income groups. These data come from the Longitu-
dinal Administrative Databank which is constructed from income tax administrative data.

the aggregate amount and number of taxfilers for a large set of items appearing on the tax form, ranging

from income items like Total Income, taxable dividend income, and self-employment income to deduc-

tion items like childcare expenses and credit items like charitable donations. The data are reported in

aggregate, as well as for a set of nominal categories which is fairly constant through time. We pay particu-

lar attention to the categories for $250,000 and those that report income between $150,000 and $250,000

as that income range is the closest to the P99 cutoff on which we focus. The appendix describes more

detail about the formation of this dataset.


4.2 Income Trends

The trends in high incomes in Canada have been well-documented using administrative tax data in Saez

and Veall (2005) and Veall (2012), and in census data by Milligan (2013b). In this section we provide a

brief overview of the trends with a particular emphasis on the provincial attributes and the time period

1988 to 2011 of interest to our analysis.

province. For some smaller provinces, higher thresholds were suppressed in the original data to maintain

confidentiality.

   The table reveals two important trends. First, the cutoff thresholds for reaching P99.9 grew much

more than for P95 in all provinces. Nationally, the growth in the P95 threshold was 18.9 percent and

at P99.9 it was 52.3 percent. This suggests much larger income growth at the very top, consistent with

previous findings. The second important feature of Table 1 is the vast difference across provinces. As

found in Veall (2012), the growth was much stronger in some provinces than others, with Alberta leading

the pack. For the threshold to be in P99, the cutoff grew by 19.7 percent in Nova Scotia over this period,

but by 75.1 percent in Alberta.

   We now turn to the share of income earned by those over the percentile group thresholds seen above.

To provide a sense of overall trends in high incomes in Canada, Figure 3 shows the national time series for

several top income shares over the period 1988 to 2011. There is clear growth above the 90th, 95th, 99th,

and 99.9th percentile. The percentage growth was greater for the higher fractiles shown in Figure 3. In

the top ten percent (above the 90th percentile cutoff; P90) the share of income grew 12.4 percent between

1988 and 2011, from 32.2 percent of total income to 36.2 percent. Above P95, the growth was stronger at

17.3 percent over this time period; for the top 0.1 percent (above P99.9), the total income share rises by

38.7 percent.

   The strength of the income share movements at the top of the distribution come into clearer focus by

further parsing the data. Figure 4 breaks down the top 10 percent into four pieces: between P90 and P95,

between P95 and P99, between P99 and P99.9, and above P99.9. This figure also uses an index rather

than the absolute shares in order to emphasize the percentage change over time. There is no upward

movement between P90 and P95. For the share between P95 and P99, there is growth of about 10 percent

from from 12.1 percent in 1982 to 13.4 in 2011. Again, the growth is stronger in the higher fractiles. For

the first 9 tenths of the top one percent, the income share grows from 6.2 to 7.4 percent, for an increase



                                                                              15
of 19.4 percent. For the top one tenth of the top one percent, the income share increases by 38.7 percent

by 2011, but peaked earlier in 2006 at 84.6 percent above 1988.

   These patterns for Canada are consistent with those in the U.S. (and elsewhere) in two important

ways. First, the rise in incomes is concentrated at the very top of the distribution. Not only are tax

developments at the top of the income distribution important for redistribution, but also these taxpayers

have access to substantial financial advice that may facilitate tax avoidance. Second, Saez and Veall

(2005) show the source of incomes among those at the top has shifted substantially over the last half

century from capital income toward earned income. All else equal, this change would tend to make

income shifting or tax avoidance more difficult now than in earlier times.

   To preview the core empirical relationship we will explore in the regressions, we plot in Figure 5 the

relationship between the tax rates on top income and the top one percent income shares, using our data

which vary at the province-year level. The data points near the y-axis of the figure are for Alberta in the

2000s. For the main cloud of data, there is a clear negative relationship between the tax rate and the top

one percent share not only for the cloud as a whole, but also within provinces.



5 Main Results

In this section we present the main empirical results, then discuss the implications of our results. We be-

gin by building up our specification, comparing the province-year results that can control for common

time effects to time series estimates that do not. We then show the sensitivity of results to different spec-

ifications and samples, and how the results vary across different high income groups. We close the main

results section with a discussion of the relevance of our results and an assessment of the contribution of

taxes to the trends in high income concentration in Canada.


5.1 Empirical Results

The first results start with a time series specification like the ones used in the previous literature and

then move toward the specification our data allow us to use in our context. These results appear in Table

2. The dependent variable in all cases is the log share ratio z P 99 for the top one percent. The tax rate

variable here is the log of one minus the marginal tax rate, calculated by using the actual average income

is common in the literature.14 Here and in all specifications in this paper we weight by the number of

taxfilers in the jurisdiction.15

provinces, weighting each province in the average by total income. Using just the 24 annual national

observations between 1988 and 2011 we obtain a strongly significant elasticity estimate of 2.046 in the

first column of Table 2. Of course, this requires the assumption that there are no other time series trends
  14 The threshold marginal tax rate is calculated using the national average threshold income level for each fractile and each

province’s tax system. In practice for the fractiles we use, there is very little difference between using actual and threshold
marginal tax rates because in Canada there is little progressivity at higher income levels. So, the same top tax rate applies
to everyone in the top one percent fractile in almost every year. This is not true in many other countries, necessitating the
commonly-used threshold instrumental variables approach.
  15 We base this choice on the discussion in Solon et al. (forthcoming). For a causal investigation like ours, weighting by popu-

lation can be appropriate to account for heteroskedasticity. Solon et al. (forthcoming) note that it is not necessarily true that this
correction can improve the precision of the estimation and recommend observing whether standard errors fall with weighting.
In our case, the standard errors do fall with weighting, so we proceed to use the weights for our estimation.

in top income shares and therefore attributes all of the changes in top income shares to taxes. In the

second column, we follow Saez and Veall (2007) and include the log of the top one percent share from

the United States as a proxy for global trends affecting top earners.16 As found by Saez and Veall (2007),

this one control knocks the coefficient down by 75 percent. The US coefficient itself is close to 1.00,

which suggests a tight correspondence between trends in the US and in Canada. Other combinations

of polynomial time controls (not shown) deliver highly variable results. Without an easy way to choose

which set of time controls is the right specification, the range of estimates for the elasticity is quite high.

    In the next three columns of Table 2, we use the province-year data. Here, we cluster our standard

errors at the province level to account for correlated errors within the time series for each province. The

first column includes just the set of province dummies αp but omits the time controls λt seen in equation

(7). The estimated elasticity is 1.673, not very different from the time series estimate in column (1). With

the US top one percent included in column (4), the coefficient is again knocked down substantially. In

column (5), we add the time effects λt . These control flexibly for any arbitrary differences across time

periods that are common across the provinces. Here, the elasticity estimate is 1.068, significant at the

10 percent level. These results indicate the sensitivity of elasticity estimates in a time series context

to the way time effects are controlled, and also the value of the province-year framework which can

control for these time effects in a flexible way. On the other hand, the value is limited by the relevance of

these estimates to provincial versus federal tax changes. In the presence of inter-provincial shifting, our

empirical approach will estimate well the sensitivity of income to tax changes at the provincial level, but

will overstate the responsiveness at the federal level.

    We now try out some other variations on our specification in Table 3. In this table, we estimate forms

of (7), with the log ratio dependent variable, time and province effects, and standard errors clustered on

province. The basic specification in the first column is the same as in column (5) of Table 2. In the second

column, we add a control for total income. Atkinson and Leigh (2010) control for GDP in their cross-

country regressions to try to account for differential overall income growth in the different economies.

Here in column (2), we use the log of total reported personal income within each province-year for our

income control. The income control itself in column (2) has a significant coefficient of 0.729, suggesting

a strong positive relationship between income growth and the share of income in the top one percent.

The coefficient on the marginal tax rate falls, but remains strongly significant at 0.689. Our estimate here

might be compared to the 0.62 elasticity coefficient that is reported in Department of Finance (2010)

using a similar approach with Canadian data for the period 1995 to 2006. In results not reported in

the table, we tried including the marginal tax rate at the 50th percentile to test the assumptions of our

empirical approach in equations (2) and (3). With the 50th percentile marginal tax rate included, the

coefficient on the 99th percentile tax rate remains almost unchanged at 0.689.17 This suggests our choice

to focus only on the top fractile tax rate in our main specifications is supported by the data.

    The next two columns explore two other alternative specifications. In column (3), we follow the

advice of Solon et al. (forthcoming) to check the results unweighted. The coefficient changes little, and

of note the standard error for the weighted version is smaller, suggesting the weighting improved the

efficiency of our estimates. The fourth column replaces our log ratio dependent variable z pt   with the
                    P 99
simpler log share s pt   . Again, the results are little changed. In the final two columns of Table 3, we

subject the specification from column (2) to stronger tests by including linear province-specific trends in

column (5) and quadratic province-specific trends in column (6). Relative to column (2), the precision of

the estimates decreases, but the estimated elasticities stay in the same range at 0.794 for linear provincial

trends, and 0.510 for quadratic trends. Not shown here, the results attenuate slightly as cubic provincial

trends are added to 0.417 (0.245) and 0.379 (0.260) for quartic provincial trends. We view these results as

quite robust. For the rest of our estimation, we use the specification in column (2). While the results do

hold up to quadratic provincial trends, the robustness checks that follow do show more variability when

we use the quadratic provincial trends specification.

    We also check the results in different time periods in order to get a stronger sense of the sources of

identification. The first column in Table 4 replicates our base specification for the P99 top one percent

group. The next two columns break out two distinct time periods. The first is 1988 to 1999, which was the

period between the 1988 tax reform and the ‘tax on income’ reform implemented by provinces over the

years 2000-2001. As can be seen in Figure 2, there was a large degree of variation in top tax rates across

provinces over this time period. The estimate in column (2) for 1988 to 1999 is a statistically significant

0.948. The second time period we choose is 2001 to 2011, which is entirely within the ‘tax on income’ era.

Here, there is much less within-province variation evident in Figure 2. Alberta is constant over this time

period, and other provinces (with the exception of Newfoundland and Labrador) don’t move very much.

The point estimate for this time period in column (3) is 1.026, but the standard error is too large to allow

for a statistical inference different from zero.

    In the final column of Table 4, we examine what happens over a narrow time window from 1995 to

2005 surrounding the ‘tax on income’ reform. Here, the point estimate is a statistically significant 0.458.

Given the sharpness of the reform in 2000-2001, it might seem natural to attempt a regression discon-

tinuity analysis around this reform. In trying out regression discontinuity specifications, we found that

the existing upward trend in the high income shares over this period moved in the same direction as the

predicted tax effect. The estimated tax elasticity, therefore, was highly dependent on what specification

was used for the polynomial in time to control for the ‘running’ variable. We take this as further evidence

of the difficulty of using national-level shocks or experiments to identify elasticities in the presence of

such strong prevailing trends.

    Next, we want to see how sensitive the results are to different definitions of income. The norm in

much of the elasticity of reported income literature (see Saez et al. 2012) is to use a measure of ‘market’

income (excluding government transfers), and also excluding capital gains. The focus on market income

is to facilitate comparison across long time spans during which the taxation and reporting of govern-

ment transfers may have changed. Since high earners have a fairly low share of their income coming

from government transfers, this assumption is normally assumed to be innocuous. In our case, the time

period we cover has no important changes to the definition of income regarding transfers, so we take the

broader total income definition as our default. In addition, the focus on earnings can be motivated by

noting that it is earnings processes that we expect to be affected by taxation.

   The exclusion of capital gains in the literature (again see Saez et al. 2012) is motivated by its differen-

tial taxation, the high degree of year-to-year variability in aggregate gains, and the particular dynamics of

capital gains realization around tax reforms. Evidence on the sensitivity of high income trends to these

definitional choices suggests they are not pivotal. Veall (2012) examines the capital gains issue, while

Milligan (2013b) explores different market and after-tax income definitions using the Canadian census.

Nevertheless, excluding capital gains from the dependent variable could in principle omit important

avenues for taxpayer responses to tax reforms.

   Table 5 displays the results for the four income definitions available in the CANSIM data. The first

column is the definition we have used as our default, total income without capital gains. When capital

gains are added, the elasticity in this top one percent sample increases from 0.689 to 0.817. However,

some of this extra impact may be transitory, relating to the dynamics of capital gains realizations. In

the third and fourth columns are the results using market income. The results are quite close to those

using total income, so our choice to use total income as our default definition is not consequential to our

findings.

   We turn in Table 6 to comparing the elasticity across different fractiles of income, ranging from P90

up to P99.9. The source data for P99.9 are suppressed for all years for Newfoundland and Labrador and

for Prince Edward Island, so we cannot use those observations. As well, 1988 and 1989 are suppressed

for New Brunswick. The first column shows our result for P90. The estimated elasticity is 0.025, which

is small and not statistically significant. In the next column for P95, the point estimate is larger at 0.221,

but still statistically insignificant. The third column replicates our base specification for the top one

percent using P99. Finally, the fourth column reports an elasticity estimate of 1.451 for those in P99.9.

This is more than twice the estimated elasticity for those in P99. Our results here are consistent with the

international literature, which shows increasing responsiveness in the very top fractiles.

   The final set of results in this section breaks down the top ten percent of incomes in a different way.

We cut the top ten percent into four pieces: from P90 to P95; from P95 to P99; from P99 to P99.9; and

from P99.9 up. This breakdown allows us some insight into how much of the results in Table 6 were

driven by those at the very top. Since our empirical approach outlined earlier uses the complement to

the high-income fractile as an implicit control group, we must exclude from the share calculation the

income above the threshold. For example, for the P90 to P95 share we exclude the income earned in the

top five percent, so that the P90 to P95 share represents how much of the bottom 95 percent of income

and how they vary across the top ten percent of the income distribution.

statistically insignificant. In column (2), the point estimate for the range P95 to P99 is also negative and

statistically indistinguishable from zero. The third column has the results for the bottom nine tenths of

the top one percent, P99 to P99.9. Here, the estimate is a positive and significant 0.364. Finally, the top

P99.9 percentile group shows an elasticity of 1.451, which is highly significant and large. These results

suggest that the 0.689 elasticity we estimated in Table 6 for P99 is driven largely by those in the top tenth

of one percent, where the elasticity is four times what is observed in the lower nine tenths.


5.2 Relevance of Results

We now place our estimates in context through two exercises. First, we combine our estimates with

the standard formula for the revenue-maximizing tax rate and compare these results to the existing top

rates in Canada. This allows one to observe the potential scope for provincial governments in Canada to

increase tax rates at the top while still gaining revenue. The second exercise attempts to calculate how

much of the observed trends in high income concentration can be explained by changes in top marginal

tax rates.

    The first exercise considers the scope for higher taxes in Canada, given our estimates. Our primary

finding for the elasticity of reported income for the top one percent in group P99 is an estimate of 0.689,

and for the top 0.1 percent in group P99.9 our preferred estimate is 1.451. The literature review in Saez

et al. (2012) concludes that a reasonable range for the long-run elasticity is 0.12-0.4; Diamond and Saez


                                                        24
(2011) use 0.25 as the central estimate of the elasticity for their policy analysis. Department of Finance

(2010) also surveys the literature, finding several studies with estimates over 0.6 for higher earners. In this

context, our estimate of 0.689 for P99 is high, and 1.451 for P99.9 very high. Again, this estimate is most

relevant for provincial tax changes, as inter-provincial shifting would change the analysis for federal level

changes.

      The magnitude of our estimates can be put into context by calculating the revenue-maximizing tax

rate τ∗ , which is the rate corresponding to the peak of the so-called ‘Laffer Curve’. At this point, an

incrementally higher rate will raise no further net revenue as the mechanical effect of the tax increase

will be completely offset by the behavioural response of lower taxable income. This revenue-maximizing

tax rate considers only the income tax revenue, and is not in general the optimal tax rate.

      Saez et al. (2012) derive the formula for τ∗ for a tax bracket affecting some proportion of higher earn-

ers


                                                                    1
                                                        τ∗ =               ,                                                     (8)
                                                               (1 + a × e)

where a is a parameter of the income distribution and e is the elasticity of reported income. For Canada,

a reasonable estimate of a is 1.81.18 Plugging a = 1.81 and e = 0.689 into equation (8) yields an estimate

for τ∗ of 44.4 percent. In Figure 1, four provinces have a top marginal tax rate for 2013 under 44.4 percent

and six provinces are higher. Using the P99.9 estimate of 1.451, the revenue maximizing tax rate τ∗ would

be only 27.5 percent. If true, this would suggest all provinces could increase revenue by lowering the tax

rate for those in income group P99.9. On the other hand, the estimated elasticity for P99-P99.9 in Table

7 is 0.364, which delivers a τ∗ of 60.3 percent. This is well above the top tax rate in all provinces and

suggests substantial room for higher taxes before hitting the revenue-maximizing rate for income levels

up to P99.9.

      We now turn to the second exercise, assessing the contribution of high-income tax rates on the ob-

served trends in high income shares in Canada over the period from 1988 to 2011. The motivation for

Canada, the Canada Revenue Agency Preliminary Statistics for the 2011 tax year report that the 203,010 Canadians with total
incomes over $250,000 have total assessed income of $113,092,727,000. This yields an average of $557,080. Using the formula
for a, we find a = 1.81. Atkinson et al. (2011) reports in their Table 6 a value for β of 2.42 for Canada, which corresponds to an a
for Canada of 1.704. This is fairly close to our estimate of 1.81.

this exercise is to ascertain whether our estimates are large enough to account for much of the observed

trends in high income concentration in Canada.

    We begin by taking our preferred estimation from Table 3 column(2) and imposing the 1988 tax rates

on all years in the data. We then use our estimates to predict values for each province and year with the

counterfactual 1988 tax rates, then aggregate across the provinces within each year (weighting by total

income) to produce a national time series. The predicted values show an estimate of what the P99 share

would have been if tax rates had stayed at their 1988 level. The results are graphed in Figure 6.

    There are three lines in Figure 6. The line indicated by the squares shows the actual series for the

top one percent income share from 1988 to 2011. The line indicated by the triangles shows the path for

the top one percent share predicted by our model. The lines are nearly on top of each other, indicating

that our model does a very good job of fitting the trends. The third line indicated by circles shows the

predicted values when we hold taxes level at their 1988 value. Through the 1990s, the predicted top one


                                                                      26
percent share would have been even higher with 1988 taxes, as most provinces raised their taxes over

this period. (Figure 2 shows these provincial tax trends.) In the period since 2000, tax rates fell, meaning

that the income share of the top one percent rose more than would have been the case if taxes had stayed

constant. For this period, the predicted series with 1988 taxes is slightly under the actual series. However,

the largest impression from Figure 6 is the close correspondence of the 1988 tax predicted series to the

actual series, suggesting that taxes do little to explain the rise in the top income share. Veall (2012) argues

that it is hard to make the case that taxes have driven the increase in top income shares, as the time series

for taxes and income shares just don’t line up. Our evidence concords with Veall’s argument.

    Since 2000, however, tax rates have fallen considerably. In 1999, the income-weighted average of

the top tax rate across Canada was 49.5 percent; by 2009 this dropped to 44.9 percent. The bulk of this

decrease happened between 1999 and 2001 with the introduction of the ‘tax on income’ system for the

provinces and the cancellation of the high income surtax federally. Over the time period since 1999,

therefore, our estimates may have some scope to explain the changes in the top one percent income

share. We pursue this possibility by performing another simulation for the years since 1999, applying

the 1999 tax rates to all years in this sample. As above, this allows us to predict a counterfactual path

for the P99 income share in the absence of any tax change since 1999. We again note that our estimates

are best applied at the provincial level and for federal tax changes may overstate the elasticity if there is

substantial inter-province income shifting.

    The results are graphed in Figure 7. The actual top share series rises from 10.3 to 11.9 between 1999

and 2006, for a gain of 15.4 percent. However, our simulation attributes 0.6 of the 1.6 percentage point

gain to the change in marginal tax rates at the top. Put another way, our estimates suggest that the drop

in marginal tax rates in the 2000s can account for 36.5 percent of the increase in the top income share

over this time period. So, while the overall long-run trend toward higher income concentration cannot

be explained by taxes, the drop in tax rates in the 2000s did contribute some to the income concentration

seen during that decade.

6 Extensions

In this final section of the paper, we present two extensions of our work. The first looks at some differ-

ences across provinces. The second extension uses another source of data to examine the most sensitive

components of income to changes in top tax rates.


6.1 Provincial heterogeneity

There are several reasons why the results might differ by province. The income thresholds to be in the

top one percent vary substantially across provinces, as can be seen in Table 1. If someone’s ability to

respond to higher taxes depends on the absolute level of income, this would make provinces with lower

one-percent thresholds different than those with higher thresholds. In addition, Alberta’s provincial top

marginal tax rate of 10 percent is the lowest in Canada. When added to the federal tax rate of 29 per-



                                                                     28
cent, Alberta high income earners face a marginal tax rate of 39 percent, more than 10 percentage points

lower than in some other provinces. This suggests some return for finding ways to shift income across

provinces. As one example, assets transferred to a trust resident in Alberta are taxed using Alberta tax

rates. This kind of arrangement would transfer taxable income out of a higher tax province and into Al-

berta. The other side of this coin is that residents of Alberta potentially have fewer instruments to avoid

taxes, since they cannot shift income to a lower tax province. This suggests that to the extent that income

shifting is important, the elasticity of reported income in Alberta might be lower. Of course, there are

other institutional factors that differ in Alberta so this analysis can only be suggestive.

    In Table 8, we begin by reproducing the base results using our regular specification. Here, we do

not use the instrumental variables estimator because of the difficulties of doing so with the interaction

terms we introduce in the other columns in the table. The second and third columns show the results for

a specification in which we allow for a different response in provinces from Ontario to the west. The esti-

mate of 0.619 in column (2) is for the five eastern-most provinces, while the five more western provinces

see a significant 0.360 higher elasticity. This may reflect the higher average income thresholds to be in the

top one percent in the western provinces. The same pattern holds for the top one tenth of one percent

in column (3).

    In the fourth column, we turn the focus to Alberta by interacting the marginal tax rate with the Alberta

fixed effect in order to estimate a different impact of the marginal tax rate in Alberta. While there is little

change to the main effect estimate at 0.619, the interaction on the Alberta term shows a point estimate

of -0.504. While this is statistically insignificantly different from zero, the point estimate is nearly large

enough to counteract the main effect leaving the predicted elasticity for Alberta close to zero. In the

fifth column, we repeat the interaction specification for the P99.9 percentile group. Here, the main point

estimate for the marginal tax rate is large at 1.492, but the interaction with the Alberta tax effect is -

1.406, significant at the 10 percent level. While the standard errors in both columns 4 and 5 are large,

the results are consistent with the elasticity in Alberta being lower. The results for the West and Alberta

together indicate that the larger western elasticities from columns (2) and (3) are not driven by Alberta.

This may indicate that geographic proximity to Alberta (the lowest-tax province) could play a role in

income shifting opportunities. These interesting differences across provinces provide opportunities for

6.2 Income components

In this set of results, we investigate the response of different components of income to the marginal tax

rate among high earners. These results may shed some light on the mechanisms that underlie the overall

tax elasticities found in this paper. We pursue this analysis using data drawn from the Canada Revenue

Agency Income Statistics, which report a comprehensive set of disaggregated income and tax measures

annually and by province, grouped into different income categories. These data were previously used by

Gagné et al. (2010) to estimate tax elasticities, and by Saez and Veall (2007) to create top income share

series.

    Our data run from 1991 to 2010. The largest challenge to making use of these data is the nominal

thresholds for the income categories. For example, the number of taxfilers and total amount for various

definitions of income are reported for a category that includes taxfilers with total reported income of



                                                         30
$250,000 or more for each year in our sample. However, this $250,000 nominal threshold includes 0.19

percent of all taxfilers in Alberta for 1991, but 1.38 percent by 2010. When we observe that the total

income share of this $250,000 group rose from 4.31 percent to 15.60 percent in Alberta from 1991 to 2010,

the growth is comprised of two parts. Part of this growth is due to increasing income concentration, but

part of it is just ‘bracket creep’ as more of those with constant real income are pushed over the nominal

threshold. Since we are comparing across provinces where the $250,000 cutoff cuts at different points

of the tail of the income distribution, this introduces unwelcome province-year varying noise to our

estimate of top income shares.

   With these caveats, we present results showing the regression results for the top $250,000 category,

and for those with incomes higher than $150,000. We also take two approaches to improve on these raw

results. We use the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) data to create our own top income fractile shares and

cutoffs by interpolation. We try two methods for the interpolation. The first is a basic linear interpolation

that assumes homogeneity of those within an income category. The second employs the Pareto distri-

bution assumption to make the imputations, which allows for income concentration at the top of each

category when performing the imputations. Each method is described in the data appendix.

   A comparison of our constructed income share data to the CANSIM data and the raw CRA data ap-

pears in Figure 8. We aggregate across provinces to a national series using total income as weights. We

also plot the share in the $250,000 category and the share above $150,000 from the CRA data.

   As expected, the raw category data do not match the CANSIM data well. In the early 1990s, the

$250,000 category had much less than one percent of taxfilers, but the proportion of taxpayers in this

category grows through time. The $150,000 and higher category is a better match for the top one percent

in the early years, but far exceeds the CANSIM numbers by 2010. Our constructed imputations fit the

data fairly closely. The linear imputation fits very closely until around 2000, when it begins to under-

predict the CANSIM series. This is expected, since this imputation assumes homogeneity within each

category when in reality income within categories is likely skewed toward the top. The Pareto imputa-

tion, in contrast, overpredicts the income share of the top one percent compared to the CANSIM data.

   We wish to use the CRA data to examine the components of income. Since the categories are defined

based on total reported income, rather than the components we wish to study, we cannot use the exact

same methodology as we do to impute total income. Instead, we follow this procedure. We define our

interest as the income components of those in the top fractiles of total income. To find the component

income share of a top fractile of total income, we apply the cumulative distribution function of total

income to the observed category totals of the component. For example, if the top one percent of total in-

come spreads across all of the $250,000 category and 40 percent of the $150,000 to $250,000 category, we

take all of the component income from the $250,000 category and 40 percent of the component income

from the $150,000 to $250,000 category.

   In addition to breaking the data down into income components, we also report results for several

tax base adjustments. These adjustments take the form of deductions from total income and non-

refundable tax credits. Our results are reported in Table 9 for the $150,000+ shares and the $250,000+

shares, as well as the P99 and P99.9 results for both our linear and Pareto imputation methods.

comparable to our base results in Table 6, although point estimates are smaller. The regression results

using the CRA data make up the rest of the rows in Table 9. We use our instrumental variables approach

for the estimation here, with the log share ratio dependent variable. The first two columns of the table

display the results for the $150,000+ and the $250,000+ category. The results show a strong sensitivity of

Total Income to the tax rate, with strongly significant estimates. There are especially strong effects for

Total Employment income, Total Capital Income, and Taxable Dividends. Of course, given the nominal

thresholds, these results are difficult to interpret.

    The next two columns have our estimates for the P99 group using the linear and the Pareto impu-

tation, respectively. In almost all cases, the Pareto estimates show more sensitivity to the tax rate than

the linear estimates. With the CRA data using the linear method, the estimated elasticity for total in-

come is 0.670, quite similar to our earlier results with the CANSIM data. Using the Pareto imputation

the estimated elasticity for total income becomes 0.983, larger than our earlier results. The value of the

CRA data comes from our ability to also look at the components of income. The definitions for the com-

ponents are provided in the data appendix. There are strong responses by employment income and

capital income, with dividend income in particular showing strong sensitivity. It is perhaps surprising

that self-employment income doesn’t display the same responsiveness. Taxable income for all specifi-

cations shows a stronger sensitivity than total income, which is consistent with expectations since the

availability of deductions from total income increases the potential scope for tax shifting or avoidance.

In the last two columns we present the results for the top 0.1 percent. Here, the Pareto estimates are

much larger than the estimates using the linear imputation. This might be expected because the linear

imputation is likely to do poorly picking out the top 0.1 percent from the top $250,000 category.

    The bottom half of Table 9 reports deduction and credit items. Overall, total deductions don’t show

a significant effect. The only item that shows a consistently strong result is union and professional dues.

Charitable donations become significant only for the top 0.1 percent in the last column. The lack of

consistency of the estimates suggests that no strong conclusions can be drawn from the credit and de-

ductions items.

7 Concluding remarks

In this paper, we use subnational variation in tax rates in Canada to estimate the elasticity of reported

income for high earners. We find that the elasticity is large, but concentrated at the very top of the income

distribution. Although the responsiveness is large, the thirty-year surge in high income concentration is

largely unrelated to tax rates. We also find that there are important differences when comparing other

provinces with Alberta, and also the response is present for both earned and capital income. These

findings suggest multiple channels for income shifting and tax avoidance that may underlie the estimates

we uncover.

   An important limitation of our work is its applicability to federal tax rate changes. Since we use

provincial-level variation, our estimates embody any inter-provincial income shifting that might occur.

Federal tax changes should not induce inter-provincial income shifting, so our estimates are best used

to predict the impact of provincial-level tax policy changes.

   Another limitation is our treatment of dynamics, as we assume a contemporaneous reaction between

tax rates and income. So, our estimate is clearly a short-run elasticity. As discussed by Saez, Slemrod, and

Giertz (p. 13-14, 2012) the long-run elasticity may be higher because the generation of income shifting

opportunities may take time, but also might be lower because the short-run elasticity captures short-run

temporal income shifting dynamics (such as the timing of bonuses or realization of dividends or capital

gains) that are harder to avoid over longer time spans.

   In ongoing work in Milligan and Smart (2013), we look more precisely at the case of Alberta to ex-

amine the role of an internal ‘tax haven’. The federal dynamics are made more interesting by the use of

the common federal tax base across most of the country, as a dollar shifted in response to one province’s

taxes imposes a vertical externality on federal finances. We believe the work presented here in this paper

provides a firm starting point for further research on these types of tax interactions in a federation like

Canada.

A Data appendix

The Canada Revenue Agency (and its predecessor agencies) publishes an annual report on the incomes

of Canadians drawn from the universe of tax forms that are filed. The data are available nationally and by

province. The report includes data for income categories (e.g. total income, employment income, tax-

able income), deduction items (e.g. Registered Pension Plans, childcare expenses) and non-refundable

credits (e.g. charitable donations and gifts, the basic amount, spousal amount). For each of these, the

total amount and the number of taxfilers with any value for the item are listed. The data are presented in

aggregate, as well as for income categories that are fairly constant across years.

   We obtained the data for 1991 to 2010 by downloading the available years from the CRA website, For

earlier years, we made a special request for a tabulation from the Canada Revenue Agency. The top cate-

gory reported is for $250,000 for all years. Since this nominal limit doesn’t change through time, ‘bracket

creep’ means that more and more individuals overtake the nominal $250,000 threshold. To overcome

this, we developed two methods to impute a consistent series, a linear interpolation and a Pareto inter-

polation.

   The linear interpolation simply assumes everyone within an income category is homogenous. So, for

the 2010 $250,000 category in Alberta, we observe that 1.38 percent of taxfilers are in the category with
                                                                                               1
15.60 percent of total reported income. The linear interpolation calculates the P99 share as 1.38 ×(15.60) =

11.30 percent. Because people within the category are not homogenous but instead the income is con-

centrated closer to the top, this method underestimates top income shares. The comparable CANSIM

value for the P99 share for 2010 in Alberta is 13.8 percent.

   The Pareto interpolation makes the assumption that the upper tail of the income distribution is

Pareto distributed. Pareto distributed variables have the property that the ratio of the mean above some

cutoff to the value of the cutoff is a constant. In the CRA data, we observe the number of taxfilers and

total income in the $250,000 category, so we can calculate the mean and divide by $250,000 to recover

an estimate of this Pareto parameter. We then use this parameter to project the share. For example, in

Alberta in 2010, there are 37,710 taxfilers in the $250,000 category who report $22,679,668,000 in total

income, which is an average of $601,423. Divided by the threshold of $250,000 gives an estimate of 2.41

for the Pareto parameter. Using this, we estimate the Alberta P99 share to be 14.74 percent for 2010. This
