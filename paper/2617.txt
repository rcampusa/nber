  Flexible Staffing Arrangements and Emgloyer#' Short-term Adjustment

                                         Strategies


                                          A batract


      This paper reports new evidence from a survey of over 400 U.S.

employers concerning their use of temporary and on-call workers.            More

than 90 percent of responding organizations reported reliance on these

flexible staffing arrangements.            They accounted for an average of 1.5

percent of total labor input at user organizations during 1985; at some

organizations, they accounted for 10 percent or even 20 percent of total
labor input.          Four-fifths of survey respondents indicated that flexible

staffing arrangements play an important role in absorbing workload
fluctuations.          Moreover,   organizations with highly seasonal or highly

cyclical demand made significantly greater use of flexible staffing

arrangements during 1985 than organizations with less seasonal or less

cyclical demand.          The use of flexible staffing arrangements appears to

be a more important component of employers' short-term adjustment

strategies than has previously been recognized.

I.     Introduction

        Any viable enterprise must somehow accomodate uncertainty and flux
in both output and input markets.       In this paper,   I explore the use of a

hitherto largely negixoted mechanism for accomplishing this:          the use of

workera who provide their services only on an as-needed basis.          Reliance

on this sort of flexible staffing arrangement offers employers an

alternative to adjusting hours, adjuatng the size of the regular

workforce, and/or using inventories as a buffer, approaches that have
been the focus of a considerable body of earlier work.   I conclude that

the use of flexible staffing arrangements constitutes an important

component of many U.S. employers' short-term adjustment strategies.
         There are at least two sorts of fluctuations that may lead

employers to use flexible staffing arrangements.         First,   if demand

varies from period to period, It may make sense to cover some part of

peak demand with flexible staffers.  Second, it may be appropriate to

rely In part on flexible staffing arrangements to deal wrth labor supply
fluctuations due to absences, vacations, leaveg, and so on. Section II

develops two simple models designed to illustrate how demand variability
and the existence of a stochastic component in regular employees' labor

supply affect employers' optimal staffing strategies and, in particular,
create a    motivation   for using flexible staffing arrangements.      Empirical



     Most of this earlier work has been concerned with firma' responses to
     fluctuations in product demand.  Hart (1984) discusses the choice
     between hours adjustment and employment adjustment, and also cites
     numerous other studies) see particularly Nickell (1978).  Medoff
     (1979> discusses the allocation of the burden of adjustment to
     downturns across layoffs, quits and hours reductions in union and
     nonunion settings.  Topel (1982> analyzes the strategic use of
     inventorisa as an alternative to varying employment and/or hours,

evidence on   the use of agency temporaries,   short-term hires and on-call
corkers from a nec survey of over four hundred U.S. employers is

presented in Section III.    This survey yields unique evidence on the use
of these flexible staffing arrangements,    on employers' reasons for

relying on flexible staffers and on the orgsnizationsl characteristlcs

assocIated with flexible staffing use,     The survey results support the
conclusion  that, in the United States, flexible staffing srrsngements
play an important role in the short-run sdjustment prooess
       In recent years, considerable attention has been given to chat
anecdotal evidence suggests is an increasing reliance on nonstandard
employment relationships by many U.S. employers    While this paper does
not speak directly to the question of hoe snd why the use of flexible
staffing arrangements hem changed over time, t does provide s benchmark
for future inveetigations. Section IV summarizes the paper's main

conclusions and suggests some directions for future research, including
some thoughts on the changing pattern of flexible staffing use,




II.   odelsof,gloers'Stsffino Decisions
      The two simple models presented in this section of the paper

provide a starting point for thinking about the role of flexible
staffing arrangements in employers' overall staffing strategies.        In the
first model, demand varies and employers cover peak demand    nih   corkers
who provide their services on an as—needed basis.2     In the second,    the
existence of a stochastic element in the labor supply of corkers hired


2 This model is much in the
                            spirit of Piore '1980), who suggests that
  different employment arrsngesents are likely to evolve to cover the
  stable and the unstable components of demand.

on long-term        contracts (vacations, leaves, etc.   }   provides the motivation
for   using flexible staffers.        Both models imply that flexible staffing

arrangements should be an important component of many employers' cost—
minimizing staffing plans and suggest several factors that should
influence the extent        t   which they are relied upon.      At the end of the

section,      I   briefly discuss how allowing for alternatives to the use of
flexible staffers affects these models' implications.
      The partial equilibrium nature of the analysis undertaken here

should be stressed from the outset.  In the models that follow, the

relative costs of employing workers under alternative arrangements are
taken as fixed.         While these models capture important features of

individual employers' decisions regarding the use of flexible staffing

arrangements,        a full understanding of the evolution of flexible staffing

patterns will eventually require consideration of the overall demand for
different sorts of workers and the supply of labor to different sorts of
        3
jobs.

Stochastic Demand for Output

            Varisbllity in product demand is one potentially important
motivation        for using flexible staffing arrangements.       This osn be

illustrated in the context of a simple model of a cost-minimizing firm.

Each period, this firm produces output         x,   where x is distributed as

f(x(.        Ignoring discounting, actual output may be thought of ae either

unpredictable (each period's output drawn from the same f(x)


  Tn a perfectly competitive labor market in which the workers'
  preferences for stable versus unstable work were static and firms'
  flexible staffing needs were uncorrelated, individual employers would
  face fixed relative costs of employing workers under alternative
  arrangements. This need not be true if labor markets are not or firms'
  perfectly competitive, workers' preferences change over time
  flexible staffing needs are correlated.

diatrbution) or           predfctable (output varying over, say, the courae of a

year according to some seaecnal pattern that ia known in advance).                       At

this point,        I assure that,     in the inItial period, the firm must make a

once-and-for-all declafon concerning the number of regular employees,

    p
         to   be hired   at              recular
                              a given wage,-  p;
                                              w  workers cannot he hired
                                                      new

later on and regular workers never leave the firm. I alec assume
tnitially that regular workers work a fixed number cf hours.
      Each regular employee can prndure one unit of output per period.
if it turns out that x S L, the regular workforce can produce all the
output required and no temporary workers will be hired. if x > L, the
firm may htre supplemental workers, L, at a glveo wage, w, to cake up
the shortfall in production capacity. Because these flexible staffers
are unfamiliar with the firm's production process, they may be less
productive than regular workers b flexible staffers are required to
produce one unit of output, bal.
      A more complete model might explicitly incorporate other

dtfferences between regular employees                 and flextble staffers,   such ae

differences 10 expected supervision coats.  As alresdy noted, flexible

staffers ore likely to have lees experience with the partIcular tasks

they are performing than regular employees. Moreover, a flexible
staffer who expects to be on a job only a short time will not be
motivated by the hope of future rewards for good performance and may for
that reason be sore likely to shirk.                  For both of these reasons,

flexible staffers may require closer supervIsion than regular employees.
The easiest way to allow for these possibilities is to think of w                      and

w       as the total per-hour costs associated with the use of regular

employees        and   flexible staffers, respectIvely, including not only wages
and      benefits but also indirect costs such as supervision costs.               I

assume that it is more expenaive to produce a fixed quantity of output

using flexible staffers than using regular workers (by5 > wv), so that
some regular workers are hired.4

         The firm's problem ta then to choose the level of regular

employment that will minimize its expected production costs:



         (1)     E(C) =        vL      w   b(x - L)   f(x>dx

where x is the maximum of the output distribution and b(x-L) equals the

number of supplemental workers hired when x >                  The first order

                               x

                                   p
Intuitively,    the firm equates the coat of expanding production capacity


  In a perfectly competitive labor market in which flexible and regular
  staffing arrangements coexist, equilibrium wages for flexible staffers
  should exceed those for equally-able regular employees; with bl, the
  stated assumption holds. 8hapiro and Stiglitz (1984) and Bulow and
  Summers (l986 argue that, if labor markets are not perfectly
  competitive, it may be optimal for employers to pay some workers
  above-market wages. They reason that fear of losing a high-paying 3ob
  will inhibit worker shirking and that this inhibiting effect will be
  strongest where workers expect to remain on their jobs for a long time
  If not fired for poor performance. This reasoning suggests that it
  may make sense to pay flexible staffers market wages and closely
  monitor their performance, but to pay regular employees above-market
  wages, thereby saving on direct supervision costs.  In this situation,
  the per-hour costs of using flexible staffers may exceed the per-hour
  costs of using regular employees even though flexible staffers' per-
  hour wages are lover.

  The firm maximizes expected profits subject to the constraint that

by hiring another permanent employee to the expected cost of producing
the marginal unit of output by hiring flexible staffers as needed (ha

times the probability that flexible staffers are hiredL                     This fIrst

order condition can be rewritten:

where   R ia the fraction of its output distribution the firm chooses to

cover with regular workers. As might be expected, N increases with b
that is the lower the relative productivity of flexible staffers, the
smaller the expected number hired, Thus, one implication of the model
is that the use of flexible staffers shoulo be greater in positions in
which frm-specifc skills are relstvely unimportant for successful job
performance,    P also decreases with a sod increases with a 5                   that is,

the lower the relative cost of using flexible staffers, the greater the
reliance placed upon them.
      Intuition suggests that increases in the dispersion df demand
ought to increase the expected ratio of supplemental to regular staff.
This ntution can be formalized. imagine a mean-preserving spread of
the   original demand distribution such that:
        (4)     x   =   P           x-p)/k,      3<k<l,

where x is the new output variable,                   p is the common mean of the new and
the old output distributions, and k captures the relative dispersion of
the new distribution compared to the old, with smaller values of k being

associated with greater relative dispersion.                    Note that N, the share of

ita demand distribution the firm chooaea to cover with regular

employees, ia independent of the dispersion of demand.                    If L   is optimal

Stochas t
           The preceding discussion assumes that regular employees aupply a

fixed flow of labor services to the firm.               But any manager could tell

you <though perhaps not in precisely theee wordeD that there ie a
atochaatio element In employees' labor supply.                Overetaffing is one way
to aooomodate vacations,            leaves,   absences due to illnesa, etc.; relying
on supplemental workers to fill In for regular employees am needed is

another,         possibly oomplementary, strategy.
           Let us represent the atoohastlo nature of regular eeployees' labor

supply as follows:
           <l0       L   =
                             gL,
where L       i5 the aotusl quantIty of labor aupplled,          L is the number of

regular workers hired, and g is distributed as f(g<, B I g                      This
aeans that the density of the labor supply distribution can be written:

      (11)    f(L
                 p
Note that there is no reason to use flexible staffers unless g varies
from period to period.             If individual employees' labor supply varied hut
the aggregate quantIty of labor supplied by regular employees withIn a

relevant grouping dId not, one could sImply hire               hg   times am many

regular employees as actually needed and have exactly the right number
at work in every period.             In general, however,    g will vary from period
to period.         For example, absences are typically higher on Nondaya and

Fridays than on other days of the week,             and more vacations are scheduled

during the summer than at other times of year.
           I assume that regular employees must be          paid whether   they work or


6   This is less general but more tractable than writing the firm s labor
    supply function as g(L), with density f(g(LD.

not.     As in the previous model, I also assume that the coat per
effective unit of labor suplied by supplemental workers is higher than

for regular employees (here, be                   >   w/E(gfl,           so that some regular

employees are hired]
         To highlight the implications of stochastic variation in the

quantity of labor supplied by regular employees,                                     output is taken as
fixed.     The firm's objective is               to   choose L to minimize expected

production costs:

Substituting for L        and f(L) from equation (10) and equation (11)

above:

     The assumption that regular employees must be paid whether they work

     situations where most of the stochastic variation reflects unpaid time
     away from work or unexpected quits.  If regular workers are paid only
     for time actually worked, the optimizing employer uses relatively more
     regular employees and relatively fewer flexible staffers.

to hire more than x regular employees.8 Flexible staffers are used to

fill   ifl    when g'L is less than     x.     Thus,   overataffing and          the   use of

supplemental workers are complementary approaches to dealing with
vsriaton in regular employees' labor                supply.     As in the model with

all lead the firm to reduoe the number of regular employees hired and to

inorease its relianoe on flexible staffers.                   Though intuition suggests
that inoreases in the vartablity of the firm's absenteeism rate should
raise the relattve use of supplemental sorkers, this does not in fart
hold as a general proposttton.

      A model in which employers' only choices are to use regular

employees who work a fIxed number of hours or to use flexible staffers
i5p of course, unrealistic.   Some of the alternative approsohes to

dealing with variability/uncertainty in product demand and labor supply
have   already     been mentioned:      varying the hours worked by regular
workers; hiring and fIring           regular workers as conditions change; and/or
using inventories as a buffer.
        For     many   employers, varying regular employees' hours                of   work,
particularly through soheduling of overtime, is an important instrument
for absorbIng demand fluctuations and for handlIng absences, vacations,
leaves,       and so on.    The   ability to
                                   vary regular employees' hours is not,
however, a perfect substitute for the use of flexible staffing
arrangements. Standard arguments imply that marginal productivity of

hours worked by the regular workforce during a given time period will

eventually decline.    For a firm with a given regular workforce, beyond a

certain point it will be cheaper to accomodate higher-than-usual demand

or higher-than-usual absenteeIsm by using supplemental staff rather than

by increasing regular orkers' hours.

      Adjusting the size of the regular workforce is another approach to
accomodating changing circumstances. If there is a change in demand or
in employees' labor supply behaviour (for example, an increase in

expected absenteeism) that is expected to persist for an extended period
of time, one would expect an employer to make changes in the size of the

regular workforce.    But one would not expect an employer to hire

additional regular staff to meet short-term needs; any wage savings
associated with using additional regular staff rather than flexible

staffers would be more than offset by the fixed costs of increasing and
then decreasing the size of the regular workforce.      Hiring costs include
the costs of screening potential new hires plus the coats of any Initial

on-the-job training provided.    The costs of reducIng the   sze        no

regular workforce will depend upon the method chosen for accompitoning
that end.   Attrition takes time; moreover,   the wrong employees (from the

employera perspective) may choose to     leave.   Layoffs may also oe

costly,   both because of government regulations (for example,   U.S.

employers who lay off workers may incur increased unemployment insurance
costs) and because of firms' own previous strategic decisions (for

example, a no-layoff firm that resorts to layoffs may experience
deterioration of employee morale and commitment). So long as the costa

  (14;.  Given our initial asauaptions, L must be greater than x.

of   adjusting the size   of the regular workforoe exceed the costs
associated with taking on and releasing flexible ataffera,    there   will be

circumstances   under which   it is optimal to rely on flexible staffers.
      in certain goods-producing industries, inventories may be used to
buffer fluctuations in demand or, possibly, in regular employees' labor

supply. The degree of relIance on inventory buffer stocks will depend,
          ilflus on the costs associated with holding them, A strategy
of holding sufficient inventories to cover ol 1 possible contingencies is
likely to he very expensive. Thus, even in industries producing
reasonably standardized and storable products where the use of Inventory
buffer stocks is feasible, there is likely to be a role for flexible
staffers. A similar argument can be made oonoerning the stretegy of
lengthening delivery or waiting times during busy periods. Some
lengthening of the customer queue may be optImal; however, if delivery
or service lags become too long, customers will seek other sources of
supply. Thus, beyond a certain point, It will pay to hire flexIble
staffers.




III.   ppjjglEyjjpgeon the        Use of Flexible Stsf±4.gg

       Arrangements by U.S. Employers
       The theoreticsl discussion just concluded suggests that flexible

staffing arrsngements can play an important role in employers'
acccmodstion of variations in demand and/or in the labor supply of

regular employees.   Flexible staffers should be concentrated in jobs

that require little firm-specific knowledge or skills, and the duration

of flexible staffing assignments should be sufficiently short that

adjusting the size of the regular workfcrce is not a cost-effective
                                          13


alternative.      The theoretical discussion also implies that the use of

flexible staffing arrangements should be greatest        in   organizations

where:      the relative costs of using flexible staffers are low; demand is

highly variable;     nd   alternative methods of accomodating fluctuations

are costly.      This   sectonof     the paper presents new empirical evidence

on U.S. employers' use of flexible staffing arrangements intended to

shed light on these propositons

The Flexible Staffing Survey

         The data analyzed here come from an employer survey that

recently conducted in collaboration with the Bureau of National Affairs
(BUA).      The survey questionnaire included questions on responding

organizations' use of agency temporaries, short-term hires, on-call
workers and contracting out. The analysis in this paper focuses on the

first three of these arrangements, all of which involve bringing people

other than regular employees onto the organization's premises to do work
that   in   pr±nclpie might be done by regular employees.       My objectives

were to ducument          reliance upon these arrangements and the factors

responsible for their uae.
         For purposes of this study, respondents were given the following

definitions:


Agency Temporaries:       Individuals employed through a temporary help
                          agency to work for your organization.  Examples:
                          accountants, clerical help, laborers, maintenance
                          workers,    nurses.

Short-term Hires:         Employees hired on the company payroll either for a
                          specific period of time or for a specific project.
                          Examples: employees hired during the Christmas
                          season, students hired for the summer, employees
                          hired for a one-time project or event. This
                          classification includes freelancers hired by the
                          hour or day, but does not include individuals in an
                          on-call      pool.
                                          14

On-Cafl Workers:            Individuals in a pool of workers who are called in
                            on an as-needed basis.  Examples:  laborers
                            supplied by a oion hiring hell, retirees who work
                            for a few days a month.
All questions on the survey pertained to calendar year 1985.

      The survey questionnaire was sent during Nay 1986 to 799 human
resnurce executives at private firms, some corporate-level personnel and

some with division or plant level responsIbilIty. All were members of a
standing panel previously solicited for participatIon iO a short
quarterly survey on absence and turnover rates and in an annual survey
on personnel department activities         and budgets.    A followup letter

including another oopy       of the survey form was sent to those executives
we had not   heard   from   by the   end of June 1986.    ReplIes from 469
respondents were received by the end of July 1986.            The questions about
on-call work generated some oonfusion;         followup telephone interviews
were conducted to clarify the anawera to these questions.5 Altogether,
442 surveys were usable in at leaat acme of our analyses, a usable

response rate of 55 percent. 10
      The replies do not mirror the industry distributroo of employment,
but are skewed towards manufacturing, finanoe,           insurance sod real



 Nany respondenta did not provide the information needed to estimate
 on-call use intensity. Between mid-July and mid-August of 1986, my
 research assistant, Kelly Eastman, telephoned all 92 respondents who
 reported using on-call workera other than former regular employees;
 useful clarification waa obtained from 55 of theme 92 respondents.

   Respondents who did not answer all the yes/no questions about whether
   they used each of the various flexible staffing srrangments were
   excluded from sIl analyses.   I also excluded a very few replies from
   agricultural, mining and construction firms, one reply from a firm
   located in Puerto Rico, and two replies from firms whose industry and
   location could not be determined.   Two respondents replied twice; in
   these cases, I ueed the information from the earlier reply.

estate,   and health care,   and   away from trade and services other than

health care.      In addition,     almost all the responding organizations had

acre than 50 employees at year-end 1985 and many are part of even larger

corporations.                                      survey sample
mandates caution in grneralzlng from the survey findings,          evidence

described at the end of this section suggests that the pattern of

flexible staffing use repored by survey respondents is not out of line

with that of U.S. employers overall.
Use of Temoorary Workers,     Short-Term Hires and On-Call Workers

      The top panel of Table       1   reports the percentages of responding

organizations that use flexible staffers.         Overall,   93 percent of

respondents use at least one of the three flexible staffing

arrangements.

   Bureau of the Census (1986).
12 In the letter
                 accompanying the first survey mailing, respondents were
   instructed that "i)f staffing practices vary by facility or if you
   can provide more accurate information for particular facilities than
   for the company as a whole, please answer for one facility,
   preferably the largest.   Some replies apply to a single
   establishment; some apply to a division or subsidiary; and some apply
   to an entire firm, This makes meaningful comparison of the size
   distribution of responding organizations with other data difficult.

      While previous studies have suggested that many U.S. employers use

flexible staffers, particularly agency temporaries, to my knowledge none

has yielded estimates of how intensively these arrangements are used.13

For each type of flexible staffing, the survey described here collected

two pieces of information that together permit an estimate of use

intensity;   the total number of assignments during calendar year 1985;

and the typical duration of oelendsr year 1985 assignments (which can be

expressed as a fraction of a year).     For each organization for which

both of these pieces of information were reported, their product yields

an estimate of person-years worked by flexible staffers.     This person-

years number was then divided by regular employment as of year-end 1985
and the resulting ratio multiplied by 100 to yield a use intensity

measure that is a rough proxy for the average percentage addition made

by flexible staffers to the regular workforce's labor input over the
                    14
course of the year.
      The second panel of Table 1 reports estimates of   ho   intensively



13 The best earlier
                    study was carried out by Donald flayell and Kristin
   Nelson (MaysIl and Nelson (1982); see also 1angum, Mayall and Nelson
   (1985)). Their data apply to 1981. a year in which use of flexible
   staffers might be expected to have been low; they collected
   information on whether firms used agency temporaries, short-term
   hires and on-call workers, but not on use intensity. Official
   government statistics provide information on temporary help industry
   employment but not on where agency temporaries actually work.   See
   Carey and Hazelbaker (1986) for a discussion of these data.
14 Not all users of flexible
                             staffing arrangements provided complete
   information on their intensity of use.  The responses from those that
   did were weighted in inverse proportion to the response rate in the
   relevant use category (use agency temporaries only, use both agency
   temporaries and short-term hires, and so on).  In defining use
   categories, those whose only on-call use consisted of sometimes
   having former regular employees come in to work were distinguished
   from other on-call users.

flexible staffers are used.      These estimates indicate that average use

intensity among users of each of the Individual categories of flexible

staffing amounts to between a 0,3 percent and 1.0       percent addition to
their   regular employment, with combined use for organizatIons using at
least     of the three arrangements averaging a 1. 5 percent addition.
        one
Since 33 perceot of all respondents said that they used flexible
staffers, this number implies an average use ntenaity across all
sampled organizations of approximately l4 percent.
        The   use intensity distribution is markedly skewed.    For most

organizatlone, use intensities are small:        43 percent of user

orgsnzstions had use intensIties for all three categories of flexible
staffers combined of less than    0. 5   percent and another 21 percent had
use intensities of less than 1.0 percent.        But for a minority of user

organizations, use intensities are very large:       0 percent had use
intensities in excess of 5.0 percent and 2 percent had use intensities

in excess of 10.0 percent.
      An important assumption underlying the discussion in Section II

was that flexIble staffers cost more per hour to employ than comparably

productive regular employees; otherwise, I reasoned, there would be an
incentive for employers to employ only flexible staffers, at least in
certain types of jobs. Testing this assumption turns out to be very
dIfficult. The data in the top panel of Table 2 pertain to the direct
hourly costs associated with using flexible staffers. The answers imply
that   temporary help agencies' per-hour charges typically equaly or
exceed the per-hour wage and benefit costs associated with regular

employees in comparable positions; however, a substantial share of users
of short-term hires and on-call workers report lover per-hour wage and

benefit costs for thoae flexible stsffers than for regualr employees in

      5The question asked about agency teaporaries was, 'Is your hourly coat for
agency teaporaries generally higher or lover than the hourly pay and benefits
costs for regular eaployees in coaparable positions?' The questions about
short-tera hires and on-call workers substituted 'your hourly pay and benefits
cost' for 'your hourly cost'.

comparable positions. Unfortunately, it was not possible to collect
information either on flexible staffers'      relative productivity or on the
relative costs of supervising them, as would      have   been required to
construct direct estimates of per-unit production costs.        The data in
the second panel of Table 2, which show that flexible staffing

assignments are typically quite short, are consistent with per-unit

production coats being higher for flexible staffers than for regular
workers. If using flexible staffers reduced per-unit production costs,
I would expect flexible atsffng assignments to be longer than they
               15
typically are.
        The discussion   n   Section II also implied that the use of flexible
staffers should be sore prevalent in jobs requiring little firm-specific

expertise than   n   jobs where firm-specific skills are important.     The
data   in the bottom panel of Table 2 are at least consistent with this

implication.    Substantial numbers of organizations assign flexible
staffers to office/clerical, professional/technical and

produotion/oervcs    poaitiona,   but very few make use of flexible staffers

in either ranagerial/adminstrative or sales positions.




15
     NayslI and Nelson (1982) and Nangum, Nayall and Nelson (1985) argue
     that the relative median assignment durations associated with each of
     the three flexible staffing arrangments reflect differencesin their
     respective cost structures.
16 One
       might also hypothesize that managerial/administrative and sales
   personnel are particularly difficult to monitor, so that it is very
   expensive to use flexible staffers in these positions.  It may also
   be relevant that managerial/administrative and sales personnel are
   most likely to represent the organizstion to the outside world.

Reasons for Using and Perceived Importance of Flexible Staffing

Arrangements
        Let me turn next to the questIon of whether employers' stated
reasons for using flexible       staffers   are   consistent witn the theoretical
models developed       in Section II.    The choices made by survey respondents

from a list intended to capture a varIety of possible motivations for

using   flexible staffers       that the theoretical dimcussion does
                              suggest
capture important elements of the decision to use flexible staffers. As
shown in Table 3, among those using at least one of the three flexible

staffing ar:sn;ements, 90 rercent checked at least one factor that might
be   put under t'e broad heading of 'variabilIty in demand':            'speca1
projects', 'seasonal       needs' or 'provide a buffer for regular staff

against downurns sn deosnd'.            While only 22 percent of the user

population cheoked 'provide a buffer against downturns In demand',               42

percent of the top 12 peccent of users indIcated thai this was one of
their reasons for using flexible staffers             In addition,   89 percent of

users mdI 3    .1   t-s
                      t u. e faotnr that might be put under the broad
neading of 'fluotuatn in tne labor supply of reguar employees':
'fill vacancy untis a regular employee is hired' or 'fmll in for absent
regular   employee'.

        How important are flexible staffers in employers' overall staffing

strategies?    The fact that flexible staffing arrangements account for

less than 2 percent of employment at responding firms over the course of

the year might at first blush suggest that they are of little strategic

importance.    But on further reflection,         it is obvious that flexible

staffers could account for an even smaller part of total average

employment but still absorb a substantial fraction of the day-to-day and
month-to-month fluctuation in demand and/or Isbor supply.              Table 4

reports respondents' answers to a set of questions concerning the

importance of each of a number of strategies for absorbing fluctuations

in the responding organization's workload.         The strategy moat often

mentioned as 'very important' or 'somewhat important' for absorbing

workload fluctuations was the use of overtime; however, the second and

third most frequently mentioned strategies were the use of agency

temporaries and the use of short-term hires.           Altogether, 36 percent cf
the survey respondents said that at least one of the three flexible

staffing arrangements was 'very importanta for absorbing workload
fluctuations and an additional 46 percent        ssd   that at least one was

'somewhat important'.       Not aurpriangiy,    heavy users of flexioie
staffers    -   - those in the top 10 percent of the overall uae intensity

distrtbution -- were even more likely to say that at least one of the

three flexible staffing arrangements was 'very important' (78 percent)

or 'somewhat important' (17 percent) for aosorbing workload

fluctuations.

         Perhaps   the most interesting question concerning U.S. employers'
use of    fiexble staffing    arrangements   is what accounts for the

tremendous cross-organization variation in the share of labor input
accounted for by flexible staffers. The theoretical discussion implied
that the ume of flexible staufera is likely to be greatest where: the
relative cost of using fiexibie staffers is low; demand is highly
variable; and the coats of alternative shock-absorbing strategies         are

high.  The survey questionnaire was designed to yield proxies for          a

number of these organizational characteristics.

      The fraction of the organization's workforce represented by          a

union can be thought of as one proxy for the relative coats of using

flexible   staffers; unions typically oppose the use of flexible staffers
and thus likely raise the costs associated with using them.                         The survey

included two questions which asked respondents to indicate whether the

demand for their organization's product or service was highly or

somewhat seasonal, and whether it was highly or somewhat variable across

years.     The answers to these questions serve as proxies for the

variability    n   organizations' demand.                   One might also expect

organizations that had recently experienced either rapid growth or rapid
shrinkage   to   be more                  their future staffing needs

charscteratics        of high intensity users, low intensity users and

nonusers of flexible staffing arrangements.               High intensity users have
such lover unionization rates than either low intensity users or

nonusers.        High intensity users are also more likely to say that their
demand is highly seasonal and to say that it is highly variable across

years.      Both the mean absolute percentage ohange in employment between

1980 and 1985 and tne proportion of low turnover,            no layoff,   high wage
nonunion employers were larger among highintensity users than among low

intensity users or nonuaers,           There were no aystematio differences

across uaer groups tn the proportIon of manufacturing organizations or
in mean unit size

         The univariste relationships which emerge from Table 5 could, of

course,    be mialesding.         The logical next step is to specify an

appropriate multlvsriate model for analysis of the factors affecting
flexzble staffing use intensity. Let                represent organization i's
underlyIng propenaiy tc use flexible staffing arrangements.               Suppose
that:

          (15)        =


where X is a vector of organizational characteristics, 8 is a parameter
vector and        is a normally distributed error term.        For an organization

that does not use flexible staffers, we know only that               is less than

or equal to zero.         The contribution to likelihood for such an

organization is:
         (16)             =                =
                              P(Xi8=€iO)


   High intensity users are defined here as those in the top 10 percent
   of the use intensity distribution, and low intensity users as those
   in the bottom 50 percent. Qualitatively similar results were
   obtained with different high intensity and low intensity cutoffs.

where FL)             is the cumulative standard normal density and C                      is the
standard deviation of the error term in equation 15.                                 For a user

organization that provides valid information on use intensity,                                    the

contribution to likelihood is:
                                                          =
        (17)

where   f(,      )     is the standard normal density.                  Specifying the contributIon

to likelihood for an organization that uses flexible staffers but

providea no information or incomplete information on intensity of use is

slightly more complicated. For a user organization that provides no use

intensity information, we know only that its use Intensity is positive;
in this case,                        the lower bound on total flexible staffing use
                            Y,
intensity, equals zero.                          For an organization that uses more than one

category of flexible staffer but provides valid information for only a
subset of the categories used,                                 equals the intensity of use in that
subset of categories.                           The contribution to likelihood for a user

in Table    6.    The column   l)   apecification includes the proportion of the

organization's workforce that is unionized and dummy variables which
capture whether the organization's demand was reported to be seasonal Cr
to vary from year to year.          The union variable takes on a large and

statistically significant negative coefficient          that   is,   unionized fIrma
make less use of flexible ataffing arrangements than nonunion firma.28

Organizations that report their demand         t   be either highly seasonal or

highly variable from year to year make greater use of flexible staffing

arrangements than other organizations. The column           2,   specification is
like that in column <1), out with the absolute value of the proportional

change   in the   organization's employment between 1990 and 1995, a

manufacturing dummy     variable, the logarithm of the     number    of employees
in the   unit, and a dummy variable Intended to capture the organIzation's

employment philosophy added as a separate control varables.              The

unionization, seasonal dummy and year-to-year demand variability dummy
coefficients in this model are almost identical in magnitude to those in
the previous model.      Somewhat surprisingly, however, none of the added

variables   take on significant coefficients.

Can the Survey Results Be Oeneralizs4t

         Given the nonrandom nature of the survey sample,    an obvious

question is whether the survey findings are at all generalizabie. Two

specific concerns are, first,    that the pattern of answers might have

iooked significantiy different had the industry composition of the

sampie more ciosely mirrored that in the economy as a whole, and,
second,   that the organizations responding to the survey are

unrepresentative       ways that are less easy to observe.     Weighting the

survey responses to correct for the discrepancy between the industry
distribution of survey responses and tne industry dIstribution of,
alternatively, employment in establishments with 50 or more employees
and total employment produced no noteworthy changes In the pattern of
use  frequency, use intensity, reasons for use or reported importance of
     22 Of
use.        course, It should oe kept In minc that the survey did not

reach very small firms.

         Beyond pusalbis dsturtiuns related to the industry distribution
of the respurdin; urgar zatlsns,    I    was   cnernd   that organizations that

did not use flexIble staffers might have felt that the survey

questionnaire did not apply to them and therefore been less likely to

reply.    For this reason, tne short letter accompsnying the followup

mailing to those we had not heard from by the end of June emphasized
that we were interested In answers from all organizations, including

those that made no use of flexible staffing arrangements.         If my concern



22 A mix
          industry classification was used in constructing these weights;
   durables; nondurables; transportation, communication and utilities;
   finance, insurance and real estate health care; and trade and other
   services.   With a larger sample, it would have been possible to use
   finer industry classifications in constructing the weights, but this
   was not feasible here.
                                   26

were warranted, one might expect the answers of those who replied

following the first mailing to differ systematically from the answers of
those who replied only after receiving this second letter.      However,

there were only minor differences between early and late responders'
        23
answers,

        it would be particularly reassuring if estimates of use frequency

and use intensity based on the survey data could be shown to correspond

to estimates from other sources.   Unfortunately, there is little other
information on flexible staffing use availsble indeed,    the paucity of

information on flexIble staffing usage was the primary motivation for

carrying out the survey in the first place.     The Bureau of Labor
Statistics does collect information on employment in the temporary help

industry that provides one useful benchmark, As reported in Table     1,   my

survey results indIcate that 77 percent of employers used agency
temporaries during 1965 and that agency temporaries sdded an average of
0.76 percent to these firms' employment levels over the course of the

year,   which implies that agency temporarIes accounted for an 00003qo of

0,56 percent of total employment during 1965.    ELS statistics on

nonmupervisory employment in the temporary help industry ccmpsred to
total nonagricultural payroll employment,   adjusted for the difference
between average weekly hours in the temporary help industry compared to
the economy as a whole, imply that agency temporaries accounted for an



23 Esrly responders were
                         slightly more likely than late responders to
   use short-term hires (66 percent versus 55 percent),  However, early
   responders who used eiTher agency temporaries or short-term hires
   also made slightly less intense use of these flexible staffing
   srrsngements than late responders. In all other respects, the two
   groups' answers were statistically indistinguishable.

IV.     Conclusions

         This paper represents a first lock at employers' use of agency

tempcrarea,     short-term hires and on-call workers.        My starting point
was to hypothesize that variability in demand and stochastic variation
in regular employees' labor supply should lead many employers to sake
use of one or more of these flexible staffing arrangements. The models
in Section II developed these hypotheses more formally, and also yielded
some additional implications concerning the likely cnaracterlstlca of
flexible slatting assignments and the characteristics of organizations

likely to make the greatest use of flexible staffers.
         Over SO percent of Inc employers respond_no to       te   survey

average employment at user flrmsl use intensity at a majority of


24
      Nonaupervisory employment in the temporary help industry averaged
      691,300 and total nonagricultural payroll emolcyment for the year
      averaged 97,519,000 in 1985. The ratio of these two numbers would
      overstate agency temporaries' contribution to total employment, since
      the payroll survey counts everyone who received any pay during a week
      as employed, and agency temporaries are more likely than the typical
      employee to work less than a full week.  A reasonable adjustment is
      to weight each person on the temporary agency payrolls by the ratio
      of average weekly hours worked by nonsupervisory employees in the
      temporary help industry (30,2 hours) to average weekly nonsuperviaory
      hours in the economy as a whole (35,9 hours, assuming that private
      sector supervisory employees average 40 hours per week and that
      weekly hours in the public sector average the same as in the private
      sector),

organizations is well below 1.0 percent, but it      exceeds   10.0   percent and
even   20.0 percent for a email number of organizations.       Office/clerical,

professional/technical and production/service assignments are common.

Varablity     in product demand and in regular employees' labor aupply are

reported by moat employers to be among the factors motivating their uae
of flexible ataffers and over 80 percent of survey reapondents indicate
that flexible staffers play an important     role   in absorbing workload

fluctuations.       Finally, organizations with a low percentage of their

nonexempt workforce covered by collective bargaining agreements and

organizations that report their demand to be either highly seasonal or

highly variable across yeare make greater use of flexible staffing

arrangements than other organzatona.
        While fluctuations in both output and input markets do provide a

central motivation for using flexible staffers,      this does not imply that
other reasons for using flexible staffers are never important.          One

possible alternative motivation is that flexible staffing arrangements

permit employers to do a better job of screening candidates for regular
posItions.      Although very few organIzations report this as a reason
for their use of flexible staffers,     a substantial number say they often

or occasionally hire these flexible staffers into regular jobs.
Identification of potential permanent hires thus seems to be, at this
point, mainly an unanticipated benefIt of the use of flexible staffing


     Bull and Tedeschi (undated) discuss this possibility. Fine and
     Gibbons l986) consider screening of temporary workers in a somewhat
     different context, in ;hich temporary workers never become permanent
     workers, but the firm keeps some temporary workers on the job longer
     than others.

arrangements.
      With better    data,   one   might be able   to   say more than   I   have done

here about the determinanta of flexible staffing            uae,   and also something

about whether and under what circumstances firma that incorporate

flexible staffing ume into their overall staffing strategy outperform

firma that do not.     Some of the same factors that lead firms to use

flexible staffers may also lead to decisions to contract work out; these
decisions are another important subject for future study,

      Considerable recent interest has been focused on the question of

how and why employers' deciaions to ume flexible staffers and to
contract cut have changed over time.         Answers to questions concerning

the relative magnitude of flexible staffing use in 1985 c                   red with

1980 suggests that agency temporary use, short-term hIre uae and on-call

use have all grown.27        The cross-section analysis carried out In this

paper suggeata two demand-aide changes that could have contributed to

growing use of flexible staffing srrangements              the decline in union

ccverage among U.S. wcrkers; and what aome evidence suggests may have


26 In
      response to a question which asked whether flexible staffers were
   'often', ocoasionally', 'seldom' or "never' hired into regular
   positions, often' or 'occasionally' wam checked for 62 percent of
   339 organizations using agency temporaries, 55 percent of 281
   organizations making short-term hires and 44 percent of 151
   organizations using on-call workers.  The survey questionnaire also
   included an open-ended question concerning unanticipated benefits and
   unanticipated drawbacks of using flexible staffers. Identification
   of potential permanent hires was mentioned as an unanticipated
   benefit more often than anything else, by 35 of the 81 respondents
   who cited any unanticipated benefit.
27
   Altogether, 40 percent of the 441 organizations providing information
   on changes in flexible staffing use intensity reported greater use of
   agency temporaries in 1985 than in 1980, while only 15 percent
   reported less use; the corresponding percentages for short-term hires
   are 25 percent and 12 percent; and for on-call workers, 15 percent
   and 4 percent.

been an increase in the variability of demand for many organizations'

products and services.28    But other factors sees likely to have been at

work as well.   Still on the demand aide, the growing strength of anti-

discrimination legislation and the erosion of the employment-at-will

doctrine may have raised the perceived coat of reliance on a hire/fire

aduatment   strategy,   In addition,   many observers have pointed to the

growing proportion of youth and women in the labor force if these
workers are more willing than adult men to take temporary and on-call

positions, the relative wages of flexible staffers may have fallen and
thus encouraged their greater use.      Slack labor markets may also have

contributed to employers' ability to restructure their employment

relationships in ways they find advantageous       These hypotheses merit

more careful investgstion.

      Finally, this paper has focused exclusively on employers'
decisions concerning the use of flexible staffing arrangements and the
role played by flexible stsffera within the firm.      The broader sooial

implications of employers' reliance on flex±ble staffing arrangements
should also be explored.
