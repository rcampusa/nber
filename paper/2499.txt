                                           ABSTRACT



              This paper examines the determinants of the number and quality of outside

                                                        a variety of time-series,
              applicants for federal job openings using

              cross-sectional   and panel data sets.   The main finding is that the

              application   rate for government jobs increases as the ratio of federal to

                                                                     to be related to
              private sector earnings increases, but does not appear

              the relative level of fringe benefits.     Furthermore,   an increase in the

              federal-private   sector earnings differential is associated with an

              increase in the average quality of applicants    for federal jobs.    The


              paper discusses the implications   of these findings for wage determination

              and recruitment in the federal government.

     Since 1962, wage determination    in the federal government has

ostensibly been guided by the principle of equal wages with comparable

private sector jobs. To accomplish this goal, the Bureau of Labor

Statistics   (BLS) annually conducts a survey of wages of white collar jobs

in private sector establishments,    and based upon this survey a

Presidential Commission recommends across the board wage adjustments to

bring about equality between federal and private sector wages. Recently,

the comparability process has been severely criticized, and alternative

measures for guiding federal pay have been proposed.1 Host notably, the

U.S. Office of Personnel Hanagement     (OPM) has proposed analyzing   data on

turnover and application rates to adjust federal wages.2 If high quit

rates or low application   rates make it difficult to attract, retain and

motivate the federal workforce, wages would be adjusted accordingly.

     Linking wage rates to the governments ability to attract and retain

competent employees has the appeal of reflecting the underlying implicit

job queue, and thus appears consistent with cost minimizing behavior.

Furthermore,   unlike the wage survey approach, these measures have the

virtue of reflecting workers' evaluations of nonwage compensation, such

as fringe benefits, job security and working conditions. As a matter of

practice,    turnover and application information are already used by the

                                                             off-scale

wage rates for a small proportion of federal joba.     A precise

understanding of the determinants of turnover and job applications is

necessary if this approach is to be effectively used to set wages for

federal workers on a wide scale.

     Although there is a relatively large literature on turnover,

surprisingly little is known about the determinants of applicants for job

openings   in the public or private sectors.3   There are many questions

that one would want to answer before using application rates as an input

in wage determination.    For instance, does the application rate depend on

the differential   in wages and fringe benefits between federal and private

sector workers?    Do macroeconomic factors such as unemployment affect the

rate of job applicants?    How does the average quality of job applicants

vary with wagea and macroeconomic conditions?    This paper analyzes a new

collection of time-series and cross-sectional   data to examine the

determinants of applicants for federal jobs.    Section one of the paper

summarizes the institutional process of applying for federal jobs.      In

section two a simple model of the supply of job applicants     is presented.

The empirical results that are presented in section three support a

conclusion that the application rate for federal jobs is very responsive

to relative federal-private   sector wages and macroeconomic   conditions,

but does not appear to be related to the relative level of nonwage

compensation.

Black, Moffitt and Warner (1987) for comparative studies of turnover in
the federal and private sectors. See Barron and Bishop (1986), Dc Vany
and Saving (1981), and Holzer, Katz and Krueger (1988) for contributions

1.   The Federal Job Application Process

      In 1985 the federal government received about 4.5 million requests

for information regarding job openings, processed nearly 1.2 million

completed job applications from individuals who were not employed by the

government, and hired 134,224 new employees.4   Below I consider the

system that generates and processes applications for federal jobs.

      For the majority of job openings, agencies hire workers from outside

the federal government through the Office of Personnel Management's Open

Competitive Appointment System.   This system is administered by OPM and

its Area Offices.   When it is decided that a position should be filled by

an outside employee, OPM advertises the job opening in its Job

Information Centers, specifies the minimum qualifications needed to

perform the job, and announces the job's starting salary.   In its

instructions to job applicants, OPM advises potential applicants not to

apply for a job unless they "fully meet the qualification requirements,

will work in the location(s) for which applications are being accepted

and will accept the salary of the position." This process is intended to

screen out applicants who are not qualified for the position.

      Applications are accepted only for the specific positions that have

job openings. However, for many occupations, including most clerical,

engineering, nursing and accounting jobs, there is a continual need for

new hires, so applications are accepted on an on-going basis.

Individuals may submit an application for more than one job opening.




   These data and the subsequent data used in the paper are based on
workers hired through the competitive appointment system which excludes
postal workers.
                                            -4-


        An application     consists   of a completed   job application   blank   and in

many cases also includes references, academic records and civil service

exam results.       Job applicants are evaluated on the basis of this informs-

tion.     An inventory of eligible or qualified applicants is kept in

federal "registers'        for each occupation. OP1 then refers a list of the

eligible applicants ranked in order of their qualifications to the

specific agency that has a job vacancy. The agency must select a

candidate from the three most highly rated job applicants on the

register.

        Applications typically remain active on the register for a period of

12 months.      After the 12 month period expires, however, the applicant may

request to have his or her name remain active on the register for an

additional year.         Thus, the registers mainly contain applicants who

currently desire government employment.

        After 1978, in cases where a specific agency or local area is the

sole or predominant employer of an occupation, OPM may delegate complete

responsibility for recruitment and hiring to the agency or area.                 By

1985, about one-third of federal job applications that were processed and

selections that were made were delegated to individual agencies and local

areas.     Examples of occupations that OPM has delegated include air

traffic controllers (delegated to the Federal Aviation Authority) and

ship-fitters (delegated to local federal ports).

        The data used in this paper are drawn from the lists of applications

maintained by OPM and its predecessor organization, the U.S. Civil

Service Commission.        Applications and selections that are delegated to

agencies and local areas are added to the total to make the series

consistent over time.
2.    Model

       A simple model of workers' decisions to apply for federal jobs is

presented below.         The basic framework is that optimizing agents compare

their expected lifetime utility from applying for a job in the federal

sector (including the cost of applying) to their expected lifetime

utility of not applying in deciding whether to apply for a federal job.5

An employee will apply for a government job if his expected utility is

higher if he applies for the job than if he does not apply.

       Assume that each individual has a utility function of the form:



(1)           U   =   U(Wi,Bi)    BU/BW   >   0,   BU/BB > 0   ;    i =    (g,p)


where W' represents the employee's discounted value of earnings in sector

i, and B1 represents a vector of nonwage benefits (fringe benefits,

working conditions, etc.) attached to sector i.                The superscript i refers

to either government jobs, g, or private sector jobs, p.                  I initially


simplify the problem by assuming that all workers are identical in terms

of their abilities and preferences, and have probability q of being

selected by the government should they apply for a job.                It is further

assumed that individuals' preferences satisfy the von Neumann-Morgenstern

axioms.

       If an individual applies for a government job he is hired with

probability q and has lifetime utility             U;   with probability (l-q) the



   This model is formally similar to John Abowd and Henry Farber's (1982)
model of implicit queues for union jobs and Rebecca Blank's (1985) model
of sectoral choice. The present approach differs from these previous
studies in that I explicitly model actual applications instead of
implicit job queues, and in estimating the model I use direct
observations on the number of applications and selections.
                                                     —6-




applicant is not selected for the job and takes his best private sector

alternative which gives him utility U.6                        Finally, I assume that the cost

in terms of utility of applying for a government job is                                  and the

utility      cost   of applying      for     a private      sector   job is   C.       These costs

reflect the time and psychic costs of filling out an application, taking

an exam, and interviewing for a job.

          An individual will apply for a government job if the net expected

utility of applying for the job is greater than the net utility of his or

her private sector alternative.                     That is, he or she will apply if

qU(W,B)         +   (1-q)U(W,B)          -     - (l-.q)C > U(W,B)             -
                                                                                  C,   or equivalently

if    q[U(W,B)       -    U(W,B)     +    cI > C]           In equilibrium, open competition

for federal jobs will lead individuals to apply for government jobs until

the marginal applicant is indifferent between applying and not applying

for the job, so



(2)          qjU(W,B)_U(WP,BP) +                     =



          The intuition     behind       equation        (2) is that in expected value there

are no rents to be made on the margin by applying for a government job.



6
   As setup, the model assumes that the prospective applicant will take a
private sector job with certainty if he does not apply for, or is not
selected for, a government job. This will follow if the worker currently
has a private sector job. If the worker does not have a certain private
sector alternative, he or she will weigh the utility of the private
sector job by the probability of getting a job there. As a result, the
empirical analysis controls for aspects of the labor market which
influence the probability of getting a private sector job, such as the
unemployment rate.

   Note that this equation does not imply that the utility function is
risk neutral; instead, it implies that the uncertain outcome of applying
for a government or private sector job may be analyzed in terms of
expected utility.
                                       —7-.




 The number of individuals applying for job openings adjusts to eliminate

 ex ante rents associated with government jobs.         As wage and nonwage

 compensation offered by the federal government rise relative to the

private sector, individuals will Continue to apply for a given number of

 federal job openings until the marginal worker is indifferent between

applying to either sector. And as the cost of applying for a federal job

increases or the cost of applying for a private sector job
                                                           decreases,
fewer individuals will apply for a given number of federal
                                                           job openings
so that equation (2) will again hold.

Heterogeneous Labor with Nonrandom Selection

        If individuals differ in their productive capacities, and if the

government is able to make job offers to applicants on the basis of

workers' perceived abilities, the analysis becomes more
                                                        complicated. The
purpose here is only to present a heuristic discussion of these effects.

        It is probably reasonable to assume that individuals have a
                                                                    noisy
estimate of their ability relative to the population, and that the

government has an imperfect but positively correlated measure of each

applicant's ability.      A final assumption is that there is a positive

correlation between an individual's alternative wage in the private

sector and his or her ability.

        An increase in the relative attractiveness of
                                                      government employment
(i.e.    an increase in    and 5g holding   W   and   B constant) in this
situation has two opposing effects on the application rate.
                                                                    First, a job
candidate's expectation of being rated the most highly qualified

applicant and therefore of being selected for the job is diminished.

This occurs because individuals with higher alternative wages and

therefore greater expected ability will apply for the job
                                                          (Weiss, 1980;
                                     -8-




Nalebuff and Stiglitz, 1982).    The average quality of the job queue

increases. In the extreme case, if employees know with certainty who the

most qualified applicant for the job will be, only that individual will

apply for the job.

     The second effect occurs because the government job has become

relatively more attractive and is therefore worth applying for even

though the chance of ultimately being selected for the job is reduced.

This is the result that is developed formally in the model above in the

case of homogeneous labor.

     If, as seems likely,    there is considerable uncertainty as to the

quality of competing job applicants and the validity of the government's

selection criteria, and little cost of applying for a government job, the

second effect will dominate.     However, the direction and magnitude of the

effect of a change in the relative attractiveness of government

employment on the application rate are empirical issues.



3.   The Determinants of Job Applicants

     Figure 1 depicts the relationship between the application rate for

all federal jobs (measured by the ratio of outside applications to new

hires) and the ratio of federal to private sector earnings. The relative
                                                                     and
earnings variable in this instance is drawn from the National Income

Product Accounts because this is the only available source of annual

earnings data that covers the entire period over which application rate

data are available.8   The figure shows that applications per new hire and

present discounted value of lifetime earnings in each sector, because
data limitations current annual earnings for full-time equivalent
employees is used.

relative earnings fluctuate substantially over time.     A fairly close

relationship between the two variables is apparent, especially between

1960 and 1980.     In years when the federal wage increases relative to the

private sector wage applications per new hire generally increase, and in

years when the federal wage decreases relative to the private sector wage

applications per new hire tend to decrease.

     The tightness or looseness of the labor market also has an important

effect on the value and availability of individuals' private sector

alternatives. And in this connection it should be noted that employment

in the federal government displays relatively little cyclical variation

(Freeman, 1987).    Figure 2 illustrates the relationship between the

application rate and the unemployment rate.     The unemployment rate is an

indicator of the availability of private sector alternatives as well as a

measure of job search intensity. The application rate closely tracks the

unemployment rate.    The pattern strongly suggests that when the labor

market becomes loose from an employee's perspective, the number of

applicants for federal job openings increases.

     Table 1 reports results from estimating multiple regressions to

predict the log of the annual application rate for federal jobs.     Since

the application rate displays serial correlation, I correct for first

order autocorrelation.9 Appendix Table Al reports results of regressions

on first-differences. Several factors are held constant in the

regressions to isolate the effect of the federal wage differential on the

application rate.    General labor market conditions are measured by the




   The coefficient estimates are qualitatively similar when a second
order autoregression is estimated and when an OLS regression is
estimated.

unemployment rate and by the Conference Board's national index of help

wanted ads.10   Two dummy variables are included to control for

differences in federal recruitment practices over time: specifically, in

years after 1974 Post Offices were no longer used for recruiting, and in

years after 1965 OPM consolidated several of its regional offices.

Finally, a time trend is included to control for secular trends in

applications. The variables and data sources used in the regressions are

described in greater detail in the Data Appendix.11

     The regression results reinforce the conclusions drawn from Figures

1 and 2.   The economic variables account for a large share of annual

variations in the application rate.   Furthermore, the log of the

government wage relative to the private sector wage denoted by in(W/Wl)

has an economically sizable and statistically significant effect on the

number of applications per worker hired.12   A   one percent increase in the

wage of federal workers over the wage of private sector workers is

associated with about a two percent increase in the number of job

applications per federal worker hired.   Moreover, this relationship

becomes stronger when additional variables are held constant.

    See Medoff (1983) for a discussion of the relationship between
unemployment, help wanted ads, and labor market pressure.

    In results not reported here I also control for the size and growth
rate of the labor force, the size of the federal government (measured by
the log of employment), one period lagged relative wages, and years in
which the Carter-Reagan hiring freeze was in effect. Controlling for
these variables does not qualitatively change the regression estimates.
12
    Following Ehrenberg (1973) and Ashenfelter and Ehrenberg's (1975)
work on public sector labor demand, the government wage differential is
taken as exogenous of the length of the job queue. This assumption seems
reasonable because of the political factors that influence determination
of wages in the federal government, and because the federal wage is
unlikely to have an important effect on the aggregate private sector wage
(see Borjas, 1980 and 1984; Reder, 1975).

     The specification of the relative earnings variable in Table                       1


constrains the federal salary and private sector salary to have equal but

opposite signed effects on the application rate.              To check the

appropriateness of this specification, the regressions are re-estimated

allowing 1n(W) and 1n(W) to enter as separate regressors.                          The results

of this exercise provide support for the specification in Table 1.                          For

example, the results of re-estimating column (1) which are reported below

show that the government wage and private sector wage have virtually

equal but opposite effects on the application rate             (AIR)   for federal jobs,

holding the unemployment rate (UR) and help wanted index (11W) constant.



ln(AR) = 1.34    + 1.96    lfl(W)

     Although the estimates reported above and in Table 1 rely on wage

data from the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA), the effect of

relative wages on applications is positive and statistically significant

when other sources of wage data are used.            For instance, when the average

wage of federal employees directly estimated from OPH's Central Personnel

Data File is used to re—estimate column (3) of Table 1, the coefficient

(standard error) on the relative earnings variable is 1.66                   (35)13
Alternatively, when the same regression is estimated using the earnings


13
    Tabulations from OPHs Central Personnel Data File are reported
annually in Pay Structure of the Federal Civil Service (Washington, D.C.
OPM). An employment-weighted average of blue collar and white collar
earnings of federal workers is the numerator of the relative wage
variable; the denominator is the average private sector wage from the
National Income and Product Accounts.
                                   -12-



differential derived from the PATC comparability survey, which is

available only in the years between 1968 and 1985, the coefficient

(standard error) on relative earnings is 1.44 (.46).14

     Turning next to measures of the general condition of the labor

market, the unemployment rate and help wanted index have their expected

signs and usually border on statistical significance. A one percentage

point increase in the unemployment rate, for instance,   is associated with

a 6.49 percent increase in the application rate according to the estimate

in column (3).   However, the size and significance of the effect of the

unemployment rate diminishes when the dummy variables for recruitment

policies and the time trend are added to the regression.15

     An increase in the index of help wanted ads is associated with a

decline in the number of applicants per federal job opening.   In

comparison to the wage ratio and the unemployment rate, however, the

regressions imply that a one standard deviation change in the help wanted

index has a relatively small effect on the application rate.   Finally, I

note that after controlling for the government wage differential, labor

market conditions, and changes in recruitment practices, the application

rate displays a slight upward trend over time.




14
    Since Freeman finds that the various estimates of the federal-private
sector wage differential from the PATC survey, OPN's Personnel Data File,
and NIPA tend to move together over time although at a point in time they
often seem inconsistent, it is not very surprising that all three
variables yield relatively similar results here.
15
    Results are qualitatively unchanged when the unemployment rate and
help wanted index are entered in log form.

Fringe Benefits

     There is a widespread perception that fringe benefits in the federal

government exceed those in the private sector (e.g. Hartman 1983).                          To

examine the impact of the relative level of fringe benefits on the

federal job application rate, the regression reported below controls for

the log of the ratio of average federal nonwage compensation to average

private sector nonwage compensation for full-time equivalent employees

(B8/B), using NIPA wage and nonwage               data.

                                                                                  .16 HWI

          Adj.-R2 = .85      p   .36           DW = 1.49       (S.E.'s in parentheses)




     Surprisingly, the regression indicates that an increase in the level

of fringe benefits in the federal government relative to the private

sector has   a small,   statistically insignificant,                        effect on the

application rate.'6 Moreover, the small standard error of this estimate

implies that the economically negligible effect of relative fringe

benefits on applications is precisely estimated. The relative earnings

variable, however, continues to have a sizeable,                 positive impact on

federal job applicants after controlling for nonwage compensation.

     Why might fringe benefits be unrelated to job applicants?                      One

possible explanation is that prospective job applicants are not


16
    It should be noted that this result does not appear to be entirely
driven by multicollinearity between relative earnings and relative fringe
benefits because the relative fringe benefits variable has a small,
statistically insignificant (though positive) effect on the application
rate when the relative earnings variable is dropped from the regression.
immediately cognizant of the availability or generosity of fringe

benefits.     Nonwage compensation, such as pension benefits and health

insurance, might not be a very salient or relevant feature of work for

job applicants, while in contrast, earnings are easily measured and

immediately relevant. On the other hand, another possible explanation is

that nonwage labor costs are a very noisy measure of the value of fringe

benefits to workers.    Random measurement error would have the effect of

biasing the relative fringe benefit coefficient toward zero.

Sex Differences

        The federal government's equal employment opportunity policy and

affirmative action program give preferential treatment in hiring to

women.'7     This might be expected to lead to a different relationship

between applications and wages for men and women.     In addition,

differences in geographic mobility between men and women might also

affect application rates.     Unfortunately, diaggregated application data

are not available to perform a separate analysis by sex.    However, it is

possible to estimate the effect of sex differences in the relative

federal-private sector earnings differential on the overall application

rate.

        Table 2 presents log application regressions controlling for the log

of the ratio of federal to private sector earnings for the median,




17
    The same argument can be applied to the hiring of minorities and
verterans, but these issues are not examined empirically because
sufficient time-series data on relative earnings by sector are not
available for these groups.

full-time, year-round male and female worker.18   Changes in the

federal-private earnings differential for the median male and median

female worker have about an equal, positive impact on the overall job

application rate.   The elasticity of the overall application rate with

respect to relative earnings is slightly greater for male workers than

female workers, but the difference is not statistically significant at

conventional levels.    Furthermore, these conclusions are unchanged when

the sample period is restricted to years after the Civil Rights Act took

effect.

Quality of Applicants

     The results presented so far do not control for the quality of job

applicants. Unfortunately, only scant evidence is available on the
                                           One admittedly crude measure of
quality of applicants for federal jobs.

the quality of applicants for federal jobs is the number of applicants

who were judged minimally qualified to perform their prospective job.19

OPM collected such data nationally in 22 of the last 36 years.     On

                                                           for their
average, 59% of applicants were judged minimally qualified

prospective jobs during these years.

     Table 3 presents regression results predicting the log of the number

of minimally qualified applicants per new hire for the years in which

data are available. To aave degreea of freedom, only the relative wage

rate and labor market factors are held constant.    For comparison, the

second column of the table reports regression estimates of the log of the

overall application rate on the same set of controls and sample.     The

third column examines the effect of the independent variables on the log

of the ratio of minimally qualified applicants to all
                                                      applicants.
     The table shows that a one percent change in the federal wage

differential haa a greater positive impact on the number of qualified

applicants per new hire than on the total application rate during this

time period.   As a result, the fraction of job applicants who are at

least minimally qualified to perform the job they applied for increases

as the average federal-private wage differential increases.

     Finally, it appears that the application rate of qualified workers

is less responsive than the total application rate to
                                                      changes in the
unemployment rate and help wanted index.   The effect of these two

variables on the fraction of the applicant pool that is considered

qualified, however, is statistically insignificant.

Within-Occupation Analysis

     The aggregate time-series analysis above reflects the entire

spectrum of federal and private sector jobs.   This approach ia

appropriate if the mix of federal and private sector jobs remained

relatively constant over the time period studied.

     To examine the effect of relative wages on the number of
                                                              applicants

The results of this estimation are reported in Table 4.          Adding

occupation dummies to the regression reduces the effect of the relative

wage variable on the application rate, but the relative wage variable

continues to have a statistically significant and sizable impact on the

application rate.        A one percent increase in the government wage

differential is associated with a 2.37 percent increase in the

application rate according to the within-occupation regression.             This

estimate is similar in magnitude to the elasticity of applications with

respect to relative wages obtained from the aggregate time-series

analysis.

        The white collar unemployment rate appears to have a very large

effect on the application rate in both the inter and intra-occupation

analyses.     The point estimates indicate that a one percentage point

increase in the unemployment rate has a much greater effect on the

application rate in the white collar occupation analysis than in the

aggregate time—series analysis. The index of help wanted ads, however,

has an insignificant effect in the occupational analysis.

     Lastly, I note that there is considerable variation in the

application rate across occupational lines even after controlling for

occupation specific relative wage differentials. Engineers appear to

have the lowest application rate while accountants and auditors
                                                                appear to

Thia pattern might reflect the relative supply of workers with these

types of skills or unmeasured aspects of the relative attractiveness of

government employment that varies across these occupations.

Inter-City Analysis

     With relatively few exceptions, the government pays the same wage to

workers who are in the same grade of an occupation nationwide.20 Private

sector wages, on the other hand, vary considerably across regions and

cities of the U.S.    The rigid government nominal wage schedule therefore

leads to differences in the ratio of government wages to
                                                         private sector

wages across cities, and if workers are mobile, should influence the

number of applicants for federal jobs across cities.   To what extent can

inter-city variability in the federal to private sector wage ratio

explain the inter-city pattern of application rates?

     City—wide application rates for federal nursing jobs are examined

here because the qualifications for these jobs are well defined, and

because requisite data are available for eleven cities.     In terms of


20
    Special wage rates introduce some regional flexibility in the federal
wage schedule.  In addition, inflated job classifications introduce
another source of flexibility. Borjas (1980) finds evidence of wage
dispersion within occupations across federal agencies.

number of employees, nursing is the fifth largest white collar occupation

in the federal government.    It it noteworthy that more than

three-quarters of federal nurses work in Veterans Administration
                                                               women in
hospitals, and that 91% of federal nursing jobs were filled by

1985.    The proper alternative wage for federal nurses is probably the

wage of nurses employed by non-federal hospitals in the nearby geographic

area.

        Table 5 presents the application rate for federal nursing jobs and

the ratio of average earnings of nurses employed by federal VA hospitals

to average earnings of nurses employed by non-federal hospitals in each

city.    Looking across cities, there appears to be a weak positive

relationship between the application rate and relative earnings (r.22).

In Washington, D.C. and St. Louis, for instance, the federal wage is

relatively high compared to non-federal sector wages for nurses, and the
                                                                 And in

spite of the above scale federal wage rate that is in effect

nurses in San Francisco, the extremely high wage rate offered by the non-

federal sector appears to lead to a very low application rate for federal

nursing jobs in that city.     Nonetheless, some significant anomalies are

evident.     For example, the number of applications per nurse hired in New

York is the highest among the eleven cities, while the ratio of federal

to non-federal earnings is relatively low in New York.

4.   Conclusion

     This paper has examined the determinants of queues for federal

government jobs as measured by the job application rate.    The principal

findings are: 1) the number of job applications filed per worker hired

increases sharply as the average wage of government workers increases

relative to the average wage of private sector workers; 2) the number of

qualified applicants per worker hired, as well as the fraction of job

applicants who are qualified to perform their prospective job, increases

as the relative average wage of government workers increases; 3) the

number of applications per new hire does not appear to be related to the

relative level of fringe benefits; and 4) the number of applications per

new hire increases as the unemployment rate increases, and decreases as

the help wanted index increases. Noreover, these conclusions seem to

hold in both aggregate time-series data and in longitudinal data on

occupational groups over time.

     These findings have several implications for federal wage setting

and recruitment policy.   The analysis shows that an increase in the wage

of federal workers will lead to an increase in the number and average

quality of applicants for federal jobs.    Since job application rates

appear to reflect economic incentives, the case for using application

data as a mechanism for adjusting wages is strengthened.    If the number

of job applications for a given job opening falls below or rises above a

certain level, wages can be adjusted accordingly to minimize costs.      In

addition, the results suggest that increasing fringe benefits is not an

effective way to recruit workers.

     An important unresolved issue is the determination of the proper

standard for judging the optimal number of applicants for job openings        ir
                                     —21-



the federal government.    A backlog of applicanta allowa vacanciea to be

filled rapidly and facilitates efficient job matchea, but reaourcea are

uaed inefficiently if wages are set above the optimal level.    A natucal

standard of comparison for the government's application rate is the

application rate for jobs in the private sector.    A first attempt to

compare job queues in the government and private sector is presented in

Krueger (1987).    However, a comparison between the application rate in

the private and public sectors    is hindered by the salience of the

government and by differences in recruitment practices used by public and

private sector employers. It is noteworthy that Bishop, Barron and

Hollenbeck (1984) and others find that employer size and search

activities have an important effect on the number of applications

received by private sector establishments. The application rate for

federal sector jobs and private sector jobs may not be directly

comparable.

     An alternative approach would be to study the effect of differencea

in application rates on the productivity and efficiency of government

agencies.     The optimal application rate can be based on organizational

performance and actual experience rather than on a rigid comparison with

private sector employers. Finally, a valuable complement to the analyaia

here would be an examination of the determinants of the rate at which

workers turn down job offers.    Like the application rate, the turn down

rate reflects workers' alternative opportunities in the labor market.

The job turn down rate can serve as a additional indicator of the

relative generosity of compensation.
