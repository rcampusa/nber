1. Introduction

    Research exploiting new longitudinal business datasets has shown that firms in narrowly defined

industries exhibit very different outcomes in terms of productivity, wages, growth, and survival.

These firms also exhibit very different choices in terms of technology, organizational structure, size,

and factor mix. It is apparent that there is much heterogeneity and persistence in the ways firms

produce and do business, and that learning and selection effects play large roles in these processes. In

this paper we use a unique new database with longitudinal information on both firms and their

workforce to find that this heterogeneity and persistence in productivity both extends to and is related

to firm workforce composition. We propose a framework where the underlying source of these

different outcomes is differences in firms’ endowment of key factors such as technology, capital,

organizational structure, and the ability of managers. New firms that make mistakes in recognizing

their initial endowment either adjust their workforce as they learn about their capabilities or exit

through a competitive selection mechanism.

    This study follows in the footsteps of recent studies using longitudinal business data and the much

larger and more established literature using worker level data. While the former contributes to

understanding the nature and sources of firm heterogeneity and the latter to understanding worker

heterogeneity, this paper contributes to the gap in knowledge about the connections between the two –

and hence a key piece of the story underlying the interactions of workers and firms. Casual

observation suggests that these interactions are important: similar firms, even when faced with similar

markets, make very different choices of workers. For example, visits to various individual businesses

will reveal different types of workers at each, and repeat visits will confirm that although the workers

may have changed, the age, gender, and education level of the replacement workers are similar.

Recent empirical evidence using longitudinal matched employer-employee data confirms this

anecdotal impression: in their sample of long-lived large firms, Haltiwanger, Lane, and Spletzer
                                                                                                            2




(1999) found that employers choose very different types of workforces and productivity levels, even

within relatively narrow industries, and these choices are quite persistent over time.

    Figure 1 illustrates this heterogeneity and persistence in workforce mix, productivity, and earnings

per worker. Using a sample of long-lived single establishments in Maryland, the upper left panel of

this figure plots the proportion of the workplace that is female for each firm in 1986 against the same

proportion for the same firm in 1996, the upper right panel plots the proportion of the workplace that

is highly educated for each firm in 1986 against the same proportion for the same firm in 1996, the

lower left panel of this figure plots the productivity in 1986 against the productivity for the same firm

in 1996, and the lower right panel plots the analogous relationship for earnings per worker.1 The data

show quite dramatic heterogeneity and persistence in firm personnel practices and firm outcomes.

That is, firms not only choose widely different workforces (the percent female and percent highly

educated range from 0% to 100%) but the result that workforce composition, productivity, and

earnings per worker are very similar a decade later suggests that these firms are choosing their

workforces quite deliberately.2

    Such a deliberate choice of worker mix is likely to be complementary to other choices of the firm,

such as technology and organizational practice, and to other intrinsic characteristics of the business,

such as managerial or entrepreneurial ability. Consideration of these relationships leads one to think

about the complex matching and sorting processes that must underlie the connection between firm and

worker outcomes. In particular, it raises questions about the relationship between wages, productivity,

and worker mix, and the way in which firms – particularly new firms - make such widely differing

  A description of the data underlying Figure 1 is provided in section 6. Note that 4-digit effects have been
removed from the observations underlying Figure 1. Note that we find similar patterns of heterogeneity and
persistence for other measures of worker characteristics including other categories of education, age and foreign
born.

  For all cases, we present a 10 percent random sample of our data. For percent highly educated, we only show
range from 0 to 0.4 since the mean is relatively low. In all cases, the persistence is measured as the first order
AR coefficient from a regression of the 96 value on the 86 value -- for percent female, the AR1 coefficient is
                                                                                                                3




choices. This raises other issues about the role of learning and selection in this process. In this paper

we both propose a framework where the underlying source of different outcomes in both workforce

composition and productivity is differences in firms’ endowment of key factors such as technology,

capital, organizational structure, and the ability of managers, and investigate the implications of the

model using a new longitudinal matched employer-employee dataset.

       Our key empirical results are:

i)         We find substantial and persistent differences in earnings per worker, output per worker, and

           worker mix across businesses within narrowly defined industries, which remain even after

           controlling for other observable characteristics.

ii)        We find that new businesses exhibit even greater heterogeneity in earnings and productivity

           than do mature businesses, but that they adjust to the mature business pattern as they age. The

           adjustment process, while different for earnings and productivity, is consistent both with firms

           learning as they age and with the exit of “mistake” prone firms.

iii)       The dynamics of the reduction in productivity heterogeneity of new firms as they age is both

           complex and very different from the dynamic reduction of earnings heterogeneity.

           The paper is organized as follows. We first set the stage by describing how our approach

draws on the previous literature and explore some of the implications of Figure 1 a bit more. We then

develop a descriptive model that synthesizes a number of these ideas. We follow this by describing

the construction of a linked employer employee dataset, which we use to empirically test our key

hypotheses. We conclude by summarizing our contribution.

2. Background

           The framework presented here views the choice of worker mix as part of the experimentation

of how best to create and run a business. It is clear from the emerging literature using linked


0.82; for highly educated the coefficient is 0.45; for productivity the coefficient is 0.47, for earnings the
coefficient is 0.45.
                                                                                                       4




employer-employee data that worker heterogeneity and firm heterogeneity are closely linked. Our

earlier work (as well as that of others) suggest firms ultimately locate along a

productivity/earnings/skill locus with some firms being high productivity, high wage, and high skill

firms while others are low productivity, low wage, and low skill firms. In the current paper, we

provide further analysis of the connection between productivity, earnings, and worker mix and, in

particular, focus on the learning and selection dynamics of new businesses and the role of worker mix

in these dynamics. Prior to beginning our own analysis, it is useful to review briefly key strands of the

theoretical and empirical literature on firm dynamics that provide background and additional

motivation for our analysis.

        First, firm performance and behavior, even within quite narrowly defined industries, is quite

heterogeneous. Davis, Haltiwanger, and Schuh (1996) document the large magnitude of job creation

and destruction and the dominance of idiosyncratic factors in accounting for the observed large pace of

job reallocation. Spletzer (2000) reports that forty percent of new businesses die within three years of

their birth, and more than half of all jobs destroyed in a three-year period are due to the death of

establishments. In addition to growth and survival, firm heterogeneity in wages and productivity has

been documented by Abowd, Kramarz, and Margolis (1999), Foster, Haltiwanger, and Krizan (1998),

and Dunne, Foster, Haltiwanger, and Troske (2000), amongst others.

        Second, complementarities in the firm's production process can lead to a choice of worker

skill mix that varies across firms. Kremer's (1993) model of production as a series of tasks where

quantity can not be substituted for quality provides insights into how workers of similar skill will

match together in firms. Empirical evidence that worker skill is positively correlated across

occupations within establishments is provided by Lane, Salmon, and Spletzer (1999). Milgrom and

Roberts (1990) discuss the business strategy of exploiting complementarities and the resulting

clustering of marketing, production, and organization. Ichniowski, Shaw, and Prennushi (1997) find

that innovative employment practices tend to be complements, and these human resource policies are
                                                                                                     5




important determinants of productivity. And Bresnahan, Brynjolfsson, and Hitt (1999) describe how

information technology is complementary with the organization of work, including the demand for

workers of various skill levels.

        Third, there is considerable persistence in outcomes such as wages and productivity across

mature businesses. See, for example, Baily, Hulten, and Campbell (1992) with regard to productivity,

and Doms, Dunne, and Troske (1997) with regard to wages. In addition, there is considerable

persistence in measures of choice of technology, factor mix, and worker mix across mature businesses

-- see Doms, Dunne, and Troske (1997) and Haltiwanger, Lane, and Spletzer (1999).

        Fourth, the idea that learning and selection dynamics are important for firm dynamics and

heterogeneity across firms is most notably attributable to Jovanovic (1982), but also by Ericson and

Pakes (1995). In this vein, Jovanovic develops the notion that efficient firms survive and others die.

Consistent with the learning and selection models, Evans (1987), Audretsch and Mahmood (1995),

and Dunne, Roberts, and Samuelson (1989) find that establishment specific characteristics such as size

and age are important contributors to the success or failure of manufacturing establishments. Burgess,

Lane, and Stevens (2000) find that firms both at the beginning and end of their lifecycle have much

higher turnover rates than mature and successful firms do, and Lane, Isaac, and Stevens (1996) suggest

that this contributes to firm exit. Foster, Haltiwanger, and Krizan (1998) note that a common finding

in the emerging literature is that low productivity is an excellent predictor of exit.

    The evidence of tremendous heterogeneity in outcomes such as productivity, employment, and

wages (both in levels and growth rates) across businesses in the same narrowly defined industries is at

the core of this burgeoning literature. In the next section, we provide some further analysis of the

nature of this heterogeneity. We think this analysis is interesting in its own right but also helps in

thinking about the connections between productivity, earnings, and worker mix.

3. The Sources of Firm Heterogeneity
                                                                                                         6




    The motivating force for this paper was presented in Figure 1, which showed that businesses in the

same year exhibit widely different productivity, wages, and worker mixes – and that these differences

are persistent. What might drive this? The most obvious argument is that this persistence and

heterogeneity reflects different production techniques: different industries, quite naturally, require

different levels of capital intensity, or organizational structure, and that this is reflected in the

workforce composition. In this view, if we hone in closely enough to industry characteristics, the

observed persistence and heterogeneity should be reduced: firms within very narrowly defined

industries should choose roughly similar methods of production and consequently workforces. Figure

1 goes a long way in this direction by controlling for 4-digit effects but it may be that even narrower

classification is required for this purpose.

    In fact, we have a unique opportunity to examine this, because we can link our analytical dataset

(described in detail in section 5 below) to internal Census files with detailed firm level responses to

the quinquennial economic Censuses in 1987 and 1992. In Figures 2 and 3, we recreate the

relationship described in Figure 1 for two detailed five-digit industries: restaurants and plumbing

businesses.3 For each of these industries, we examine the heterogeneity and persistence for all

businesses, and then businesses that fit into a very narrow set of what one might think of as observable

dimensions of differences across firms.

    For the restaurant industry we present eight panels of firm level scatter plots on the relationship

between variables on worker mix, earnings and productivity for the firm in 1987 against the

corresponding variable in 1992. The left column of panels present these relationships for the entire

restaurant industry in the state of Maryland; the right-hand column for the subset of restaurants that

have table service, that are in metropolitan area in the state of Maryland, and where the average

customer spends the same amount (within a $5 range). By restricting our attention in the right panels


3
   We chose these industries both because of an abundance of data points and because the questions asked of
firms in these industries were particularly well suited to our analytical purpose.
                                                                                                             7




to the narrow set of restaurants on several dimensions, we think we have come fairly close to finding

firms with observationally equivalent sets of characteristics.

    Since we are looking within a relatively narrow five digit industry, it is “surprising” (although this

mimics the results that controlled for 4-digit industry) to find considerable heterogeneity and

persistence in the measures of worker mix, earnings, and productivity in the left panels for the entire

restaurant industry. As noted, this “surprising” result may simply reflect observable differences in

products and services provided – that is for the restaurant industry, some datapoints are for the fast

food restaurants while others are expensive, fancy restaurants. The right panels of Figure 2 depict the

same scatter plots focusing on the businesses with seemingly very similar observable characteristics.

The striking finding is that there remains substantial heterogeneity and persistence in earnings,

productivity, and worker mix even within as narrow a group as can be defined using detailed survey

data.4

    We repeat this same exercise for plumbing businesses in Figure 3. On the left hand column we

recreate Figure 1 for all firms in the industry. On the right column we subset the firms to include

those in the top decile of capital expenditures and capital assets. Again, despite controlling for these

observable differences, we still find similar patterns – substantial heterogeneity and persistence across

businesses not only in the same narrowly defined industry but also controlling for various detailed

characteristics of the business.

    Our interpretation of these findings of large residual heterogeneity and persistence is that they are

prima facie evidence that there are some inherently unobservable (or difficult to measure) dimensions

of firm heterogeneity. Indeed, this would mirror the prior research surveyed in Section 2, which

documented substantial differences in capital intensities as well as propensities to adopt advanced

technologies, organizational and human resource practices across business even in the same 4-digit

industries. In our view, these differences are likely to reflect, at least in part, inherently difficult to

measure characteristics such as managerial ability or related organizational practices.5

4. Theoretical Underpinnings – Learning and Selection

    The preceding section described differences in productivity levels, workforce composition, and

earnings for long-lived, mature businesses. In order to understand these different outcomes, we argue

in this paper that the heterogeneity in each of these is a manifestation of an underlying quasi-fixed

heterogeneity in firm type. This also explains the persistence in outcomes: since firm type is quasi-

fixed, the manifestation of type should not change quickly. In the model we sketch in this section, we

make three key assumptions about differences across firms. First, we assume that there are some

underlying differences in firm type, labeled “k” for now. Second, we assume that firms of different

types have incentives to use different mixes of workers through the nature of the interaction between

firm type and the productivity of different types of workers. Third, since some aspects of firm type are

arguably unobservable even to the firm itself initially, newly born firms learn and evolve towards their

“long run” type (or potentially exit as discussed below). In what follows, we first focus on the nature

of the connection between firm type and worker mix. We then consider the role of uncertainty, the

effect of this on the learning of surviving firms, the associated belief distribution in this learning, and

the consequences for the choice of worker mix. After discussing the optimal choice of worker mix for

surviving firms, we discuss the factors that determine selection.

4A. The link between firm type and worker mix

         We only sketch a model here, drawing heavily on the literature, in order to motivate and help

interpret the empirical exercises we consider in section 5. The simple descriptive model focuses on

the choice of worker mix and abstracts from scale effects. As such, we take the size of businesses as


5
  It is important to emphasize that in all of the results to be presented in this paper control for 4-digit industry,
which is a basic control for observable differences across businesses. There may well be, of course, other
important observable dimensions of firm heterogeneity. As such, we believe that it would be a fruitful path for
                                                                                                            9




given and develop the model focusing on the determinants of output per worker and the mix of

workers by worker type within a business, although many of the same factors that we emphasize that

influence mix also influence scale.6

         We begin by assuming that the observed firm heterogeneity fundamentally reflects some

variation in business type – the idiosyncratic ability of managers, the firm's organizational practices or

policies, or the choice of productive inputs such as technology, physical capital, or organizational

capital. In what follows, we refer to this type as “k” with high “k” firms inherently more productive.

For now, it is useful to think of k as fixed but in practice it is better to think of k as changing either

slowly or, even better, infrequently (as when a firm adopts a technology through an investment spike -

- see, for example, Cooper, Haltiwanger, and Power (1999)). Following the learning literature, we

also argue that firms are not likely to be fully aware of their type at birth, and initially “guess” their

type to be K. Since k is not directly observable to the firm, but output is, firms have to revise their

priors each period based upon observations of their output. However, a firm’s ability to extract

information on its type is clouded to some extent by unobservable profit (i.e., productivity, demand,

and cost) shocks.

         Furthermore, assume that output per worker is given by θf(k,s) (suppressing time subscripts),

where θ is initially assumed to be a random (i.i.d.) profit shock, s is skill mix, f is increasing in its

arguments and the cross partial between k and s is positive (i.e., there is k-skill complementarity).7



future research to explore on an industry-by-industry basis other observable dimensions of differences across
businesses.
6
  For example, Lucas (1977) develops a model of the size distribution of employment that depends upon
heterogeneity in the managerial ability across businesses. The latter is part of what we have mind as “k” in the
analysis that follows. In the Lucas (1977) model, the most productive entrepreneurs employ more workers but
do not capture the entire market because of diseconomies of control – even the most productive individual can
only effectively control a limited size operation. While this is outside the scope of our model, this argument is
implicitly important in our context as well in that it provides one potential explanation for why the high and low
“k” firms can operate simultaneously.
7
  The assumption that θ is i.i.d. is not critical and likely unrealistic – we assume this for now to make some of
the simple illustrative analysis easier to present.
                                                                                                   10




Firms observe total output each period after decisions for the period are made, but do not observe k or

θ directly. The observation of output implies there is learning over time about true k.

        We specify wages as having two components: one a function of skill and one reflecting the

ability of workers in a firm to extract rents (and or more generally internal labor market considerations

that might generate firm specific components to wages – in what follows we use “rent sharing” as a

catch all label for such effects). Specifically, wages are given by w(s) = ω(s) + δEΠ, where ω(s) is the

reservation wage for workers of skill s (with ω’>0), and δEΠ is the rent sharing premium such that

δ<1 and Π is the surplus in the period (see below). In principle, we permit δ to vary over time (e.g.,

over the life cycle of the firm) and to be idiosyncratic and stochastic. Put differently, one source of

heterogeneity across businesses may be the nature of the internal labor market and, accordingly, the

earnings profiles of businesses may change as the firm ages and changes its internal paysetting

structure. Our descriptive model includes such firm-specific effects in a crude fashion to recognize

their potential empirical relevance – modeling the nature of the firm-specific components of wage

determination in this context should be a high priority for future research. In this regard, we recognize

that our descriptive model is missing potentially interesting aspects of the firm-specific components of

wages. It could be, for example, that δ not only varies with time but with s – many interesting internal

labor market models may yield incentives for varying the wage differential based upon worker

characteristics.

        In this setting, expected profits in a given period are given by (normalizing the output price to

one for now):

                      E[(1-δ){θf(k,s) – ω(s) - F} | K],                          (1)
                                                                                                          11




where F represents fixed costs of operating in each period and K represents the belief about type in

each period.8 In our simple model, firms will learn about their type and update K each period based

upon prior observations. Then they will either decide to shut down (selection) or decide to continue to

operate. If the latter, they will choose s, and generate their output.

         This generates several concrete predictions. First, in the absence of uncertainty and rent-

sharing, the choice of s each period will satisfy θ∂f(k,s)/∂s = ω’(s) and k-skill complementarity implies

that firms with higher k will have higher s and higher wages. Second, the slope of the wage and

productivity profiles should be the same for given k. In this simple case, systematic firm productivity

differentials, wage differentials, and workforce composition differences are entirely driven by

differences in k.

         The intuition of this result can be seen in figure 4, where we have graphed the productivity

profiles for firms with three different values of k (k3 > k2 > k1). For any given skill level s, firms that

are type k3 are the most productive, firms that are type k1 are the least productive, and firms that are

type k2 are in between. Expanding this simple three firm example to a continuum of k, the points of

tangency where marginal productivity equals marginal wages sketch out the equilibrium line of

observed productivity/skill combinations (for simplicity in drawing the figure, we have assumed that

wages are linear in skills). If we interpret skill on the horizontal axis as an index of observable worker

characteristics, this line can be thought of a possible underlying theoretical justification for the

statistically significant productivity/skill relationship found for long-lived large firms by Haltiwanger,

Lane, and Spletzer (1999).9


8
   We assume conditions are such that expected profits are a strictly concave function of s. In many of our
examples, we assume f is strictly concave in s and ω is linear in s.
9
   It is worth noting that there are a number of potential reasons why high “k” and low “k” firms can both exist in
the same market. If k is managerial ability, economies of scope as in Lucas (1977) can limit the size of the
business. If k is type of technology adopted, then costs of adopting and learning new skills may mean that there
is heterogeneity in technologies being used as in Cooper, Haltiwanger and Power (1999) or Caselli (1999). It
might also be that we want to think about k as the persistent component of idiosyncratic technology or cost
shocks as in Hopenhayn (1992) or Hopenhayn and Rogerson (1993). Such idiosyncratic technology and cost
                                                                                                            12




4B. The role of uncertainty about type and the implications for learning

         In the more general case, with uncertainty about firm type, the skill mix s will be chosen so

that E[θ∂f(k,s)/∂s | K] = ω’(s). We still obtain the result that firms with higher K choose higher s and

have higher wages. However, as is obvious from the first order condition, uncertainty about k implies

that the slopes of the wage and productivity profiles need not be the same, even for firms with the

same k. Figure 5 provides a visual interpretation of this. Suppose we have three firms in an entering

cohort, each of which has the same k, but each of which initially believes it has a different type K3 >

K2 > K1. At birth, then, they choose different skill levels based upon their belief about K. However,

because productivity is determined by actual type as well as the skill mix of workers, the optimistic

firm's realization of productivity is less than anticipated. Similarly, the pessimistic firm's realization

of productivity is greater than what it expected. Only firm 2 is at a point on the long-run (no

uncertainty) productivity/skill locus. Firms 1 and 3 then adjust their skill level along the productivity

curve, so that eventually they end up with a workforce composition appropriate to their type (and in

this case the three firms with the same k would end up with the same workforce compositions and the

same productivity level).

         While the specific quantitative implications for productivity and worker mix dynamics depend

upon the precise assumptions about the initial distribution of beliefs, there are a few key aspects of the

implications illustrated that do not depend upon the precise assumptions regarding this distribution.


shocks might relate to the location of production or the specific technology adopted (and thus be related to some
of these other factors as well). It is the case that the equilibrating forces act somewhat differently across these
different possibilities. As noted above, in Lucas (1977) the differences in managerial ability and the economies
of scope yield differences in the size of businesses (and thus determine the equilibrium size distribution). In
Caselli (1999), there is some general capital that is perfectly mobile and thus sites that have adopted the latest
technology have not only better capital but more capital. In Hopenhayn and Rogerson (1992), labor is the only
input considered, labor is subject to adjustment costs and is subject to decreasing returns and there are entry costs
(therefore the mass of entrants does not take over the market nor does any individual business). These different
models and associated equilibrating forces have implications for the dispersion of productivity across businesses.
It is beyond the scope of this paper to specify fully the nature of the factors generating the productivity
dispersion and the associated equilibrating forces. mapping the observed patterns and evolution of dispersion in
productivity (and earnings) across businesses to the specific implications of these alternative models is an
important area for future research.
                                                                                                            13




For one, Figure 5 helps illustrate the more general prediction that businesses will learn that they have

made mistakes about their type and will adjust their mix of workers in a systematic fashion:

overestimates of type result in decreased s; underestimates result in increased s.10 A second key

related prediction that does not depend upon the initial distribution of beliefs is that the deviations

from the long run profile should be reduced over time. In the limit, only the idiosyncratic productivity

shocks should generate deviations in the long run. Wages, productivity, and worker mix are all still

related through their common relationship to k, but the tightness of that relationship, as measured by a

reduction in the variance of the deviations, increases as a cohort ages. The following example helps

illustrate the working of the simple model, as well as the role of initial beliefs.

4C. A simple example

         To more fully understand the implications of this model for learning dynamics and the link

between wages, productivity, and skill mix, it is useful to consider a simple example. Suppose we

have the following production function (for 0<α<1) and wage function (where we have abstracted

from rent sharing – a point we return to below):

                    y = θksα ,     ω ( s ) = ϖs                                              (2).

The optimal s is then:11

                                  1 
                                    
                       αK   1−α 
                   s =
                     *
                                                                                            (3).
                      ϖ 

Equations (2) and (3) imply that as firms get older and learn about their type, the dispersion of skills, s,

and the dispersion of productivity, y, depend directly on the dispersion of beliefs about type, K.


10
    Note that it should be clear that even if firms had the same initial belief, firms with negative errors (overly
optimistic) will decrease their skill mix while firms with positive errors (overly pessimistic) will increase their
skill mix.
11
    The assumption that θ is i.i.d. makes this expression simple. Observations of past output yields information
about k but no information about future productivity shocks. For this example, we have also normalized the
mean of θ to one.
                                                                                                       14




Accordingly, the changes in the dispersion of mix, productivity, and wages depend upon the evolution

of var(K).

        To consider the empirical implications, it is helpful to take logs of the production function,

defining ~
         • ≡ ln(•) , which yields ~
                                  y = α~
                                       s + η . The “error” term in this expression has information on

                                           ~    ~
both type and productivity shocks: η = k + θ . Clearly, estimating a simple regression of y on s does

not yield an estimate of α, since s and k are positively correlated and k is unobserved at least to the

econometrician, but rather an estimated coefficient, β where

                         cov(k~, ~
                                  s)
         E ( β ) = α +        ~
                                    
                                                                                       (4)
                          var( s ) 

         The “omitted variable” bias from regressing ~
                                                     y on ~
                                                          s differs for mature and young

businesses, and hence help us understand the role of learning about type on the productivity/skill

relationship. For mature businesses, where K = k, estimating this regression yields the slope of the

long run profile (which we refer to below as β ) depicted in Figures 4 and 5. For young businesses

that have uncertainty about their type, the relationship between skills and productivity depends on the

structure of their initial beliefs. If the initial distribution is similar to a type of classical measurement

error (K = k + κ, where κ is a random measurement error with mean zero), then learning effects as

firms converge to the long run profile will yield a reduction in overall dispersion in productivity, a

reduction in the dispersion of the worker mix, but an increase in the slope of the estimated

productivity/skill relationship as firms age. If, in contrast, newly-born firms have identical ex ante

beliefs, then we would expect to see rising dispersion in both productivity and worker mix, but a

flattening of the slope of the estimated productivity/skill relationship as firms age. Note that

regardless of the assumption about initial beliefs, the convergence to the long run profile implies that

residual deviations from the long run profile will diminish over time.
                                                                                                       15




        In this simple example, the implied changes for wage dispersion are similar to those for

productivity on some dimensions but different on others. The similarities arise because the dispersion

of wages depends upon the dispersion of s. In the absence of rent sharing, the only effect of the

learning about k on wages is the direct effect through s. In this case, the model predicts changes in the

dispersion in wages only due to systematic changes in the distribution of s, but does not predict

systematic changes in the estimated slope of the wage/skill profile or systematic changes in the

distribution of the unobservables (i.e., residuals). With rent sharing, the qualitative predictions for the

distribution of wages begin, in principle, to mimic those for productivity. Even here, the quantitative

predictions may be different given the nature of rent sharing.

        On the learning side of the story, then, as firms’ age, declining uncertainty about firm type

leads to systematic changes in the skill mix and decreases in the residual dispersion in the relationship

between productivity and skills (with similar predictions potentially for wages). Changes in overall

wage, productivity, and worker mix dispersion (and the estimated relationship between these) depend

upon the initial distribution of beliefs and the associated resolution of uncertainty. We return to these

predictions when we discuss the empirical specification in section 5.

4D. Selection

        On the selection side, we draw heavily on the implications from the existing literature on

selection as we have little to add (theoretically) except for some modest refinements. Following

Jovanovic (1982) and Dunne, Roberts, and Samuelson (1989), we suppose that entering firms face the

uncertainty about type that we have already outlined, entry costs, and a fixed cost of operating in every

period (denoted F in the prior section).12 In this environment, only firms with sufficiently high

expected k will enter. The marginal entering firm will have zero expected discounted profits taking


12
   In a formal model of entry and exit, we might also want or need to guarantee some exit of mature businesses.
The latter could be generated from there being some probability of any given production site becoming
sufficiently unproductive (e.g., as in Davis and Haltiwanger (1990) or Ericson and Pakes (1995)) that it should
                                                                                                        16




into account the costs of entry. However, given the learning as well as the fixed costs of operating

each period, some firms will learn that they have negative expected profits and exit. The firms that are

more likely to exit are those with low k since they will be closer to the marginal firm.

        In terms of observable implications, low k firms will tend to have both lower productivity and

lower “s”. Putting these pieces together, we get some modest refinements of the typical predictions of

the selection literature. The standard prediction is that low productivity firms are more likely to exit

and this reflects the fact that low productivity firms are more likely (on average) to have learned

through experience of producing that they are expected negative profit firms. Our refinement is that

we should see that such marginal firms have also selected a low “s” and thus we should see that low

“s” predicts exit. Errors should also provide information: firms that deviate from the long run profile

in the negative direction should also be more likely to exit since this yields information about the

learning about type. That is, a negative error indicates that the firm is more likely to have

overestimated rather than underestimated its type and such firms will revise their expected type

downwards and be more likely to exit.

        To sum up, like the standard selection model, firms that learn they are low productivity firms

are more likely to exit. Our focus on the choice of worker mix suggests the following refinements.

First, the choice of mix will be correlated with k and productivity and thus should help predict exit.

Second, the component of productivity that is not predicted by worker mix may also have some

additional power to predict exit as this indicates the direction of learning.

5. Empirical Specifications and Tests

        The above theoretical discussion generates testable hypotheses about selection and the

evolution of productivity, wages, and worker mix as a cohort of businesses enters and ages. We have




exit. In terms of the model sketched above, this could be captured by assuming that there is a component of the
profit shock θ that has this feature.
                                                                                                        17




specific predictions about the evolution of productivity and earnings as firms’ age and the role of

changes in the worker mix in this evolution.

        The evolution of productivity and earnings can be traced empirically by using the following

specification following directly from the discussion in the previous section:



                       y it = X it β t + ε it ,                                     (5)

Here yit is a measure of an outcome such as output per worker or payroll per worker, Xit is a vector of

worker characteristics, βt is the slope of the profile in the current year (and thus may not be the slope

of the long run profile) and εit is the residual (reflecting a deviation from the current “profile”).

        On the learning side, the theoretical predictions of changes in dispersion can be tested directly

using a Juhn, Murphy, and Pierce (1993) (hereafter JMP) full accounting approach to decompose

changes in variance of outcomes into changes in β’s, changes in X’s, and changes in residuals. That

is, by exploiting this specification for a cohort of entering business, we can examine the changes in the

dispersion of productivity and wages and the extent to which changes in the dispersion is accounted

for by changes in the distribution of observable and unobservable factors.

        Our JMP full accounting distribution exercises are based upon exploiting the following two

closely related decompositions:

               y it = X it β + v it = X it β + X       it   ( β t − β ) + ε it ,            (6)

where β represents a set of time invariant coefficient estimates and β t represents the estimated

coefficients for each age level of an entering cohort. In this methodology, the distribution of the

outcome variable, y, is ultimately decomposed into three terms based upon the expressions on the right

of the second equal sign: the first term captures the influence of observable characteristics for given

β’s, incorporation of the second term captures the influence of changing differentials associated with

the given characteristics, and incorporation of the third term captures the influence of unobservable
                                                                                                           18




factors. However, as an intermediate step, it is useful to consider the simpler decomposition of y into

two terms given by the expressions to the right of the first equal sign: the first term captures as before

the influence of observable characteristics for given β’s and the second term everything else. This

simpler intermediate decomposition is useful in this context because the “error” term in this simpler

decomposition, νit, can be interpreted as representing deviations from the long run profile. Note that

by construction in what follows that performing the full 3-term decomposition automatically yields the

intermediate decomposition so we can characterize how the distribution of deviations from the long

term profile evolves over time.

         To see how to use this decomposition for characterizing changing dispersion, consider using

this decomposition to decompose changes in the differential between the 90th and 10th percentile of y

for the surviving members of an entering cohort of businesses that we follow over successive years.

Using the first term in each of the above decompositions and constructing the implied 90-10

differential based upon this term alone for each year and then considering the change in this

differential over time provides a measure of the contribution of changing characteristics to the change

in overall dispersion. Inclusion of the second term in the 3-way decomposition in a measure of the

predicted 90-10 differential incorporates the contribution of the changes in the β’s. The marginal

contribution of the changing β’s is measured as the difference between the change in dispersion

generated by the first two terms from the change in dispersion generated from the first term. In a

similar manner, the contribution of unobservables is generated by considering the change in dispersion

implied by all three terms less the change in dispersion implied by the first two terms alone.13


13
    One issue that is relevant is that the ordering of the decomposition may matter here. Covariance-like effects
on the components of the decomposition of the 90-10 can make the ordering important. As such, appropriate
caution about the interpretation of the contribution of the terms is required. Given the ordering we have chosen,
there is a clear interpretation of the contribution of the first term but the second term and its interpretation is
potentially impacted by covariance-like effects. Note that regardless of the ordering the contribution of the
unobservables will be the same. The ordering we have chosen is the natural one for the exercises we are
interested in – that is, we are especially interested in the contribution of changes in the distribution of worker
mix across businesses to changes in dispersion of productivity and earnings across businesses. We have
                                                                                                               19




         As noted above, we use the estimated coefficients from a balanced panel of mature businesses

to generate the “fixed” β’s (the β in the above equation). The motivation for this -- influenced

largely by Figures 4 and 5 and our initial empirical work in Haltiwanger, Lane, and Spletzer (1999) --

is that mature businesses have presumably learned their type and thus the estimated coefficients will

not reflect errors in type. The time varying β’s are generated from estimation of the specification for

samples of entering cohort of businesses for each of the years that we follow over time.

         The theory generates predictions about the changes in skill mix that should be observed for an

entering cohort of firms. Firms that overestimate their type will decrease their skill mix while firms

that underestimate their type will increase their skill mix. In addition, the magnitude of the skill

change will be greater the greater the initial mistake made by the firm. These predictions can be tested

for entering cohorts of businesses by examining the relationship between changes in the skill mix and

the sign and magnitude of their errors. To be specific, we construct a measure of predicted

productivity using the long run β’s and the actual skill mix chosen by the business. The difference

between actual and predicted productivity yields a measure of the “error” made by the entering

business (this measure of the error is captured as νit in equation (6)). A similar measure of the wage

“error” is also constructed.

         Finally, on the selection side, the theory predicts that firms with observed initial low

productivity are more likely to fail. It could be that the firm had expectations that it was a marginal

firm with a low k and therefore had also chosen a low s and therefore worker mix should help predict

exit. Alternatively, the low observed productivity could be a surprise (and thus show up in the error

term) that indicates the firm overestimated its type and through learning the firm is more likely to exit.

We can test these predictions by examining the probability of exit as a function of initial productivity



considered the alternative ordering and briefly discuss the results of this alternative ordering in the results that
we present.
                                                                                                       20




as well as the magnitude and sign of the errors made in k. The measure of the errors is constructed in

the manner discussed above.

6. Longitudinal Linked Employer-Employee Data

        In order to address these questions, we need a dataset that links workers to their employers,

provides information on the characteristics of both, and follows both over time. We use three sources

of data to create our longitudinal linked employer-employee dataset.14 Firm characteristics are

obtained from the Standard Statistical Establishment List (SSEL), which is the U.S. Census Bureau's

sampling frame for businesses in the United States. Demographic characteristics of individuals are

obtained from administrative records at the U.S. Census Bureau. The bridge between the workers and

the firms is the Unemployment Insurance (UI) wage records from the state of Maryland.

        Every quarter, all employers subject to state Unemployment Insurance (UI) laws are required

to submit quarterly contribution reports detailing their monthly employment and quarterly wages to

the State Employment Security Agencies. The employer also provides quarterly wages for every

employee. These data on individual employees are known as the wage records, and are used by the

states to manage their unemployment insurance program. The UI wage records have been used by

many previous authors for research into worker flows, job flows, and the earnings effects of labor

reallocation -- see, for example, Jacobson, LaLonde, and Sullivan (1993), Anderson and Meyer

(1994), Lane, Miranda, Spletzer, and Burgess (1999), and Burgess, Lane, and Stevens (2000). In this

paper, we use wage records from the state of Maryland from the second quarter of 1985 through the

third quarter of 1997. This dataset consists of 108,254,142 observations on 5,006,622 workers and

262,062 employers.




14
   We should note that our linked employer-employee dataset has been created under strict protocols within the
confidential firewalls at the U.S. Census Bureau. Following Census Bureau policy, the resulting micro analytic
database can be used only for statistical purposes, and the output from such statistical analysis is carefully
reviewed to ensure the confidentiality of individual households and businesses.
                                                                                                       21




        The main advantage of the UI wage records is their coverage of essentially a universe of

workers and employers.15 Another advantage of the wage records data is the ability to construct

longitudinal linkages for both individuals and employers. We have linked the UI wage records across

quarters, using the employer as the unit of analysis. To ensure that we do not falsely define businesses

that are involved in ownership changes as births and deaths, we use information on worker flows to

distinguish administrative changes in employer identification numbers from true births and deaths.

        Perhaps the main drawback to the UI wage records data is the lack of even the most basic

demographic information on workers. We overcome this by linking the UI microdata to

administrative data residing at the Census Bureau which contains information such as date of birth,

place of birth, and gender. We are also particularly interested in the educational composition of the

workforce. We were able to directly obtain education information on a sample of the workforce via

other administrative data links to the long form of the decennial census.16 Since education can change

for workers aged 18-24, we subset the data to only include workers over age 25. We then follow

Angrist and Krueger (1991) in using detailed place of birth, month of birth, year of birth, race, and

gender to impute education for the balance of the workforce.

        The information in the UI wage records is also quite limited with regard to characteristics of

the employer. We link the UI data to the Standard Statistical Establishment List (SSEL), which is the

Census Bureau's business register. All SSEL information about individual businesses is confidential

under Title 13, Unites States Code. The SSEL is the source of basic employment and payroll

measures summarized by industry and geographic area in the Annual County Business Patterns series,

and the SSEL also serves as a resource for research into topics such as longitudinal business

demographics. Walker (1997) provides an excellent description of the SSEL. We use the natural log


15
   The state based UI system provides a virtual census (98 percent) of employees on nonfarm payrolls. The
major exclusions from private sector UI coverage are agricultural employees, self employed workers, private
household workers, unpaid family workers, and employees in small nonprofit organizations.
16
   The long form is only sent to 1/6 of households.
                                                                                                         22




of payroll per worker as our measure of earnings in the empirical work below, and we use the natural

log of sales per worker as our measure of productivity.17 Because of concerns about price variation or

variation in capital usage that vary across years and industries, most of the empirical work below uses

data measured as deviations from year and four-digit industry means.

        The analytical dataset that we construct from these merged files has the employer as the unit

of analysis. We aggregate the individual worker data into summary measures for each firm. For

example, we construct firm level proportions of workers under age 30, between 30 and 55, and over

55. We construct the proportion of the firm's workforce that is female and the proportion that is

foreign born. We also construct firm level proportions of workers with low, medium, and high

amounts of education (where these categories roughly correspond to less than high school, high school

graduates and those with some college, and college graduates). The resulting dataset has annual

observations on essentially every firm in the State of Maryland between 1985 and 1997.

        We impose a series of restrictions before turning to the analysis. We restrict the data to those

firms in the UI with a valid match to the SSEL, and we keep single establishment firms with

nonmissing sales data in the SSEL.18 While restricting attention to single establishment firms has

limitations for some purposes, it is not a major concern in the current context where we want to focus

on the dynamics in the first few years after entry. As Spletzer (2000) has shown, almost 90 percent of



17
    As described by Haltiwanger, Lane, and Spletzer (1999), the sales to employment ratio should be regarded as
a proxy for labor productivity since revenue is divided by employment rather than hours, and the GDP deflator is
used rather than the appropriate firm specific price deflator. Variation in hours per worker may vary
systematically across types of businesses because of, for example, the use of part-time workers – by controlling
for 4-digit effects we have abstracted from differences in hours per worker across 4-digit industries. Still, one
could easily imagine that within the same narrowly defined industry that some businesses have chosen to use
part-time workers more intensively than others – thus, one of the sources of between business variation we may
be capturing is this type of variation in the choice of the role of part-time workers.
18
    Each of these restrictions is somewhat severe in terms of losing observations. The Maryland UI data
identifies firms with a state-specific identifier, whereas the SSEL identifies firms with a federal identifier.
We have the crosswalk between these two identifiers for 1988 Q1 and 1992 Q1. This implies that all births
after 1992 Q1 and all deaths before 1988 Q1 will not be in the merged dataset Because the sales data in the
SSEL is reported at the EIN level rather than the establishment level, and because most births are single
establishment births, we have chosen to delete multi-establishment companies from our analysis.
                                                                                                    23




entering establishments are single unit firms and thus we have the set of firms that dominate entry

dynamics. Because of concerns about partial year data, we delete observations from 1985 and 1997

and we delete observations in the year of birth and the year of death. We further restrict our data to

firms not in the agriculture and public administration industries, and we delete observations in the top

and bottom 1% of the productivity and earnings distributions.

        Since the focus of the paper is on the evolution and selection of newly-born firms, we create

several analytical datasets. The first dataset consists of a balanced panel of firms that exist every year

1985-1997. There are 22,420 of these firms, with full information available in 116,461 employer-

year observations (sales data are missing in the SSEL in 1988, 1989, 1990 and1993; sales data are, on

average, missing for 32 percent of single establishments in the other years) The average firm in the

balanced panel has 11.9 employees. This balanced panel is the sample of mature firms from which we

estimate the β coefficients in the JMP decompositions. The data in Figure 1 are from this balanced

panel. The second dataset consists of firms born within the 1985-1990 period; we restrict on births in

these years so we can observe their growth and survival during their initial six years of life. There are

20,338 such births, contributing 48,664 employer-year observations. Of these births, 14,722 survive

for at least six years, and these successful births contribute 39,981 employer-year observations.

7. Basic Patterns in the Relationship between Productivity, Earnings, and Worker Mix

         Table 2 presents very basic regressions relating productivity, earnings, and worker mix. The

regressions in table 2 use the simple specification described in section 5 to relate firm-level outcomes

to the characteristics of the workers employed by the firm. We find that firms in our data have higher

measures of labor productivity and earnings if they have workforces with a higher fraction of foreign

born workers, a lower fraction of female workers, a higher fraction of prime age workers, and a higher
                                                                                                             24




fraction of more educated workers.19 Many of these coefficients are statistically significant. While the

estimates vary somewhat across the age of businesses (which our theoretical arguments suggest should

happen), the slopes of the productivity and wage profiles with respect to worker characteristics appear

to be qualitatively similar across businesses of different ages.

         It is tempting of course to compare the magnitudes of the coefficients in the productivity and

earnings regressions and draw inferences regarding the extent to which different workers are being

paid their marginal products.20 For example, it appears that increasing the percentage of highly

educated workers raises earnings per worker more than output per worker. Our discussion of the

simple theoretical model in section 4 cautions against interpreting such interesting findings as

implying that, in this case, highly educated workers are being paid more than their marginal products.

Our theory and evidence presented above suggests that, amongst other things, there are inherently

unobserved factors “k” that may influence productivity and wages differentially. These factors are

likely to be correlated with our measures of worker characteristics and as such, it is important to

interpret the coefficients in Table 2 as reflecting the empirical covariances between productivity,

earnings, and worker characteristics. Along related lines, the resolution of uncertainty may have




19
    Haltiwanger, Lane, and Spletzer (1999) note that the female coefficient in these regressions requires
special interpretation. Because we are using employment rather than hours in the denominator of the
productivity and the earnings variables, these coefficients might be biased downward if the propensity to
work part-time is greater for females. More generally of course, there may be many factors that influence
the productivity and earnings effects that are outside the scope of the type of theoretical considerations we
have discussed. Rather than take on those issues directly here, we take the approach here that we are
interested in the connection between productivity, earnings, and a variety of different indicators of worker
mix. It would be of interest to consider the respective contribution (and the associated interpretation) of
each of the indicators we have separately.
20
    For example, Hellerstein, Neumark and Troske (1999) present analysis that compares slopes of similarly
specified earnings and productivity profiles in order to examine questions of discrimination. As they carefully
show there are important issues of functional forms that can influence tests of the productivity versus earnings
differentials. Since such tests are not the focus of our analysis we do not attempt to investigate the sensitivity to
functional form issues in the same manner.
                                                                                                            25




differential impacts on wages and productivity so that the slopes of the estimated profiles for young

businesses have additional sources of possible differences between the profiles.21

         While some caution is called for, it is also the case that it is interesting to compare the

coefficients – especially since we are interested in using the patterns in these coefficients in empirical

exercises that follow. The last columns on the right of Table 2 report differences in the coefficients for

each of the respective worker characteristic variables and a test of statistical significance. For the

balanced panel, we find that the coefficient in the productivity equation is less than that in the wage

equation for foreign born, older and more educated workers. Again, for the balanced panel, we find

that the coefficient in the productivity equation is greater than that in the wage equation for female,

younger and less educated workers. All of these differences are statistically significant. For the

younger businesses, the pattern of the difference in coefficients is roughly similar but somewhat more

erratic and less statistically significant. An interesting aspect of these findings is that whatever factors

are driving the differences in the productivity and earnings coefficients are apparently more important

for well-established businesses. Since uncertainty would presumably be less important for mature

businesses, this suggests that the wedge between productivity and wages for mature businesses must

be driven by other factors.

         While the inherently difficult to measure or observe components of “k” make some inferences

difficult (like interpreting slope comparisons), recall that our theory offers predictions about how the


21
   It is true that we have some reasonable conjectures about the nature of the biases induced by unobservable
“k” for particular specifications. For example, consider the example sketched out in section 4 but abstracting
from uncertainty (Figure 4). In that example, we abstracted from rent sharing and internal labor market
considerations and thus k only influences wages indirectly via s while k influences productivity both directly and
indirectly via s. In addition, in that example the production process exhibited k-skill complementarity so higher
k yielded higher s. Under this scenario, the “bias” in the coefficient on s in the productivity equation abstracting
from uncertainty should be positive – that is, the coefficient should reflect both the direct impact of s on
productivity and the fact that s should have a positive covariance with k and k is unobservable and thus not
included in the empirical specification. The implication is that under this strict specification (abstracting from
both uncertainty and rent sharing considerations), the estimated coefficient on s in the productivity equation
should exceed the analogous coefficients in the wage equation. The results in Table 2 tend to reject this strict
specification (abstracting from uncertainty with no rent sharing and internal labor market considerations, etc.)
since the coefficients on “s” for wages tend to exceed those for productivity.
                                                                                                          26




nature of these covariances should evolve over the life cycle of a business and moreover how the

worker characteristics should evolve over the life cycle. It is the latter predictions that we can analyze

even without measures of “k” and it is these predictions that we investigate in the analysis that

follows.22

8. Empirical Analysis

8A. Learning: Changes in Productivity and Earnings

         We now investigate the evidence for and the consequences of firms learning about their type.

Our interest here is to characterize the overall nature of dispersion of productivity and earnings, its

evolution over time, and decompose the sources of its change.

         Using our sample of successful births, the productivity and earnings dynamics are given in

table 3. 23 An examination of Table 3 demonstrates that successful births exhibit systematic changes in

the mean and variance of productivity and earnings during their first six years: as the firm ages, the

mean productivity falls, the mean earnings rises, and the standard deviation of both productivity and

earnings falls.24


22
    There are some other possible strategies to deal with “k”. For example, in section 3, we provide some
exploratory analysis of potential observable indicators of “k”. However, as noted in the analysis in that section,
it appears that there are important unobservable components of “k”. Note that in addition to trying to measure
“k” directly, it would be possible to exploit the panel nature of the data for continuing businesses to attempt to
abstract from the influence of “k” using fixed effect techniques. We plan on pursuing these ideas in future
research.
23
    In all of the forthcoming analysis in tables 3-6, all data have year and four digit industry means removed.
24
    One hypothesis of the falling dispersion of earnings and productivity is that it simply reflects a statistical
artifact due to successful businesses growing under the accompanying hypothesis of a random assignment of
heterogeneous workers across businesses. That is, suppose that workers are heterogeneous in terms of
productivity and are paid their marginal products but workers are just randomly assigned to businesses.
Moreover, suppose that new businesses grow. Then, for a sample of new businesses that grow, the businesses
will exhibit falling dispersion in earnings and productivity as businesses will inherently become more
statistically similar as they grow. While we think the evidence is overwhelmingly against the hypothesis of
random assignment of workers, we nevertheless conducted some further robustness checks since some elements
of this statistical artifact hypothesis might operate even without complete random assignment as it is true that
new successful businesses exhibit positive growth (on average). In particular, we examined the patterns of
change in productivity and earnings dispersion for alternative groups of successful businesses. One check we
made was based upon initial size – we classified businesses into quartiles based upon initial size. We found that
the pattern of falling dispersion holds even more strongly for businesses in the top quartile as for the bottom
quartile of initial size. This evidence does not support the statistical artifact hypothesis since this hypothesis
                                                                                                             27




         The JMP decompositions of the sources of changes in the declining productivity and earnings

dispersion are presented in the top two panels of table 4. We find that changes in the distribution of

worker characteristics and the differentials associated with those characteristics account for a modest

fraction of the falling dispersion in productivity and a substantial fraction of the falling dispersion in

wages.25 Specifically, changes in the distribution of worker characteristics account for 3% of the

decline in the 90-10 ratio of productivity during the first six years, and changes in the differentials

(i.e., estimated regression coefficients) account for 5% of this decline. Changes in the distribution of

worker characteristics account for 34% of the decline in the 90-10 ratio of earnings during the first six

years, and changes in the differentials account for 43% of this decline. This implies that 92% of the

declining productivity dispersion is due to unobservables, whereas 22% of the declining earnings

dispersion is due to unobservables. In terms of the simpler intermediate decomposition in equation

(6), these results suggest that only 3% of the decline in productivity dispersion can be interpreted as

arising from reduced dispersion in worker mix and only 34% of the decline in earnings dispersion can

be interpreted to reduced dispersion in worker mix. The vast majority of the decline is associated with

changing deviations from the long run earnings/worker mix profile (i.e., residuals).


should be of particular relevance for the smallest businesses. Second, we classified new businesses into growth
rate quartiles based upon growth over the first six years of existence. We found that the pattern of falling
dispersion holds for all growth rate quartiles – moreover, the lowest quartile has strong negative growth while
the top quartile has strong positive growth. It is true that the quantitative decrease in dispersion is somewhat
greater for the growth rate group in the top quartile. However, under pure random assignment, we should
actually see dispersion rising for the lowest quartile group (as they are getting smaller) and dispersion falling for
the highest quartile group. Our interpretation of these robustness checks is that the falling dispersion in
productivity and earnings is not being driven by this statistical artifact hypothesis. Moreover, the other evidence
we have presented does not support random assignment. Such evidence includes the finding of persistent
heterogeneity amongst mature businesses in earnings, productivity and worker mix and the finding of rising
mean earnings and falling mean productivity amongst new businesses.
25
    Recall that the ordering in the JMP decomposition does not impact the contribution of the unobservables so
the combined contribution of changes in worker characteristics and differentials is robust to ordering as well.
When we change the ordering placing the contribution of the changing differentials prior to changes in the
characteristics, we largely get the same patterns as reported in Table 4. There is a modest increase in the
contribution of changes in the distribution of characteristics but we still find that changes in the distribution of
characteristics matter a lot for earnings but not for productivity. We also find that changes in the differentials
still contribute substantially for earnings but not for productivity (actually they modestly go the “wrong” way).
                                                                                                        28




         How do these decomposition results fit with the predictions of the learning model? There are

several facets of the results that we discuss in turn and, in so doing, it is important to recall that some

of the predictions of the model depend on the assumptions regarding the initial distribution of beliefs.

One prediction of the model that does not depend upon the latter is that we should observe a reduction

in the overall dispersion of residuals from the long run profile. We observe that this prediction holds

for both productivity and wages. With regard to other predictions, the declining overall dispersion of

productivity and earnings is, at first glance, consistent with the assumption that the variance of initial

beliefs about type exceeds the variance of true types so that learning yields falling dispersion in

productivity, earnings, and worker mix as firms age. However, the weak contribution of changes in

the distribution of worker characteristics raises doubts that the falling overall dispersion in

productivity is due to businesses having an initial dispersion of beliefs about type that exceeded the

true dispersion in types. It is also the case that the changes in dispersion resulting from worker mix

effects are not supportive of the hypothesis that all firms had common (identical) initial beliefs at

entry.

         It is interesting that changes in the distribution of worker characteristics account for a greater

fraction of the changes in dispersion of earnings than productivity. This finding is consistent with the

prediction that deviations from the long run profile are less likely to be important in accounting for

changes in earnings dispersion. The reason is that mistakes about “k” may only (or primarily) have an

impact on changes in earnings dispersion through changes in the workforce mix while these same

mistakes imply a falling contribution of deviations from the long run profile for productivity. We also

know, however, from Table 2 that, if anything, the slope of the earnings/skill mix profile is steeper

than the productivity/skill mix profile. Thus, any change in the distribution of worker characteristics

will have a larger impact on earnings dispersion than on productivity dispersion.


We focus on the ordering in Table 4 in the text because this ordering provides the most straightforward evidence
on the contribution of changes in the distribution of worker characteristics.
                                                                                                          29




        We also find that changes in the slopes of the earnings and productivity profiles tend to

decrease rather than increase dispersion – although the contribution of changing slopes for

productivity is very small. The implied flattening of the schedules is consistent with the hypothesis

that firms had similar or common initial beliefs that led to a steeper initial profile than the long run

profile. However, since the changes in slope matter mostly for earnings, it may be (as we will discuss

further below) that there are other factors contributing to the earnings dynamics beyond the learning

effects emphasized in our model. If, for example, the propensity for rent sharing increases over the

lifetime of a business, this could potentially yield a weaker relationship between earnings and

characteristics as a business ages. Moreover, for earnings, taken together the contribution of changes

in the distribution of worker characteristics and changes in the differentials associated with those

characteristics work in the “wrong” way for the changes in earnings dispersion to be entirely driven by

learning effects. That is, the changes due to distribution of worker characteristics suggest that initially

var(K)>var(k) while the changes due to differentials suggest that initially var(K)<var(k). In short,

there are some interesting dynamics for young businesses involving the interaction of changing worker

characteristics and earnings differentials associated with those characteristics that appear to involve

factors other than learning.

        The results in Table 3 also show that mean productivity falls and mean earnings rises during

the first six years of the successful birth's lifecycle. This difference in trends is, at first glance,

somewhat puzzling since our model suggests that average earnings also captures some portion of

average productivity, and thus mean earnings and mean productivity should move in the same

direction. To further investigate this divergence, we present results from a JMP decomposition on the

means in the bottom two panels of table 4. We find that changes in worker mix alone during the first

six years would lead to falling mean earnings and falling mean productivity, and changes in the

regression coefficients would account for a relatively small increase in both means. Therefore, the

opposite trends we observe are primarily accounted for by changes in unobservable characteristics.

       There could be a number of explanations for why unobservable factors explain the different

trends in mean productivity and earnings. The decline in mean productivity might reflect mean-

reverting tendencies for successful firms to have high initial draws of productivity (that is, high θ

shocks). The increase in mean earnings might reflect an increasing share of rents as a business ages –

in terms of the simple descriptive model, it may be that the rent sharing fraction (δ) increases with the

age of the business. We do not have a formal explanation of why rent sharing would vary in this

systematic way – however; it seems plausible that survival probabilities are related to the ability to

enter with low initial wages and implicit commitments of higher future wages upon success (i.e.,

survival). A related possibility is that the productivity and earnings measures may capture different

dimensions of entrepreneurial effort that are important in the first few years of a business’s existence.

It is possible that entrepreneurs put in long hours at the birth of a business and pay themselves very

little salary, reversing this pattern as the business ages. This would be consistent with a falling mean

sales-per-worker ratio and an increasing mean earnings-per-worker ratio. We believe that

investigating the robustness of and the explanations for the opposite trends of mean earnings and mean

productivity is an interesting area for future research.

        To sum up, there are striking and systematic changes in the mean and dispersion of

productivity and earnings per worker in the first several years after the birth of a cohort of firms.

Some of these patterns (in particular, the reduced dispersion from deviations from long run profiles)

are clearly consistent with the hypothesized effects of learning. There are, however, significant

differences in the patterns of the findings across productivity and earnings. These differences are not

inconsistent with learning effects per se but do suggest, especially for earnings, that other factors are

playing a role in the evolution of the relationship between earnings per worker and worker

characteristics. Perhaps this is not surprising as firm-specific components of earnings determination
                                                                                                           31




are likely to evolve over the life cycle of new businesses and to vary with worker characteristics as

well.

8B. Learning: Changes in Worker Mix

         In this part of the empirical analysis, we are interested in describing how firms adjust their

workforce in response to their initial errors in knowing their type. The theory predicts that firms with

positive surprises in initial productivity are more likely to have underestimated k and will exhibit

increases in skill, and firms with negative surprises in initial productivity are more likely to have

overestimated k and will exhibit decreases in skill. The dependent variable we use to measure changes

in skill is a change in a skill index from the second year to the sixth year for a successful entrant

(measured formally as (X6-X2) β , where Xt is the vector of workforce composition variables in the tth

year after birth, and β is the vector of regression coefficients estimated from the balanced panel from

the productivity regression on worker characteristics).26 We measure the change in skill between years

2 and 6 to avoid problems with measures of initial year productivity as explanatory variables in the

regression.

         In column 1 of table 5, we regress the change in the productivity skill index on the firm's

initial productivity error. We find that those firms with positive errors (such as firm 1 in figure 5 that

underestimated its k) tend to increase their skill mix, and those firms with negative errors (such as firm

3 in figure 3 that overestimated its k) tend to decrease their skill mix. To see whether this result might

be driven by regression to the mean effects, we control for the initial worker skill mix by including the

initial predicted productivity in column 2.27 The coefficient on the initial error is reduced somewhat


26
   We have also replicated the analysis in Table 4 using the earnings specification. We find qualitatively similar
results although they are somewhat less strong and estimated less precisely. Part of the reason for this is that the
implications for responses to “errors” may not carry over to earnings. In the absence of rent sharing, there is no
sense in which the gap between actual and predicted earnings reflects an error.
27
   Of course, learning is a potential source of regression to the mean effects but there may be other factors
generating regression to the mean effects in the worker mix. By controlling for initial worker mix, we abstract
from such factors and focus on the impact of the “error” made in the choice of worker mix.
                                                                                                           32




but remains positive and statistically significant. Finally, in column 3, using indicator variables for

whether the firm's initial error is in the top or bottom third of the error distribution, we find that the

largest changes in skill are from firms in the bottom third of the error distribution decreasing their skill

levels.

          We interpret these results as saying that the initial error in choosing skill level has important

empirical content. This is consistent with the view that new firms systematically experiment with their

mix of workers as they learn about their type.

8C. Selection

          As discussed earlier, our theory has specific predictions about both selection and learning.

With regard to selection, we present simple OLS death regressions in Table 6. For each cohort of

entering businesses, we define an indicator variable that is equal to one if the business does not survive

within the first six years and zero otherwise. In the first column, we regress this indicator of death

within the first six years on the firm's actual productivity in its first year. We find that the firms with

initially low productivity are more likely to exit. This is in keeping with the theoretical predictions,

where we expect that firms with lower levels of initial productivity are more likely to be close to the

marginal firm (i.e., close to the fixed cost threshold at which exit is optimal).28

          In keeping with the theoretical analysis, and with the visual depiction in Figures 4 and 5, we

decompose actual productivity into two parts: the component that is on the long run productivity/skills

locus, and the residual. The former is where the firm expects to be given its chosen skill mix, and the

latter is what we term the firm's error in identifying its type. In addition to the predicted component


28
   This result is mirrored in a death regression that uses earnings instead of productivity: we find that firms with
low initial earnings are likely to exit. At first glance, this result might seem counter-intuitive: one would expect
that all else equal, firms with lower earnings would have higher expected profits and thus be more likely to
survive. One explanation for this finding is that low earnings reflects low skill, and skill is chosen based upon
the firm's expectation of type. Indeed, in the model, wages w(s) are equal to [(1-δ)ω(s)+δ{θf(k,s)-F}], and in the
presence of rent sharing (δ>0), wages are a function of k and thus become an alternative measure of productivity.
When we estimate a death regression with actual productivity and actual earnings as explanatory variables, both
                                                                                                           33




signaling the firm's belief about its type k, we expect firms that make optimistic errors about k will

exhibit negative productivity errors, which leads to firms learning that they are lower k and therefore a

greater likelihood of exit. These hypotheses are empirically valid: the coefficients in column 2 are

negative and statistically significant. Interestingly, the coefficient on the predicted component of

productivity is substantially larger in magnitude than the coefficient on the error component. One

interpretation for this result is that the observed worker mix is a good proxy for type and thus a good

predictor for productivity, whereas the error is a noisy predictor of type (as it should be) but

nevertheless has predictive power in terms of predicting survival.

         We now extend the analysis to examine whether there are asymmetries in how various parts of

the distributions of the predicted and error components of initial productivity influence exit. In

column 3 of table 6, we find that firms that choose worker characteristics that map into the lower third

of the predicted productivity distribution are more likely to exit. Consistent with our prediction that

overly optimistic mistakes about type matter for survival, we find that firms with errors in the lower

third of that distribution are more likely to exit. However, we find that firms with errors in the upper

third of that distribution are not less likely to exit. Thus, there is an interesting asymmetry in the

response to errors.

         This interesting asymmetry is outside the scope of the simple selection model we have

sketched. The latter predicts that firms with negative errors should be more likely to exit and firms

with positive errors should be less likely to exit. We find that it is only negative errors that matter

here. A potential explanation for this finding (outside of the model we have sketched) is that negative

errors have a direct impact on productivity and profitability. That is, the mismatch between type and

worker mix may have direct adverse consequences, particularly for those that are overly optimistic. It

will also be the case that overly optimistic firms will be paying the higher wages that go along with the


come in with statistically significant negative coefficients. We interpret this to mean that both earnings and
productivity are noisy measures of underlying firm type.
                                                                                                  34




higher skill mix. It seems plausible that firms with such a mismatch problem might find themselves in

difficulty and be more likely to exit.

9. Concluding Remarks

        We began this study by exploiting a rich new employer-employee dataset to find substantial

and persistent differences in earnings per worker, output per worker, and worker mix across businesses

within narrowly defined industries. We found that these remained even after controlling for other

observable characteristics. We argued that these were all manifestations of the same underlying

dynamic: the type of firm that generated these differences. We sketched a model in which businesses

deliberately choose different worker mixes because of differences in their types and productivity

interactions (e.g., k-skill complementarity) between the type of business and the mix of workers.

Following the industrial organization literature, we posited that businesses learn about their types over

time so there is churning and evolution of the worker mix at businesses and this is related to the

observed earnings and productivity dynamics. In order to understand the dynamics underlying the

choice of workforce composition, our empirical analysis focused on the productivity and earnings

dynamics of young businesses.

        We found that, at entry, successful (i.e., surviving) new businesses exhibit substantially higher

than industry-average productivity and substantially lower than industry-average earnings per worker

– interestingly, however, as the business ages there is convergence between productivity and earnings.

        We also found that new businesses exhibit even greater heterogeneity in earnings and

productivity than do mature businesses, but that two factors contribute to the lower earnings dispersion

of mature businesses. First, new firms learn to adjust their workforce composition as they age.

Second, new firms with low initial productivity, or that make initial mistakes about their type

(particularly those that are overly optimistic), are more likely to exit.

        These results on earnings and productivity dynamics are of interest in their own right but our

focus has been to examine the contribution of the choice and evolution of worker mix to these
                                                                                                    35




dynamics. When we did this, we found that unobservable factors dominate the observed changes in

the distribution of productivity - consistent with the learning model. However, the failure of worker

characteristics to account for much of the considerable decline in productivity dispersion is somewhat

puzzling.

        The results for changes in earnings dispersion are quite different on some dimensions. As

with productivity, overall dispersion fell and changes in the distribution of unobservable factors

contributes substantially to this decline. Here, however, changes in the distribution of worker

characteristics and changes in the differentials associated with those characteristics play a substantial

role. The importance of worker characteristics is potentially consistent with the theory, given the

uncertainty about firm type. However learning does not explain why both workforce mix adjustment

and adjustment in differentials act to reduce earnings dispersion. In addition, the substantial

differences in the adjustment process for earnings and productivity suggest that some other factors are

playing a role in the interaction between earnings and worker characteristics for young businesses.

        In sum, this paper extends a very basic result from the empirical industrial organization

literature – namely that learning and selection effects matter for firm dynamics – to the labor

economics literature in showing that this experimentation process involves the choice of worker mix in

both the selection and the learning process. Put differently, new firms struggle to find their way in

deciding how to undertake production and run a business – some do not succeed and fail while others

learn and prosper. In this sense, our results, although derived from a new dataset, are very consistent

with both the rich empirical literature documenting marked differences in firm behavior within

industries, and the explicit theoretical understanding of the impact of different initial endowments –

like managerial skill, physical and organizational capital – on firm outcomes.

        There are clearly aspects of the results that require further research. A particularly interesting

result is investigating the contribution of rent sharing and internal labor market considerations to the

different dynamics between average earnings and productivity as firms age. In addition, it would be
                                                                                                    36




useful to investigate the interaction between different types of k and different sets of worker

characteristics on earnings and productivity. A question that we do not directly address but which is

equally interesting is the impact of these firm dynamics on workers. In particular, we know that the

types of firms which are more likely to exit are those which are low productivity, with a low level of

workforce skill. We also know from the recent literature that this entry and exit plays an important

role in productivity growth, yet that the effects of involuntary job loss can be large and persistent, at

least for long tenure mature workers. Quantifying and understanding the potential economy wide

gains in productivity from this process of creative destruction and adjustment via the costs borne by

workers should be an important area for future research.
