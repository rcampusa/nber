                                             ABSTRACT

Our analysis seeks to understand the impact of changing allocations of property rights on investment
in new firms. We focus on the Cartoon Network, et al. v. Cablevision decision in the U.S., which narrowed
the protection enjoyed by content creators (e.g., movie studios) and gave greater rights to downstream
technology firms, as well as decisions in France and Germany that took an opposite view. Our findings
regarding relative venture capital investment in the U.S. and Europe, across Europe, and between the
various judicial circuits of the U.S. suggest that decisions around the allocation of property rights can
have economically and statistically significant impacts on investment in innovative enterprises.

1.   Introduction
     The ways in which the strength and allocation of property rights can affect investment

decisions have been an enduring topic of interest (e.g., La Porta et al. [2000], Acemoglu [2003]).

The consequences of property rights are particularly critical when evaluating intellectual

property policies. An extensive theoretical literature suggests that shifts in the design of such

property right schemes—in particular, the relative protection offered to initial innovators and

those who do follow-on work—can have dramatic impacts on the rate and direction of

technological progress. For instance, if all the rewards go to the initial innovators, other firms are

unlikely to be able to access resources for follow-on innovations (e.g., Gilbert and Shapiro

[1990]; Scotchmer [2004]; Hopenhayn, et al. [2006]; and, Boldrin and Levine [2008]).

     The empirical literature on the impact of changes in the nature of property rights on the

ability to finance innovation, however, remains inconclusive (see, for instance, Sakakibara and

Branstetter [2001]; Branstetter, et al. [2006]; and, Lerner [2009]). Many of the difficulties stem

from the difficulties of identifying appropriate “natural experiments.” Legislation altering

intellectual property rights is often undertaken in conjunction with other policy reforms or in

response to shifting economic circumstances. Moreover, empirical studies to date have largely

focused on the patent regime: given the long lag times between discoveries and commercial

application in many technical fields, identifying what effects may exist empirically can be

especially challenging.

     The shorter time lags between the production and dissemination of creative activities and

software suggest that examining the impacts of copyright law may be more promising. From a

more practical perspective, the consequences of shifting copyright protection remains intensely




                                                                                                     1
partisan, given the intensity of real world controversies about the Digital Millennium Copyright

Act and the proposed Stop Online Piracy Act.

     This paper examines the effect of major but largely unanticipated changes in the allocation

of copyright protection on venture capital (VC) investment in cloud computing companies. In

particular, it examines the impact of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals’ decision The Cartoon

Network, et al. v. Cablevision, which was widely perceived as enhancing the property rights of

cloud computing companies relative to the content owners such as major movie studios and

publishers, a claim backed by an event study of cloud-computing firms. Meanwhile, decisions in

French and German courts took substantially narrower views of these firms’ property rights.

     We focus on the impact of these decisions on VC investment because venture activity is

well documented, and has been shown to have a positive impact on growth and innovation. Thus,

while VC represents only a fraction of total investment in this industry, it is a natural setting for

understanding the impact of policy shifts.

     To understand the impact of copyright protection changes on the willingness of venture

capitalists to invest in cloud computing, we employ a difference-in-difference approach,

hypothesizing that policy shifts affect investments in different geographies, sectors, and years in

varying ways. Such analyses have been widely employed in the economics literature to examine

the consequences of policy shifts.

     To quantify the impact of copyright protection changes, we first analyze the effects on VC

investment in cloud computing firms of the Cablevision decision in the U.S., which narrowed the

protection enjoyed by content creators (e.g., movie studios) and gave greater rights to

downstream technology firms using this content. We anticipate that the decision eased investors’

fears about litigation entangling innovative cloud computing firms, resulting in greater



                                                                                                        2
investments. We find that VC investment in cloud computing firms increased significantly in the

U.S. relative to the EU after the Cablevision decision, particularly in the geographies and sectors

most affected by the decision. The Cablevision decision, along with court rulings in France and

Germany, led to additional incremental investment in U.S. cloud computing firms that ranged

from $728 million to approximately $1.3 billion over the two-and-a-half years after the decision.

     We then examine court rulings in France and Germany, which were perceived as moving in

the opposite direction. We look at VC investment in cloud computing firms in these countries

relative to that in other EU nations. We find that these rulings regarding the nature of copyright

protection had significant negative impacts on investment. Specifically, we find that VC

investment in cloud computing firms declined in Germany and France, relative to the rest of the

EU, after the French and German rulings.

     Taken together, our findings suggest that shifts in the allocation of property rights can have

significant impacts on investment in innovative enterprises. The findings suggest that strong

upstream intellectual property rights, when combined with seeming large transaction costs that

deterred licensing, may block investment in innovative downstream technologies. At the same

time, we must acknowledge that this is a partial equilibrium analysis, which does not allow us to

assess social welfare. For instance, these decisions may have had different effects on the

willingness of incumbent firms to invest, as well as the impact on the development of new

creative works.

     The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 justifies the use of venture

financing as an indicator, and provides background on the Cablevision decision in the U.S. as

well as on the French and German court rulings. Section 3 discusses the data used in our

analyses, Section 4 presents our results from the analysis of the Cablevision decision, and



                                                                                                     3
Section 5 presents our results from the analysis of the French and German rulings. Section 6

concludes the paper.


2.   Background
2.1. Venture Financing as an Indicator

     VC investment is an attractive measurement for several reasons.

     The first rationale related to the practical nature of this measure for researchers. Venture

financing is well documented, because of the presence of institutional investors who report the

activities and performance of the funds in which they invest important due to data services such

as those operated by Dow Jones and Thomson Reuters. Moreover, venture capitalists tend to

fund young firms in well-defined areas, allowing a detailed mapping of funding by technological

area. This specificity is in contrast to large corporations, who often report an aggregate R&D or

those for broad lines of business.

     Second, there is a well-documented relationship between venture capital funding,

innovation and job growth. Hellmann and Puri [2000] examine a sample of 170 recently formed

firms in Silicon Valley, including both venture-backed and non-venture-backed firms, and find

that VC financing is related to more innovative product market strategies and a significant

reduction in the time taken to bring a product to market. Kortum and Lerner [2000] examine the

relationship between venture financing and innovation at an aggregate industry level. Exploiting

the clarification the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the U.S. Department of Labor in

the late 1970s, a policy shift that freed pensions to invest in venture capital, they show that, even

after addressing causality concerns, venture funding has a strong positive impact on innovation.

Puri and Zarutskie [2010] compare the evolution of venture-backed and non-venture-backed




                                                                                                    4
firms using the records of the U.S. Census’s Longitudinal Business Database, and find very rapid

employment growth in venture-financed firms relative to non-venture-financed firms.

2.2. The U.S. Litigation: The Cartoon Network, et al. v. Cablevision

      Section 4 focuses on a key juncture in copyright policy in the United States: the 2008

appellate decision in The Cartoon Network, et al. v. Cablevision.3 It will compare VC investment

in cloud computing in the U.S. against that in the EU (where the decision did not have bearing)

both before and after the Cablevision decision by employing a differences-in-differences

approach.

        In 2006, Cablevision announced the development of a Remote Storage Digital Video

Recorder (RS-DVR). Similar in operation to a traditional recorder, the Cablevision RS-DVRs

allow customers to record, pause, and replay television content on a hard drive. Unlike

traditional DVRs, however, in which a consumer installs and uses an appliance in their own

home, the Cablevision RS-DVR was located remotely, recording to and playing back from

remote servers. When a consumer hit the “record” button on their remote, the RS-DVR would

start to record, just as if that RS-DVR were right in their living room. In response, a consortium

of U.S. television and copyright holders filed a complaint against Cablevision in May 2006 over

alleged copyright infringement.

      In March 2007, the District Court declared a summary judgment against Cablevision.4 As

the appellate court subsequently narrated:

        [P]laintiffs successfully argued that Cablevision’s proposed system would directly
        infringe their copyrights in three ways. First, by briefly storing data in the primary
        ingest buffer and other data buffers integral to the function of the RS-DVR,

    yet to be resolved.

        Cablevision would make copies of protected works and thereby directly infringe
        plaintiffs’ exclusive right of reproduction under the Copyright Act. Second, by
        copying programs onto … hard disks …, Cablevision would again directly
        infringe the reproduction right. And third, by transmitting the data … to …
        customers in response to a “playback” request, Cablevision would directly
        infringe plaintiffs’ exclusive right of public performance.5


      This decision attracted relatively little attention from the media and blogs, in large part

because it was consistent with a series of earlier rulings that restricted the ability of third parties

to distribute copyrighted material without authorization. For instance, in a 1991 case which

anticipated many of the issues in the Cablevision case, a district ruled in favor of seven major

movie companies in a dispute with a firm that developed a system for the electronic delivery of

movie video tapes.6 Despite the fact that the firm, On Command, had legally purchased the

videotapes that it transmitted to hotel guests, the court found that the firm’s system infringed the

studio’s copyrights because it electronically transmitted the movies to hotel rooms (as opposed

as physically renting the cassettes).

      In August 2008, the District Court decision in Cablevision was reversed on appeal by the

Second Circuit Court of Appeals.7 The Circuit Court held that Cablevision's RS-DVR system did

not infringe the plaintiffs’ rights of reproduction and public performance on any of the three

claimed grounds. The original decision was reversed, vacated, and sent back to be reconsidered

by the lower court. In June 2009, the Supreme Court refused to hear the case, thereby effectively

finalizing the Second Circuit’s decision.

       Because the Supreme Court never heard the appeal, the decision was only binding to the

Second Circuit. But the decision was influential nationally, due to the historical sway that the

circuit as had in copyright cases. As Carter [1991] argues:

            The Second Circuit is widely recognized as the nation's most important copyright
            court. Centered in the capital city of publishing and the arts, and mindful of the
            proud tradition of copyright scholars who have formed its treasure of precedent,
            the court regularly hears appeals raising issues in the forefront of copyright
            developments. The Second Circuit is not shy about its historic leadership role in
            shaping U.S. copyright law.

Moreover, the decision was particularly influential because the Second Circuit has historically

been seen as sympathetic to copyright owners (as opposed to the 9th Circuit, based in San

Francisco, which was seen as more sympathetic to firms seeking to exploit copyrighted

material). The fact that this decision went “against the grain” by limiting the property rights of

the copyright owners in favor of cloud firms lent it particular importance. Perhaps most

importantly, the decision was the first in this area: such decisions are widely understood to have

significant “persuasive authority” in other jurisdictions.8

       Consequentially, at the time of the decision, the ruling was perceived as likely to positively

impact firms focusing on cloud computing. To cite two contemporaneous accounts:

             The Cablevision ruling is good for IT companies moving into cloud computing,
              said Dow Lohnes PLLC attorney James Burger, who represents technology
              companies in IP and content licensing matters. If the court had found
              Cablevision guilty of direct infringement for giving its customers the RS-DVR
              data storage system, system operators storing consumers’ legally acquired
              entertainment media in the internet cloud could have faced the same claims.9
             [A] rule holding Cablevision liable merely because it housed and maintained
              the servers in this case could imperil a wide variety of innovative business
              models that rely on the use of remote computing, ranging from examples like



8
    This may be partially attributed to a “bandwagon effect,” and partially because reach a different outcome would
    create a “circuit split” that invites Supreme Court review, and thus dramatically increases the odds of a reversal
    of the decision, an outcome most judges try hard to avoid.

            Internet-enabled self-service photo processing and printing, to cloud computing
            services offered by companies like Amazon, Apple and Google.10

       Conversations with a number of venture investors suggest that the Cablevision decision led

to increased VC investment in cloud computing in the U.S. relative to other counties where no

comparable shift of copyright protection occurred.11 Prior to this decision, venture investors

feared that record labels, movie studies, and other content owners might sure cloud-computing

start-ups for copyright infringement, based on their users storing and accessing legally acquired

copies of protected content. Trade associations such as the Recording Industry Association had

made substantial investments in ferreting out infringing materials on platforms such as Pirate

Bay, and the investors feared that the start-ups could readily get caught up in litigation with

content owners. These concerns were exacerbated by the experience of investors in Napster. The

firm’s corporate and independent venture investors were sued by major recording companies,

who argued that the investors were liable for copyright infringement because they had effective

control of Napster. After the federal courts refused to dismiss the claims, the investors settled the

case in 2006 and 2007, collectively making what has been estimated to be a nine-figure sum

[Ottaviani, 2007]. As Ottaviani [2007] noted,

         The decision caused a great deal of discomfort among those firms, in the private
         equity community dealing with content distribution companies. Investors were
         forced to review and rethink commonly used structures to control a portfolio
         company, and evaluate whether and how those control structures exposed the
         investors to liability for copyright infringements of the portfolio company.

It might be thought that these startups could obtain licenses from content providers to immunize

themselves from such fears, but the transaction costs of such licensing arrangements, our

     While there have been several copyright cases against online video recording service providers in Europe, we
     are unaware of any that has resolved such substantial uncertainty with respect to reproduction and
     retransmission rights in favor of such service providers as the Cablevision decision has in the U.S.

                                                                                                                    8
informants reported, were prohibitive. The costs reflected both the complexity of the rights

holdings and the suspicion of the intellectual property owners regarding the intentions of

venture-backed firms.

      Two caveats should be noted. First, it is important to note that to the extent that U.S.-based

firms also do business in the rest of the world, or EU firms do business in the U.S., such

international activity will dampen the hypothesized effect since the Internet is affected by both

local and non-local regulations, and thus any estimates of the hypothesized effect are likely to be

conservative. (It should be noted that in many cases foreign courts have deferred to the laws in

which an Internet company is based when ruling on disputes involving these firms (Chander

[2012])).

      Second, the Supreme Court addressed similar issues in June 2014,12 when it reversed an

appellate court decision and concluded that the firm Aereo publicly performs copyrighted works,

in violation of the Copyright Act, when it sells its subscribers a service that allows them to watch

television programs over the Internet at about the same time as the programs are broadcast over

the air. This decision was seen as reintroducing substantial uncertainty into the breadth of

copyright protection [Stoltz, 2014].

2.3. The French Litigation: M6, W9, France Television, TF1, and NT1 v. Wizzgo (2008)

      In Section 5, we will also examine the impact of decisions in the French and German courts

relative to those elsewhere in Europe. In May 2008, Wizzgo launched the first online DVR

platform in France, which allowed users to view recorded copies of programs broadcast on

domestic terrestrial television channels as long as they requested that the show be recorded

before the programs started.13 The copy was a faithful reproduction and included the original

advertising.14 In response, a consortium of French television and copyright holders, including

M6, W9, France Television, TF1, and NT1, filed complaints against Wizzgo over alleged

copyright infringement.

         Wizzgo argued that its technological platform fell under two exceptions in French

copyright law: transience and privacy copying. First, Wizzgo claimed that it provided users with

a temporary and transient copy of a program, and only assisted users in saving private copies.

Second, Wizzgo claimed that each copy of a recorded program was private. In France, copying

copyrighted work strictly for personal use falls under the private copy exception as long as the

copyist and the user of the copy are the same person.15 Throughout August and November 2008,

the Tribunal de Grande Instance de Paris issued a series of injunctions, banning Wizzgo from

using the plaintiffs’ copyrighted works.16 On November 25, 2008, the Tribunal de Grande

Instance de Paris declared the final set of summary judgments against Wizzgo and levied a

fine.17 In response to the court’s ruling and the fine ordered by the court, Wizzgo and similar

companies halted operations.18 Outside sources suggest that the French litigation is likely to have

a negative impact on VC investment and to delay the development of related technology, such as

cloud computing services. For example, a paper by European Digital Rights states that “[t]he

[Wizzgo] case is a relevant example to further corroborate the idea that the current EU copyright

     The Tribunal de Grande Instance issued five summary judgments against Wizzgo: (1) Metropole Television v.

     “The court ordered compensatory damages of more than €440,000 against Wizzgo for copyright infringement,
     which convinced other French online DVR platforms immediately to cease similar services.” (International Law
     Office [February 19, 2009]).

                                                                                                              10
policy hinders technology.”19 Some members of the popular press was similarly disappointed;

for example, one member wrote that “[b]y closing the door to the Wizzgo arguments […] and the

evolution of technology and uses, the French justice system is particularly reactionary and

conservative.”20 Given the view that the French ruling was likely to have a negative impact on

related technologies, it is logical to hypothesize that this ruling would lead to decreased VC

investment in cloud computing in France relative to other counties in the EU.

2.4. The German Litigation: RTL et al. v. Shift.tv and Save.tv

       Shift.tv, founded in 2005, and Save.tv, founded in 2006, are subscription-based services

that allow customers to select and store television content on servers from which users can

download and stream stored programs.21 Online video recording platform service providers

operate sites that facilitate the receipt of TV signals through satellite reception stations, and

transform and store these signals in customer-dedicated server space.22 Customers select the

content to be stored and can download and/or stream the content. In response to the services

offered by these companies, two German television channels, RTL and SAT1, began judicial

action claiming that the services constituted copyright infringement.23

       A German District Court found that both Shift.tv and Save.tv infringed plaintiffs’

reproductions rights by storing and copying the data streams provided by the plaintiffs on servers

for playback by customers, on May 12, 2006 and May 9, 2007, respectively. The Dresden Court

of Appeals ruled against Shift.tv on November 28, 2006, yet in favor of Save.tv on October 9,

2007.24 On April 22, 2009, the Federal Court of Justice repealed both rulings and remanded them

to the Dresden Appeals Court.25 In doing so, the Federal Court of Justice considered the

recording process and ruled on two issues: the right of reproduction and the right of

retransmission. To the court, it was unclear whether Shift.tv and Save.tv recorded broadcasts on

behalf of its users, or if the technology was automatic and users themselves recorded the

programs. If the copying was not automatic, the Federal Court ruled that Shift.tv and Save.tv

would be liable for direct infringement of reproduction rights. Even if the copying was fully

automatic, the defendants could be liable for infringement of the plaintiffs’ retransmission rights

to the public, which are harmed by retransmitting broadcasting signals simultaneously to a large

number of customers.26 Thus, the Federal Court instructed the Appeals Court, on a case-by-case

basis, to rule on whether the reproduction process is automated and to clarify the extent to which

the plaintiffs infringed retransmission rights.27

       In July 2011, the Dresden Appeals Court ruled in favor of Save.tv and found that its online

video recorder did not infringe RTL’s rights of reproduction, though a similar ruling has not been

reached for Shift.tv. The court found that from a technical standpoint, the user initiates an

automated recording process to create a private copy of a television program.28 However, the

court did not resolve the issue of retransmission rights infringement.29 As such, Save.tv requires

a license for retransmission from RTL, yet it has been unable to do obtain such a license.30 Thus,

     VG Media, the German royalty collecting society, refused to grant Save.tv the necessary licenses to operate its
     business, arguing that online video licenses are not covered by its agreement with German broadcasters. (See

                                                                                                                  12
while Save.tv was not found liable of direct infringement, German law has blurred the issue by

neither ruling completely in favor nor completely against companies like Save.tv and Shift.tv.

While Save.tv does not infringe reproduction rights, the German courts have ruled that television

channels can prevent these businesses from operating by refusing to issue licenses for

retransmission.

       While both Save.tv and Shift.tv continue to operate in Germany, outside sources suggest

that the German litigation—by raising questions about the allocation of copyright protection—is

likely to have a negative impact on investment in this and related technologies, such as cloud

computing services. For example, “[a]lthough the Federal Court of Justice referred the case back

to the Court of Appeal, it is already clear that the business model of Internet-based video

recording can be operated legally only with the broadcasters’ prior permission. It is doubtful

whether a service operated on this basis can be profitable.”31 The popular press also reacted

negatively: “[N]ew technology and innovation are impeded by [the 2009 judgment], which

unnecessarily increases the technical deficits of Germany compared to other Internet-nations.”32

As with the French ruling, given the view that the German rulings were likely to have a negative

impact on related technologies, it is logical to hypothesize that these rulings would lead to

decreased VC investment in cloud computing in Germany relative to other counties in the EU.




     IRIS Legal Observations of the European Audiovisual Observatory [2011]). In a November 2010 ruling on the
     dispute, the Appeals Court of Munchen found that “RTL is entitled to prohibit Save.tv from retransmitting its
     programmes.” (See IRIS Legal Observations of the European Audiovisual Observatory [2011]).

2.5.   Event Study Evidence

        One way to validate the impact of these judicial decisions on cloud companies is to

examine the consequences of these decisions on publicly traded cloud-computing companies in

the same country. Inasmuch as the decisions contained unexpected good or bad news, it should

affect their valuation either positively or negatively.

        To undertake such an analysis, we sought to identify publicly traded cloud computing

companies. We identified potential cloud computing firms through Capital IQ, the CloudTimes

“50 Top” [2010] list, IDC analyst reports, and Thomson Reuters VentureXpert. We verified from

CRSP and/or Datastream that the firm was publicly traded at the time of the decisions, and from

securities filings that the firm was active in the cloud computing market at that time. The sample

included companies with active cloud-computing divisions but generated the bulk of their

revenues in other ways (e.g., Amazon) and dedicated cloud-computing firms (e.g., Rackspace).

        It proved to be much more straightforward to undertake this analysis in the United States

than in France and Germany. In the United States, we were able to identify 25 companies that

met our criteria. In Europe, it was much more difficult. For instance, in Germany, following the

same procedure, we could identify only two borderline cases, Deutsche Telekom and SAP,

which were problematic as they appeared to really get involved in cloud computing at a

considerably later date. This paucity of identified firms may reflect the relative thinness of

technology activity in continental Europe in this area, the difficulties that many entrepreneurial

European face in going public, and the poorer representation of technology analysts and reporters

on the continent.

        As a result, we focused our analysis on the U.S. judicial decisions. Because of some

uncertainty of the timing during the day of the release of the decisions, we looked at the

cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) on the day of the decision and the day after (the [0, +1]
                                                                                                 14
window). Because the “pure play” cloud companies were generally smaller in market

capitalization, we focused on equal-weighted returns. For the market-adjusted model, we use a

one-year estimation period, ending two months before the event.

          Table 1 illustrates the key patterns. The March 2007 District Court decision was

associated with negative returns, which was weakly significant in one specification. These results

were consistent with press accounts that suggested that this decision largely corroborated the

received wisdom about the nature of copyright protection, and thus contained limited news. The

August 2008 Second Circuit decision, on the other hand, had a substantial positive effect. Not

only was the absolute magnitude of the effect stronger (a positive CAR of +1.2% and 1.4%), but

the four tests are consistently significant at the 5% confidence level, and in three cases at the 1%

level.


3.       Data
3.1. Venture Capital Funding Data

         In order to examine the differences in how VC investment in cloud companies varies

between the U.S. and EU, and between France and Germany and other EU countries, we

constructed a dataset that draws on historical investment figures captured by VentureXpert.33

VentureXpert is one of the two most widely-used databases of VC investments in the U.S. and

EU.34 It contains data on approximately 1.2 million global private companies and over 25,000

venture, buyout, and mezzanine funds.35




33
     More specifically, the Thomson ONE’s Private Equity module powered by VentureXpert was used.

                                                                                                    15
       The dataset uses all private equity investments in the Thomson database from the beginning

of 1995 through the end of 2010 classified as “Venture Capital Deals”36 involving a portfolio

company with a business description including the term “cloud.” These criteria yielded data on

investments in 280 companies. Independent research identified an additional 216 cloud

computing-related companies,37 59 of which received VC investment from 1995 through 2010

captured in VentureXpert. Seventy-nine companies were removed from the list of 339 (280 + 59)

companies appearing in VentureXpert based upon review of their business descriptions, and 17

were removed for lack of any data on investment amount.38 As a result, the final dataset contains

data on VC investments in 243 cloud computing companies.39

       The unit of observation in the data extracted from VentureXpert is an investment by a

particular VC fund into a particular portfolio company on a particular date. The dataset contains

2,009 observations on investments by 706 distinct funds into the 243 companies on 587 different

dates. These data were then aggregated by calendar quarter of investment date by region (U.S.,

EU, and the rest of the world for the analysis of the Cablevision decision, and France, Germany,

EU, and the rest of Europe for the analysis of the French and German rulings).



36
     Venture capital investments include start-up, seed, and early, expansion, and later stage deals.

38
     Business descriptions from VentureXpert, Bloomberg, the company websites, and news stories were reviewed.
     Companies were excluded if cloud computing did not appear to be a primary part of their business or their
     business appeared to focus on pushing non-user-generated content to from the cloud to users (e.g., security
     updates, games, licensed media content).
39
     In identifying cloud computing companies for our analysis, we carefully reviewed all business descriptions as
     well as, when possible, company websites to ensure that the company was primarily a cloud computing
     company and that the company’s business was one that had the potential to be affected by the rulings in France,
     Germany, and the U.S.

                                                                                                                 16
     Appendix A summarizes the data used in the analysis of the Cablevision decision. As it

shows, total VC investment in the identified U.S. cloud companies from the first quarter of 1995

to the end of 2010 amounted to $5.9 billion. This reflects average quarterly investment of $92.3

million over that time period. In the period immediately preceding the Cablevision ruling (Q1

2006 to Q2 2008), average quarterly investment in U.S. venture-backed cloud companies was

$131.0 million, and subsequent to the ruling, that figure amounted to $184.7 million. Thus,

average quarterly investment in U.S. cloud computing increased by approximately 41 percent

after the Cablevision decision. Appendix A further shows that VC investment in the identified

EU cloud companies from the first quarter of 1995 to the end of 2010 amounted to $242.3

million. This reflects average quarterly investment of $3.8 million over that time period. In the

period immediately preceding the Cablevision ruling (Q1 2006 to Q2 2008), the average

quarterly investment in EU venture-backed cloud companies was $7.0 million, and subsequent to

the ruling, that figure amounted to $8.9 million. Thus, average quarterly investment in EU cloud

computing increased by approximately 27 percent, as compared with 41 percent in the U.S., after

the Cablevision decision.

     Appendix B summarizes the data used in the analysis of the French rulings for three time

periods: (1) the entire period for which data from VentureXpert were obtained (Q1 1995 to Q4

2010), (2) a short period preceding the Wizzgo ruling (Q1 2006 to Q4 2008), and (3) a short

period following the ruling (Q1 2009 to Q4 2010). We focus on relatively short periods around

the ruling to mitigate the bias that could be introduced from long-term investment trends prior to

2006.

     In the period immediately preceding the Wizzgo ruling, there were no VC investments in

French venture-backed cloud companies, and subsequent to the ruling, the average quarterly VC



                                                                                                    17
investment in French cloud companies was $0.45 million. In the EU as a whole,40 for the period

immediately preceding the Wizzgo ruling, the average quarterly VC investment in cloud

companies was $5.9 million. Subsequent to the ruling, the average quarterly VC investment in

EU cloud companies was $9.8 million.

       Appendix C summarizes the data used in the analysis of the German rulings for four time

periods: (1) the entire period for which data from VentureXpert were obtained (Q1 1995 to Q4

2010), (2) a short period preceding the 2006 German District Court ruling (Q1 2004 to Q2 2006),

(3) a short period following the ruling (Q3 2006 to Q4 2008), and (4) a longer period following

the ruling (Q3 2006 to Q4 2010). As with the French ruling, we focus on relatively a short period

around the 2006 German District Court ruling (Q1 2004 to Q4 2008) to isolate the effect of this

ruling as well as the other similar rulings discussed above that occurred in 2006 and 2007. We

also investigate the effect over a longer time period (Q1 2004 to Q4 2010) since the litigation

involving Shift.tv and Safe.tv, to our knowledge, has not yet been completely resolved. Thus,

uncertainty likely exists regarding the viability of certain cloud computing business models in

Germany.

       In the period immediately preceding the 2006 German District Court ruling (Q1 2004 to Q2

2006), there were no investments in German venture-backed cloud companies, while the average

quarterly VC investment in EU cloud companies was $3.5 million. Subsequent to the ruling, for

the shorter period Q3 2006 to Q4 2008, there were also no investments in German venture-

backed cloud companies, while EU cloud computing companies received average quarterly VC

investment of $6.9 million. For the longer period Q3 2006 to Q4 2010, the average quarterly VC

investment in German cloud companies was $0.30 million, while EU cloud computing

companies received average quarterly VC investment of $8.2 million.

3.2. Supplemental Data

       We augment the VC funding data with data on other factors that could influence investors’

decisions to invest in cloud computing specifically, and in other sectors more generally. Such

factors include macroeconomic conditions reflected in gross domestic product (GDP) measures

and the feasibility of cloud computing as measured by broadband penetration.

       Our GDP data are quarterly growth rates of real, seasonally adjusted GDP as a percent

change over the previous quarter from the OECD.41 These data are available for the U.S. from

Q1 1995 through Q2 2011, and for the EU (27 countries), including France and Germany, from

Q2 1995 through Q2 2011.

       Data on broadband penetration, which is equal to the number of broadband subscriptions

per 100 inhabitants, was obtained from the OECD for the U.S. and 21 of the 27 EU member

states from Q2 2002 through Q4 2010.42 To calculate an EU-specific measure of broadband

penetration in each period, the broadband penetration rate of each EU member state was

multiplied by its corresponding annual population to obtain the number of broadband

subscribers. Next, the total number of EU broadband subscribers was obtained by summing over

all EU member states; this total was then divided by the total EU population to obtain an EU-

specific measure of broadband penetration. Finally, quarterly broadband penetration rates were

calculated by linearly interpolating the semi-annual series.

4.   Estimation and Results – The Cablevision Decision
     We first examine whether investment in venture-backed U.S. cloud companies shifted

subsequent to the Q3 2008 Cablevision appeals court ruling. Each of these analyses are variants

of difference-in-difference regression frameworks that rely on historical VC investment in both

the U.S. and EU as controls in order to identify any statistically significant increase in VC

investment in U.S. cloud companies post-Cablevision.

     Our initial set of regression analyses are variants of the following regression model that

accounts for the impact of a variety of factors on quarterly venture-backed investment in the

identified cloud companies:

     VC Ratior,t = β0 + β1(U.S. Indicator)r + β2(Q3 2008 or After Dummy)t + β3(Effect of

                   Cablevision on U.S. VC Investment)r,t +θXr,t+ εr,t.                            (1)

     Specifically, the dependent variable, VC Ratior,t, is VC dollars invested in the cloud

computing companies in region r at quarter t divided by VC dollars invested in all information

technology (IT) companies (including cloud computing) in region r at quarter t. We normalized

our dependent variable this way because the volume of VC activity varies considerably over time

due to factors that are largely exogenous to the issues being studied here. To cite one notable

example, the volume of venture investment fell by almost 90 percent between 2000 and 2002;

this decline was driven primarily by the collapse in the public valuations for internet and

telecommunications stocks in 2000, and the subsequent inability of venture funds to exit many of

their investments at attractive prices. In other cases, funds have flowed to particular sectors, such

as cleantech, potentially crowding out investment elsewhere.


                                                                                                  20
     As a result, the bulk of our analyses examine VC investments in cloud computing as a

share of all VC investments, though we also analyze the level of venture investment in cloud

computing in a robustness check. When we replicate the results using the level of financing, we

find the results go through as before.

     The explanatory variable U.S. Indicator equals one for investment in U.S. cloud computing

companies and zero for investment in EU cloud computing companies. The explanatory variable

Q3 2008 or After Dummy equals zero for all quarters before the U.S. Appellate Court decision in

the Cablevision case in August 2008 and one in Q3 2008 and all quarters thereafter. The

explanatory variable, Effect of the Cablevision Decision on U.S. VC Investment, a dummy

variable capturing the interaction between the U.S. Indicator and the Q3 2008 Dummy, equals

one for investment in U.S. cloud computing companies in Q3 2008 and thereafter, and zero

otherwise. Xr,t is a vector of other explanatory variables, including GDP growth and broadband

penetration, that may be associated with investment in cloud companies.

     This difference-in-difference model is designed to estimate parameter β3, whether

investment in venture-backed U.S. cloud companies rose subsequent to the Cablevision decision,

controlling for trends in the U.S. relative to EU (captured by U.S. Indicator), and trends in cloud

computing generally (captured by Q3 2008 or After Dummy) absent the policy.

     In order to focus more narrowly on the time period surrounding the Cablevision decision,

our analyses focus on investment levels from 2006 to 2010. Doing so eliminates long-term

investment trends prior to 2006 from influencing the results. Figure 1, which depicts the

quarterly difference between investment in U.S. and EU venture-backed firms, suggests that

investment in U.S. venture-backed cloud companies was not systematically increasing, relative

to EU firms, in the time period immediately preceding the 2008 Cablevision ruling; however,



                                                                                                 21
investment in U.S. venture-backed cloud companies increased, relative to EU firms, after the

2008 Cablevision ruling.43

         Our first set of regression results are presented below in Table 2, and show that

investment in venture-backed cloud computing companies is significantly higher in the U.S. than

in the EU after the Cablevision decision.44 The coefficient on β3 in Model 1, which provides an

estimate of the change in VC investment post-Cablevision, is equal to 0.0257. It indicates that

the rise in average VC investment in cloud computing in the U.S. as a percentage of VC

investment in IT in the U.S. from the period Q1 2006 through Q2 2008 to the period Q3 2008

through Q4 2010 was approximately 2.57 percent greater than the corresponding rise in cloud

computing investment in the EU, or approximately 3.16 percent overall.45 This estimate of β3,

statistically significant at the 95 percent confidence level, implies an approximately $730 million

increased VC investment in U.S. cloud computing companies after the Cablevision decision.

       Model 2 is similar to Model 1, except that it incorporates variables that control for GDP

growth and broadband penetration. As shown in column 2 of Table 2, the coefficients on these


43
     Figure 1 shows that the increase in VC investment in the U.S., relative to the EU, did not occur immediately
     after the 2008 Cablevision ruling. Such a delay is consistent with both the typical amount of time required to
     obtain VC investment and the fact that VC investment often involves multiple rounds of increasing size.
     Specifically, the VC investment process typically takes between 6 and 12 months (Madison Park Group [2008])
     and a firm receiving VC investment may receive multiple rounds, with the average investment size in the first
     round equal to between $6 and $13 million, the average in the second round equal to between $8 and $15
     million, and the average in later-stage rounds equal to between $15 and $23 million (Huggett [2012]). In
     addition, there are gaps between each round, with the average time between rounds of financing in 2010 equal
     to approximately 20 months (Sherman [2012]).
44
     Around the time of the Cablevision decision, some cloud services were launched, such as Microsoft Windows
     Azure on November 17, 2009 (“Microsoft Cloud Services Vision Becomes Reality With Launch of Windows
     Azure Platform,” http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/press/2009/nov09/11-17pdc1pr.aspx), and these
     services may have had an effect on VC investment in cloud computing in the U.S. However, other cloud
     services, such as Amazon EC2 and Google Apps and Docs were launched much earlier in 2006, and appeared to
     have little or no effect on VC investment in the U.S. (“Google Introduces New Business Version of Popular
     Hosted Applications,” http://googlepress.blogspot.com/2007/02/google-introduces-new-business-
     version_22.html; http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2006/; and, “Google Announces Google Docs
     & Spreadsheets,” http://googlepress.blogspot.com/2006/10/google-announces-google-docs_11.html.)
     Furthermore, any cloud services that were launched around the time of the Cablevision decision may have been
     in part launched because of the clarity afforded by the decision.

other variables remains the same, and as shown in the table, the magnitude and significance of

the Effect of Cablevision on U.S. VC Investment is almost identical to the magnitude and

significance of the Effect of Cablevision on U.S. VC Investment in Model 1. The implied increase

in U.S. VC investment of approximately $728 million is nearly identical as well.

     To investigate the potential impact of outliers on our analysis, we ran Models 1 and 2 using

a difference-in-difference quantile regression analysis. Quantile regression analysis allows one to

estimate the relationship between a set of independent variables and a specific quantile, or

percentile, of the response variable. One advantage of such an analysis is that the influence of

large outliers is mitigated. Thus, for our context, it allows us to determine the extent to which our

results are sensitive to quarters with very large or very small values of the dependent variable,

VC Ratio. Results for median (quantile) difference-in-difference regressions are presented in

Table 3.

     Results for Model 3, the quantile regression version of Model 1, are presented in Table 3.

These results are similar to those presented in Table 2 and imply that the rise in median (as

opposed to average) VC investment in cloud computing in the U.S., as a percentage of VC

investment in IT in the U.S. from the period Q1 2006 through Q2 2008 to the period Q3 2008

through Q4 2010, was approximately 3.5 percent greater than the corresponding rise in cloud

computing investment in the EU. This estimate, which is statistically significant at the 95 percent

confidence level, implies an approximately $952 million increase in VC investment in U.S. cloud

computing companies after the Cablevision decision.




                                                                                                     23
       Results for Model 4, the quantile regression version of Model 2, are also presented in Table

3, and are similar to those for Model 3 with an implied increase in U.S. cloud computing

investment of approximately $904 million.

4.1. Additional Sensitivity Analyses and Robustness Checks

4.1.1. Alternative Control Group Specifications

       We have also estimated a difference-in-difference model comparing investment in the U.S.

to investment in the rest of the world (ROW) in order to examine whether the results are

sensitive to the use of EU companies as a control group. Specifically, we have conducted

analyses analogous to Model 1 using ROW investment (rather than investment in the EU) as a

benchmark.

       As an alternative approach to examining the robustness of our findings, we have examined

the extent to which investment levels increased subsequent to the Cablevision ruling for a broad

set of internet companies, rather than just the cloud companies included in the above analyses.

We anticipate that there will be no effects for this set of internet companies since the Cablevision

ruling should only affect cloud computing companies. The results associated with Models 5 and

6 presented in Table 4, are analogous to Models 1 and 2 except that they are run on the “internet-

specific” companies rather than the cloud companies.46

         As the results in Table 4 show, investment levels in U.S. internet-specific companies

either actually decrease in the U.S. following the Cablevision decision (Model 5), or are not

statistically different in the time periods before and after the Cablevision ruling (Model 6). This

suggests that the findings described above are specific to cloud companies, in particular, and do



46
     VentureXpert categorized 8,510 companies as being internet-specific. This list includes companies described as
     “internet communications,” “e-commerce technology,” “computer hardware,” “internet software,” “internet
     programming,” “internet ecommerce,” “internet content,” and “internet services.”

                                                                                                                24
not reflect general trends associated with venture-backed investment in internet-specific

companies.47

4.1.2. Stationarity48

       One assumption made in our regression analyses is that the data are stationary; that is that

the data series do not depend on time and thus, that the mean, variance, and covariance of the

data do not vary with time. To examine the extent to which increased U.S. investment

subsequent to the Cablevision decision reflects an ongoing trend, perhaps attributable to factors

not reflected in any of the data we collected, we have conducted a variety of tests. First, we ran a

simple ordinary least squares regression on the difference between U.S. and EU investment

levels against a time trend; this revealed that U.S. investment levels relative to EU investment

levels were falling on average, but not significantly, during the Q1 2006 to Q3 2008 time period.

       To more formally test for stationarity in our time series data, we conducted three well-

known tests on our data from Q1 2006 through Q4 2010: the Dickey-Fuller, Phillips-Perron, and

Kwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin tests. Using each test, we found no evidence of non-

stationarity. As such, our data appear to be stationary, and thus, it is not necessary to adjust our

regression equations or data.

4.1.3. Autocorrelation

       We also tested for the presence of autocorrelation in our regression analyses by conducting

 a test proposed by Jeffrey Wooldridge for panel data.49 After correcting for autocorrelation, the



47
     We also undertake a variety of unreported robustness checks. These include using the logarithm of venture
     financing as a dependent variable, as more detailed controls for country and industry. The results are robust to
     these alterations.
48
     A stationary time series is one whose statistical properties such as mean, variance, and autocorrelation, are all
     constant over time. Most statistical methods are based on this assumption, and violations of stationarity can lead
     to biased point estimates.
49
     Wooldridge [2002].

                                                                                                                    25
 estimate of the effect of Cablevision remains significant and positive, and the implied increase

 in U.S. cloud VC investment actually increases from that of Models 1 and 2.

4.1.4. Clustered Standard Errors

     Clustering standard errors corrects for the lack of independence between observations. In

our data, observations within a quarter may contain similar information. Without correcting for

the non-independence of the data, the standard errors would potentially be too small, and thus the

p-values would be too low. To correct for this, we clustered our standard errors by quarter.

Although the p-values increase as expected, the estimate of the effect of Cablevision remains

significant. Specifically, as Table 5 shows, the estimate of the effect of Cablevision remains

significant in both Models 7 and 8 these models are analogs to Models 1 and 2, with the only

difference being that the standard errors are clustered by quarter.

4.1.5. Tobit Regression Model

      Given the fact that many of the observations in our dependent variable are equal to zero

(32.8 percent), we run a Tobit model in an unreported analyses to account for potential

censoring. Doing so, we find that the estimate of the effect of Cablevision remains significant

and positive in Models 1 and 2. When Model 1 is run using ordinary least squares, we find that

the coefficient on the effect of Cablevision is equal to 0.0257 and is significant at the five percent

level. When we instead use a Tobit model, the coefficient on the effect of Cablevision is equal to

0.0241 and is significant at the ten percent level. When we rerun Model 2 using a Tobit model,

the estimate of the effect of Cablevision decision also remains significant.

4.1.6. Investment Levels (vs. Ratios)

     We ran additional sensitivities based on an alternate specification of the dependent

variable. Specifically, we ran regressions analogous to Models 1 and 2 but where the dependent


                                                                                                   26
variable was the total quarterly investment (in the U.S. or EU) measured in dollars, rather than

measured in terms of a ratio relative to total IT spending. The total other IT VC investment and

total other VC investment in a given region were controlled for by their inclusion as separate

independent variables in the regression analysis. These regressions yielded results, presented in

Table 6, comparable to those of Models 1 and 2.

     In Model 9, the analog to Model 1, U.S. investment was, on average, $119 million higher

each quarter after the Cablevision ruling (after controlling for EU differences), totaling $1.2

billion over the 2.5 subsequent years. The corresponding figures for Model 10 the Model 2

analog, which incorporates controls for GDP changes and broadband penetration, imply $126

million higher investment on a quarterly basis and $1.3 billion in total for the 2.5 years.

4.1.7. Investment Events (vs. Investment Ratios or Investment Levels)

     We next ran regressions analogous to Models 1 and 2 where the dependent variable was

whether a given VC deal was a cloud deal or not, rather than total quarterly investment measured

in dollars or the ratio of total quarterly investment relative to total IT spending. In running these

regressions, we used a logit model where, if a deal was a cloud deal, the binary dependent

variable was set equal to one; otherwise, the dependent variable was set equal to zero. Because

there is a strong industry effect in venture funding—some groups specialize, for instance, in

biotechnology, while others concentrate on energy--we restricted our sample to include only VC

firms that had previously provided funding to a cloud company. Our results, which are presented

in Table 7, indicate that the effect of Cablevision on whether a VC firm provided financing to a

cloud company is generally positive and significant, and suggest that our principal results are not

being driven by a small number of large VC investments.




                                                                                                    27
4.1.8. Investment Rounds (vs. Investment Ratios or Investment Levels)

     We also ran regressions analogous to Models 1 and 2 where the dependent variable was the

number of rounds of VC investment received within a given quarter (in the U.S. or EU), rather

than total quarterly investment measured in dollars or the ratio of total quarterly investment

relative to total IT spending. Our results, which are shown below in Table 8, indicate that the

effect of Cablevision on the number of U.S. VC investment rounds is positive and significant,

and suggest that our principal results are not being driven by a small number of large VC

investments. These results thus provide further evidence that decisions around copyright

protection can have significant impacts on VC investment.

4.1.9. Cloud Company Identification

     We have also tested the sensitivity of our results to the list of cloud computing companies

included in our dataset. Our results are robust to the use of a smaller set of companies, that is,

one that includes those with “cloud” in their VentureXpert business descriptions but does not

include additions based on review of third party cloud computing company lists.

     Our research also revealed specific types of cloud companies that are likely to be

differentially affected by the Cablevision decision. In particular, there exist three general types of

cloud computing services: infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), software-as-a-service (SaaS), and

platform-as-a-service (PaaS). IaaS providers are the most likely to be affected by the Cablevision

decision because their customers can store files, some of which may be copyrighted, on their

servers. SaaS providers, in contrast, are the least likely to be affected by the Cablevision decision

because they generally provide pre-packaged software solutions that are unlikely to be tasked

with storing copyrighted materials on the providers’ servers. And finally, PaaS providers form a

middle ground between IaaS and SaaS providers in which the consumer, rather than the provider,


                                                                                                     28
creates the software using tools and/or libraries from the provider. Some customers may create

services that store or access copyrighted material, while others may not; thus, it is unclear

whether PaaS services are likely to be affected by the Cablevision decision.

     Table 9 provides results from three regressions where we investigate the differential impact

of the Cablevision decision on VC investment in IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS companies. In Model 18,

we run a regression in which only VC investment in IaaS companies is included in the

denominator of our dependent variable, and we find results consistent with our hypothesis

articulated above; that is, we find a significant and positive impact of the Cablevision decision on

VC investment in IaaS companies. Model 19, which estimates the impact of the Cablevision

decision on PaaS companies, also finds a significant and positive impact of the Cablevision

decision. And finally Model 20, which estimates the impact of the Cablevision decision on VC

investment in SaaS companies, provides results that are consistent with our expectation that SaaS

companies should be unaffected; that is, we find an insignificant, although positive impact of the

Cablevision decision on VC investment in SaaS companies. Thus, we find that those cloud

companies that are the most likely to be affected by the Cablevision decision experience an

increase in VC investment in the U.S. relative to the EU after the decision.

4.1.10. Second Circuit Court Analysis

     We ran additional regressions using a logit model, similar to Models 11, 12, and 13 in

Table 7, to determine whether investment in cloud companies headquartered in states under the

jurisdiction of the Second Circuit Court increased compared to the rest of the U.S. The Second

Circuit Court of Appeals has jurisdiction over the states of New York, Connecticut, and

Vermont; since the Second Circuit Court sets binding precedent for district courts in these states,

we expect to see an even bigger increase in investment in cloud companies located in these states


                                                                                                 29
after the Cablevision decision. While this decision, as discussed above, was likely to have a

broader impact, the effect of the decision should be most substantial here.

     Anecdotal evidence suggests that this ruling has indeed effected firms’ location decisions.

For instance, high-profile (and controversial) video streaming company Aereo chose to locate in

New York with a “model engineered specifically to take advantage of 2008 ruling from the U.S.

Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in a copyright case against Cablevision” (Bario [2013]).

     Our results, presented in Table 10, support our hypothesis. We find a positive and

significant impact of the Cablevision decision on investment in cloud companies in states under

the Second Circuit’s jurisdiction in Models 21, 22, and 23.


5.   Estimation and Results – The French and German Rulings
     To determine whether investment in venture-backed French and German cloud companies

declined subsequent to the Wizzgo and 2006 German District Court rulings, we ran regressions

similar to those that were run to analyze the impact of the Cablevision decision. For France:

     VC Ratior,t = β0 + β1(France Indicator)r + β2(Q1 2009 or After Dummy)t + β3(Effect of

                   Wizzgo Decision on French VC Investment)r,t + θXr,t+ εr,t.                   (1)

And for Germany:

     VC Ratior,t = β0 + β1(Germany Indicator)r + β2(Q3 2006 or After Dummy)t + β3(Effect of

                   German Decisions on German VC Investment)r,t + θXr,t+ εr,t.                  (2)

The dependent variable, VC Ratior,t, is VC dollars invested in the cloud computing companies in

region r at quarter t divided by VC dollars invested in information technology (IT) companies in

region r at quarter t, computed for both the country in question and the rest of the EU excluding

France and Germany.




                                                                                                30
     The explanatory variable France Indicator (Germany Indicator) equals one for investment

in French (German) cloud computing companies and zero for investment in German (France)

and EU cloud computing companies. The explanatory variable Q1 2009 or After Dummy (Q3

2006 or After Dummy) equal zero for all quarters before the French (German) Court ruling in

November 2008 (May 2006) and one in Q1 2009 (Q3 2006) and all quarters thereafter. The

explanatory variable, Effect of Wizzgo Decision on French VC Investment (Effect of German

Decisions on German VC Investment), a dummy variable capturing the interaction between the

France Indicator (Germany Indicator) and the Q1 2009 Dummy (Q3 2006 or After Dummy),

equals one for investment in French (German) cloud computing companies in Q1 2009 (Q3

2006) and thereafter, and zero otherwise. Xr,t is a vector of other explanatory variables including

GDP growth and broadband penetration that may be associated with investment in cloud

companies.

     This difference-in-difference model is designed to estimate the parameter β3, which

provides an estimate of the effect of the French and German rulings on investment in French and

German cloud computing, respectively, controlling for trends in France and Germany relative to

the EU (captured by the country indicators), and trends in cloud computing generally (captured

by Q1 2009 or After Dummy and Q3 2006 or After Dummy) absent the policy.

     In order to focus more narrowly on the time period surrounding the French ruling, we

analyze investment levels from 2006 to 2010. Doing so helps to eliminate long-term investment

trends prior to 2006 from influencing the results. Similarly, in order to focus more narrowly on

the time period surrounding the 2006 German District Court ruling, we first analyze investment

levels from 2004 to 2008. We also investigate the effect over a longer time period, 2004 to 2010,




                                                                                                   31
because additional court rulings were made in 2006, 2007, and 2009, and because the litigation

involving Shift.tv and Safe.tv, to our knowledge, has not yet been completely resolved.

     Our first set of regression results are presented below in Table 11, and show that

investment in venture-backed cloud computing companies is lower in France than in the EU after

the Wizzgo ruling. The coefficient on β3 in Model 24, which provides an estimate of the effect of

the Wizzgo ruling on VC investment in French cloud computing companies, is equal to -0.0185.

This indicates that the increase in average VC investment in cloud computing in France as a

percentage of VC investment in IT in France from the period Q1 2006 through Q4 2008 to the

period Q1 2009 through Q4 2010 was approximately 1.85 percent lower than the corresponding

rise in cloud computing investment in the EU. This estimate of β3, statistically significant at the

90 percent confidence level, implies that VC investment in French cloud computing companies

decreased, relative to the rest of the EU, by an average of $2.0 million per quarter after the

Wizzgo ruling, or approximately $16 million in total for 2009 and 2010.

     Model 25 is similar to Model 24, except that it incorporates variables that control for GDP

growth and broadband penetration. As shown in column 2 of Table 11, the coefficients on these

control variables have the expected positive sign and are statistically significant. Interpretation of

the other variables remains the same, and as shown in the table, the magnitude and significance

of the Effect of Wizzgo Decision on French VC Investment are almost identical to its magnitude

and significance in Model 24.

     Analogous regression results for Germany are presented in Table 11 and show that

investment in venture-backed cloud computing companies is lower in Germany than in the EU

after the 2006 German District Court ruling, both when a shorter post-ruling period is used (Q3

2006 to Q4 2008) and when a longer post-ruling period is analyzed (Q3 2006 to Q4 2010).



                                                                                                   32
Model 26, which estimates the estimate of the effect of the 2006 German District Court ruling on

VC investment through the end of 2008, shows that the effect of the 2006 German District Court

ruling (as well as other similar rulings that followed later in 2006 and 2007) on VC investment in

German cloud computing companies is equal to -0.0115. This indicates that the change in

average VC investment in cloud computing in Germany as a percentage of VC investment in IT

in Germany from the period Q1 2004 through Q2 2006 to the period Q3 2006 through Q4 2008

was approximately 1.15 percent lower than the corresponding rise in cloud computing

investment in the EU. This estimate, statistically significant at the 95 percent confidence level,

implies that VC investment in German cloud computing companies decreased, relative to the rest

of the EU, by an average of $0.5 million per quarter after the 2006 German District Court ruling,

or approximately $3 million in total from 3Q 2006 through 4Q 2008.

     Model 27 is similar to Model 26, except that it incorporates variables that control for GDP

growth and broadband penetration. As shown in column 4 of Table 11, the coefficients on these

control variables have the expected positive sign. Interpretation of the other variables remains the

same, and as shown in the table, the magnitude and significance of the Effect of German

Decisions on German VC Investment is almost identical to its magnitude and significance in

Model 26. The implied decrease in German VC investment is nearly identical as well.

     As described above, the litigation involving Shift.tv and Safe.tv, to our knowledge, has not

yet been completely resolved; as such, uncertainty likely exists regarding the viability of certain

cloud business models in Germany. To investigate whether this ongoing legal uncertainty

continued to depress VC investment in German cloud computing in 2009 and 2010, we also

analyzed a longer post-ruling period (Q3 2006 to Q4 2010). These results, presented in Models




                                                                                                     33
28 and 29 in Table 11, show that the magnitude and significance of the Effect of German

Decisions on German VC Investment is similar to the estimates in Models 26 and 27.

5.1. Additional Sensitivity Analyses and Robustness Checks

5.1.1. Alternative Control Group Specifications

       We have also estimated a difference-in-difference model comparing investment in France

and Germany to investment in the rest-of-the-world (ROW) in order to examine whether the

results are sensitive to the use of EU companies as a control group. Specifically, we have

conducted analyses analogous to Model 24 (France) and Models 26 and 27 (Germany) using

ROW investment, rather than investment in the remainder of the EU, as a benchmark. These

results are presented in Table 12 and are qualitatively similar, finding that the decrease in

investment in French (German) venture-backed cloud computing companies, relative to the rest

of the EU, amounted to an average of $0.9 million ($0.2 million) per quarter after the Wizzgo

(German) ruling.

5.1.2. Stationarity50

       To examine the extent to which the decrease in French and German investment subsequent

to the French and German rulings, relative to the EU, reflects an ongoing trend, perhaps

attributable to factors not reflected in any of the data we collected, we have conducted a variety

of tests. First, we ran a simple ordinary least squares regression on the difference between French

and EU investment levels against a time trend, as well as on the difference between German and

EU investment levels against a time trend. This revealed that French investment levels relative to

EU investment levels were falling on average, but not significantly, during the pre-ruling time



50
     A stationary time series is one whose statistical properties such as mean, variance, and autocorrelation, are all
     constant over time. Most statistical methods are based on this assumption, and violations of stationarity can lead
     to biased point estimates.

                                                                                                                    34
period, and that German investment levels relative to EU investment levels were increasing on

average, but not significantly, during the pre-ruling time period.

       To more formally test for stationarity in our time series data, we conducted three well-

known tests on our data: the Dickey-Fuller, Phillips-Perron, and Kwiatkowski–Phillips–

Schmidt–Shin tests. Using each test, we found no evidence of non-stationarity. As such, our data

appear to be stationary, and thus, we do not adjust our regression equations or data.

5.1.3. Autocorrelation

       We also tested for the presence of autocorrelation in our regression analyses by conducting

 a test proposed by Jeffrey Wooldridge for panel data.51 After correcting for potential

 autocorrelation, the estimate of the effect of the French and German rulings remains significant

 and negative, and the implied increase in French and German cloud VC investment is

 qualitatively similar.

5.1.4. Investment Levels (vs. Ratios)

       We ran additional sensitivities based on an alternate specification of the dependent

variable. Specifically, we ran regressions analogous to Models 24 and 25 for France, and Models

26 – 29 for Germany, where the dependent variable was the total quarterly cloud VC investment

measured in dollars, rather than measured in terms of a ratio relative to total IT spending. Total

other IT VC investment and total other VC investment in a given region were controlled for by

their inclusion as separate independent variables in the regression analysis. The results of these

regressions, presented in Table 13, show that the French and German rulings continue to have a

negative and significant impact on cloud VC investment, although both the French and German

results imply a larger decrease in cloud VC investment, relative to the EU, as compared to the


51
     Wooldridge [2002].

                                                                                                     35
regressions in which cloud VC investment is measured in terms of a ratio relative to total IT

spending.

5.1.5. Investment Rounds (vs. Investment Ratios or Investment Levels)

     We also ran unreported regressions analogous to Models 24 and 26 for France, and Models

26 – 29 for Germany, where the dependent variable was the number of rounds of VC investment

received within a given quarter (in France, Germany, or the EU), rather than total quarterly

investment measured in dollars or the ratio of total quarterly investment relative to total IT

spending. Our results indicate that the effect of the French and German rulings on the number of

French or German VC investment rounds is negative and significant in Germany, and negative,

although insignificant in France. This suggests that our principal results are not being driven by a

small number of large VC investments and provides further evidence that decisions around

copyright protection can have significant impacts on VC investment.


6.   Conclusions
     The impact of property rights, and in particular its implications for investment, is an

important issue in corporate finance. In this paper, we set out to address the impact of these

changes in one particular case: by looking at the impact of unexpected judicial decisions that

shifted the allocation of copyright protection on VC investment in cloud computing companies.

We do so by analyzing the joint effects of the Cablevision decision and the French and German

rulings on VC investment in the U.S. relative to the EU and across the U.S., as well as by

separately analyzing the effects of the French and German court rulings on VC investment in

French and German cloud computing companies. To that end, we constructed a dataset on VC

investment in cloud computing companies and estimated multiple difference-in-difference

regression models.

                                                                                                 36
     Our findings suggest that decisions around the allocation of copyright ownership can have

significant impacts on investment in innovative enterprises. Specifically, we find that the

Cablevision decision, along with court rulings in France and Germany, led to additional

incremental investment in U.S. cloud computing companies compared to the EU experience. In

addition, we find that French and German court rulings led to reduced investment in French and

German cloud computing companies compared to all other EU countries. The more granular

analyses, such as of the impact on funding in the Second District, support that the shift in the

allocation of copyright protection has a major impact on investment.

     Taken together, our findings suggest that strong upstream property rights, combined with

transaction costs that limited the ability to enter into licenses, can significantly deter investment

in downstream innovations. We cannot assess the broader social welfare impact of these

changes, since we cannot observe investment by large corporations or the long-run consequences

of these shifts in property rights on the production of creative material. (Waldfogel [2011] argues

that changes in effective copyright protection has had little impact on the development of high-

quality popular music, but much more work needs to be done.) Nonetheless, the findings of this

paper provide an empirical data point that helps illustrate an important and little studied issue.
