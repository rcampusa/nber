In 2004, Canada changed the eligibility rules for its Scientific Research and Experimental
Development (SRED) tax credit, which provides tax incentives for R&D conducted by small
private firms. Difference in difference estimates show a seventeen percent increase in total R&D
among eligible firms. The impact was larger for firms that took the tax credits as refunds because
they had no current tax liability. Contract R&D expenditures were more elastic than the R&D
wage bill. The response was also greater for firms that invested in R&D capital before the policy
change.

             Tax Credits and Small Firm R&D Spending

           In 2004, Canada changed the eligibility rules for its Scientific Re-
          search and Experimental Development (SRED) tax credit, which
          provides tax incentives for R&D conducted by small private firms.
          Difference in difference estimates show a seventeen percent in-
          crease in total R&D among eligible firms. The impact was larger
          for firms that took the tax credits as refunds because they had no
          current tax liability. Contract R&D expenditures were more elastic
          than the R&D wage bill. The response was also greater for firms
          that invested in R&D capital before the policy change.

  Economists have long suspected that private incentives for research and devel-
opment (R&D) are too low, since knowledge spillovers cause research spending
to resemble investment in a public good. Tax subsidies are a market-oriented
approach to this problem. It is often unclear, however, whether fiscal incentives
for R&D produce a meaningful private response. This is particularly true for
small firms that lack sophisticated tax-planning capabilities, have little or no tax
liability, and might balk at the fixed costs of starting a new line of research. We

use a change in eligibility rules for R&D tax credits under Canada’s Scientific
Research and Experimental Development (SRED) tax incentive program to gain
insight into the impact of fiscal incentives on R&D spending by small private
firms.1

    In 2004, Canadian-Controlled Private Corporations (CCPCs) with prior-year
taxable income between $200 and $500 thousand became eligible for a fully re-
fundable 35 percent R&D tax credit on a larger amount of qualifying R&D ex-
penditures. We show that firms eligible to benefit from the more generous policy
spent more on R&D following the change, compared to firms with the same tax-
able income before the change. Specifically, eligible firms increased their R&D
spending by an average of 17 percent. Much of the response comes from firms
with zero tax liability, who would not benefit from a non-refundable credit, but
can convert (some) refundable SRED credits to cash. We examine the compo-
nents of R&D spending, and find a smaller effect for R&D wages than for contract
R&D expenditures. Finally, we show that firms increase their R&D spending by
a larger amount if they recently made R&D related capital expenditures.

    Our findings make three contributions to the literature on R&D tax incentives.
First, we focus on small private firms: the average firm in our estimation sample
has annual revenues of $1.2 million. While large firms account for the bulk of
private R&D spending, several authors have argued that small firms have a com-
parative advantage in product innovation or exploratory research (Cohen and
Klepper, 1996; Akcigit and Kerr, 2010). Our estimates suggest that small private
firms are quite responsive to R&D tax incentives, consistent with the findings of
other recent studies (Dechezleprêtre et al., 2016).

    Second, because SRED credits are fully refundable for most of the firms in our
sample, our findings are relevant to debates over the design of the U.S. R&D tax
credit. Before 2016, the U.S. federal R&D tax credit was non-refundable, so small

   1 While the program is commonly referred to as SR&ED in Canada, we conserve ampersands by
adopting the acronym SRED throughout this paper.

firms that did not owe taxes could only benefit from carry-forwards. The law was
changed in December 2015, allowing firms with gross receipts less than $5 million
to deduct up to $250,000 of qualifying R&D expenditures from their payroll tax,
making the R&D tax credit essentially refundable for small firms.2 Roughly half
of the firm-year observations in our data have no tax liability. We show that zero-
tax-liability firms are more responsive to the expansion of the refundable credit,
presumably because these firms face a larger increase in the after-tax marginal
cost of R&D once all of their credits are consumed.
  Finally, our results highlight the potential importance of fixed costs in small
firms’ response to R&D tax incentives. We provide two pieces of evidence on
this point. First, we show that contract R&D spending (a spending category we
assume to have relatively low fixed costs) has a greater after-tax cost elasticity
than the R&D wage bill. Second, we show that firms with recent R&D-related
capital expenditures (one source of fixed costs) are more responsive to the more
generous tax incentives.
  In the remainder of the paper, we review prior research on R&D tax credits, de-
scribe the Canadian SRED program change and our empirical strategy in greater
detail, present our empirical results, and speculate on the implications of our
findings.


                                 I.   Related Literature


  Hall and Van Reenen (2000) review the early literature on R&D tax incentives
and identify two broad empirical strategies. One approach is to estimate a re-
duced form R&D demand equation that includes a shift parameter to measure
the impact of changes in the R&D tax credit. This strategy is used in several pa-
pers, including Swenson (1992), Bailey and Lawrence (1992), and Czarnitzki et al.
(2011). A second approach is to regress R&D spending on the after-tax user cost

   2 The new law also made the U.S. R&D tax credit permanent. Observers such as Tyson and Linden
(2012) had long called for both changes.

of R&D to obtain a scale-free estimate of the cost elasticity of R&D spending.3
This latter method is implemented by Hall (1993), Bloom et al. (2002), Lokshin
and Mohnen (2012), Wilson (2009), and Rao (2016). Given the complexities of
calculating the R&D user-cost, and the endogeneity introduced when user-cost
is function of R&D spending, the reduced-form approach is often simpler. We
estimate a reduced form expenditure function and use the design of the credit to
calculate an implied user-cost elasticity of R&D.

    While early research on the impact of R&D tax incentives focused on the
United States, some recent studies provide evidence from other countries, in-
cluding Canada (Dagenais et al., 1997; Baghana and Mohnen, 2009; Czarnitzki
et al., 2011), Japan (Yohei, 2011; Koga, 2003), the Netherlands (Lokshin and
Mohnen, 2012), the United Kingdom (Dechezleprêtre et al., 2016; Guceri and
Liu, 2015) and China (Chen et al., 2017). The results of these studies are broadly
consistent with those surveyed in Becker (2015), and with the conclusion in Hall
and Van Reenen (2000) that, “A tax price elasticity of around unity is still a
good ballpark figure, although there is a good deal of variation around this from
different studies as one would expect.”

    Our study is one of a small number of papers on R&D tax credits to focus on
small firms. Lokshin and Mohnen (2012) split their sample into large and small
firms (above or below 200 employees) and find that small firms have a larger
cost elasticity of R&D. Koga (2003) finds the opposite result — a larger cost
elasticity for large firms — in a sample of Japanese manufacturing firms, though
in that study size is based on capital rather than employees. More recently
Dechezleprêtre et al. (2016) estimate a user cost elasticity of -2.6 for firms with
assets in the vicinity of 86M Euros, the threshold for “small or medium” under a
UK administrative rule. We do not provide an explicit comparison of the impact
of tax credits on large and small firms, since our natural experiment only impacts

   3 To our knowledge, the only papers to examine innovation-related outcome variables other than R&D
spending are Czarnitzki et al. (2011) and Dechezleprêtre et al. (2016).

those with taxable income between $200 and $500 thousand. Nevertheless, our
estimates do suggest that the very small firms in our sample have a user-cost
elasticity greater than one.

  To our knowledge, no study has sought direct evidence of fixed costs in R&D
investment. Many authors have noted that the within-firm variance in R&D ex-
penditures is much lower than for capital goods and that one way to rationalize
this observation is to assume some type of adjustment cost. There is some dis-
agreement, however, over what these costs might be. For example, Lach and
Schankerman (1989) argue that the bulk of R&D spending are labor costs, which
should not impose substantial fixed costs, at least for large firms. On the other
hand, Hall (1993) suggests that the long-term nature of research and the fact
that much of a firm’s knowledge capital is tied up in its R&D workforce make it
difficult for even large firms to quickly adjust their R&D spending. A number of
papers seek evidence of adjustment costs in the lag structure of R&D investments
(e.g., Bloom et al., 2002). This is a difficult empirical exercise though, precisely
because within-firm R&D expenditures are typically quite smooth over time (e.g.,
Hall et al., 1986). Unlike prior studies that identify adjustment costs by using
a dynamic model (Hall, 1993; Bernstein and Nadiri, 1988), we compare different
types of R&D spending – contracts versus wages – and utilize direct proxies for
the firm-level cost of adding R&D resources.

  Finally, as noted in the introduction, the refundable nature of SRED credits
makes our results relevant to recent U.S. tax policy changes. Because most firms
in our sample earn fully refundable credits, we cannot test whether the elasticity of
R&D differs for credits earned as non-cash carry-forwards versus cash equivalents.
We do observe, however, that zero-tax-liability firms are more responsive to the
expansion of the refundable credit program. This finding complements the results
in Zwick and Mahon (2014), which show that small financially constrained firms
exhibit a greater response to accelerated depreciation benefits in their capital
expenditures, and those of Himmelberg and Petersen (1994), which show that

R&D investments are sensitive to cash flow for small firms in high-tech industries.


                     II.   SRED Policy and Empirical Framework


                            A.   The SRED Tax Incentive Program


    The SRED program is a tax incentive provided by the federal government to
encourage businesses of all sizes and sectors to conduct research and develop-
ment in Canada. To qualify for SRED support, a firm’s R&D expenditures must
broadly satisfy two conditions. First, the work must be a “systematic investiga-
tion or search that is carried out in a field of science or technology by means of
experiment or analysis.” And second, this work must be undertaken to achieve a
technological advancement or further scientific knowledge.4
    SRED has three main features. First, all companies operating and carrying out
R&D in Canada may deduct 100 percent of qualifying R&D expenditures (includ-
ing capital expenditures) from their taxable income.5 Second, SRED provides a
two-tier tax credit. All firms are eligible to receive an investment tax credit on
qualifying expenditures at the general rate of 20 percent.6 Small and medium-
sized CCPCs can receive an additional 15 percent tax credit, for a total credit
rate of 35 percent, on R&D expenditures up to a threshold called the expenditure
limit. Third, some SRED credits are refundable. Specifically, credits earned at
the 35 percent rate are fully refundable, while credits earned at the 20 percent
rate are non-refundable (but can be used to offset future tax liability).
    Our empirical strategy exploits a change in the expenditure limit, which is a
function of prior-year taxable income and prior-year taxable capital employed in
Canada. (To simplify exposition, we focus only on how taxable income affects
the expenditure limit, because taxable capital is only relevant for a handful of the

   4 See               http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/txcrdt/sred-rsde/clmng/lgbltywrkfrsrdnvstmnttxcrdts-
eng.html#N101D1 for more detail.
   5 Until 2014, qualifying expenditures included both current and capital expenditures used in the
conduct of qualifying SRED activities. Since January 1, 2014, capital expenditures no longer qualify.
   6 As of January 1, 2014, the general credit rate is now 15 percent.

firms in our estimation sample.) Before 2004, the expenditure limit was $2 million
for CCPCs with prior-year taxable income below $200 thousand, with a phase-out
for firms earning between $200 and $400 thousand. In 2004, as part of a broad
package of tax reforms, the lower bound of the phase-out range was increased
by $100 thousand. This change in the expenditure limit formula was announced
on February 18, 2003, and our inquiries with the Department of Finance of the
Government of Canada suggest that it is very unlikely any firms knew about the
plan before that date.

  To illustrate the effects of expenditure limit reformulation, let T Yi(t−1) denote
prior-year taxable income, and define a variable Zt that governs the location of
the phase-out range. The expenditure limit for firm i in year t (ELit ) can then
be written as


(1)             ELit = min{$2 million, max{0, Zt − 10 T Yi(t−1) }}.



Figure 1 graphs this function before and after the 2004 policy-change. The solid
line represents the pre-2004 expenditure limit, based on Zt = $4 million. R&D ex-
penditures below this line earned refundable tax credits at the rate of 35 percent,
while additional expenditures above this threshold earned non-refundable credits
at 20 per cent. The 2004 SRED policy-change increased Zt to $5 million, shift-
ing rightward the expenditure limit phase-out region, represented by the dashed
line in Figure 1. If a firm’s lagged taxable income was between $200 and $500
thousand, and if their R&D investment crossed the pre-2004 expenditure limit,
then the policy change reduced their after-tax cost of R&D. More precisely, the
marginal after-tax cost of R&D declined for firms located in the darkly shaded
parallelogram, while the average after-tax cost of R&D declined for firms with
total R&D spending in the lightly shaded area above the parallelogram. Note
that Figure 1 is not drawn to scale: in practice the expenditure limit phase-out
is much steeper, with each $1 increase in lagged taxable income producing a $10

    Because the marginal cost of R&D increases dis-continuously at the expenditure
limit, we should expect some bunching of firms near that point, and Appendix A
shows that bunching does occur.7 It is therefore important to recognize that our
identification strategy does not rely on variation in tax rates produced by firms
actually crossing the threshold. Instead, we exploit variation in the after-tax cost
of R&D produced by the expenditure limit reformulation illustrated in Figure 1.
    In addition to the expenditure limit, a firm’s marginal credit rate depends on
its tax liability. As noted above, SRED credits earned at the 35 percent rate are
fully refundable.8 Credits earned at the 20 percent rate reduce the marginal cost
   7 The appendix also provides a simple model to explain how declining marginal returns to R&D can
produce a discontinuous increase in the number of observations just above the discontinuity, which is
what we actually find.
   8 Here we assume that the marginal SRED dollar represents a current (as opposed to a capital)
expenditure. This is an important and sensible assumption. It is important because current expenditures
earning the 35 percent credit rate are fully refundable, while only 40 percent of credits earned from
capital expenditures are refundable. It is sensible to assume the additional dollar invested is a current
expenditure because the vast majority of CCPC SRED expenditures are current expenditures.

of R&D by 20 cents as long as the firm has a remaining tax liability, since these
credits can be used to fully offset taxes payable. If a firm does not owe taxes, but
does have the maximum expenditure limit ($2 million during our sample period),
it earns a fully refundable tax credit of 8 percent.9 Thus, letting R denote R&D
expenditures and T ax the total taxes owed after accounting for all other credits
and deductions, a firm’s marginal credit rate is

  This formula for the marginal credit rate shows that crossing the expenditure
limit leads to a smaller increase in the after-tax cost of R&D for firms with tax
liability, because the cash value of their credits will decline by 15 cents per dollar
of R&D expenditure, as opposed to the 27 or 35 cent drop experienced by a firm
with zero tax liability.


                                    B.    Empirical Framework


  Our empirical analysis is based on an R&D demand equation similar to (3.1) in
Hall and Van Reenen (2000), where we exploit the reformulation of the expendi-
ture limit for identification. Specifically, we estimate the following reduced-form
model of R&D spending:


(2)      E[Rit |Tit , Xit ] = exp{Tit P ostP olicyt β1 + Tit β2 + γi + λjt + Xit θ},


where Tit is an indicator for Eligible firm-years with lagged taxable income above
   9 In reality, credits and deductions are somewhat more valuable than we suggest here, since we do not
account for the fact that firms may use them in other years.

$200,000, P ostP olicyt equals one for all years after 2003, γi are firm fixed effects,
λjt are 3-digit SIC-by-year effects, and Xit are time-varying firm-level controls.
     Equation (2) is a difference-in-differences specification that compares firms
above and below the lower bound of the pre-policy phase-out region, before and
after the policy-change, controlling for observed and unobserved firm-level het-
erogeneity.10 The parameter β2 measures the difference in R&D expenditures
between eligible and ineligible firms before 2004. Because the model includes
firm-effects, β2 is identified by firms that cross the eligibility threshold, and have
lagged taxable income above $200,000 during the pre-policy time period. Simi-
larly, the average change in R&D expenditures for firms that cross the eligibility
threshold during the post-policy period is (β1 + β2 ). The parameter β1 captures
the pre- versus post-policy difference in the association between eligibility and
R&D spending. We interpret β1 as an intent-to-treat parameter that measures
the average impact of raising the expenditure limit.
     The key assumption for causal interpretation of β1 is that β2 is a valid estimate
of the counter-factual relationship between eligibility (i.e., prior-year taxable in-
come) and R&D expenditures in the absence of a policy change. Because we
include industry-by-year fixed effects to control for aggregate time-trends, the
main threat to causal inference is an omitted variable that leads to an upward
shift in β2 around the same time as the policy change. To address this concern,
we estimate a version of (2) that replaces P ostP olicyt with a set of calendar-year
dummies (leading to a separate β1 parameter for each year of the panel) and show
that crossing the eligibility threshold has no impact on R&D expenditures before
the 2004 policy-change.
     The reduced-form parameter β1 measures the impact of the policy change, but
not firms’ sensitivity to the after-tax cost of R&D. We can use our estimates,

   10 Because eligibility is a function of prior-year taxable income, (2) is not a standard difference-in-
differences estimator. In particular, we never observe the average difference in outcomes for two firms
with the same prior-year income but different SRED eligibility limits in a given year. Rather, our model
compares the association between R&D and having prior-year taxable income in the relevant range before
and after a change in SRED policy.

however, to calculate an implied user-cost elasticity that is comparable to other
published results. Suppose Ad is the present value of deductions and depreci-
ation allowances, and Ac is the value of tax credits, so the after-tax cost of a
$1 investment is 1 − Ad − Ac . In Canada, Ad = τ , the corporate tax rate, be-
cause R&D expenditures (including for capital) are fully deductible. We also have
Ac = ρ(1 − τ ) because R&D tax credits are taxable income. The Hall-Jorgensen
formula for the steady-state after-tax R&D user cost is then

                                         (1 − Ad − Ac )
(3)                      U = (r + δ)                    = (r + δ)(1 − ρ)
                                             1−τ

where r is the real return to the marginal R&D investment, and δ is the depre-
ciation rate of the R&D capital stock.11 Equation (3) shows that under SRED,
the after-tax R&D user cost depends upon the credit rate, but not deductions or
the corporate tax rate, because the latter two quantities are equal.12

  The user-cost elasticity of R&D is d ln(R)/d ln(U ). For the numerator of this
expression, we can substitute d ln(E[R])/dTit = β1 . The denominator can be
found by substituting ρ into equation (3). For zero-tax-liability firms that would
have crossed the original expenditure limit threshold, d ln(U )/dTit = −dU/U =
−0.35/0.65, while firms with tax liability have d ln(U )/dTit = −0.15/0.65. Thus,
if s percent of eligible firms are in the shaded regions of Figure 1, and p percent
of those firms have current tax liability, the implied user cost elasticity is

                                  d ln(E[R])       0.65 ∗ β1 /s

Hall and Van Reenen (2000), Bloom et al. (2002) and Rao (2016) In practice, because
                                                                                  n     credits are taxed

where the third term reflects the benefits of deferring the tax on credits for one year. In our calculations,
we assume that r = 0.05 and τ = 0.2, though it makes no practical difference if we simply ignore the
third term inside the braces.
   12 Of course, deductions remain valuable to firms that would otherwise have to capitalize their R&D
expenditures, because capitalization leads to Ad < τ which implies a higher after-tax user cost.
12                                                                         APRIL 2019


Intuitively, β1 /s is the average treatment effect for treated firms, which is divided
by the percentage change in R&D user costs to obtain an elasticity. Because s is
derived from a counter-factual policy — applying the pre-2004 expenditure limit
to post-2004 tax and R&D spending levels — we can compute implied elasticities
even though very few firms actually cross the expenditure limit.



     Finally, consider how this framework can be used to examine the role of fixed
costs in small firms’ responsiveness to R&D tax credits. Conceptually, fixed costs
imply a discontinuous jump in the R&D supply curve. One source of fixed costs
is specialized machinery and equipment. We expect firms that have recently
made investments in R&D-related capital to have a larger supply of “bench-
ready” projects. Having already incurred the sunk costs of capacity building,
they should be more responsive to a change in the after-tax cost of R&D. To test
this hypothesis, we estimate a triple-diffs version of equation (2) that interacts
Tit P ostP olicyt with an indicator for pre-2004 R&D capital investment.



     Small firms also may view hiring new scientists or engineers as a fixed cost. If
R&D capital accumulates within employees, hiring is based on the expectation
that these knowledge workers will be retained over the long-term. Tax credits
can mitigate the cost of hiring, but not by enough if potential future research
projects are improbable and thus cause high expected rates of worker turnover.
One alternative to hiring a new researcher is to outsource R&D projects to a
contractor. Firms that face significant fixed costs of hiring but have a supply of
one-off projects with an expected return near their hurdle rate may respond to a
decrease in the after-tax cost of R&D by increasing their contract R&D spending.
Thus, we can learn about the importance of fixed costs by comparing estimates
of β1 when the outcome variable is R&D wages to estimates when the outcome
is contract R&D expenditures.

                                     C.    Data and Measures


  Our data come from the tax records of the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) for
all firms claiming SRED credits during the 2000 to 2007 sample period. Our esti-
mation sample includes all firms that operated as CCPCs throughout the sample
period and claimed R&D tax credits at least once between 2000 and 2003. We also
limit the sample to firms that operated in only one province throughout the sam-
ple period to ensure that our analysis is not complicated by having to consider how
firms active in multiple jurisdictions might geographically re-allocate their R&D
activity in response to differences in provincial R&D support.13 This yields an
unbalanced panel of 7,239 firms and 48,638 firm-year observations. Fifty percent
of these firms are in service industries, 29 percent in manufacturing industries,
and the remaining 21 percent are in other sectors (primarily agriculture).
  Table 1 provides summary statistics for our estimation sample. Total annual
SRED-eligible R&D expenditures averaged $82,887 per year, which implies that
aggregate annual R&D spending for the firms in our estimation sample was
roughly $600 million.14 Sixty-six percent of a representative firm’s annual ex-
penditures (or $55,217) reflect wages paid to R&D personnel. Seventeen percent
of R&D expenditures (or $14,077) were spent on contract research. Contract
research reflects expenditures on the same type of activities that would qualify
for SRED benefits if undertaken in-house. Tax credits for contract research are
generally allocated to the client, although expenditures in excess of the value of
a contract may be allocated to the contractor. Expenditures on R&D capital
were the smallest component of R&D spending, accounting for only $3,022, or
about 3.6 percent of overall expenditures. Conditional on claiming R&D capital,
however, the average expenditure was about $27,000. The remaining 13 percent

   13 We also exclude any firm that is associated at any time during our sample period with any other
firm. Under the SRED program, associated firms must share a common expenditure limit and must
divide room under this limit. To simplify analysis, firms in such sets are not included in the sample.
   14 Thus, if SRED produced a 10-15 percent increase in aggregate R&D for firms in our sample, it would
amount to incremental spending of $60 to $90 million. We do not view this amount as likely to merit
investigation of general equilibrium effects or crowding out in the market for R&D labor.

of total R&D spending is highly correlated with R&D Wages, and we interpret
this residual spending as overhead.15

     Our main explanatory variables are a pair of dummies for eligibility before and
after the policy change. The dummy variable Eligible (Tit ) equals one in any year
when a firm’s prior-year taxable income falls between $200 and $500 thousand –
the range of taxable income over which the expenditure limit increased as a result
of the change in SRED (see Figure 1). We also create a variable P ostP olicyt that
equals one in any year after the SRED eligibility limits were changed. The center
panel in Table 1 shows that 7.3 percent of all observations are eligible, and of

   15 A two-way fixed effects regression of R&D Wages on “other” R&D expenditures produces a coefficient
of 0.16 with t=10.71.

those, 4.8 percent are treated (eligible after 2004). By far, the main reason why
firms are not eligible is that their taxable income was less than $200 thousand.
  The average credit rate in our sample is 34.5 percent, indicating that almost
all firms receive the fully refundable 35 percent credit. More than half of the
firm-year observations have no tax liability. The zero-tax-liability share drops to
around 16 percent, however, if we condition on eligibility (0.012/0.073 ≈ 16.4%).
  Finally, the bottom panel in in Table 1 provides summary statistics for several
additional controls. Roughly 24 percent of the firms in our sample made Pre-
policy R&D Capital investments. We use this variable as a proxy for fixed cost
reduction. Our models also include revenues, assets and liabilities as time-varying
controls. The table shows that, on average, firms in our sample had $1.2 million
in revenue and a similar amount of accounting assets.

                            A.    The Impact of R&D Tax Credits


  Figure 2 provides some graphical intuition for our main result. To create the
figure, we estimate a two-way fixed-effects model (i.e., a linear regression of Total
R&D on a full set of firm and year effects) and then use a local polynomial
regression to plot the mean of the residuals from that regression against prior-year
taxable income. Recall that the change in the SRED expenditure limit formula
potentially lowers the after-tax cost of R&D for firms with prior-year taxable
income between $200 and $500 thousand. So we expect to see an increase in the
residual part of R&D expenditures for firms making more than $200 thousand in
the post-policy period. This is exactly what we observe in Figure 2.16
  We now turn to a regression that decomposes the residuals graphed in Figure 2.
Table 2 presents estimates of the impact of expenditure limit reformulation on

  16 While it would be reassuring to observe a return to the same mean-zero baseline for firms above
$500 thousand, we do not have enough data to reliably estimate the mean residual on that portion of
the support of the prior-year taxable income distribution.

The outcome variable is residual R&D obtained by estimating a two-way fixed effects model of Total
R&D spending that includes firm and year effects. The explanatory variable is prior-year taxable income,
which determines the location of the expenditure limit (see Figure 1).




Total R&D from Poisson-QML estimation of equation (2). A Poisson estimator
handles the many cases where Rit = 0 more naturally than a log-log specification,
and QML simply means that we uses robust standard errors (clustered by firm) to
correct for over-dispersion, leading to asymptotically correct confidence intervals.
Estimates of β1 , the impact of the change in the expenditure limit, appear in the
first row of the table.

     Column 1 contains estimates from a parsimonious specification with only firm
effects plus dummies for Eligible, PostPolicy, and their interaction. The coefficient
of 0.17 in the first row can be interpreted as an elasticity: crossing the eligibility
threshold produces a 17 percent greater increase in R&D expenditures after the
policy is in place than before. This effect is statistically significant at the 1
percent level. The coefficient on Eligible shows that firms above the threshold

had greater R&D expenditures than firms below the threshold, even before the
policy change. The coefficient on PostPolicy shows that there was a secular trend
toward more R&D expenditures over this period, even among firms that did
not change eligibility status. Nevertheless, the Eligible x PostPolicy interaction
shows that in the post-policy time period, the average difference in Total R&D
expenditures between eligible and ineligible firms is about 50 percent larger that
the average difference during the baseline period.

  In Column 2, we add 3-digit SIC industry-by-year effects, which absorb the
main effect of PostPolicy, but produce no change in our estimate of β1 . In Col-
umn 3, we add the the log of Assets, Liabilities and Revenue as time-varying

firm-level controls. Adding these size controls removes any correlation between
eligibility and R&D expenditures during the pre-policy period. Even with these
controls, however, we continue to find a highly significant (p < 0.001) increase
in R&D expenditures at the eligibility threshold following the 2004 expenditure
limit reformulation.17
     Columns 4 through 6 in Table 2 examine different outcome variables.18 Col-
umn (4) shows an 11 percent increase for R&D Wages. Column (5) reports that
Contract R&D expenditures increase by 34 percent. Because wages account for
two-thirds of R&D spending, the dollar-denominated impact on wages and con-
tracts are very similar (see Table 5). The scale-free coefficient on Contract R&D
is twice that of Total R&D, however, and three times the size of the R&D Wages
effect.19
     Unfortunately, our data on the R&D wage bill does not distinguish between
hiring additional employees (real effects) and paying higher R&D wages (crowd-
ing out). If starting a new project requires hiring a new R&D employee, however,
we expect that fixed costs reduce the impact of a more favorable tax credit policy.
Intuitively, these small firms face an integer constraint – new employees must be
hired one at a time – and an incremental unit of R&D labor is not a negligible ex-
penditure for firms whose average R&D wage bill is $55,217 (roughly the starting
salary for a single engineer).20
     Our discussions with managers and tax practitioners also suggest several ways
that firm-level fixed costs might influence the decision to outsource R&D. First,
if managers view both their research budget and the quantity of permanent R&D

   17 Estimates from OLS regressions using log(Total R&D) as the outcome variable yield similar results
but are sensitive to the treatment of observations with zero reported R&D expenditure (see Table B-6
in the online appendix). J. M. C. Santos-Silva and Tenreyro (2006) explain how log-linear models can
produce biased estimates, particularly in applications with many zeroes, and suggest using Poisson-QML
as an alternative.
   18 Sample sizes change for different outcomes because our models contain a multiplicative fixed effect
and therefore all observations with all-zero outcomes are dropped. As a robustness check, we re-run all
regressions with the outcome set to max{1, Rit } and obtain identical results.
   19 We also estimate the impacts for R&D Capital and Other R&D spending. Neither effect is statisti-
cally different from zero.
   20 The web site talentegg.ca reports starting salaries for Canadian engineers between $57,000 and
$84,000, with a median of roughly $65,000 in 2013, or about $60,000 in 2008 dollars.

labor as fixed factors, contracting provides a way to exhaust the budget when tax
incentives reduce the cost of internal R&D. Second, contract R&D may provide a
relatively transparent (i.e., easy to document) form of R&D expenditure. Thus,
even if a firm could allocate its current employees to a new research project,
managers may favor contract R&D because they believe use of contracted R&D
services facilitates the assessment of these expenditures for purposes of the tax
credit.21 Finally, contractors can pass any SRED-related tax savings to clients in
at least two different ways: by allowing a client to claim the credits directly or
by claiming the credit themselves and passing the savings to clients in the form
of lower prices.

  Table 2 column 6 considers whether our main results might come from re-
labeling of other types of investment as R&D. For example, Chen et al. (2017)
suggest that roughly 30 percent of the measured response to a Chinese fiscal
R&D incentive comes from re-labeling. Column 6 examines changes in Non-
R&D Investment. If the observed increase in Total R&D reflects re-labeling of
expenditures that firms would have made even in the absence of a SRED program
change, we would expect a reduction in other types of investment. Instead, we find
a statistically insignificant 14 percent increase in non-R&D capital expenditure
for eligible firms in the post-policy period.22

  Finally, the bottom panel of Table 2 reports implied user-cost elasticities for
different combinations of s and p, based on equation (4), along with standard
errors calculated via the delta method. In the top row, we use the overall sam-
ple means. Specifically we assume any firm with positive R&D faces a binding
expenditure limit (s = 0.59), and that 57 percent of those firms have no tax
liability (p = 0.43), which leads to an implied elasticity of -0.71 for Total R&D,
-0.46 for R&D Wages, and -1.42 for R&D Contracts. We see these figures as a

   21 We find supporting evidence for this story by examining related party (i.e., non-arms length) contract
R&D expenditures and finding that they are a significant piece of the overall contract R&D effect.
   22 If we change the outcome to Non-R&D Investment / Sales, the coefficient changes sign and remains
statistically insignificant, suggesting that the positive estimate in Table 2 column 6 is not driven by
complementarities between R&D and non-R&D spending, or a large income or scale effect.
20                                                                          APRIL 2019


lower bound on the magnitude of the true user cost elasticity, because the credit
rate does not actually change for most firms (suggesting s should be smaller), and
because eligible firms are more likely to pay tax (suggesting p should be larger).
     Our second set of user cost calculations assume s = 0.11, which is the share of
post-policy observations having R&D expenditures above the pre-policy expen-
diture limit (i.e. the share of eligible firms in the shaded parts of Figure 1). We
also assume p = 0.65, which is the share of firms with current tax liability in this
“treated” group. These assumptions imply a user-cost elasticity of -4.57 for Total
R&D, -2.95 for R&D Wages, and -9.13 for Contract R&D. This is a large response.
At the same time, the 95% confidence interval for Total R&D covers other recent
estimates for small and medium-sized firms (e.g. Dechezleprêtre et al., 2016),
and the very large elasticity for Contract R&D reflects substitution from wages
to contracts, as well as a lower baseline spending level.
     We view the calculations in the bottom row of Table (2) as an upper bound
on the true user-cost elasticity, because our data show that R&D increases even
among firms that do not cross the pre-2004 expenditure limit. In particular, if we
discard all observations with R&D expenditures above the pre-2004 expenditure
limit, our baseline empirical model still finds positive and statistically significant
impacts of the policy change.23 This suggests that the true value of s is greater
than 11%, and is an interesting finding in its own right, because it implies that
firms respond not only to their marginal tax rates, but also the amount of “spend-
ing room” they have before exhausting the fully refundable 35% SRED credits.

                                          B.   Trends and Timing


     One concern with our diff-in-diffs design is that firms may have anticipated the
policy-change and tried to manipulate their treatment status before its imple-
mentation. As a practical matter, it is unclear how firms that anticipate a policy
change should respond. Zero-tax-liability firms with R&D spending in the vicinity
     23 We   report these estimates are in the online appendix Table B-3.

of the pre-policy expenditure limit may delay some R&D spending to take advan-
tage of the shift. On the other hand, firms with taxable income that anticipate
large R&D expenditures will typically want to accelerate their spending in order
to create a current-year deduction and an increase in the next year’s expenditure
limit threshold. Thus, the bias could go in either direction. As a robustness test,
we re-estimated our baseline model using a sample that discards all data from the
years 2003 and 2004. For that sample, the coefficient on Eligible X Post-policy
increases to 0.22, with a standard error of 0.06 (not significantly different from
our baseline estimates).24 We conclude that any bias from firms anticipating the
SRED policy change was small, and likely caused us to under-estimate the impact
of the policy.

  A second concern with our diff-in-diffs research design is that β1 may be mea-
suring a secular trend in β2 . In other words, the treatment effect may reflect a
pre-existing trend in the relationship between R&D expenditures and eligibility.
This concern motivates the standard “parallel trends” falsification test, which we
implement via an event-study specification. Specifically, we estimate


                      E[Rit |Tit , Xit ] = exp{Tit βt + γi + λjt + Xit θ},


where the βt are year-specific treatment effects that measure the difference in
R&D spending for eligible versus non-eligible firms in each year of the panel. The
parallel-trends test is equivalent to a test of the null-hypotheses that βt are jointly
zero for all t ≤ 2003. Table 3 reports estimates of βt for each of the three main
outcomes: Total R&D, R&D Wages and Contract R&D.

  In the bottom row of the table, we report tests of the parallel-trends hypothesis.
For all three outcomes, we find no statistically significant evidence of a pre-policy
trend in β1 . This lends credibility to a causal interpretation of the reduced-

form results in Table 2, since the main threat to our identification strategy is an
upward trend in the slope of the lagged-earnings-to-R&D relationship over the
entire sample period.
  Table 3 also provides evidence on the timing of the policy impacts. In particular,
the coefficients in 2003 and 2004 are generally small and statistically significant,
while the coefficients for 2005 through 2007 are two or three times larger and
statistically significant at conventional levels. The pattern of treatment effects,
starting in 2004 and increasing through 2006, also suggests that firms face ad-
justments costs in their R&D spending. If that is the case, the true user cost
elasticity of R&D will be somewhat larger than our estimates in Table 2, because
those coefficients are based on an average that includes the (smaller) short-term
response.


                C.   Treatment Heterogeneity: Tax Liability and Fixed Costs


  This sub-section estimates a pair of triple-difference models that allow the im-
pact of the SRED policy change to vary across firm-years. We use these models to
examine treatment heterogeneity for zero-tax-liability firms, and firms that made
pre-2004 R&D capital investments. Specifically, let the indicator variable Dit di-
vide the estimation sample into two groups according to current-year tax liability
or pre-policy R&D capital investments. We estimate the following regression:


      E[Rit |Tit , Dit , Xit ] = exp{Dit Tit P ostP olicyt β1 + Dit P ostP olicyt β2 +

(5)              Dit Tit β3 + Tit P ostP olicyt β4 + Tit β5 + Dit β6 + γi + λjt + Xit θ},


where all of the other variables are defined above. Note that this model contains
a full set of two-way interactions, and that the main effects of P ostP olicyt are
subsumed in year the industry-by-year fixed-effects.
  In the first three columns of Table 4, the indicator Dit is a dummy for firm-
year observations with no current tax liability. The Zero-tax dummy variable
24                                                                                       APRIL 2019


identifies firms that cannot deduct their marginal dollar of R&D expenditure,
and who therefore face a steeper increase in the after-tax cost of R&D when
crossing the expenditure limit threshold. Put differently, these firms benefit not
only from a higher credit rate, but also from the refundable nature of SRED
credits, because they have exhausted the value of any tax deductions.
     The key results for zero-tax-liability firms appear in the top two rows of Table 4.
Before the 2004 policy-change, these firms’ R&D spending declined by 16 to 31
percent (relative to firms that pay tax) if they were in the Eligible group, and
therefore faced a lower expenditure limit. Adding the coefficients in the top two
rows of Table 4 reveals that most of the drop-off for eligible firms with no cur-
rent tax liability disappeared when the SRED expenditure limits were increased.
Another way to interpret these results is to note that the coefficient on Eligible x
Policy is the diff-in-diffs estimate for firms that pay tax, whereas the diff-in-diffs
estimate for zero-tax-liability firms is found by adding the coefficients on Eligible
x Policy and the three-way interaction. This shows that the impact of the SRED
policy change was roughly twice as large for zero-tax-liability firms, although the
coefficient on the three way interaction is significant at the 5 percent level only
for Total R&D spending.
     In columns 4 through 6, Di corresponds to an indicator for firms that made
R&D capital investments in the pre-policy period. Because this is a time-invariant
explanatory variable, the main effect of Di is absorbed by firm fixed effects.
For these models, we exclude firms in the Professional, Scientific and Technical
Services sector (NAICS 541) from the estimation sample because we expect fixed
costs to be less relevant for R&D service providers — with a steady flow of
projects, there is less chance that specialized assets will sit idle.25
     If capital expenditures represent a fixed cost that dampens small firms’ response
   25 Examples of firm types in this industry are engineering and internet consulting companies as well
as specialized software development companies. In a previous version of the paper, we estimated triple-
difference models that included a three-way interaction for firms in NAICS 541, and found that they
were more responsive to the SRED policy change on the intensive margin (R&D Wages), but not the
extensive margin (R&D Contracts), relative to firms in other industries. This is the same pattern we
find for firms outside NAICS 541 with pre-2004 R&D Capital investments.

to a change in the after-tax cost of R&D, then firms with pre-policy R&D capital
investment should have a larger response to the policy change, because those fixed
costs have already been sunk. This is exactly what we see in columns 4 and 5,
where firms that made ex ante R&D capital expenditures increase Total R&D
spending by 25 percent more and R&D Wages by 24 percent more than other
eligible firms in the post-policy period.26 The fact that we find no statistically
significant change on the extensive margin (R&D contracts) is also consistent
with the fixed cost hypothesis. In particular, the results in Table 2 show that,
on average, contract spending is more responsive to the policy shift than wages.
But once the necessary fixed costs are sunk, these results suggest that more of
the incremental R&D spending shifts back inside the firm.

                                  D.    Decomposition of Policy Impacts


     Before concluding, we use the estimates reported above to decompose the overall
impact of the policy-change into a series of dollar denominated effects for firms
with and without tax liability. The top panel in Table 5 shows the firm-level
impacts of expenditure limit reformulation. To compute these figures, we mul-
tiplied the pre-2004 mean of each outcome variable by our diff-in-diff estimates
of the policy impact. For the All Firms column, we use estimates from Table 2,
columns (3) to (5). For the Taxes Owed and Zero Tax Liability columns, we use
estimates from Table 4, columns (1) and (2). The bottom panel in Table 5 shows
the aggregate impact of the policy along each margin. These numbers are calcu-
lated by multiplying the figure in the top panel by the average annual post-policy
observation count in each cell.
     The results in the top panel of Table 5 show that, in dollar terms, zero-tax-
liability firms increased their annual R&D spending by roughly an order of mag-
nitude more than firms owing tax in the current year. This reflects a difference in
baseline expenditures — firms without tax liability spend roughly 2.5 times more
     26 Table   B-4 shows that we obtain very similar results using a balanced panel.

on R&D — and a larger impact of the SRED policy change. The top panel also
shows that for each type of firm (i.e. with and without tax liability), spending on
contracts increased by roughly the same amount as as the R&D wage bill. The
bottom panel of Table 5 shows that zero-tax-liability firms account for more than
half of the aggregate impact of the SRED expenditure limit reformulation. Over-
all, the calculations in Table 5 indicate that firms that face no tax liability, and
have therefore exhausted any benefit from deductibility of R&D expenditures, are
very responsive to the refundable SRED credits. This finding suggests that the
recent change in the U.S. tax policy described in the introduction may have a
substantial impact on small firm R&D expenditures.


                                 IV.   Conclusions


     We exploit a change in eligibility rules for R&D investment tax credits under
the Canadian SRED policy to estimate the impact of this program on small-firm
R&D expenditures. Privately owned firms that became eligible to benefit from
a refundable 35 percent R&D tax credit on a greater amount of qualified R&D
expenditures increased their R&D spending by an average of 17 percent, compared
to before the program. This corresponds to an R&D user cost elasticity between
-0.7 and -4.57. Our findings contribute to a growing body of evidence suggesting
that tax incentives can induce private R&D expenditures, even among small and
young firms (e.g., Dechezleprêtre et al., 2016). While small firms account for
a modest share of aggregate R&D, they may have a comparative advantage in
specific types of innovation, and linking our findings to innovation outcomes is an
important topic for future research.
     This study also provides several pieces of evidence that fixed costs play an
important role in how small firms respond to a change in the after-tax cost of
R&D. First, we decompose R&D spending into wages and contracts, and show
that estimated user-cost elasticities are much larger for contract R&D expendi-
tures. Second, we show that the response to the SRED policy change was larger

among firms that recently made R&D-related capital investments, and that for
those firms, the response was stronger for the R&D wage bill than for contract
expenditures. Many of the firms in our sample are small enough that they may
not be able to fully utilize an additional scientist or engineer, and these findings
suggest that such firms use external contract R&D to avoid the fixed costs of
launching a new project internally, but shift back to internal work after capacity
is in place.
  Beyond providing new evidence on fixed costs and the response of small firms
to the R&D tax credit, our findings are useful for projecting the effects of recent
U.S tax policy changes in this area. Prior studies of the U.S. R&D tax credit
have typically focused on larger firms, reflecting both data availability and the
fact that smaller firms with no tax liability received limited benefits. In our
sample of small Canadian firms, over half of the firm-year observations had no
tax liability, and would therefore only receive carry-forwards under U.S. policy
prior to 2016 as opposed to cash under SRED. We show that Canada’s SRED
program is particularly effective at stimulating R&D for these small zero-tax-
liability firms. Evaluating the impacts of recent changes in the U.S. R&D tax
credit is a promising topic for future research, particularly if it becomes possible
to link policy-induced changes in R&D spending to innovation outcomes for a
broader range of public and privately owned firms.

                    Appendix A - ONLINE PUBLICATION ONLY


  This appendix provides evidence of “bunching” in R&D investment at the ex-
penditure limit, and proposes a simple model along the lines of Garicano et al.
(2016) to rationalize this behavior. We begin by showing that when firms cross
the expenditure limit threshold, they respond to the increased marginal cost of
R&D.
  Figure A-1 is divided into six panels, with the top row corresponding to data
from the pre-policy time period, and the bottom row using data from after the
policy change. Each graph shows a count (or probability density) of firm-year
observations conditional on distance from the expenditure limit, which is indicated
by a vertical line. The dots are actual frequencies (i.e., the number of firm-
year observations where R&D expenditure is at a certain level relative to the
threshold). The lines correspond to fitted values and a 95 percent confidence
interval from a quadratic model with a break-point at the expenditure limit.27
  The first column in Figure A-1 shows that for “Control” firms with lagged
taxable income below $200 thousand, there is a large jump in the probability
density right at the expenditure limit. This jump in probability mass above the
EL threshold suggests that the size of the marginal R&D investment falls when
the after-tax marginal cost of R&D increases, making firm-year observations less
“spread out” along the X-axis.
  The middle column examines firm-year observations in the “Treatment” group
relative to the pre-policy expenditure limit. Comparing these graphs to the left-
hand column, it appears that firms in the “Treatment” sample are less sensitive
to the expenditure limit. However, there is a notable increase in the frequency
(density) of observations as we move from the pre to the post-policy time-period
   27 To produce each panel in Figure A-1, we first created a variable X , equal to firm i’s Total R&D
                                                                         it
in year t minus the relevant expenditure limit ELit . Next, using observations where |Xit | < $1 million,
we counted the number of firm-years where Xit fell into each of a series of 80 “bins” with
                                                                                         P a bandwidth
of $25,000. Formally, letting k = −39 . . . 40 index the bins, we created variables Yk =    i,t 1[25, 000 ∗
(k − 1) < Xit ≤ 25, 000 ∗ k)] and Xk = 25k. We then created scatter plots of the 80 values of (Y, X),
along with fitted values and 95% confidence intervals from the regression: Y = α + β1 X + β2 X 2 + 1[X >
0]{α2 + γ1 X + γ2 X 2 } + εk .

(i.e. from the top to the bottom row) in the middle column. This shows that
firms are more willing to spend at or above the pre-policy expenditure limit after
that limit has been increased. This is the source of variation used to identify the
main results in the body of the paper.
     Finally, the right-hand column in Figure A-1 shows the probability density
in a neighborhood of the post-policy expenditure limit. In the top-right cell,
we can see that there are very few firm-year observations from the pre-policy
period that spend enough on R&D to reach the post-policy threshold. However,
in the bottom-right cell, we can observe not only more observations, but also
a discontinuous drop in the density at the expenditure limit. We interpret this
bunching as evidence that firms are aware of the change in the SRED policy, and
are adjusting their spending to take advantage of the higher threshold.
     Because the bunching of Control observations just above the expenditure limit
in the left-most column of Figure A-1 may seem counter-intuitive, we now provide

a simple model to illustrate the the incentives behind this behavior. The model
rests on two assumptions: (1) firms differ in their marginal productivity of R&D,
and (2) there is a sharp increase in the marginal cost of R&D at the expenditure
limit.
  Suppose that a firm investing x in R&D receives gross benefits B(x; η) = ηxθ ,
where θ < 1 and η is a random parameter with cumulative distribution F (As-
sumption 1).    Further, suppose that the marginal cost of R&D is cL up to
some expenditure limit EL, and cH thereafter (Assumption 2), so total costs
are C(x) = cL min{x, EL} + cH max{0, x − EL}. The first-order condition for
R&D investment then implies that:

                                 
                                                  if η < η < η,


                 (1−θ)                  (1−θ)
where η = cL EL θ        , and η = cH EL θ      . Thus, Assumptions 1 and 2 suffice to
generate a mass point in the distribution of x at the expenditure limit, since there
is an atom of types [η, η] that spend exactly x∗ = EL.
  Now let g(x) denote the density of x. Applying the chain rule, we have g(x) =
F ′ (η(x))η ′ (x), where η(x) is the inverse of the optimal R&D investment implied
by the first-order condition (A-1). Taking the limits of g(x) from above and below
as x approaches EL, we have

                                  (1 − θ)                     (1 − θ)
(A-2)           lim = F ′ (η)cL           and lim = F ′ (η)cH
               x↑EL                θELθ       x↓EL             θELθ


  Thus, a graph of g(x) will have a discontinuous increase at x = EL if and
only if cH F ′ (η) > cL F ′ (η). That is what we observe in the lefthand column of
Figure A-1, for firm-years in the Control sample (i.e. with lagged taxable income
below $200 thousand). Intuitively, we see bunching above the cutoff because
the increase in marginal cost leads more firms to “drop out” for each additional

dollar of R&D investment, and this produces an increase in the density g(x) at
the expenditure limit.
     Although Figure A-1 provides strong evidence that firms respond to the R&D
tax credit, we do not use this variation in our empirical analysis for two reasons.
First, the marginal cost of R&D is endogenous – our main outcome variable
appears on the x-axis in Figure A-1.28 And second, only about two percent of
the firm-year observations in our data set actually cross the expenditure limit
threshold.




   28 This simultaneity also prevents us from using a regression discontinuity design to estimate the impact
of tax credits at the expenditure limit.
