                      Lifeâ€”Cycle Models of Consumption:
                 Is the Evidence Consistent with the Theory?



                                ABSTRACT


 The paper considers a variety of evidence that casts light
                                                             on the
 validity of the life-cycle model of consumer behavior.    In
 first part of the paper, simple non-parametric tests are used the
                                                                 to
 examine representative agent models of consumption and labor
supply.    It seems extremely unlikely that post-war United States
 evidence can usefully be explained by such a model, at least if
 the assumption of intertemporal separability is maintained.
 Changes in aggregate consumption bear little relationship to
 after tax real interest rates, and consumption has tended to
even during periods of negative real interest rates.           grow

consideration of consumption and labor supply does nothing to
resolve the problems that arise when consumption is taken by
itself.     It is argued that these results cast doubt, not on
life-cycle theory itself, but on the representative agent
assumption; there is little reason to suppose that changes in
aggregate consumption should be related to the real interest
rate.    The second part of the paper is concerned with the

presence of time trends can cause severe problems of inference in
models containing variables with unit roots, but the results make
it seem unlikely that this is the cause of the widespread excess

 Introduction



 In this --parer I discuss some empirical evidence that reflects on the

 validity of life-cycle models of consumer behavior. I make no attempt to

 provide a survey but rather focus on a number of specific issues that

 seem to me to be important, or that seem to have been
                                                         unreasonably
 neglected in the current literature. The paper has three sections. The

 first looks at the stylized facts. In particular I look at the

 non-parametric evidence with emphasis on both consumption and labor

 supply and the interaction between them. I present some aggregate

 time-series data from the U.S.; these suggest that simple representative

agent models of the life cycle are unlikely to be very helpful, at least

without substantial modification. it is particularly hard to come up

with one explanation that is consistent both with these data and

the wealth of evidence on consumption and labor supply from microeconomic

information. However, I argue that the main problem here is not so much

the theory as the aggregation; except under extremely implausible

assumptions, including the supposition that consumers are immortal, life

cycle theory does not predict the sort of aggregate relationships that

are implied by representative agent models. In particular, it makes

little sense to look for a simple relationship between the real rate of

interest and the rate of growth of aggregate consumption. Section 2 is

concerned with the estimation of parametric models on aggregate time

series data.    I review briefly the "excess sensitivity" issue, as well as

some of the econometric problems associated with the nonstationarity of

the income and consumption time series.    My main point, however, is to
                                   -2-




argue that there are interactions between the time-series representation

of income and the life-cycle model that have not been adequately

recognized ifi the literature. In particular, if real disposable income

can be adequately represented as a first-order autoregressive process in

first differences, a formulation that is becoming increasingly popular in

the macro literature, then consumption, far from being excessively

sensitive, is not sensitive enough to innovations in current income.

Indeed, the representative agent version of the permanent income

hypothesis can be rejected because it fails to predict the fact that

consumption is smooth, the very fact that it was invented to explain in

the first place.   I consider a number of possible explanations, and offer

a menu of directions for escape: we can abandon the life-cycle theory, we

can abandon intertemporal additivity, or we can abandon our time series

description of income. There are attractions to both of the last two

routes. The section concludes with some summary empirical evidence on

the excess sensitivity issue as well as on the relevance of the

distinction between anticipated and unanticipated variables.    Some time

series estimation problems are reviewed, and though they complicate

inference, I nevertheless find convincing evidence for excess

 sensitivity, and more surprisingly for the view that there is little cost

 to ignoring the distinction between anticipated and unanticipated income.

 Section 4 is a brief summary of the main conclusions.



 Section 1: Some non-parametric evidence.



 In this section I first follow the lead of Martin Browning (1984) and

 discuss non-parametric tests of life-cycle behavior. Browning's work
                                    -4-




                    -
         W0=            wth                                   (2)




In these equations, c and ht are consumption and hours, Pt is the price

of goods in t, and w the wage rate. Superimposed tildes imply that the

price or wage is discounted back to period 0, so that W0 is the initial

wealth endowment at the beginning of life. Note that the subperiod

utility functions are not indexed on t, and that for the moment, I have

not allowed for a rate of time preference; this is more conveniently

introduced later.



The empirical evidence Consists of a finite set of pairs of observations

on consumption and hours together with their associated discounted prices

and wages. Browning shows that for these data to be consistent with the

theory, it is necessary and sufficient that they satisfy the condition of

"cyclical monotonicity", see also Green and Srivastava (1984). This is

that for any "cycle" of observation indices, s, t        ,   v,     say, it
must be the case that




pc

       st +               +pc
                            uv-wh
                               vs -whSt -           .. -wh
                                                         uv
                                                                      (3)

follows that of Sydney Afriat, for example, (1967), (1981), and Hal

Varian, (1982),(1983), in seeking to confront a finite number of data

points with the underlying theory without the intermediation of an

arbitrarily chosen functional form. As we shall see, the tests are

particularly simple for the life-cycle model, so that they provide an at-

tractive way of organizing the evidence before moving on to more

conventional analysis. The starting point is the (absurdly) extreme

hypothesis that the evolution of aggregate behavior over time is simply

the unfolding of the predetermined life-cycle plan of a single

representative agent. This prescient individual, having returned from

World War II, or let us say Korea, established a clear and subsequently

correct view of the rest of the post-war period. This hypothesis is of

interest only because, if it cannot be rejected, there is little point in

testing weaker forms, like intertemporal choice under uncertainty.    And

Browning presents evidence from the U.S., the U.K., and Canada that

suggests that there are in fact few obvious discrepancies. Let us see.



The theory begins with the assumption that preferences can be represented

by the intertemporally additive utility function




           u = v(c,h)                                      (1)




subject to a budget constraint, which under certainty, can be written
                                     -6-




 decrease as the growth of real wages is greater than or less than the

 real rate of interest. If the latter exceeds the former, hours should be

 higher now than later in spite of the fact that wages are increasing; in

 terms of-tomorrow's goods, the return on today's work is higher than that

 on tomorrow's work when the positive real rate of interest is taken into

 account. The reader can check that the addition of a rate of time pre-

 ference to the utility function, so that each period's subutility is

 multiplied by the discount factor l/(l+c5) to the power of t, leaves these

 predictions unchanged except that the real rate of interest is simply

 replaced by the real rate of interest minus the rate of time preference.

Note that if the data fail the conditions (5) and (6), i.e. if the

 schedules appear not to be monotone, then recourse can be had to the

weaker condition (4). Provided labor supply behaves as it should, then

there is some scope for a violation by consumption, and vice versa.

However, note that some sign patterns are clearly inconsistent with both

(4) on the one hand, and (5) and (6) on the other. In particular, if the

real rate of interest is pgative and consumption is increasing, then

hours and discounted wages must move in the same direction.



Table 1 presents some data on annual changes in the aggregates for the

U.S. from 1954 through 1984. Definitions of the series are shown at the

foot of the Table. I have followed standard practice in excluding

durable goods from the consumption concept. Note the importance of

calculating real interest rates on an after tax basis; not only is there

a prolonged period of negative rates through the 1970's, but there is

also similar period from 1955 to 1959. The tax adjustment is made by

comparing the yields on (tax-free) AAA municipal bonds with those on
                                          -5-




Since I shall be attempting only to disprove this condition, I work with

one of its implications. For any pair of indices, s and t, cyclical

monotonicity implies that




           -
               p).(ct   -   c)       (w -   w).(ht
                                                     -   h)   (4)




This condition can usefully be contrasted with those that are required if

the utility function (1) is simultaneously intra- as well as

interâ€”temporally additive, so that life-time utility is the sum of two

sums, one involving hours alone, the other involving only consumption. In

this case, cyclical consistency is equivalent to, for all t and s,




                   -
                        p).(c c) -          0                 (5)




                (w -    w).(ht   -
                                     h)     0                  (6)




i.e. to the (obvious) requirement that the consumption demand function

slope down and that the labor supply function slope up. Note that if t

and s are successive observations in time, then the discounted price is

falling if the real after-tax rate of interest is positive, while the

discounted wage is rising if the proportional increase in real wages is

greater than the real rate of interest. Hence, under simultaneous

additivity, consumption should be increasing over periods when the real

rate of interest is positive, while hours worked should increase or
                                     -8-




 simultaneity, Kennan (1985), and so forth, but at this simple level there

 is clear evidence against the hypothesis.



 Consumption and hours can also be considered jointly. Figure 1 is a

 scatter plot for the thirty-one years of real interest rates against the

 growth of real wages less the interest rate. Using the series DH1, points

 are marked as "1" for consumption growth and hours growth, tl2f   for
 consumption growth and hours decline, "3" for consumption decline and

 hours growth (one point, 1974), or "0" for 1963 when there was

 essentially no change in average hours. (There are no years in which

 consumption and hours both declined.) If we look at the second quadrant,

where there is (discounted) wage growth but negative real interest rates,

we know that increases in consumption must be associated with increases.

in hours for cyclical consistency to be satisfied. But of the 16 years

represented in the quadrant in which consumption increased, in 5 of them

hours declined. There are further problems in comparing the first and

fourth quadrants. In 1983 and 1984, by a miracle of supply-side

economics, hours increased (substantially) by both measures while

discounted real wages were falling. Since consumption increased, no

doubt in response to the unprecedented high real interest rates, such

events could be explained by a high degree of complementarity between

consumption and hours. However, in quadrant 1, where wage growth and

interest rates are both positive, there are several years in which hours

declined when consumption rose, presumably because hours and goods are

substitutes! Once again, the addition of a positive rate of time

preference is of little help. Subtracting 6>0 from the real rate r
                                    â€”7â€”




similar (taxed) corporate bonds, and then applying the correction factor

to the treasury-bill rate. This may not be correct, but it is better

than making no correction at all.



Since consumption grows in every year except 1974, and since real

interest rates are negative from 1955-59, 68-9, and 71-80, it is

immediately clear that the simple monotonicity condition (5) is violated,

indeed it is only satisfied for 15 out of the 31 years. Allowing for a

positive rate of time preference is of little help in explaining why

consumption grows; a negative rate of time preference would do much

better.



The labor supply side is much more difficult to document, largely

because, with different wage rates for different individuals, the

aggregation makes even less sense. The series DH1 and DH2 are two of the

many possible series for changes in hours; their sign patterns are

similar but not identical. The real wage series is average hourly

earnings of production workers in manufacturing deflated by the implicit

price deflator of consumption. There is little relationship between the

sign pattern in this series and those in either of the two series for

changes in hours. This is what we would expect. The growth of real

wages is close to being a random walk with drift, Ashenfelter and Card

(1982),(1985), while hours move with the cycle, so that we can expect as

many contradictions as confirmations of the monotonicity condition (6).

Clearly, it is possible to take a more sophisticated view of these data,

to allow for aggregation bias, see e.g. Barro and King (1984), for
                                        -10-




 this, goods and hours have to be substitutes, which is inconsistent with

 the latter period of the typical life-cycle where hours, consumption        and
 the   wage rate decline together. One of the strengths of working on

 consumptiorr   behavior is   the availability of many different types of data

 on which the same hypotheses can be tested, but one of the weaknesses of

 the theory is its inability to yield a simple explanation that appears to

 work for them all.




 11any of these problems go away as soon as the fiction of a representative

 consumer is abandoned. In particular, imagine an economy with a

 stationary population and no secular real income growth, where each

 individual is a perfect lifeâ€”cycle consumer.      Suppose also that each

 consumer has the standard utility function, with identical
                                                               parameters,   -



 and that the real rate of interest is
                                       greater than the rate of time

preference. In consequence, the life-cycle consumption paths will be

identical (except possibly for scale) for all individuals, and each will

be characterized by a consumption stream that is rising over time.

Furthermore, if all these consumers were to be transported to another

economy with a higher real rate of interest, each of their
                                                               consumption
streams would be growing faster than in the original economy.

Nevertheless aggregate consumption in this economy is constant, or at

least it is so unless its inhabitants live for ever. Old people, whose

consumption has been growing steadily over their lives and is thus higher

than their permanent income, are continually dying off and being replaced

by young people whose consumption is much less than their permanent

income. In consequence, consumption in aggregate remains Constant over

time even though it is growing for each individual.      Comparing otherwise
                                   -9â€”




simply moves the axes of Figure 1 down along the 45Â° line to the right;

this does nothing for the "bad" points in quadrant 2.



These resurts seem to me to be entirely consistent with, and indeed

almost an explanation for, the results that have been obtained in

parametric studies that have modeled hours and consumption simultaneously

in a life-cycle context. Mankiw, Rotemberg, and Summers (1985), using

quarterly data from the U.S. find violations of concavity in their

estimated utility function. With quite different data, a time series of

cross sectional household surveys from the U.K. ,   Browning, Deaton, and

Irish (1985) also found inconsistencies between theory and evidence, with

violations not only of concavity, but also of symmetry, so that goods and

hours want to be both substitutes and complements for one another, as -

                                                                  that
appears to be the case in Figure 1. In this evidence, it is clear
the life-cycle model cannot provide a single unified explanation that

will cover both life-cycle and business cycle evidence. Data from other

sources suggest that the difficulties are quite widespread.     Information

on individual households typically shows hump shaped life-cycle profiles

of consumption, hours, and real wages, see Ghez and Becker (1975), Smith

(1977), Thurow (1969), Browning, Deaton, and Irish (1985). This can be

trivially explained by time varying preferences, and perhaps more

interestingly by variations in household size over the life cycle.

Alternatively, and since there is no obvious life-cycle shape to the real

 interest rate, the hump is consistent with the supposition that hours and

 goods are complements, as Heckman (1971), (1974) pointed out. However,

 in long-run time-series data, consumption increases, hours decline, real

 wages grow, and the real rate is (presumably) positive. To account for
                                    -12-




 rather a typically humped shape, with declines in consumption in old age.

 Thirdly, casual evidence suggests that while children share much of their

 parents wealth and standards of living, it is not true that they

 immediately begin their lifeâ€”cycle consumption paths at the same level as

 their parents.



 Aggregation does not explain all of the contradictions given above, but

 it should teach us not to expect aggregate consumption to be growing or

 declining as the real rate of interest is greater than or less than the

 rate of time preference. Note that "Euler equation" models of

 consumption under uncertainty are also guilty of this sin. The Euler

 equation is the stochastic version of the first-order condition that

 equates the marginal utility of money across periods taking into account

 the real interest rate, and it is the equation that determines the rate

of growth of consumption in relation to the real interest rate. Even if

each consumer conforms to the Euler condition, there is no corresponding

aggregate version without some version of the immortality
                                                            assumption.



The aggregation assumptions are even more severe for labor supply than

for consumption. Comparing (5) and (6), it is clear that if all consumers

face the same prices and interest rates, and if the population of

consumers is indeed immortal and thus identical at all points in time,

then if each individual satisfies (5), so will the aggregate. However,

different consumers face different wage rates, so that it is very easy to

construct examples in which individual wages and hours move together, but

the averages move contrarily.
                                   â€”11â€”




stationary economies with different real interest rates will reveal no

relationship between the real rates and the rate of growth of

consumptiOfl,SinCe the latter is always zero. It is only if there is

population -growth or growth in real income per capita that aggregate

consumption will grow, and the rate of growth will be related to

demographic factors on the one hand, and to a very long moving average of

incomes (i.e. a time trend) on the other. Only if the economy is

continuously on a "golden-age" growth path, with the real interest rate

equal to the real rate of growth, and if it is capable of instantaneously

jumping from one equilibrium growth path to another, only then will there

be a stable relationship between the real rate of interest and the rate

of growth of consumption. All of this was, of course, clearly worked out

and carefully explained thirty years ago in the original papers on the -

lifeâ€”cycle   hypothesis by Nodigliani and Brumberg (1955), (1979). It is a

pity that the recent literature has lost sight of it.



One counter argument is that individuals may not live for ever, but that

their descendants do, so that in aggregate we have "as if" immortality.

This would require that as one consumer dies, his or her replacement,

grandchild or great-grandchild perhaps, picks up the dead progenitor's

consumption stream where it was momentarily interrupted, so that the

growth path can continue. I find this hard to believe. Firstly, the

discounted present value of future real incomes from here to eternity

would almost certainly yield an eternal stream of real income far in

excess of current income levels. If so, consumption ought to reflect it

now, and it does not. Secondly, evidence on individual life-cycle

 consumption patterns does not show steady growth over the life-cycle, but

 Section 2. Aggregate time series, sensitivity, and insensitivity.



 2.0 Introduction




 Compared with consumption function analysis of a decade or so ago, modern

 work is characterized by much greater attention to the time-series

 aspects of econometric analysis. This is partly because economists have

 become much more aware of the special econometric problems that arise

with inference and estimation in time series models, but also because the

 applications of rational expectations theory to the consumption function

has drawn attention to the essential part played by the time series

properties of income in determining the form of the consumption function.

This point was made in the context of the consumption function in Lucas's

original critique (1976), but the basis for much of the subsequent work

has been Hall's (1978) demonstration that, conditional on lagged

consumption, expected future consumption should be independent of other

lagged information. In his original paper, Hall found that such a

formulation was surprisingly difficult to reject.   Subsequent and more

detailed analysis has led to something close to a consensus view that,

contrary to the theory, aggregate consumption is responsive to

anticipated changes in income, see in particular Flavin (1981), Hayashi

(1982), and Hansen and Singleton (1982), though see also Campbell (1985),

Bean (1985) and Blinder and Deaton (1985). Both of the last two studies

find that as the consumption function is expanded to include a wider

range of variables, e.g government expenditure, leisure, and various

relative prices, it becomes more difficult to reject the theory. The

Before moving on to the more conventional parametric models, it is worth

noting some of the advantages and disadvantages of the non-parametric

technique. Jt will not have escaped the reader that the method shares

much with the journalistic approach to economic events; if variables once

move in the wrong direction relative to one another, a counter-example

has been established, and the theory must be false. We spend a good deal

of time, and for good reason, teaching undergraduates that this is not a

good way to make inferences. Nevertheless, in the present case, the

violations are more endemic than occasional, and an equally simple

parametric approach would undoubtedly yield the same results.

Additionally, it can be argued that since the parametric approach is more

restrictive than the non-parametric, imposing a possibly restrictive

functional form, then rejections of the theory can only get worse if     -




parametric   tests are carried out. However, there is an important sense

in which non-parametric tests are too strong. By their nature, they

focus on the relationship between two, possibly vector valued quantities.

In these models, quantities respond to prices, and to nothing else. It is

therefore straightforward to construct simple, exact models of

consumption and labor supply that contain variables in addition to

prices, and these simple models, though entirely consistent with the

theory, could easily be made to fail the non-parametric tests.
                                    -16â€”




  aggregation over agents is unlikely to be the explanation, though I have

  so far been unable to rule out an explanation based on consumers' jointly

 modelling consumption, income, and other variables, for example, interest

  rates and unemployment. A simple model of habit formation is shown to be

 consistent with the evidence.



 (iii) It is also possible to make the life-cycle model true by

 assumption, and to use its truth to infer backwards to the time series

 properties of income.   I consider a number of possible time series

 representations for income, and argue that it is unlikely to be possible

 to discriminate between them on statistical
                                               grounds, even though each has

 very different implications, not only for the life-cycle model, but also

 for the way in which we think about the economy as a whole. As a con-

 sequence, and in contrast to the general promise of rational
                                                                expectations
models, time series analysis of income is unlikely to tell us very much

about how consumption should behave, nor to yield testable implications

for the consumption function. More concretely, the old problem of how

consumption should respond to transitory income is essentially not

resolvable since we cannot tell what are the implications of income

innovations for the future of income.



(iii) On the excess sensitivity issue, I discuss briefly the issue raised

by Mankiw and Shapiro (1984) of whether or not the non-stationarity of

the joint consumption income process implies that tests of excess

sensitivity are biased against the rational expectations model. I show

that the "excess sensitivity" results
                                        on U.S. quarterly data cannot be

explained away by this phenomenon. Further, there is little evidence
                                  -15-




"excess sensitivity" finding, which is usually attributed to the presence

of a significant fraction of liquidity-constrained consumers, was also

confirmed inThn excellent study of food expenditures using the PSID by

Hall and Mishkin (1982). Even so, there is much good work currently

being done on panel data, and the final results are by no means in. For

example, and again using the PSID, Altonji and Slow (1985) have found

that allowing for measurement error can make a large difference to the

results of tests of simple versus rational expectations type models.



Here I wish to discuss the following issues:



(i) I look at two standard time-series models for real disposable income.

In the first, income is taken to be stationary around a deterministic

trend, and the residuals after trend removal are modeled as a low order

ARNA, typically AR(2). In the second, income is made stationary by first

differencing, and the differences modeled as a low order ARNA, typically

an AR(1) with positive persistence. Both procedures fit the data well,

both have their determined adherents, and it is extremely difficult to

tell them apart. However, if the second procedure is correct, it turns

out that innovations to permanent income are more variable than

innovations to current income, so that life-cycle theory predicts that

changes in consumption should be larger than innovations in income. It

seems fairly clear that such a conclusion is false.



 (ii) Since the difference model of income is a plausible and attractive

one, and since it is widely used, I consider some explanations for the

 smoothness of consumption that are consistent with it.   I argue that
                                    â€”18-




 value, it can ultimately be expected to return to the baseline trend.

 The differencing procedure may or may not imply that the effects of

 shocks eventually die out, depending on what sort of time series process

 is fitted to the differences. While the         in income is stationary

 and has a(n unconditional) mean that remains constant through time, there

 is in general nothing that acts to bring the level of income back to any

 particular path. In the simplest example of a random walk with drift,

 which turns out to be a good description of the growth of the real wage

 in the U.S., previous changes are immediately consolidated into the

baseline, so that a good year with a large wage increase means that we

 can expect wage levels to be permanently higher with no expectation that

at some future date, the good fortune will have to be paid for.



To compare the two approaches, I estimated simple representations using

seasonally adjusted quarterly U.S. data from 1954,1 to 1984,4.     I use two

income concepts, real disposable labor income, y, and total income,

including capital income, z. The latter concept is close to the published

NIPA figure, and the former was constructed from other published data,

see Blinder and Deaton (1985) for further details and for the series

itself. It is important to make some attempt to exclude capital income,

since it is the labor income concept that is the appropriate one for

life-cycle models, and there is no presumption that the two series have

the same time-series properties. The detrending procedure is best

carried out by estimating the autoregression with time variables

included. By the Frisch-Waugh theorem, the results are numerically

identical, but the standard errors allow us to assess the relative
                                 â€”17â€”




that the distinction between anticipated and unanticipated income that is

required by rational expectations theory has any basis in the empirical

evidence.



2.1 The time-series processes of consumption and income



There is no clear consensus on how best to represent the process

generating real disposable income. Everyone agrees that real income is

not stationary, but that is far from enough to produce a consensus model.

One approach is to remove a time trend from income, and then to fit a

timeâ€”series representation to the residuals. On quarterly U.S. data, an

AR(2) seems to do the job. The other approach, more favored by

"professional" time-series analysts, see in particular Beveridge and      -




Nelson (1981), is to difference either income or its logarithm, and to
fit the time series model to the difference, rather than to the deviation

from trend. More recently, Doan, Litterman and Sims (1985) have

recommended first differencing the logarithms of virtually all trending

macroeconomic time-series as a prelude to fitting vector autoregressive

models. That it is rates of growth rather than levels that should be the

appropriate object of our attention is an idea that has much to commend

 it.




At a conceptual level, these two procedures are quite different, and they

 have different implications for the estimation and interpretation of the

 relationship between consumption and income.   The detrending procedure

 assumes that trend around which real income moves is fixed and deter-

 ministic; even if income is temporarily shocked above or below its trend
                                    -20-



 insufficient to induce stationarity. After
                                              deleting insignificant terms,
 including the time trends, the differenced models are




        8.4 Ã· 0.435
                              R2=0.1918, Q(33)=37.7, ESE= 25.3
       (3.3)     (5.4)
                                                                 (9)



        12.5 +   0.377         R2=0.1428, Q(33)=35.7, ESE= 27.7
        (4.2) (4.5)
                                                              (10)


 These are simple and parsimonious descriptions of two nonstationary time

 series; the change in labor income is somewhat more autoregressive and

has a less variable innovation than does the change in total income and

this is what one would expect. The closeness of (9) and (10) to the        -



corresponding unrestricted forms (7) and (8) suggests that formal      tests
are unlikely to be able to separate them, and this is in fact the case.

Following Dickey and Fuller (1981), the adequacy of the unit-root models

(9) and (10) can be tested by calculating an "F-test" for these models

against the more general alternatives in which y (or z) is regressed on

its first lag, its lagged first-difference, and a time trend. The

calculated statistics are 1.97 for labor income and 3.95 for total income

compared with the critical values given by Dickey and Fuller of 6.49 at

5% and 5.47 at 10%.
                                    â€”19â€”




contributions of both elements. For labor income, y, the regression

equation is




     = 84.9   +1.39 y0.46 t-206 t-3Â°4 t-4063
      (2.3) (15.2)      (-2.9)      (1.1)   (-1.5)    (2.1)


R2=0.9983, Q(33) =31.7, ESE =25.1                             (7)




while, for total real disposable income, z, the regression is




 z =139.7     +1.30 z_1-O.35 z_2+O.O8 z_3-0.09 _4+i.35 t
     (2.8)     (14.7)   (â€”2.3)      (0.5)   (â€”1.0)    (2.8)


R20.9987, Q(33) =31.6, ESE =27.1.                             (8)




Note that these time-series representations are broadly similar, though

the absolute values of the coefficients on the first and second lags are

larger for labor than for total income, while the standard deviation of

the innovation is about 20% larger for the broader concept.     The time

trends are both significant, though much less important than the

 autoregressive components, and if the regressions are rerun in

 logarithmic form, neither time trend is significant at conventional

 levels. Note that at the parameter values shown, both autoregressions

 are estimated to be stationary, but in each case by a very small margin.

 Indeed, the estimated coefficients strongly suggest a differenced model

 in which y is modelled as an AR(1). This would be the immediate reaction

 of most time-series analysts; for example, Beveridge and Nelson (1981) do

 not quote results like (7) and (8) but simply state that detrending is
                                     -22-


 is,   the estimated autoregressions suggest that, not only are shocks

 permanent, but they are positively autoregressive, so that a better than

 average change in any given quarter can be expected to lead to further

 good fortune in subsequent quarters. This implies that the permanent

 income value of an unanticipated change in income is greater than the

 change itself. Clearly, the choice between the two time series processes

 considered here, though almost impossible to make on statistical grounds,

 is of considerable importance in calculating permanent income.



How then can we choose between, on the one hand, the (marginally)

 stationary representation of the deviations of income from trend, and on

the other, the AR(1) representation of the differences? Since the data

cannot discriminate between them, the choice must be made on theoretical

grounds. For myself, I find it hard to believe that real per capita

income is centered round a deterministic trend. As emphasized in a

recent paper by Campbell and Mankiw (1986), such a representation tends

to assume that income shocks originate from the demand side rather than

from supply. If some particularly unpleasant negative "epsilon" was the

result, for example, of the destruction of part of the capital stock,

then I see no reason for believing that income will eventually get back

on the old trend. It is much more credible that it wouldbegin to grow

again from the new lower base, which is what the first difference model

says it will do. Of course, the AR(1) first-difference model is far from

being the only time-series representation of income that allows this sort

of shock persistence, but it is certainly one of the most parsimonious

and widely used.
                                  -21-




Consider then a representative consumer who is calculating his or her

permanent income and whose representative income is generated by one of

these stochatic processes. For the general case, where income (or

deviations of income around a deterministic trend) are generated by an

ARMA(p,q) process, the change in permanent income from t-l to t is given,

see Flavin (1981), by




              =   r[l   +(1 +r)n}                                 (11)

                   {l -(1 +r)5p}


where the n's are the MA coefficients, the p's the AR coefficients, u is

the current innovation, and r is the interest rate, here assumed to be

fixed to avoid complications that are irrelevant to my current concerns.

Equation (11) is valid whether or not the process is non-stationary, see

Hansen and Sargent (1981). If we re-estimate the stationary labor income

equation above excluding the longest two lags, the autoregressive

parameters are 1.41 and -0.45, so that, with a real rate of 1%, the

factor multiplying the innovation in the above equation is 0.22, a

sizeable but reasonable figure. However, if we move to equation (9),

which as we have seen cannot be rejected against the model with a time

trend, the corresponding parameters are 1.435 and -0.435,-so that the

response of consumption to a unit innovation is now 1.8, i.e. eight times

as large.



For the non-stationary model (9), such a result is intuitively obvious.

If income were a random walk, permanent and measured income would be the

same; an income shock is expected to be sustained indefinitely.    As it
                                    -23-




 If the arguments in favor of the differenced model are accepted, then the

 permanent income model of the representative consumer is in some trouble.

 Innovations in permanent income should be magnified versions of the

 innovationsâ€” in measured income, so that if, to take the simplest case,

 consumption is equal to permanent income, then the variance of the change

 in consumption should be        than the variance of the innovation in

 the income process. Equation (9) above gives the standard deviation of

 the income innovation process as $25.27 per capita in 1972 prices. The

 standard deviation of the change in aggregate consumption of goods and

 services over the same period, 1954,1 to 1984,4 is $12.08. Even if it is

only required that consumption be proportional to permanent income,

identical problems arise. The standard deviation of the rate of growth

of consumption is still only a half of the standard deviation of the

innovation in the AR(1) process describing the first difference of the

logarithm of income. Even this understates the difficulties, since no

allowance has been made for any other shocks to consumption. The

addition of shocks that are independent Ã f innovations to income,

"transitory consumption," will further increase the expected variation in

consumption, and further deepen the puzzle.



Of course, the representative consumer may be able to predict income

changes better than can a simple autoregression. Indeed, if equation (9)

is supplemented by other variables, including several lags of

consumption, wealth, interest rates, and inflation rates, the multiple

correlation coefficient can be doubled from 0.20 to 0.40. But even if

the R2 were to be 0.50, the standard deviation of the innovation would

still be $20.2, which is still very much larger than the corresponding
                                  -24-




figure for changes in consumption. However, this is not the relevant

comparison. If the consumer uses a number of other variables to predict

income, thenthose variables must themselves be predicted if they are to

be a guÂ±de to future values of incomes, so that the innovation in

permanent income will ultimately be a function, not only of the income

innovation, but also of the innovations in all of these other variables.

West (1985) has shown that, in spite of these complexities, expansion of

the information set cannot increase the variance of the innovations to

permanent income, at least provided that the discount rate is positive

and that permanent income is discounted over an infinite horizon.

Discounting is the key to this result. If, for example, today's

unemployment rate helps predict tomorrow's income, knowledge of the fact

can help shift some of today's uncertainty to tomorrow at which date

unemployment itself will have to be forecast in order to get the next

day's income. But, with a positive discount rate, the postponement of

shocks helps reduce the innovation variance in the estimate of permanent

income.   I have not made any progress in attempts to quantify the size of

this reduction, and remain doubtful the that more complex forecasting

equation can resolve the paradox. Even so, it remains an important

avenue for further research.



2.2   Why is consumption so smooth? Aggregation and separability.



One plausible explanation for the smoothness of consumption is that

individuals have a great deal of personal, idiosyncratic information

about the likely future course of their labor income, so that even if

their income path looked very noisy to an observer, it would contain few
                                          -26-



                        sh
                             +       eh
                                 Ut                          (13)



                       sh
             Et
                  =          +C eh                          (14)

                                                            (15)




 If, as seems reasonable, it is assumed that each sub-component of

 averages to zero over the population, then aggregate average
                                                                consumption
 Lc and income zy are given by




                      uS                                    (16)



                  =
                      Ut                                    (17)



so that consumption can be smoother than income if the variance of the

average surprise component of the common innovation is less than the

 variance of the aggregate innovation. If u is genuinely unpredictable

at the aggregate level, it is hard to see why it should be predictable by

individuals; it is by definition an aggregate surprise. The ability of

individuals to anticipate a large component of their own incomes is

largely irrelevant to the relationship between aggregate (common) shocks

in income and consumption, at least in this simple model.



If not aggregation, then what? One simple possibility is to abandon the

intertemporal additivity assumption with which I began. I think that
                                    â€”25â€”




surprises for the individual so that consumption would nevertheless be

very smooth. The question is whether this explanation can carry through

to the aggregate.



Unfortunately, relatively little is known for certain about the

relationship between individual and aggregate income fluctuations over

time. There is considerable and accumulating evidence that the income

changes observed in panel data such as the PSID are heavily contaminated

by errors of measurement. For example, by comparing two different wage

indicators in the PSID, Altonji (1985) estimates that 72.2 of the

observed variance of wages is measurement error, see also Abowd and Card

(1985) and Ashenfelter (1985) for other evidence that is consistent with

this finding. In consequence, I have no direct evidence to offer, only a

balance of argument.



Consider the simplest case where, for each consumer h, labor income as

perceived by an outsider follows a random walk. Write this as




                    =
                        u+                                   (12)



where u is a common     component across all agents, and    is the
idiosyncratic   component which averages to zero over the population as a

whole. Decompose each of these into their (by individual h) anticipated

and unanticipated components, with consumption responding only to the

latter
                                        -28-




taking c =    c   -
                      c1      as instrents, and then shows how to


rewrite the budget constraint so as to define corresponding prices that

reflect not only market prices of the goods, but also the costs or

benefits of consumption now in terms of pleasure foregone later. Doing

this gives a budget constraint under certainty of




             pc = W       -
                              ac {l -/(1 +r)}                  (19)



             Pt =     (1 +r)_t     {/(i +r)}k                  (20)




where W is the usual discounted present value of human and

nonhuman wealth. If preferences are such that c is constant over time,

then the consumption function has the form




      c =    c1+ B      [y -
                                 arc     -
                                             /(l   +r)}1 1     (21)



where 8 (1 +r -a)/(1+r) and permanent income is as conventionally

defined. If r is small enough, 13(1 - a) and the second term in square

brackets is small so that for the differenced version, we have




         =
              ac1+       (1 -
                                 a)Ly                           (22)
                                    -27-


this   ought to be done with some reluctance, since almost any lag pattern

between income and consumption can be modeled by a insertion of suitable

lags of consumption and hours into the current period subutility

function; In consequence, the hypothesis loses much of its sharpness and

predictive power. Nevertheless, if the evidence is against additivity,

then alternatives must be explored. If lagged hours affects the

enjoyment of current leisure, and if current consumption and leisure are

not separable within the period, there is no problem in explaining the

"excess sensitivity" finding, that the changes in consumption depends on

last period's income, and there is a growing body of work that interprets

the evidence in this way, see e.g. Kydland and Prescott (1982),

Eichenbaum, Hansen, and Singleton (1984), and Singleton (1984). There is

also a long tradition of modeling "habit-formation" or "stock-effects" in

the demand analysis literature, see Phlips (1972), Houthakker and Taylor

(1970), and especially the elegant work of Spinnewyn (1979a), (1979b).

Such models can also explain the smoothness of consumption in relation to

income.



Consider the simplest model of non-separability recently discussed and

applied to British data by Muellbauer (1985). The utility function is




       u =
             (1+Ã´Ytv(ct
                          -
                              ac1), >O                    (18)




where a is a measure of habit formation. Spinnewyn suggests taking
                                    -30-




 hence the relationship between innovations to income and changes in

 permanent income. Note also that the first difference of y is a

 stationary process and can easily be seen to be a (restricted) ARMA(2,2).



 Watson contrasts this unobserved components model with the AR(1) first

 differences model as a description of the logarithm of real GDP, a

 quantity that has very similar time series properties to those of real

 disposable income. Not surprisingly, the AR(2) for the second component

 looks very similar to the AR(2) implied by the ARINA(1,1,0) in the

differenced model, and the growth term g is the mean of y. Moreover,

both models perform about equally well over the sample (1949 through

1984), though the unobservable components model does somewhat better in

tests of longer-run forecasting ability. However, because the
                                                                          -



unobservable components model attributes only a fraction of the current

innovation to shifts in the underlying trend, the effects of innovations

on present discounted values are much less than in the ARIMA, so that

such a model is entirely consistent with the change in permanent income

being substantially less than the innovation in income. Watson's

analysis therefore provides us with a model that allows permanent

supply-side shocks but is nevertheless consistent with consumption being

smoother than income.



In a very recent paper, Campbell and Mankiw (1986) have directly

addressed the question of the extent to which innovations in GDP are

permanent. They use exact maximum likelihood methods to estimate a wide

range of ARI'IA processes for the first differences of the logarithm of

GDP, and use the results to calculate the fraction of an innovation that
                                    -29-




If we assume that 80% of permanent income eventually gets consumed as

non-durable goods and services, then the variance results given above

require an etimate of a of 0.78, so that current consumption exerts a

very high price in terms of future enjoyment.



2.3 Alternative specifications for the income process.



Each of the alternative income generation processes can be modified in a

number of different ways. The deterministic trend model is an example of

an unobserved components model, in which the time series is decomposed

into two or more components. A model that is very close to this has

recently been proposed by Watson (1986). In his model, the trend is not

deterministic but is modelled as a random walk with drift, but as in our

original model, there is a low order stationary process in addition to

the trend. The model can therefore be written in the form



                     x +     z                               (23)


                =   g   +       Ã·                            (24)
                                    vlt

                =           +              +
                    a1z1         a2z2          v2            (25)




where v1 and v2 are two mutually orthogonal white noise processes. Note

that, if the variance of v1 is zero, Watson's model is exactly the same

as an AR(2) around a deterministic trend, but the addition of v1 permits

the trend itself to shift. In consequence, innovations in y will contain

innovations in both v1, which are permanent, and innovations in v2, which

are not. The ratio of the variances of the two types of innovations

determines the fraction of any given innovation that will persist and
                                        -32-




 unanticipated events is surely one that makes a great deal of sense. A

 simple form of a "surprise" consumption function estimated on the same

 U.S. quarterly data is shown in the first column of Table 2. Once again,

 the   income -variable is   the Blinder and Deaton (1975) series for labor

 income, not the conventional NIPA magnitude. The dependent variable is

the change in the logarithm of consumption of non-durable goods and

services. Lagged consumption is included in order to capture any

possible habit-formation effects, while lagged income is included largely

to test for "excess sensitivity". The change in income is decomposed

with reference to a supplementary equation (not shown) in which the

change is explained by two lags each of income and consumption together

with a quadratic time trend. Time is included to model the very long-run

moving average of income that is predicted by the aggregation theory of

Section 1 above. The econometric procedure is to first run the supple-

mentary regression followed by the main regression with the expectations

and surprises replaced by their calculated values from the first stage.

The standard errors are calculated by a straightforward application of

Newey's (1984) method; for all the models shown here, the results of

Pagan (1984) and Bean (1985) apply, so that the procedure is

asymptotically fully efficient, and the standard errors are identical to

the raw OLS standard errors for the ?tsurprise?? terms, and to the

two-stage least squares standard errors for the others. All standard

errors and results could have been equivalently obtained by applying

three stage least squares to the system.



Column   (1) of Table 2 shows the   basic regression with only income and

consumption included. It shows little evidence that the rational
                                  -31â€”




is expected to persist indefinitely. Their results, though not

inconsistent with the belief that such a question is hard to answer,

suggest thatinnovations are persistent, frequently with a long-run

effect that is larger than their immediate impact. If these results

survive further testing, we are back with the original paradox.

Life-cycle theory predicts that changes in consumption should be larger

than innovations in income, and the prediction is false.



At the present, it is probably safest to reserve judgment. It is clear

that the nature of real disposable income or of GDP is such that it is

extremely difficult to discriminate between a wide range of different

time series representations, all of which have similar short-run

properties, but which differ radically in the way in which they respond

in the long-run to short-run shocks. And not surprisingly, the data are

much more informative about short-run than about long-run properties.

Unfortunately however, the relationship between consumption and income

depends on the long-run properties of the income generation process, the

very properties about which we know very little. If further research

cannot modify this conclusion, then in the end, the study of the income

process will have told us very little about the structure of the

consumption function, and the promise that is held out bythe rational

expectations approach will remain unfulfilled.



2.4 Surprise consumption functions and excess sensitivity



Whatever the final verdict on rational expectations consumption

functions, the distinction that they recognize between anticipated and
                                    -34-




 surprises matter is resoundingly rejected, whether or not lagged

 consumption is included in the regression, though now the coefficients on

 the two wealth terms are sufficiently different to permit a rejection of

 the traditi-onal formulation without the decomposition. Note also that if

 the coefficients on lagged consumption and income are equal and opposite,

 consumption has a long run unit elasticity with respect to income and the

model is of the partial adjustment variety that has recently been much

 recommended in Britain by Hendry and his collaborators, Davidson, Hendry,

Srba and Yeo (1978), Davidson and Hendry (1981), and Hendry (1983). In

both models this restriction is rejected at the 0.5% level or less.



More and more detailed results of this kind can be found in Blinder and

Deaton (1985), and there are more elaborate models in which it is
                                                                         -




possible   to reject the traditional in favor of the surprise version.

However, here I am more concerned with evaluating an objection to this

type of testing that has recently been raised by Mankiw and Shapiro

(1986). Mankiw and Shapiro note, as in Section 2.1 above, that real

income is non-stationary, and they model it by a random walk.   They point
out that if the random walk formulation is correct, permanent income and

measured income are identical, so that if consumption is equal to

permanent income, all three series are the same random walk. Hence, if

the change in consumption is regressed on lagged income to test for

excess sensitivity, the regression is essentially the regression of a

random walk on its own first lag so that the excess sensitivity test is a

t-test. for the unit root in a first-order autoregression.   But as can be

checked from the tables provided by Dickey and Fuller (1981) for this

situation, the t-distribution is a poor guide to the actual distribution
                                   -33-




expectations model can help explain the data. The coefficient on the

unanticipated income term is almost identical with the coefficient on the

anticipated change in income, and the lagged value of income also

attractsa -statistically significant coefficient. The chi-squared test

for the joint exclusion of lagged and anticipated income has a p-value

that is less than one in 10,000, and even if the test is repeated with

lagged consumption excluded from the regression (so as to conform to

other tests such as that by Flavin), the 'surprises-only" hypothesis can

still be rejected at around the one percent level, the "variant" figure

in the table. However, the test against what I call the traditional

model, one in which there are no surprises, is accepted. The

decomposition of the change in income into its components has no

significant effect in the regression, and offers no improvement over     -




regressing   consumption on income, income lagged, consumption lagged, and

time. This "traditional" formulation has graced (or disgraced) standard

Keynesian macroeconometric models for decades, and has been widely

attacked on rational expectations grounds. And while it may be difficult

to defend from a theoretical perspective, it is entirely consistent with

the data.



Column two show the results of including wealth terms, again decomposed

into anticipated and unanticipated terms. As before, prediction

equations are fitted for these variables, and the VAR's are extended to

include two lags of wealth. The results for the wealth variable are much

more satisfactory, with anticipated changes in wealth having no

significant effect, while wealth surprises have a highly significant

positive effect on consumption. However, the hypothesis that 21Y
                                   -36-




 formulation, consumption responds one for one to the innovation in income

 and has no other source of variation. The model that was estimated was



               b0 +   b1logy i+ btime + error                 (31)



 In a hundred replications, errors were drawn from independent normal

 distributions, and the income and consumption series calculated afresh

 each time, with their actual value in 1953 serving as a base for the

 calculations. The technical problem here is, as in Nankiw and Shapiro,

 the non-stationarity of the income series in the regression, so that

standard results cannot be called on to derive the distribution of the

calculated t't-statistics.' We would expect the difficulties to be most

severe when the consumption series is most closely linked to the income

series, i.e. in the baseline case where t1 and there is no independent

innovation in consumption.



Table 3 presents the results. The baseline case, though for a different

model than that used by Mankiw and Shapiro, and one that is more like the

actual data, essentially reproduces their results. The mean value of

the absolute value of the t-statistjcs is 2.25 with a standard error of

0.075, and the true null hypothesis that lagged income isabsent from the

regression is rejected 62% of the time. The rest of the experiments

differ from the first in that by setting    = .003842, an independent

source of variation is introduced into the change of consumption. In the

case where t=0.3, this setting replicates the observed variance of the

change in log consumption. This makes little difference to the results
                                  â€”35-




of the so-called t-statistic in this situation, even asymptotically.

Mankiw and Shapiro generate artificial series for income and consumption

on the assumption that consumption equals permanent income and that the

random wÃ lk model is true. They then find in a Monte Carlo experiment in

which the change in consumption is regressed on lagged income and a time

trend, that the median value of the t-statistic on the latter is -2.2

with a consequent "excess sensitivity" finding 61% of the time, even

though the rational expectations permanent income model is true.



Mankiw and Shapiro's procedures are somewhat different from those in

Table 2, and the time series analysis presented above does not suggest

that income is a pure random walk. However, the parallels are close

enough to be worrying, and it seemed worth discovering how sensitive the

Mankiw and Shapiro results would be to variations of their assumptions in

the directions of the models estimated here.   I work with the following

artificial model:



     Alogc = a +tu2 +   u1       E(u4.) 0, Var(u,t)O           (26)




1logy = p +            +                                       (27)
              plogy        u2   E(u2t) 0, Var(u2) a


Equation (27) replicates reality, and in all the experiments reported

below I use the estimated parameter values and variances to generate the

data. For equation (26), I always take a to be the sample mean of logc

over 1954,1 to 1984,4. Ny base case, corresponding as closely as

possible to that of Mankiw and Shapiro, is where t1 and      =0. In this
                                     -38-




 coefficients, particularly those on income and wealth, are more or Less

 unchanged,   and the tests for the surprises only hypothesis and for the

 traditional formulation give the same results as before. The test for

 the longâ€”run unit elasticity are, however, extremely sensitive to the

 inclusion of the time trend. Of course, these results do not tell us

whether or not the time trend ought to be in the regression, but that

given the non-stationarity of income and consumption, it is very

difficult to tell. However, these time-series problems, although real

and potentially misleading, do not appear to be the source of the finding

of excess sensitivity.



Section 3.    Summary a.nd conclusions.




The argument in this paper may be briefly summarized as follows:



(1) Nonâ€”parametric tests using aggregate time series data suggest that

the representative consumer life-cycle model is likely to have difficulty

in explaining the evidence on the joint movement of the real after tax

interest rate and changes in consumption. Taking consumption and labor

supply jointly helps very little. This is hardly surprising since the

labor supply model does even worse at explaining the evidence on hours

and wages than does the consumption model at explaining consumption and

interest rates. These tests are very naive and hardly constitute a

convincing rejection of the life-cycle model. But the question arises as

to how much intellectual effort is worth expending in the attempt to

rescue a model that seems to be so blatantly at odds with the raw,

untreated data.
                                  -37â€”




if   remains as high as unity. However, as is reduced, so that the

change in consumption varies less with the shock to income, the t-values

become smaller, though even in the (realistic) case where t=O.3, the mean

is stilF 1:46 and the null would be rejected in 26% of the cases. If the

t-values were normally distributed, the expected values would be

2/J(2Tt)=O.8O, and the rejection frequency would be 5%. Experiments 1-3b

reproduce the three previous ones but with the time trend excluded.

There is a remarkable improvement with the t-vaiues much closer to their

theoretical values and rejection frequencies of 8%, 7%, and 5%

respectively. Clearly, it is the presence of the time trend that causes

the greatest difficulty and without it there are no great difficulties in

making inferences in the usual way. The final experiment sets t=2.12

which is the theoretically correct value if the rational expectations    -




model is true given the process determining income. These results are

essentially the same as when 1=1; things do not get any worse, (Note that

these results do not suggest that a model of this kind could have

generated the actual data. If it had, we would indeed be likely to make

incorrect inferences, but the data would look very different, and in

particular changes in consumption would have a very much larger variance

than changes in income.)



The results of these experiments suggest that the results discussed above

should be recalculated without the time trends. The new results are

reported on the right hand side of Table 2, and the differences are not

as large as suggested by the Monte Carlo results. Here, the main

interaction is between the time trend and the lagged consumption term,

which does not figure in the excess sensitivity tests. Other
                                   -40-




 contain non-stationary variables. However, these difficulties do not

yield an adequate explanation of why consumption appears to respond to

 information that is not previously unanticipated.

(ii) Unless consumers are immortal, or unless their children simply pick

up the eternal dynastic consumption track where their parents left off,

the life-cycle model does not predict that aggregate data should be

explicable by a representative consumer model. In particular, the rate

of growth of average consumption should not be directly related to the

real rate of interest. This casts doubt on the rationale for "Euler

equation" type consumption models which rest heavily on the relationship

between these two variables.



(iii) The evolution of real disposable income over time, whether

including or excluding capital income, is well described by an AR(l) in

the first difference with a positive autoregressive term. Given this,

changes in aggregate consumption ought to have a variance that is greater

than the variance of the innovation in the income process. This

prediction is falsified by the evidence, and it seems unlikely that

inappropriate aggregation can explain this conflict with life cycle

theory. The finding can be explained by habit formation, and/or by the

adoption of different time-series processes for income, though the

question of whether these last are appropriate is very far from being

settled.



(iv) Surprise consumption functions estimated on quarterly U.S.

aggregate time-series show clear evidence of excess sensitivity of

consumption to predictable events. This excess sensitivity is consistent

with a simple minded traditional view in which the distinction between

anticipated and unanticipated income terms is ignored. There are very

real problems associated with inference in models such as these which

Notes:- DC and DLNC are the backward first differences in the levels and
logarithms, the latter x 100, of consumption of nondurable goods and
services, excluding clothing and footwear. RR is the real after tax rate
of interest from t-1 to t. It is computed from the treasury bill rate by
applying the implicit rate of tax revealed by comparing AAA municipal with
AAA corporate bonds. The change in the logarithm of the price deflator of
full NIPA consumption is subtracted on a quarterly basis, and converted
to annual rates of return. DH1 is the first difference of average hours
per employee from the Citibase tape. D112 is the first difference of
average weekly hours of production workers in manufacturing. DLNW is 100
times the annual change in the real value of average hourly earnings, not
corrected for overtime, of production workers in manufacturing.
