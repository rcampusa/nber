              The After Tax Rate of Return
                Affects Private Savings

                          ABSTRACT


     This paper reviews theoretical argurrents and empirical

evidence regarding the interest elasticity of savings. It

concludes that there are strong theoretical reasons to expect

an increase in after tax rates of return to increase private

savings. Moreover, the empirical rrethods used in imst previous

studies are likely to produce underestimates of the interest

elasticity of savings. New evidence based on direct estimation

of utility function paraneters suggests that savings are likely

to be highly interest elastic. The paper concludes by noting

that too little tirre has passed to evaluate the effects of the

savings incentives contained in recent tax legislation.

         The effects of the rate of return on the level of savings and the

rate of capital formation are of central concern to both economists and

policymakers. Although the welfare effects of tax reforms do not directly

depend on their impact on savings, the effects of taxes on savings is crucial

to considerations of tax incidence and equity and to the issue of long run

growth. The impact of the rate of return on consumption and savings decisions

also bears on questions regarding the appropriate government discount rate,

the short run crowding out effects of fiscal policy, and the effects of

public indebtedness on capital intensity.

         The traditional view among economists is that changes in the rate of

return are likely to have only a small effect on the savings rate. This

consensus is supported by theoretical arguments pointing to the opposing income

and substitution effects associated with changes in the rate of return. The

ambiguous implications of theory are matched by empirical studies which yield

conflicting estimates as to the size of the impact of changes in the rate of

return. The polar empirical estimate is Michael Boskin's (1978) suggestion

that the interest elasticity of savings is .4. This estimate is widely regarded

as too high.

         This paper re—examines the theoretical arguments and reviews new

empirical evidence regarding the interest elasticity of savings. Both the

theoretical analysis and the empirical work demonstrate the strong likelihood

that increases in the real after—tax rate of return received by savers would

lead to substantial increases in long run capital accumulation. While it is

not possible to quantify the impact with any precision, it seems reasonable

to believe that a shift towards expenditure taxation would lead to signifi-

cant increases in the private savings rate.   I argue that the failure of
                                  —2—


traditional empirical approaches to isolate significant rate of return effects

is a consequence of their failure to distinguish between transitory and per—

manent changes in the rate of return, and of other specification errors.

         The theoretical analysis emphasizes the importance of recognizing

heterogeneity among savers in examining the effects of tax changes which raise

the rate of return available to savers. It begins by demonstrating that even

if all savings decisions are determined by rule of thumb, savings are likely

to be elastic with respect to the rate of return, as long as the rules of

thumb differ persistently across households. The effects of changes in the

rate of return on savings are then considered in a realistic multi—period life—

cycle framework. Within such a framework, the importance of recognizing future

labor income in analyzing savings is stressed. It is shown that for a wide

range of utility function parameters, the interest elasticity of savings is

likely to be positive. Since recent research suggests the importance of bequests

in determining aggregate capital formation, models of intergenerational transfers

are also considered. It is shown that as long as any part of the economy is

comprised of households with operative intergenerational transfer motives the

long run impact is also likely to be substantial. While the sign of the

response of savings to a change in the interest rate cannot be determined

unambiguously from theoretical considerations, consideration of several models

leads to a presumption in favor of a positive response.

         Section I discusses theoretical approaches to the linkage between

savings and the rate of return. Section II critiques the traditional consump-

tion function approach to examining rate of return effects on savings behavior,

and reviews estimates obtained using alternative new methodologies. Section

III concludes the paper by discussing the implications of the results for

current economic policy discussion.

I. Theoretical Considerations

         In a closed economy, it is not possible to imagine how the rate of.

return to savers could change without other relevant economic variables also

changing. Thus, it is necessary to be clear about the nature of the shock

causing the rate of return to change. Discussions of the "interest elasticity

of savings" are apt to be misleading since the change in savings associated

with any given change in the rate of return to savers will depend on what

caused the rate of return to change. The analysis here focuses on the effects

of tax policies which alter the rate of return available to savers. Any tax

change will affect revenue collections and so must be associated with

changes in either government spending, public borrowing or other tax collections.

The analysis here is all based on a differential incidence approach, where it

is assumed that spending and total revenue collections remain constant so that

changes in capital income taxes are offset by adjustments to payroll or con—

sumption taxes. All the discussion is, therefore, about compensated effects.

An effort is made to maintain this distinction in drawing implications from

the empirical work in the discussion below)'

         The discussion here focuses on the "partial equilibrium effects" of a

change in the rate of return. It is assumed that factor prices are unaffected

by changes in the savings rate. Thus the analysis addresses the supply of

savings schedule rather than the reduced form relationship between tax changes

and capital intensity. In the special cases of a small open economy or a

production function with an infinite elasticity of substitution, the assumption

of constant factor prices will be valid. Otherwise, it would be necessary

to consider the aggregate production function in assessing the ultimate effect

of a change in tax policy on private savings.
                                   —4—

Rule of Thumb Savings

         Economic theory needs to simplify reality enormously if anything

tractable is to result. But it is important to acknowledge at the outset that

no single analytic model can capture the complex motivations for any one

individual's savings decisions let alone the savings decisions of the entire

population. It turns out the existence of substantial diversity in savings

behavior, creates a presumption in favor of a positive savings response to

increases in the rate of return.

         Consider a population made up of "rule of thumb savers" each of whom

saves regardless of the rate of return a fixed fraction of his total disposable

income. The "rule of thumb" rate of saving varies across individuals; some

are liquidity constrained and consume everything, others may have a quite high

marginal propensity to save. Now imagine a reduction in the tax rate on capital

income, financed by an equal revenue yield increase in labor income tax rate.

Such a measure would, assuming some persistence in savings propensities,

redistribute income from persons with low to persons with high savings propen-

sities. As a consequence national savings would increase, even though no

individual's savings incentive was affected. As time passes, the savings rate

will rise further, as the share of total income going to persons with high

savings propensities increases.

Life Cycle Savings

         Perhaps the dominant theoretical model used by economists in analyzing

long run questions relating to savings behavior is the life—cycle hypothesis

of Franco Modigliani. In an earlier paper, Summers (1981), I argued that

realistic formulations of the life—cycle hypothesis implied a very substantial

long run response of capital accumulation to tax measures that change after tax
                                  —5—

rates of return. The essential reason for the responsiveness of savings was

the "human wealth" effect associated with changes in the after tax rate of

return. Increases in the after tax rate of return reduce human wealth defined

as the present value of individuals' labor income claims. This effect is

absent in the two period textbook formulations with all income received in

the first period.

         The claims put forward in Summers (1981) about the high interest

elasticity of avings have been challenged by Evans (1983) and Starrett (1982)

who argue that they do not survive generalization of the model. Evans'

principal point is that if one assumes a significantly negative time preference

rate and a very low intertemporal elasticity of substitution, a relatively

small interest elasticity of substitution will result. His rhetoric seems

rather overblown given that the elasticity is positive in every case he

considers, and greater than .4 in most cases. Moreover, empirical evidence

casts doubt on the relevance of the parameter values underlying Evans' low

elasticity cases. Starrett (1982) shows that lower elasticities of savings

can be generated using non—homeothetic utility functions. However, both

empirical evidence and theoretical considerations support the standard proce-

dure of imposing homeotheticity. On balance, there remains reason to believe

that life—cycle saving is very likely to respond positively to after tax rates

of return, but the question is ultimately an empirical one.

Bequest Savings

         Recent research [e.g., Kotlikoff and Summers (1981)] suggests that

bequests may account for a large fraction of national capital formation.

The papers by Evans (1983) and Starrett (1982) discussed above argue that

taking account of bequests makes it very plausible that the interest elasticity
                                  —6—

of savings is negative. The critical issue is how bequests are modelled.

In Summers (1982), I establish the following results. As long as any part

of the population is saving for altruistic bequests, the long run partial

equilibrium elasticity of savings with respect to the rate of return will be

infinite. Illustrative calculations suggest that it is likely to be very high

in the short run as well. Thus taking account of bequests increases the pre-

dicted elasticity of savings.

         Of course alternative formulations of the bequest process are possible,

although it seems hard to entirely rule out altruism. My own favorite is

outlined in Bernheim, Shleifer and Summers (1983). It has implications similar

to the standard life cycle model. Seidman (1983) incorporates bequests into

my (1981) model by assuming that they generate utility directly for donors and

get results qualitatively similar to mine. Evans gets low or negative elastic-

ities only by assuming counterfactually that bequests are typically passed

over a span of two generations, and by employing an ad hoc treatment that

allows for no substitutability between bequests and consumption in donors'

utility functions. He presents no evidence to support either of these assumptions.

         The combination of the considerations discussed in this section suggest

that the data should be approached with at least a mild presumption in favor

of the hypothesis that savings respond positively to real after tax rates

of return. There are certainly internally consistent theoretical models which

lead to a different conclusion but their premises do not seem compelling. We

now turn to the empirical evidence.



II. Empirical Evidence

         A large number of authors including Wright (1970, 1979), Weber (1970,
                                     —7—

 1975), Boskin (1978), Howrey and Hymans (1980), and Blinder (1981) have

attempted to estimate the effects of changes in the rate of return on con-

sumption and savings using Keynesian consumption functions. No consensus

has emerged. Only Boskin obtains a statistically significant and substantial

positive interest elasticity of savings. Howrey and Hymans (1980) show that

his results are extremely sensitive to the choice of sample period, and to

issues of data construction. I believe that there are fundamental conceptual

problems which make it almost inconceivable that consumption function estima-

tion can ever answer the questions of interest. Three difficulties seem

paramount.

         First, theory, particularly in the case of life cycle savers, suggests

that the value of consumers' endowments is a function of the interest rate.

Increases in the real after tax interest rate reduce the value of human wealth,

and may affect marketable wealth as well. These effects are not captured in

standard formulations. When they are taken account of using a full macro-

economic model as in Nodigliani (1971), or a modified single equation consump-

tion function as in Summers (1982), dramatic positive effects of increases in

rates of return on savings result.

         Second, the question of primary interest to persons concerned with tax

policy is the response of savings to permanent changes in the real after tax

rates of return. The experiments provided by history came in the form of

largely transitory changes in after tax rates of return. Both theory and

common sense suggest the response to temporary changes in rates of return

should be much smaller than the response to permanent changes. This creates

a strong presumption that simple extrapolation of the historical experience

will lead to very substantial underestimates of the response of savings to
                                  —8—

permanent changes in the rate of return. This presumption is magnified by    the
very high noise—signal ratio in any attempted estimates of the real after

tax rate of return over a long horizon.

         Third, there are the standard set of difficulties associated with

any Keynesian consumption function. Almost all the right hand side variables

are probably endogenous. There is no satisfactory way of meeting the Lucas

critique in modelling expected future labor income. No variables are included

which address theoretically relevant issues such as the age structure of the

population, or expected retirement ages. In an important recent study,

Auerbach and Kotlikoff (1981) illustrate the behavior of an economy in which

the life—cycle hypothesis holds exactly, and then fit standard consumption

functions. The results indicate that parameter estimates are extremely

sensitive to the choice of sample period, and that estimated parameters do not

provided a useful guide to the effect of policy interventions.

        What then can be done? I have suggested the futility of standard

consumption function estimation for answering questions relating to long run

tax policies. Recent work by Grossman and Shiller (1981), Hensen and Singleton

(1982) and many others suggests an alternative approach. In general, it is

possible to estimate the parameters of the utility function driving consumers'

behavior, even where it is impossible to estimate any kind of structural

consumption function. Essentially identification comes from the requirement

that consumers satisfy certain first order conditions for utility maximization.

This can be done using data on individual consumers as in Runkle (1983)

and Shapiro (1983) or, with aggregation assumptions, on aggregate data.

Allowance can be made for the possibility that some consumers are liquidity

constrained. Once utility functions have been directly estimated, simulation
                                  —9—

exercises of the sort performed in my 1981 paper can be used to estimate the

effects of tax reforms. Of course much more complex analyses taking account

of individual diversity, and adding realistic information on wage earnings

profiles should be possible.

         At this point, the results of such elaborate simulation exercises

cannot be predicted. However available evidence tends to suggest that savings

are likely to be interest elastic. I find in the more reliable estimates in

my 1982 paper, values of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution which

cluster at the high end of the range Evans and I considered. Similar estimates

are found using micro—data by Shapiro (1983) and by Hansen and Singleton (1982).

Where investigators find low estimates of intertemporal elasticity of substi-

tution, it is usually because of the difficulty in modelling ex—ante rates

of return on corporate stock. It is also noteworthy that if proper allowance

is made for trend growth in the economy, estimated time preference rates are

positive, reinforcing the positive effects of rates of return on savings.

Future research, particularly using micro—data, will help to refine these

conclusions and will enhance considerably our understanding of savings behavior.



III. Policy Implications

         The U.S. economy now appears to be plagued by large structural budget

deficits which appear likely to continue for the remainder of the decade un-

less major policy actions are taken. Private savings rates as measured in the

National Income and Product Accounts do not appear to have increased along

with the budget deficits. Indeed, many observers have expressed surprise that

given the tax measures enacted in 1981, and the subsequent run up in real

interest rates, savings rates have not increased sharply. Some go as far
                                  — 10 —



as to call this a serious blow to supply side economics.

         Several observations should help to put this discussion in perspective.

Unless savings are extraordinarily elastic with respect to rates of return,

reductions in taxes will reduce the total supply of savings. Reduced public

savings will not be offset by increases in private savings. The hope of

those who advocated savings incentives was that in the long run the revenue

effects of these measures would be offset by reductions in spending or increases

in other taxes. There is no serious case that permanent public dissavings

to finance incentives is a viable strategy for raising national savings.

         Does the stability of the private savings rate over the last several

years constitute evidence against the view that savings respond positively

to rate of return incentives? Probably the sample is too short to permit

conclusive judgments. Many other things happened over the last several years.

For example, if the accrued gains to households on common stock are treated

as part of income, the private savings rate was close to 20 percent over the

last 18 months. At the same time that wealth was rising rapidly, households

were suffering through a severe temporary recession, tending to put further

downward pressure on savings rates. A final factor working to make the

private savings rate appear artificially low in recent years has been the

erosion of inflation, which has led to unmeasured increases in real disposable

income and savings.

         These factors lead to the conclusion that the evidence is not in on

the savings aspect of Reagan's economic experiment. One of the few virtues

of the macro—economic turmoil we have suffered in recent years is that it

has increased the power of our econometric experiments by raising the

variance of most exogenous variables. Within a few years we should have made

considerable progress towards resolving the uncertainties discussed in this paper.

1/ As noted below, "compensated savings effects" are not well defined because
    savings are not a commodity. As illustrated in Summers (1981), the effect
    of a tax change will depend on the timing of compensation.

2/ The argument here is developed rigorously in Seidman (1983) and Summers (1982).

3/ Evans also repeats without attribution the analysis in my 1978 working
    paper suggesting that the short run elasticity with respect to a permanent
    change in the rate of return will exceed the long run elasticity. Without
    explanation, he calls this implausible and claims that it undercuts the
    long run analysis. Evans also speaks of a "general equilibrium" elasticity
    which is less than the partial equilibrium elasticity I compute. Figure 1
