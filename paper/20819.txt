                                              ABSTRACT

Using a unique dataset of daily U.S. and U.K. price listings and the associated number of clicks for
precisely defined goods from a major shopping platform, we shed new light on how prices are set
in online markets, which have a number of special properties such as low search costs, low costs of
monitoring competitors' prices, and low costs of nominal price adjustment. We document that although
online prices are more flexible than offline prices, they continue to exhibit relatively long spells of
fixed prices, large size and low synchronization of price changes, considerable cross-sectional dispersion,
and low sensitivity to predictable or unanticipated changes in demand conditions. Qualitatively these
patterns are similar to those observed for offline prices, which calls for more research on the sources
of price rigidities and dispersion.

1    Introduction
Internet firms such as Google, Amazon, and eBay are revolutionizing the retail sector as there has been an
explosion in the volume and coverage of goods and services sold online. In 2013, Amazon alone generated
$74.5 billion in revenue—approximately the revenue of Target Corporation, the second largest discount
retailer in the United States—and carried 230 million items for sale in the United States—nearly 30 times
the number sold by Walmart, the largest retailer in the world. While virtually nonexistent 15 years ago,
e-commerce sales stood at $263.3 billion and accounted for 5.6 percent of total retail sales in the U.S.
economy in 2013. The rise of e-commerce has been truly a global phenomenon. Between 2006 and 2011,
the average annual growth rate of global online retail sales was 13 percent (A.T. Kearney 2012) and global
e-commerce sales are expected to reach $1.4 trillion by 2015 (Cisco 2011). While visionaries of the internet
age are utterly bold in their predictions, one can already exploit special properties of online retail, such as
low search costs, low costs of monitoring competitors’ prices, and low costs of nominal price adjustment,
to shed new light on some perennial questions in economics and the workings of future markets.
    We use a unique dataset of daily price listings for precisely defined goods (at the level of unique product
codes) from a major shopping platform (SP) to examine price setting practices in online markets in the
United States and the United Kingdom, two countries with developed internet retail industry. This dataset
covers an exceptionally broad spectrum of consumer goods and sellers over the period of nearly two years.
Importantly, we have the number of clicks for each price listing so that we have a measure of how relevant
listings are for consumers. We document a number of stylized facts about properties of online prices
(frequency of price adjustment, price synchronization across sellers and across goods, size of price changes)
and compare our findings to results reported for price data from conventional, brick-and-mortar stores.
Similarities or differences in the properties of prices across online and offline stores inform us about the
nature and sources of sluggish price adjustment, price discrimination, price dispersion, and many other
important dimensions of market operation.
    Our main result is that online prices (especially prices with a large number of clicks) are more flexible
than prices in conventional stores. Yet, the difference in properties of prices across internet and brick-
and-mortar stores is quantitative rather than qualitative. That is, despite the power of the internet, the
behavior of online prices is consistent with smaller but still considerable frictions, thus questioning the
validity of popular theories of sticky prices and, more generally, price setting. By some metrics, prices of
goods sold online could be as imperfect as prices of goods sold in regular markets.
    Specifically, we find that, despite small physical costs of price adjustment, the duration of price spells
in online markets is about 7 to 20 weeks, depending on the treatment of sales. While this duration is
considerably shorter than the duration typically reported for prices in brick-and-mortar stores, online prices
clearly do not adjust every instant. The median absolute size of a price change in online markets, another
measure of price stickiness, is 11 percent in the United States and 5 percent in the United Kingdom, which
is comparable to the size of price changes in offline stores. Sales in online markets are about as frequent
as sales in conventional stores (the share of goods on sale is approximately 1.5–2 percent per week) but
the average size of sales (10–12 percent or less in the U.S. and 6 percent or less in the U.K.) is considerably
smaller. We use rich cross-sectional variation of market and good characteristics to analyze how they are
related to various pricing moments. We find, for example, that the degree of price rigidity is smaller when



                                                      1
markets are more competitive; that is, with a larger number of sellers, the frequency of price changes
increases and the median size decreases.
    Although costs of monitoring competitors’ prices and costs of search for better prices are extraordinar-
ily low in online markets, we observe little synchronization of price changes across sellers, another key
statistics for non-neutrality of nominal shocks. In particular, the synchronization rate is approximately
equal to the frequency of price adjustment, suggesting that by and large online firms adjust their prices
independently of their competitors. Even over relatively long horizons, synchronization is low. We also fail
to find strong synchronization of price changes across goods within a seller; that is, a typical seller does
not adjust prices of its goods simultaneously. Finally, we document that the synchronization rates for sales
across goods for a given seller and across sellers for a given good are similar to the frequency of sales.
    In line with Warner and Barsky (1995), we find some evidence that prices in online stores respond
to seasonal changes in demand during Thanksgiving and Christmas, which is similar to the behavior of
prices in regular stores. We also show that there is large variation in demand, proxied by the number
of clicks, over days of the week or month. For example, the number of clicks on Mondays is 33 percent
larger than the number of clicks on Saturdays. Yet, online prices appear to have little, if any, reaction
to these predictable changes in demand, which is inconsistent with the predictions of Warner and Barsky
(1995). We also do not find strong responses of online prices to the surprise component in macroeconomic
announcements about aggregate statistics such as the gross domestic product (GDP), consumer price index
(CPI), and unemployment rate. These findings are striking because online stores are uniquely positioned
to use dynamic pricing (i.e., instantaneously incorporate information about changes in demand and supply
conditions).
    We document ubiquitous price dispersion in online markets. For example, the standard deviation of log
prices for narrowly defined goods is 23.6 log points in the United States and 21.3 log points in the United
Kingdom. Even after removing seller fixed effects, which proxy for differences in terms of sales across
stores, the dispersion remains large. We also show that this high price dispersion cannot be rationalized by
product life cycle. Specifically, a chunk of price dispersion appears at the time a product enters the market
and price dispersion grows (rather than falls) as the product becomes older. Price dispersion appears to
be best characterized as spatial rather than temporal. In other words, if a store charges a high price for a
given good, it does so consistently over time rather than alternate the price between low and high levels.
In addition, price dispersion can be related to the degree of price stickiness, intensity of sales, and returns
on search.
    To underscore the importance of clicks, we also calculate and present all moments weighted by clicks.
Such weighting tends to yield results consistent with a greater flexibility of online markets relative to
conventional markets: price rigidities decline, cross-sectional price dispersion falls, synchronization of
price changes increases. For example, using weights reduces the median duration of price spells from 7–
12 to 5–7 weeks. Yet, even when we use click-based weights, online markets are far from being completely
flexible.
    Comparing prices in the United States and the United Kingdom offers additional insights.1 High pen-
etration of online trade in the two countries is largely due to availability of credit cards, a history of mail
order and catalogue shopping, and an early arrival of e-retailers, such as Amazon and eBay. Yet, there
   1
     In 2011, the value per head of business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce in the United Kingdom was £1,083, up 14 percent
from £950 in 2010, making it the leading nation in terms of e-commerce; see Ofcom (2012).

are important differences between the two markets. For example, population density is eight times higher
in the U.K. than in the U.S.; thus, it is easier to organize fast and frequent deliveries in the U.K. We find
that, despite the differences between the markets, price setting behavior is largely the same in the two
countries.
    Although e-commerce has been growing rapidly, there are only a few studies that focus on price ad-
justment in the sector. The data used in these studies typically cover a limited number of consumer goods
in categories that feature early adoption of e-trade, such as books and CDs (e.g., Brynjolfsson and Smith
2000), or span a short period of time, usually not exceeding a year (e.g., Lünnemann and Wintr 2011). In
spite of increasing efforts to scrape more and more prices online to broaden data coverage (Cavallo and
Rigobon 2011, Cavallo 2012, Cavallo, Neiman, and Rigobon 2014), we are aware of just one dataset that
contains information on the quantity margin.2 In contrast, the SP data used in this paper combine broad
coverage of consumer goods with information on the number of clicks each price quote received at the
daily frequency for almost two years, which has not been within the reach of researchers in the past.
    High-quality data for online prices are not only useful to estimate price rigidity and other properties
of price adjustment in online commerce but also allow comparing those with estimates available from
brick-and-mortar stores. Empirical studies on price stickiness usually document substantial price rigidity
in brick-and-mortar retail stores (Klenow and Kryvtsov 2008, Nakamura and Steinsson 2008, Klenow and
Malin 2010). Theoretical models explain it with exogenous time-dependent adjustment (Taylor 1980,
Calvo 1983), menu costs (Sheshinski and Weiss 1977, Mankiw 1985), search costs for consumers (Benabou
1988, 1992), costs of updating information (Mankiw and Reis 2002), or sticker costs3 (Diamond 1993).
However, all these explanations do not appear plausible for online markets, where costs of monitoring
competitors’ prices, search for a better price, or adjusting a price quote on a platform are significantly
smaller. Yet, we observe a fair amount of price stickiness in online markets.
    Why prices are sticky is important for real effects of nominal shocks. For example, in the standard
New Keynesian model with staggered price adjustment, nominal shocks change relative prices and, hence,
affect real variables (Woodford 2003).4 On the other hand, Head et al. (2012) construct a model with
price stickiness coming from search costs that delivers monetary neutrality. Overall, our results suggest
that standard macroeconomic models of price rigidities, which emphasize menu costs and search costs, are
likely incomplete. We do indeed observe more flexible prices in online markets, where these costs are much
smaller, but qualitatively the behavior of online prices is similar to offline prices. Since popular mechanisms
rationalizing imperfect price adjustment in traditional markets do not fit well into e-commerce, more
research is required to understand sources of price rigidities and dispersion.
    The rest of the paper is structured as follows. The data are described in the next section. Section 3 pro-
vides estimates of the frequency, synchronization, and size of price changes and sales and compares them
to pricing moments in brick-and-mortar stores. Section 4 examines properties of price dispersion in online
markets. This section also explores how product entry and exit are related to observed price dispersion

     Baye et al. (2009) use data from the Yahoo! Kelkoo price comparison site to estimate the price elasticity of clicks. They
document significant discontinuities in click elasticity at the minimum price in the PDA market. Their data cover 18 models sold
by 19 different retailers between September 2003 and January 2004.

     That is, inability of firms to change the price for inventories.

     In this model, price stickiness, in addition, leads to inflation persistence that is inherited from the underlying process for the
output gap or marginal cost. Modifications of this model that include shocks to the Euler equation, indexation of price contracts,
or “rule-of-thumb” behavior give rise to intrinsic inflation persistence; see Fuhrer (2006, 2010).

and other pricing moments. Section 5 looks at the variation of prices over time, including conventional
sales seasons and days of the week and month, and then focuses on price responses to macroeconomic
shocks at high frequencies. Concluding remarks are in Section 6.


2    Data
We use data from a leading online shopping platform on daily prices (net of taxes and shipping costs) and
clicks for more than 50,000 goods in 22 broadly-defined consumer categories in the United States and
the United Kingdom between May 2010 and February 2012. This dataset is a stratified random sample
of observations with at least one click per day obtained directly from the shopping platform; hence, it
is reliable and unlikely to have measurement error associated with scraping price observations from the
internet. A broad product coverage allows us to expand our understanding of how online markets work,
which up until now has been largely shaped by data on electronics, books, or apparel. Moreover, as the
good is defined at the unique product level, similar to the Universal Product Code (UPC), this dataset is
comparable to those used in the price-stickiness literature (e.g., scanner data) and therefore allows us
to compare price setting in online and brick-and-mortar stores. Having a large sample of sellers (more
than 27,000), we can look at price setting through the lens of competition between stores, analyze price
dispersion across them, and examine the effect of market characteristics on price adjustment. Next, since
the data are recorded at the daily frequency, we can study properties of prices at high frequencies. Last
and foremost, information on clicks can be used to focus on products that are relevant for online business.
Unfortunately, we do not have information on actual sales, local taxes, shipping costs, names of sellers,
or sellers’ costs. Although the sample period is long relative to previous studies of online markets, it is
not long enough to accurately measure store entry and exit, product turnover, or price behavior at longer
horizons. Overall, we use the most comprehensive dataset on online prices made available to researchers
by a major online shopping platform.

Shopping Platform The shopping site that donated the data is a huge and growing price comparison
platform, which utilizes a fully-commercialized product-ads system and has a global operation coverage
(including countries such as Australia, Brazil, China, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Japan,
the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States). Information available
to consumers on the platform includes a product description and image, the number of reviews, availabil-
ity, and minimum price across all participating stores. Consumers are also offered an option to browse
other items in the same product category. Information about sellers—name, rating, number of reviews,
base price, total price with tax and shipping cost, and a link to the seller’s website—is located below the
description. The on-screen order of the sellers is based on their quality rank (computed using reviews,
click-through rate, etc.) and the bid price per click. Consumers can sort the sellers by the average re-
view score, base, or total price. The platform also provides information (but not the price) about nearby
brick-and-mortar stores that offer the same product.
    The seller specifies devices, language, and geographical location where the ad will appear, as well as
a cost-per-click bid and maximum daily spending on the ad. The seller may be temporarily suspended if
the daily spending reaches the cap or the monthly bill is not paid on time. Remarkably, there is no explicit
cost of an impression (a listing display) or a price change! The seller pays for clicks only—although there

is an implicit cost of having a low click-through rate (number of clicks divided by number of impressions)
associated with an increase in the bid price required to reach the same on-screen position in the future. The
SP’s rules represent both opportunities (no direct costs) and limitations (bad reviews or low click-through
rate if unsuccessful) of price experimentation on the platform and, overall, favor dynamic pricing. The
seller’s information set consists of the number of clicks for a given period, the number of impressions, the
click-through rate, the average cost per click, the number of conversions (specific actions, such as purchase
on the seller’s website), the cost per conversion, and the total cost of the ad—all are available through the
seller’s ad-campaign account. The SP explicitly recommends its sellers to remove ads with a click-through
rate smaller than 1 percent in order to improve their quality rank (which can be monetized through a
lower bid price for the same on-screen rank in the future).

Coverage     The sample covers 52,776 goods sold across 27,308 online stores in the United States and
52,767 goods across 8,757 stores in the United Kingdom in 2,055 narrowly-defined product categories,
which are aggregated into 22 broad categories (e.g., costumes, vests, and dresses are subcategories in
“Apparel and Accessories,” while hard drives, video cards, motherboards, and processors, in “Electronics”).
Importantly, this dataset includes not only electronics, media, and apparel (categories studied before), but
also product categories that have not been studied before, such as home and garden equipment, hardware,
or vehicles. A list of broad product categories, together with the corresponding number of sellers and
goods, is provided in Table 1. Some key results presented in this paper are available at the category level
in the appendix.

Notation     We use pist and qist to denote the price and number of clicks, respectively, for good i offered
by seller s at time t. Time is discrete, measured with days or weeks, and ends at T, the last day (week)
observed. We denote the set of all goods, all sellers, and all time periods as G = {1, . . . , N }, S = {1, . . . , S},


                                                             5
and T = {1, . . . , T }, respectively, with N being the number of goods in the dataset and S the number of
sellers. Subscripts i and s indicate a subset (or its cardinality) that corresponds to a given good or seller.
For instance, Ns ≤ N is the number and Gs ⊆ G is the set of all goods sold by seller s, while Si ≤ S is the
number and Si ⊆ S is the set of all sellers that offer good i. We denote averages with the bar and sums
with the corresponding capital letter—for example, p̄is = t pist /T is the average price charged by seller
                                                          P

s for good i over the entire sample period and Q i t = s∈S q ist is the total number of clicks that good i
                                                       P

received across all sellers in week t.

Aggregation     We use the number of clicks as a proxy for sales, at least partially bridging the gap between
the studies of online markets, which do not have such information, and brick-and-mortar stores, which use
quantity or sales weights to aggregate over products. We find that a relatively small number of products
and sellers on the SP obtain a disproportionately large number of clicks. To emphasize the difference
between price-setting properties for all products and sellers (available for scraping) and those that actually
generate some activity on the user side, we employ three different weighting schemes to aggregate the
frequency, size, and synchronization of price changes, as well as cross-sectional price dispersion, over
goods and sellers. First, we compute the raw average, with no weights used. Second, we use click weights
to aggregate across sellers of the same product but then compute the raw average over products. We refer
to this scheme as within-good weighting. Third, we use clicks to aggregate across both sellers and products
(referred to as between-good weighting). More specifically, let f is be, for example, the frequency of price
changes for good i offered by seller s and Q is the total number of clicks. The three aggregate measures
(denoted by f¯, f¯w , and f¯b , respectively) are computed as follows:

Empirically, the difference between f¯ and f¯w is often much smaller than between either of them and f¯b
as many products have only one seller. However, the within-good weighting appears more important if
we look only at products with a sufficiently large number of sellers. We use f¯b as our preferred measure
since it is the closest among the three to the corresponding brick-and-mortar measure and incorporates
information on the relative importance of goods in the consumption basket of online shoppers.

Price Distribution    Table 2 reports percentiles of the distribution over goods of the average price for a
good, p̄i , together with the mean and the standard deviation of the average log price, log p i . The median
good in the sample costs around $25 in the United States and £19 in the United Kingdom. About a quarter
of goods costs $11 or less; products that cost $100 or more represent around 20 percent of the sample.

Notes: The blue dashed line shows the distribution of the log price deviation from the median across sellers, and the black solid line shows the
between-good click-weighted distribution of that deviation.



Goods that obtain more clicks tend to be more expensive: the median price computed using the between-
good weights is $61 and £48, respectively.
       To illustrate the importance of clicks for measuring prices effectively paid by consumers, for each good
we compute the average (over time) log deviation of the price of seller s, pist , from the median price across
sellers, e
         pi t :
                                                                 1X                        

Figure 1 plots the density of deviations without weights and with the between-good weights based on the
number of clicks, Q i t . Applying the weights shifts the distribution to the left by approximately 10 percent;
that is, sellers with price substantially below the median product price receive a larger number of clicks.


3         Price Stickiness
Price-adjustment frictions should be smaller for online stores than for brick-and-mortar stores. For exam-
ple, changing the price does not require printing a new price tag and is therefore less costly. In a similar
spirit, consumers can compare prices across retailers without leaving their desks (smaller search costs). As
a result, we should observe a higher frequency and smaller size of price changes in online markets. At the


                                                                          7
same time, lower costs of monitoring competitors’ prices should lead to a higher synchronization of price
changes across sellers and across goods, thus diminishing nominal non-neutrality. This section challenges
these conjectures by showing that online markets after all are not that different from their conventional
counterparts.

3.1      Regular and Posted Prices
Previous work (see Klenow and Malin 2010 for an overview) emphasizes the importance of temporary
price cuts (“sales prices”) for measuring the degree of price rigidities. However, Eichenbaum, Jaimovich,
and Rebelo (2011) point out that “sales prices” carry little weight at the aggregate level because they likely
represent a reaction to idiosyncratic shocks. Hence, we make a distinction between posted prices (that is,
prices we observe in the data) and regular prices (that is, prices that exclude sales).
       In contrast to scanner data, our data set does not have sales flags and thus we use filters as in Nakamura
and Steinsson (2008), Eichenbaum, Jaimovich, and Rebelo (2011), and Kehoe and Midrigan (2012) to
identify temporary price changes.5 We consider a price change to be temporary if the price returns to its
original level within one or two weeks. As the data set contains missing values, we identify sales with and
without imputation. Consider the following price series: {$2, n.a., $1, $2}, where “n.a.” denotes missing
values. In the “no imputation” case, we assume that “n.a.” breaks the price series so that we have one
series of consecutive observations {$2} and another series of consecutive observations {$1, $2}. In this
case, there is one “regular” price change from $1 to $2 in the second series because $1 is not preceded by
$2. In the “imputation” case, we drop “n.a.” and consider {$2, $1, $2} as the time series.6 In this case,
there is one period with a sales price (the price temporarily falls from $2 to $1 and then returns to the
initial level of $2) and there are no regular price changes. We report statistics for the two assumptions
separately.
       Table 3 reports the frequency and size of sales. In the United States, the mean weekly frequency of sales
(column 1) is in the range of 1.3–2.2 percent, depending on the filter. This weekly frequency is comparable
to the frequency of sales reported for prices in regular stores. There is substantial heterogeneity in the
frequency across products: we do not find sales in more than a half of the products (see column 3). When
we focus on goods that receive more clicks (use between-good weights), sales occur more often: the mean
frequency is 1.7–2.7 percent depending on computation technique. The average size of sales is 10.5–11.9
percent with equal weights and 4.4–5.3 percent with between-good weights. These sizes are smaller than
the size of sales in regular stores (about 20–30 percent). Using our “imputation” procedure for missing
values tends to generate a higher frequency and size of sales. The magnitudes are similar for the United
Kingdom.
       We also report the degree of synchronization of sales (across sellers for a given good or across goods
within a given seller), which can be informative about the nature of sales.7 For example, sales could be
strategic substitutes (low synchronization) or complements (high synchronization), they could be deter-
   5
      We use both ∨- and ∧-shaped filters to account not only for temporary price cuts but also for temporary price increases (e.g.,
due to stockout).
    6
      In this example, our “imputation” filter drops one “n.a.” value. In practice, our filters for “n.a.” values can drop up to five
missing values.
    7
      We define the sale synchronization rate as the mean share of sellers that put a particular product on sale when another seller
of the same good has a sale. In particular, if B is the number of sellers of good i and A of them have sales, the synchronization
rate is computed as (A − 1) /(B − 1). See Section 3.4 for more details.

Notes: Column (1) reports the average weekly frequency of sales across goods (percent), Column (2) the standard deviation of the frequency
across goods, Column (3) the frequency for the median good, and Column (4) the absolute size of sales for the median good measured by the
log difference between the sale and regular price (multiplied by 100). In all the four columns, we identify sales using the one-week two-side sale
filter (see the text). Columns (5)–(8) report the same statistics for the two-week sale filter. Column (9) reports the number of goods. The statis-
tics for offline stores are from Nakamura and Steinsson (2008) for the U.S. and Kryvtsov and Vincent (2014) for the U.K.; the mean frequency is
converted to the weekly rate.

                                                                          9
mined by seller-specific factors (low synchronization) or aggregate shocks (high synchronization).8 We
find (Table 4) that the synchronization of sales across sellers is below 2 percent in each country. The syn-
chronization of sales across goods within a seller is less than 3 percent in the U.S. and 4 percent in the U.K.
Because the degree of synchronization is similar to the frequency of sales, we conclude that synchronization
of sales is low.

3.2        Frequency and Size of Price Changes
Frequency         We compute the frequency of price adjustment per quote line as the number of nonzero price
changes divided by the number of observed price changes.9 This measure is then aggregated to the good
level. Based on the frequency of price adjustment, we also compute the implied duration of price spells
under the assumption of constant hazards. Specifically, let ϕist = I{qis,t > 0}I{qis,t−1 > 0} be the indicator
function whether a price change (either zero or not) is observed, Πis = t ϕist the number of observed
                                                                            P

price changes per quote line, and χist = I{|∆log pist | > 0.001} the indicator function for a nonzero price
change. Then, the frequency of price adjustment per quote line is the number of nonzero price changes
divided by the number of observed price changes,

                                                                           χist
                                                                  P
                                                                       t
                                                         f is =                                                                (3)

We aggregate this measure to the good level by taking the raw, f¯i , and click-weighted, f¯iw , average across
quote lines with at least five observations for a price change:

         The first two rows in each panel of Table 5 show the estimated frequency of price changes and the
corresponding implied duration. In the United States, the median implied duration of price spells varies
from 7 to 13 weeks when no weights are applied, from 6 to 10 weeks when weights across sellers are
applied, and from 5 to 7 weeks when we use weights across sellers and goods. When we apply the one-
week sale filter, the duration of price spells increases by 20–50 percent. The magnitudes are similar for the
     8
     Guimaraes and Sheedy (2011) propose a model of sales that are strategic substitutes. Alternatively, Anderson et al. (2013)
present evidence that sales are largely determined by seller-specific factors and best described as being on “autopilot” (i.e., not
related to aggregate variables and not synchronized).

     This measure is analogous to the one used by Bils and Klenow (2004), Klenow and Kryvtsov (2008), and Nakamura and
Steinsson (2008). In line with Eichenbaum, Jaimovich, and Rebelo (2011), price changes smaller than 0.1 percent are not
counted as price changes. We exclude quote lines with fewer than five observations.

and (3), instead, aggregate using within- and between-good weights, respectively. Columns (4)–(6) report the analogous statistics when missing
values are imputed (if the next available observation is within four weeks and there is no price change). Column (7) shows the corresponding

United Kingdom. We also find that the frequency of price increases is approximately equal to the frequency
of price decreases (see Appendix).
    Price spells for online stores appear significantly shorter than for brick-and-mortar stores (by one-third
for posted prices and by two-thirds for regular prices). However, with spells of up to four months, online
prices are far from being completely flexible, pointing toward price-adjustment frictions other than the
conventional nominal costs of price change. At the same time, goods that receive a large number of clicks
have more flexible prices—with the average duration of only 5–7 weeks for regular and posted prices.

    The last row of each panel in Table 5 reports the absolute size of price change. In the United States,
online sellers change their prices on average by 11 percent. This magnitude is remarkably stable and close


                                                                            11
to that for brick-and-mortar stores. The fact that online sellers adjust their prices more often than their
offline counterparts but roughly by the same amount indicates the presence of implementation costs of
price change. Incidentally, regular and temporary changes are approximately of the same size. In the
United Kingdom, the size of price change is smaller (approximately 5 percent), but it approaches the U.S.
statistics when between-good weights are applied (8.5 percent). Price decreases are slightly smaller (in
both countries) and more frequent (in the United States) than increases (see Appendix).

3.3      Do Prices Change Mostly during Product Substitution?
Nakamura and Steinsson (2012) emphasize that product substitution is potentially an important margin
of price adjustment and focusing on goods with short product lives and no price changes can overstate the
degree of price rigidity (“substitution bias”). In the context of online prices, Cavallo, Neiman, and Rigobon
(2014, henceforth, CNR) scraped price data from selected online retailers (Apple, IKEA, H&M, and Zara)
and documented three facts related to the substitution bias: (1) most products do not change their prices
throughout the lifetime (77 percent in the U.S. sample); (2) the median duration of product life is short
(15 weeks); and (3) products that live longer are more likely to have at least one price change (a product
observed for more than two years is 39 percentage points more likely to have at least one price change
than the average product).
      To assess the importance of product substitution for measurement of price rigidities in online markets,
we first compute the share of products with a constant price over their lives and compare these products
to products with at least one price change. In the U.S., 11.9 percent of goods have a constant price within
their life span (column 1 of Table 6)—this is significantly lower than 77 percent found by CNR. Moreover,
goods with no price change account for only 1 percent of total clicks. When we look at products in apparel
that are offered by one seller only (hence, a sample of goods that is more similar to those in H&M or
Zara), the share of goods with no price changes rises to 31 percent and the corresponding share of clicks
to 26 percent (column 3). When we further remove jewelry and watches, which represent a large share of
“apparel and accessories” in our data but are not key for H&M and Zara, the magnitudes further increase to
42 and 31 percent, respectively (column 5). We observe a similar pattern in the United Kingdom. Hence,
the prevalence of goods with no price changes in the CNR data appears to be determined by their sample
of goods and sellers.
      In the next step, we compare (Table 6) goods with and without price changes along four dimensions:
(1) the average number of clicks for a price quote; (2) observed duration of product life; (3) the number
of price quotes with a click; and (4) the number of sellers. While these two groups of goods are similar in
terms of (1), we see considerable differences in all other dimensions. In the United States, goods with at
least one price change, on average, span over 57 weeks, have 12 price quotes, and 5 sellers as opposed to
36 weeks, 9 quotes, and 1 seller for goods with no price changes.10 The U.K. data look remarkably similar
in this regard. Hence, goods with no price changes have a smaller duration of life (similar to the results
in CNR) and are more likely to be sold by just one retailer (hence, the difference between this paper and
CNR).
      Finally, to establish the relationship between observed price stickiness and duration of product life, we
compare the frequency of price adjustment and the duration of spells for goods with nontruncated product
 10
      We find similar results when we exclude goods with truncated entry/exit. See Appendix Table F1.

the end of our sample period). We find (Table 7) that, in our sample, the frequency of price changes is
similar across the bins of goods with different product lives. Hence, there is little support in the data that
product life is a major determinant of price rigidity. Specifically, although products that live longer are
more likely to have their price changed within their life span, this pattern is not due to a higher per-period
probability of price change for these goods.

3.4     Synchronization
Measurement             To measure the extent to which stores change prices simultaneously, we define the syn-
chronization of price changes across sellers as the mean share of sellers that change the price for a particular
good when another seller of the same good changes its price. In other words, if A is the number of sellers
of good i that change their prices at time t and B is the number of all sellers of good i at t, the synchro-


                                                                      13
nization rate is (A − 1)/(B − 1) provided A > 0 and B > 1. The synchronization rate ranges between zero
(no synchronization) and one (perfect synchronization). More formally, the synchronization rate, z̄i , for
good i is computed as the time average of nonmissing values of

where Si t = #Si t ≤ S is the number of sellers and χist = I{| log pist | > 0.001} is the indicator function for

       This measure of synchronization assigns equal weights to all sellers. To the extent online markets
have lots of inactive fringe sellers, this measure can understate the degree of synchronization among main
players. To address this potential problem, we consider the following within-good click-weighted measure
of synchronization of price changes:

                                                                  χ

           χ
where q̄i t is the average number of clicks over sellers that change the price and q̄i t is the average number
of clicks over all sellers for the same good and time.11 This synchronization rate uses the number of stores
that changed their price (minus one) in the numerator, exactly as for zi t , and the “effective” (as opposed to
actual for zi t ) number of stores (minus one) in the denominator—the number of stores that would generate
the same total clicks if sellers that did not change the price on average received the same number of clicks
                                  χ
as stores that did, Si t · (q̄i t /q̄i t ). The within-good click-weighted measure of synchronization, z̄iw , is the
weighted time average of ziwt where the weights are Q i t / t Q i t and Q i t is the number of clicks for periods
                                                                  P

with well-defined ziwt . The between-good weighted average is then calculated as the weighted mean of z̄iw
with weights Wi = t Q i t / t i∈G Q i t . To calculate the synchronization rate across goods, we just swap
                   P         P P

subscripts for sellers and goods in the above formulae.
       Sellers may fail to synchronize price changes at the weekly frequency, but may be able to do so at
lower frequencies. Measuring synchronization over horizons longer than one week, however, is more
complex: for an h-week period, a given week can take any of the h positions in the period depending on
when the period starts.12 To resolve this ambiguity about start dates, we compute the upper bound of
synchronization at horizon h. Specifically, we split our sample into nonoverlapping periods of duration
h and compute the synchronization rate using the method we described above. We then shift the start
date for each period by one week and repeat the exercise. We do this h times and report the maximum
synchronization rate across the different starting dates.13
  To put the measured synchronization rates into perspective, we report synchronization rates that one
would observe if price adjustment followed Calvo (1983). In particular, let f¯b be the median frequency
of price adjustment computed with between-good click weights (our benchmark), then the Calvo synchro-

  12
     For example, consider synchronization over three weeks. Week t could be a part of three three-week periods that start at
different times: {t − 2, t − 1, t}, {t − 1, t, t + 1}, and {t, t + 1, t + 2}.

     We are grateful to Nicolas Vincent for pointing out that the measure based on overlapping windows would suffer from the
downward bias.


                                                               14
nization rate at horizon h is 1 − (1 − f¯b )h+1 . This is a useful benchmark: there is no synchronization of
price changes in the Calvo pricing, yet the measured synchronization rate is not zero because some price
changes just coincide in time.

Synchronization across Sellers                 Synchronization of price changes across sellers is remarkably low in
both countries (see columns 1–4 of Table 8). The average synchronization rate for posted prices (no
weights) is about 10 percent in the United States and 15 percent in the United Kingdom; more than a half
of products in each country have zero synchronization. The average rate is even smaller for regular prices
(no weights): 8 and 12 percent in each country, respectively; hence, sales are more synchronized than
regular price changes. Although synchronization is higher when aggregated using between-good weights—
in the United States the median is 15 percent for posted prices and 13 percent for regular prices and in
the United Kingdom the values are 18 and 14 percent, respectively—it is still significantly lower than one
could have expected. Can this result be explained by timing? For example, although the cost of monitoring
competitors’ prices in online markets is low, sellers might still need some time to collect and analyze
information, as well as to make decisions about price changes. Yet, even at the three-month horizon, no
more than 60 percent of competitors adjust their price (see column 4 of Table 8). Moreover, the curve
representing the synchronization rate over the time horizon (Panels A and C of Figure 2) lies below the
curve for the Calvo pricing and is significantly flatter. This pattern suggests significant heterogeneity across
sellers: some sellers are relatively attentive and change their prices often, while other sellers (“zombie”
sellers) almost never react to changes in competitors’ prices.14
       Bhaskar (2002), Olivei and Tenreyro (2007), and others emphasize that nominal shocks should have
limited real effects if price changes are synchronized. In a limiting case, if price adjustment is perfectly
synchronized, real effects of nominal shocks can last at most as long as the duration of price spells. Our
evidence suggests that price changes in online markets are rather staggered over time, which is consistent
with potentially tangible monetary non-neutrality.

Synchronization across Goods                  If firms do not adjust prices simultaneously with their competitors, do
they at least synchronize price changes across goods they sell? Such cross-good synchronization is at the
heart of popular theories of multiproduct firms (e.g., Midrigan 2011, Alvarez and Lippi 2014), which
claim that multiproduct firms with a fixed cost of changing all their prices can explain prevalence of small
price changes in the data, a fact that conventional menu-cost models (e.g., Golosov and Lucas 2007)
cannot explain. We find little support for this theory in the online-market data. Price synchronization
across goods within a seller is low and similar to the synchronization rates across sellers for a given good
(columns 5–8 of Table 8). In the United States, the average synchronization rate is 17 percent, without
weights, and 23 percent when between-seller weights are applied (15 and 18 percent for regular prices).
In the United Kingdom, the synchronization rates are slightly higher: 20 and 26 percent, unweighted and
weighted, for posted prices; 17 and 22 percent for regular price). The unweighted median rates are all
below 10 percent (and very close to zero in the U.S. data). At the three-month horizon (see column 8 of
Table 8 and Panels B and D of Figure 2), the share of goods with price changes is still below 60 percent
(70 percent with between-seller weights)—not much higher than a corresponding measure of cross-seller
  14
       This result also holds for regular prices; see the appendix.

Notes: Panels A and C report the upper bound synchronization across sellers at the week-h horizon, while Panels B and D synchronization across
goods. The red dashed line aggregates using the raw average, the blue dash-dot line uses within-good/seller click weights, and the black solid
line, between weights. The black dotted line shows synchronization under the assumption of fixed probability of price adjustment, as in Calvo
(1983), based on the between-good click-weighted median frequency.

Synchronization of Price Increases and Decreases                            In the textbook theory of oligopolistic markets, sell-
ers that face a kinked demand curve are more likely to follow a decrease in competitors’ prices (to protect
their market share) than an increase. Instead, in models of market segmentation into loyal customers and
bargain hunters (e.g., Guimaraes and Sheedy 2011), substantial temporary price decreases (sales) are not
synchronized as firms prefer to avoid direct competition for bargain hunters. We do not, however, find
much evidence for either claim in the online-market data. Table 9 suggests that (i) the synchronization
rates for price increases and decreases are of the same order of magnitude and (ii) the difference between
the two is largely driven by the underlying differences in the frequency of price adjustment (i.e., whenever
price increases are more frequent than decreases, they are also more likely to be synchronized). These
conclusions also hold for regular prices (see Appendix).

3.5     Predictors of Price Stickiness
Market and good characteristics could be related to the heterogeneity of price stickiness across products.
We focus on four statistics that summarize market competition, structure, and consumer search intensity:
(1) the number of sellers that offer a given product; (2) market concentration measured by the click-based
  15
    Many online stores sell goods in multiple categories. The measured synchronization across goods may be weak because
stores can synchronize price changes within categories but not across categories. To assess the quantitative importance of this
explanation, we calculate the synchronization rate across goods within a category for each seller and then aggregate category-
level synchronization rates to the store level. Irrespective of whether we use a narrow or broad definition for categories, we
continue to find low synchronization rates, which are similar to our benchmark measure.

     Notes: The table presents estimates of the regression of the frequency (Columns 1–3), size (4–6), and cross-seller synchronization (7–9) of price changes on the given set of vari-
     ables. “No weights” columns use the unweighted measures of price stickiness, raw median price across sellers, and assign equal weights to each observation in the regression.
     “Within weights” columns use the within-good click-weighted measures of price stickiness, weighted median price across sellers, but still assign equal weights to each good. “Be-
     tween weights” columns further weight observations by the number of clicks obtained by each good. Concentration is measured with the Herfindahl index, normalized to be
     between zero and one. Category fixed effects are included but not reported. Standard errors clustered at the narrow-category level are in parentheses. ∗ , ∗∗ , and ∗∗∗ represent
     10, 5, and 1 percent significance level, respectively.
Herfindahl index; (3) market size approximated by clicks; and (4) the median product price.16 The first
two statistics measure the degree of competition across sellers. The third statistic can be related to returns
to correct, profit-maximizing pricing: a larger market means larger profits from charging right prices. The
last statistic can be a proxy for the intensity of consumer search: the absolute return to search is higher for
more expensive products.17 After aggregating the data to the good level, we regress the frequency, size,
and cross-seller synchronization of price changes on these four variables, controlling for category fixed
effects and clustering standard errors at the narrow-category level. For each measure of price stickiness,
we consider three weighting schemes: the simple average, within-good click-weighted average, and the
between-good click-weighted average.
    Results in Table 10 suggest that all these characteristics have some explanatory power. Markets with
more sellers are characterized by more flexible prices (higher frequency, lower size, and higher cross-seller
synchronization of price changes). Market size, measured by the number of clicks, is associated with
more (rather than less) price stickiness. Finally, price flexibility increases in the median price for low-
and moderate-price goods; however, very expensive products on the platform tend to have stickier prices.
We conclude that properties of online markets such as product demand, its price, and the intensity of
competition across sellers have strong association with the degree of price stickiness.18


4     Price Dispersion
Price dispersion is not only a key statistic entering welfare calculations (see Woodford 2003), but also a key
moment that can help understand the sources of sticky prices and the nature of competition. For example,
Sheremirov (2014) shows that many popular macroeconomic models predict a tight link between price
dispersion and the degree of price rigidity. In a similar spirit, establishing whether price dispersion is spatial
(some stores consistently charge more or less than others for the same good) or temporal (a store’s price
moves up and down in the price distribution over time) can help distinguish between popular theories
of price dispersion in the industrial organization literature. With the rising availability of supermarket
scanner data for brick-and-mortar stores, properties of price dispersion have been given a lot of attention
recently (Clark and Vincent 2014, Kaplan and Menzio 2014, Sheremirov 2014). Yet, little is known about
price dispersion in online markets.19,20
    In this section, we document that price dispersion in online markets has a number of unexpected prop-
erties. First, the magnitude is similar, if not larger, to that for brick-and-mortar stores. Price dispersion
remains sizeable even when the seller fixed effects are removed. Second, price dispersion cannot be ex-
   16

        (Q    /Q   )                =                                                                        =

   s∈Si    is    i    , where  Q is    t q ist is the total number of clicks for good i and seller s and Q i    s Q is the total number of clicks
for good i.
   17
      To allow for a nonlinear relationship between the median price and the measures of price stickiness, we include a polynomial
of order two in this variable.
   18
      Table F3 in the appendix shows that the conclusions are largely the same for regular prices.
   19
      Dispersion of online prices was studied for narrow markets such as books (Chevalier and Goolsbee 2003), CDs (Brynjolfsson
and Smith 2000), consumer electronics (Baye, Morgan, and Scholten 2004), or travel (Clemons, Hann, and Hitt 2002). While
analyses of these markets are informative, these markets are unusual in many respects (e.g., the market is dominated by big sellers
such as Amazon, prices tend to be very rigid) and hence generalization is not straightforward. To the best of our knowledge,
there is no other study with a large coverage of goods sold online.
   20
      However, online prices have been studied in the context of cross-border price dispersion and exchange-rate pass-through
(e.g., Boivin, Clark, and Vincent 2012, Gorodnichenko and Talavera 2014).



                                                                       19
plained by inactive sellers keeping their prices prohibitively high. The click-weighted measure of dispersion
is only slightly smaller than the unweighted one. Third, price dispersion rises steadily during product life.
It increases by a third within one-and-a-half years since the product introduction and we show that this
result is not due to a composition effect as we look at the sample of long-living products separately. Finally,
the data support spatial price dispersion, which is surprising given that search in online markets is easy.

4.1       Intraweek Dispersion across Sellers
Measurement           To distinguish between dispersion in the left tail of the price distribution—which generates
more clicks—from that in the right tail, we use six different measures, which complement each other. Three
of them—the coefficient of variation (CV), standard deviation of log prices, and range—capture the whole
spectrum of prices. Two other measures, the gap and value of information (VI), capture price dispersion at
the left tail. The gap is defined as the log difference between the two smallest prices and the VI, between the
average and minimum price. The VI can be interpreted as the maximum markup a risk-neutral consumer
would be willing to pay to obtain information about the seller with the best price versus buying from a
seller picked at random (Varian 1980). To reduce the influence of extreme observations, we also compute
the interquartile range (IQR)—the log difference between the 75th and 25th percentile.21 We use the CV
and standard deviation of log prices as our preferred measures since (i) they capture the width of the
entire price distribution and (ii) they are most often reported in the literature on price dispersion. Once
we compute a corresponding measure of price dispersion across sellers for each good i and week t (σi t ),
we aggregate it to the good level by taking appropriate time averages (σ̄i and σ̄w
                                                                                 i ).


Dispersion         Panels A and C of Table 11 report the cross-good raw average of σ̄i (no weights), σ̄w
                                                                                                       i (within-
good weights), and σ̄b (between-good weights, i.e., the click-weighted average of σ̄w
                                                                                    i ) for each measure
of dispersion for posted prices described above. As the share of identified weekly sales is small (within the
1.3–1.7 percent range; see Table 3) and a half of products in the dataset do not have sales at all, dispersion
for regular prices is almost the same as dispersion for posted prices. To save space, we focus on results for
posted prices and relegate results for regular price to Appendix.
       In the United States, the average gap between the smallest two prices is 28 log points, while the range
is 41 log points. Together with the fact that, on average, the value of information is smaller than the gap, it
suggests that there is more mass in the left tail than in the right one. This result is consistent with models
that segment the market into loyal customers (i.e., those with a strong brand preference) and shoppers
(i.e., bargain hunters who search for best prices), in which seller’s optimal strategy is to offer a low price
for the former and the reservation price for the latter (Morgan, Orzen, and Sefton 2006, Baye and Morgan
2009). Alternatively, if consumers face ex ante different information sets à la Varian (1980) (i.e., some
consumers are informed about price distribution, while others are uninformed and pick a seller at random)
and there is heterogeneity in marginal costs across firms, then the most efficient firm will set the price equal
to the marginal cost of the second most efficient firm (to attract informed customers), while every other
firm will charge the monopoly price since they face demand from uninformed customers only.
       The CV is 22 percent and does not change materially when within- or between-good weights are applied
(20 percent with both weights). This is similar to the estimates in Kaplan and Menzio (2014) and larger
  21

than in Sheremirov (2014)—two recent studies of price dispersion across brick-and-mortar stores.22 The
standard deviation of log prices is similar to the CV. In the United Kingdom the amount of price dispersion
is roughly the same as in the United States: the CV is 19 percent (18 percent with between-good weights).

Dispersion Net of Seller Fixed Effects                  As suggested by Stigler (1961), some of the observed price dis-
persion may be due to differences in shopping experience and terms of sale. This distinction is less likely
to apply for shopping on the online platform since consumers deal directly with a seller only when they
complete a transaction. Furthermore, if seller’s reputation and differences in delivery and return policy
matter, the importance of these factors is likely to be reduced in our setting because consumers get explicit
credit-card guarantees from the issuer and “trusted seller” guarantees from the comparison site. To address
this potential issue more completely, we run the following regression:

                                                        log pist = αi + γs + "ist                                                        (11)

where αi and γs are good and seller fixed effects, respectively, and then report dispersion for the residual,
which gives us price dispersion net of sellers’ heterogeneity in shipping costs, return policies, etc.23 In
other words, since the terms of sale are unlikely to be changing much in a relatively short sample period,
we can use seller fixed effects to capture the differences in reputation, delivery and return costs across
sellers.
    Seller fixed effects account for about 25–30 percent of variation in price dispersion across goods in the
U.S. and about 40 percent in the U.K. (Panels B and D of Table 11). While store heterogeneity is a tangible
source of price dispersion, the residual price dispersion remains high even when we use between-good
   22
      Kaplan and Menzio (2014), using the Nielsen household panel for the period between 2004 and 2009, report the CV at the
UPC level of 19 percent. Sheremirov (2014) uses the IRI scanner data for the 2001–2011 period and documents the average
standard deviation of log prices of 10 log points. The difference between the two is likely to be due to sample composition—the
IRI data are for grocery and drugstores only, while the Nielsen data also include warehouse clubs and discount stores, which can
widen price distribution.

      Controlling for time dummies does not affect the results.


                                                                     21
weights: the standard deviation of log prices is 17.5 log points in the United States and 14.9 log points in
the United Kingdom. These magnitudes are striking given how easy it is to compare prices for a precisely
defined good across sellers in online markets.

4.2      Dynamic Properties
Dispersion over Product Life          We may observe considerable dispersion of prices across sellers, as well as
heterogeneity in the level of the dispersion across goods, because goods may be at different stages of their
product lives. For example, in the absence of shocks, price dispersion should be falling over the course
of product life as consumers learn about price distribution through search and firms collect information
about their competitors’ prices. If there is high dispersion of prices at the time a good is introduced, a high
average level of price dispersion could reflect prevalence of recently introduced goods rather than inability
of online markets to eliminate arbitrage opportunities. Studying how price dispersion varies over product
life can also inform us about the nature of price rigidities. For example, Cavallo, Neiman, and Rigobon
(2014) find that the dispersion of prices across countries for a given good is effectively set at the time the
good enters the market and remains relatively stable throughout the product life.
       To examine the importance of this dimension, we compute the average price dispersion across products
after h weeks since they appear in the data set. We limit the sample to include only goods with the duration
of product life of at least a year so that our results are not due to a composition effect (e.g., if products
that live longer have a higher or lower price dispersion than the average product).24 Figure 3 suggests
that price dispersion steadily increases during the product life. In the United States, the between-good
weighted measure increases by a third within seventy weeks since the introduction, from 15 to 20 percent.
In the United Kingdom, a corresponding increase in dispersion is even bigger, from 11 to 19 percent. Price
dispersion for the unweighted measures increases as well, but at a smaller rate due to the level effect.
Hence, while a chunk of price dispersion appears when a good is introduced, there is no evidence of price
convergence over the good’s product life and heterogeneity in product lives cannot explain cross-sectional
dispersion of prices.

Spatial and Temporal Dispersion              Macroeconomic models of price rigidity usually generate temporal
price dispersion. For example, in the Calvo model each firm is allowed to change the price randomly and
therefore is equally likely to lag and lead other firms during an adjustment period. Over a sufficiently
long period, a given firm should have its price below and above the average roughly the same amount of
time. Sheremirov (2014) shows that, for reasonable parameterizations, popular menu-cost models make
a similar prediction: when a firm adjusts in response to an inflationary shock, it sets its price above the
average; as the price level steadily increases, the firm’s price moves to the left in the price distribution and
eventually falls below the average.
       In contrast, many (but not all) models in the search or industrial organization literature produce spa-
tial price dispersion (Reinganum 1979, MacMinn 1980, Spulber 1995). Burdett and Judd (1983) provide
an example of a search model with temporal price dispersion.25 Varian (1980) argues that over time
  24
     We exclude products that enter within the first four weeks of the sample period because we do not know if the product was
introduced then or was unavailable due to a temporary stockout. We find similar results when we use alternative cutoffs for the
minimum duration of product life. We also find similar results when we use dispersion net of seller fixed effects.

consumers should learn if a firm is high- or low-price, which should eliminate spatial price dispersion.
Consistent with this prediction, Lach (2002) finds that price dispersion for brick-and-mortar stores is tem-
poral. Given easy search for best prices in online markets, one could expect that most of price dispersion
should be temporal rather than spatial.
    Following Lach (2002), we calculate a fraction of episodes when a seller’s price is in the left tail (defined
as the first quartile) of the price distribution in the episodes when it is in either tail (the first or fourth
quartile). If price dispersion is purely spatial, this fraction should be either zero or one.26 If price dispersion
is purely temporal, we should see a distribution of the fraction with support over the unit interval and a
peak at the middle. Irrespective of whether we use observed prices or prices net of seller fixed effects ("ist ),
we find strong support for spatial price dispersion (Figure 4): the data show clear spikes at zero and one
and little mass in the middle. Using clicks as weights does not alter this finding. Thus, consumers appear
to persistently ignore lower prices offered by other sellers and there is potentially significant segmentation
of the market.

4.3    Predictors of Price Dispersion
Popular macroeconomic theories of price determination emphasize three broad sources of price dispersion.
First, prices can be different across sellers because consumers face search costs. Second, prices may be
different because they are set in different times and hence in response to different demand and supply
conditions. This is the channel in models with sticky prices. Third, sellers can price discriminate consumers
(see, e.g., Guimaraes and Sheedy 2011, Coibion, Gorodnichenko, and Hong 2012, Kaplan and Menzio
2014, Sheremirov 2014). To explore the importance of these channels, we regress the standard deviation
of log prices on variables measuring market power, returns to search, and price stickiness. To preserve
space, we present results for between-good click-weighted data (Table 12) and relegate results for other
measures and weighting schemes to Appendix.
    We tend to find that a larger number of sellers and smaller market size (measured by the number of
clicks) are associated with a smaller price dispersion. The absolute magnitudes of the estimated coefficients
on these two variables are similar. One may interpret this result as suggesting that price dispersion is
increasing in the average number of clicks per seller. To the extent the average number of clicks per seller
signals market power, our results indicate that barriers to entry allow online stores to charge different
prices and price discriminate consumers thus generating increased price dispersion.
    Consistent with predictions of models with search costs, a higher unit price, which proxies for higher
returns on search, is associated with a lower price dispersion. The economic magnitude of the relationship
is large: if good A is twice as expensive as good B, good A has a 6 to 8 log points lower dispersion of prices
than good B.
    In models of price stickiness (e.g., Calvo 1983), the higher is the frequency of price adjustment, the
smaller is price dispersion because firms catch up with the price level faster when they are allowed to
change their prices more often. While in models with menu costs the relationship between the frequency
and price dispersion is more nuanced, Sheremirov (2014) shows that the correlation is negative for rea-
sonable calibrations. In contrast to this theoretical prediction, we find a positive relationship between the

      For example, a spike at zero that is higher than a spike at one indicates that high-price sellers are less likely to have episodes
of low prices than low-price sellers episodes of high prices.

frequency and price dispersion. At the same time, models with sticky prices predict a negative relationship
between the frequency of price changes and the size of price changes so that the size of price changes
may be interpreted as an alternative measure of price stickiness. If we focus on this alternative measure,
the estimated relationship between price stickiness and price dispersion is consistent with predictions of
sticky-price models: larger price changes are associated with larger cross-sectional price dispersion. The
difference in the results for the frequency and size of price changes suggests that price changes in online
markets may be motivated by reasons other than those emphasized by mainstream models of price setting.
For example, a high frequency of price adjustment may reflect a noisier or more intensive process of price
discovery, when sellers frequently try different prices to probe the level and elasticity of demand, rather
than fluctuations in marginal costs.
    As we discussed above, sticky-price models generate price dispersion because of the staggered price
adjustment. If firms are allowed to synchronize their price changes, the cross-sectional price dispersion
should disappear in these models. In line with this prediction, we find that synchronization tends to be
negatively correlated with price dispersion.
    While price discrimination can take a variety of forms, given data constraints, we use two approaches to
capture effects of price discrimination. First, we consider how the frequency and size of sales, a mechanism
to discriminate across customers, are related to price dispersion.27 Second, we study how removing seller
fixed effects (a proxy for differences in terms of sales across stores) influences our estimates. We tend
to find that more frequent and smaller sales are associated with lower price dispersion. Again, similar to
the results for the frequency and size of regular price changes, the estimated coefficient on the size has a
sign predicted by popular theories, while the estimate on the frequency of sales is surprising. Perhaps, this
difference suggests heterogeneity in the purpose of sales across goods and markets. For example, a higher
frequency of sales may occur in markets where high-price stores use sales to bring their prices closer to
low-price competitors, while larger sales may be concentrated in markets where sellers have similar prices
and use sales to differentiate themselves from the pack. We also find that removing seller fixed effects
attenuates the estimates somewhat but the qualitative conclusions are not affected.
    Obviously these results are not causal, but the estimates suggest that multiple sources of price dispersion
are likely at play. Search costs, price stickiness, and price discrimination are predictors of the observed
price dispersion in online market. Controlling for one of the sources of price dispersion does not appear
to change estimates on variables proxying for the other sources of price dispersion.


5    Dynamic Pricing
E-commerce has been long poised to adopt dynamic pricing: online sellers can, in principle, change their
prices automatically in response to anticipated variation in demand (throughout the week, month, or
year) or current market conditions (competitors’ prices, number of customers, inventories, etc.). In fact, it
is already widely used in a few industries. For example, airlines and hotels set their prices based on when
a reservation is made, whether a trip includes a weekend stayover, and the number of available seats or
rooms (see, e.g., Bilotkach, Gorodnichenko, and Talavera 2010, 2012). Although dynamic pricing has
obvious advantages (boosting profits through price discrimination, using price experimentation to obtain
  27
     For example, Sheremirov (2014) finds that dispersion for conventional stores is lower for regular prices than for posted prices
so that, consistent with Varian (1980), one may interpret sales as a source of price dispersion.

real-time estimates of demand elasticity), excessive use of dynamic pricing may alienate consumers and
harm firm’s reputation. For example, dynamic pricing can undermine a long-term nature of seller-customer
relationships and intensify competition thus putting pressure on profits.
     From a macroeconomic perspective, dynamic pricing leads to increased price flexibility. Whether or
not it also changes the effects of nominal shocks depends on what firms respond to. If firms adjust their
prices only in response to transitory sector-specific shocks, increased price flexibility does not make mon-
etary policy less powerful. If firms also react to changes in the current state of the economy, including
policymakers’ decisions, dynamic pricing can lead to a lower degree of monetary non-neutrality. Under
dynamic pricing, not just the frequency but also the timing of price changes matter. For example, Olivei
and Tenreyro (2007) report that, due to uneven staggering of wage contracts, the effect of monetary-policy
shocks on output depends on a quarter in which the shock occurs. One may expect that this effect should
be amplified in online markets.
     To shed new light on the use of dynamic pricing by online retailers, we consider different ways through
which it can affect price flexibility. First, we look at low-frequency anticipated variation in demand due to
holiday sales such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday (in the United States) or Boxing Day (in the United
Kingdom). Second, we look at the reaction of prices to high-frequency variation in demand. We examine
how online demand (proxied by the number of clicks) and prices vary over days of the week and month.
We also investigate how online demand and prices react to the surprise component of macroeconomic
announcements.

(4) and (8) for the click-weighted mean price. Weeks are defined as Monday to Sunday to keep adjacent weekend days within the same week.

each year, the number of clicks goes up and the average price goes down during the holiday sales.28 This
finding is consistent with Warner and Barsky (1995), who find that brick-and-mortar stores choose to time
price markdowns to periods of high-intensity demand. Notably, after the sales period, prices do not go
back to their presale level but instead permanently settle at a new, lower value.
    We observe a similar but weaker pattern when we aggregate across goods. Figure 6 shows that the
frequency of regular price decreases rises relative to the frequency of regular price increases when we
compare Thanksgiving or Christmas weeks with the weeks preceding or following the holiday season.
Likewise, sales tend to be deeper and more widespread during the season. There seems to be no evidence
that the size of regular price increases and decreases behaves differentially during the season than in off-
season weeks. One should, however, take these observations with a grain of salt since the time series for
these variables are noisy and we only observe two episodes of the holiday season.

Intraweek Variation            Table 13 reports the deviation of log prices and total clicks from the weekly median,
as well as the share of total clicks by day of the week. In each country, Mondays and Tuesdays account
for almost one-third of the total number of clicks—6 percentage points more than Saturdays and Sundays
do, when the shopping activity on the platform is the lowest. In contrast, the shopping activity in brick-
and-mortar stores is the highest on weekends (BLS 2014, Koustas 2014). In the United States, consumers
generate 10 log points more clicks on Mondays than on the median day of the same week; on Saturdays,
however, this measure is 16 log points smaller than the median (8.4 and 19.0 log points, respectively,
in the U.K. data). At the same time, Monday prices are within 0.2 log points from the median in both
countries, while Saturday prices are 3 log points lower than the weekly median in the United States (2
log points in the United Kingdom). When the shopping intensity drops over the weekend, more high-price
sellers receive no clicks at all, which explains most of the deviation in the raw mean price: click-weighted
prices on Saturdays are only 0.8 and 0.1 log points lower than the median in each country, respectively.
In summary, the intraweek variation in prices is significantly smaller than in the number of clicks and the
two are not perceptibly related. If anything, prices are slightly lower on the weekend when the demand
intensity on the online platform is lower thus contradicting the Warner-Barsky hypothesis.

     Although in the United Kingdom people usually do not celebrate Thanksgiving, the late November is a typical time to start
Christmas shopping.

Intramonth Variation                                           Figure 7 shows that the intramonth variation of the number of clicks also signif-
icantly exceeds that of the average price. Specifically, we plot the median (over months) deviation of the
total number of clicks as well as the raw and click-weighted mean price from the corresponding monthly
median. While the number of clicks varies over the interval of 5 log points from each side of the median—at
the extreme, the deviations can be almost 10 log points—both measures of price deviations are consistently
within 1 log point from the median. In both countries, consumers are significantly more active in the first
half of the month—and close to the payday—than at the second half, with an additional spike in activity
around the 15th days of a month in the United States (as some consumers are paid biweekly). Similar to
the intraweek case, prices do not appear to respond to intramonth variation in demand.

5.2                      High-Frequency Aggregate Shocks
Our results above support only a limited reaction of online stores to anticipated changes in the intensity of
demand for their products. Are sellers more responsive to unanticipated changes in aggregate economic
conditions? To address this question, we explore how pricing moments and the number of clicks react to
the surprise component of macroeconomic announcements at the daily frequency.
          To measure these shocks, we use real-time data from Informa Global Markets (IGM),29 which report the
actual release and median forecast of measures of economic activity such as capacity utilization, consumer
confidence, core CPI, employment cost index, GDP, initial claims, manufacturing composite index from
the Institute of Supply Management (ISM), leading indicators, new home sales, nonfarm sales, producer

     The data were collected by Money Market Services (MMS) up until 2003, when MMS merged with another leading financial
analysis company, MCM, to form IGM. See Andersen et al. (2003) and Gurkaynak, Sack, and Swanson (2005) for more information
about the data.

where t indexes days. To make units comparable across shocks, we standardize each shock series to have
zero mean and unit standard deviation.
       While macroeconomic announcements are not synchronized, each shock series has nonmissing values
only twelve or fewer days a year (only initial claims are weekly and thus have about fifty nonmissing values
a year). To enhance statistical power of our analysis, we construct an aggregate shock series. Specifically,
we estimate the loadings of these shocks on the change in consumption using the monthly data for the
1995–2012 period:

where m indexes months and ∆ log Cm is the log change of the monthly real personal consumption ex-
penditures (FRED® code: PCEC96). The R2 in this regression is 0.47 so that the shocks account for a
considerable variation in the monthly consumption growth rate. We then compute the aggregate shock as
                                                                          P14

       Next, we estimate the effect of our shock measures on the cross-sectional frequency and size of price
changes and shopping intensity (number of clicks). Let f tb be the between-good click-weighted frequency of
                                                                                              P13 b
price adjustment on day t. To allow for a delayed response to shocks, we also construct f˜b =      f /14,
                                                                                                        t           τ=0 t+τ
the average weighted frequency of price adjustment within fourteen days since day t. In a similar spirit,
            w                                                                             b
let |∆log p| be the between-good click-weighted average price change on day t and |∆log

value of the size of price changes between t and t + 14. Since we expect a given shock to move prices in a
certain direction, we consider price increases and decreases separately. Finally, Q t is the total number of
clicks on day t and Q̃ t the average number of daily clicks between t and t + 14. We project each moment
at daily frequency on a set of dummy variables to remove predictable variation of the moment across days
of the week and days of the month. Then we regress the residual from this projection on each individual
shock separately and on the aggregate shock. Since we have relatively few nonmissing observations for
each shock, we use bootstrap to estimate the average sensitivity of each moment to a shock and to calculate
standard errors.
       While Andersen et al. (2003), Gurkaynak, Sack, and Swanson (2005), and many others show that
the surprise component in macroeconomic announcements moves asset prices at high frequencies, we
find little evidence that the shocks have a consistently discernible effect on the moments on impact or
within fourteen days after a shock (Table 14). The vast majority of the estimates are not statistically or
economically significant. None of the shocks moves the number of clicks, our proxy for demand. The
aggregate shock, which has the largest number of nonmissing observations, does not have any significant
estimates.
       Obviously, the moments may be sensitive to other shocks, but our results suggest that prices of goods
and services sold online are far from being as flexible as asset prices, exchange rates, bond yields, or
commodity prices. In fact, online prices, after all, appear qualitatively similar to prices in conventional
stores. Hence, the physical frictions of nominal price adjustment likely play only a minor role in the

    We consider alternative ways to aggregate shocks. First, we use log (Cm+h /Cm−1 ) as the dependent variable to allow shocks
to have effects over h months rather than one month. This dependent variable gives higher weights to shocks that have delayed
effects on consumption. Second, we use the daily percent change in the S&P500 index as the dependent variable. While this
variable is noisier than the consumption growth rate, it may provide a better measure of market expectations of how the economy
reacts to the shocks. Using these alternative approaches does not affect our conclusions.

     Notes: The table reports the estimates from regressions of pricing moment and clicks on high-frequency aggregate shocks. All variables and observations are click weighted when possible. All shocks
     are standardized to have zero mean and unit variance. Unweighted results are relegated to Appendix. The “two weeks ahead” results take the average over fourteen days after the shock. The sample
     period is from May 1, 2010, to February 7, 2012. Bootstrap standard errors are in parentheses. *, **, and *** represent 10, 5, and 1 percent significance level, respectively.

6    Concluding Remarks
The internet offers seemingly limitless opportunities to the retail sector by enabling sellers to collect and
process massive amounts of data to tailor prices and product characteristics to specific whims of consumers
and ever-changing economic conditions. A popular view holds that prices for goods and services sold online
should approach (if not now, then eventually) the flexibility of auction prices or stock prices. Indeed, the
internet makes it trivial to compare prices across sellers, the best price is just a few clicks away, the physical
location of online sellers is largely irrelevant, and numerous services advise online shoppers on when and
where to buy a good they desire.
    Using the unique richness of our dataset, which includes not only a very broad coverage of goods over
a long time period but also provides a proxy (clicks) for quantities associated with price quotes, we find
that online prices are more flexible than prices in brick-and-mortar stores. Furthermore, click-weighted
pricing moments point to a greater flexibility for price quotes that matter to consumers. However, we also
document that online prices demonstrate tangible imperfections such as stickiness, low synchronization of
price changes, large cross-sectional price dispersion, and low sensitivity to predictable and unanticipated
fluctuations in demand.
    These findings have a number of implications. First, even if e-commerce grows to dominate the retail
sector, price stickiness is unlikely to disappear because it does not seem to be determined exclusively by
search costs and/or physical costs of changing a price sticker. Second, one should not disregard the effect
of e-commerce on properties of the aggregate price level and inflation as pricing in online markets does
differ from that in brick-and-mortar stores. Third, macroeconomists should put more effort into develop-
ing theoretical models with alternative mechanisms generating price stickiness and other imperfections.
Fourth, we anticipate that much can be learned from studying price setting of sellers present in both on-
line and offline markets, as well as from more complete information about inventories and costs of online
sellers.

Appendix—Not for publication
A    A Typical Shopping Platform
Figure A1 provides an example of how a search result for a particular good is seen by customers in a typical
shopping platform. Available information includes the product’s name and image, a brief description, the
number of reviews, the minimum price online, as well as information about online sellers of the good. The
on-screen order of sellers is based on their quality rank and a bid price a seller chooses to pay per click, but the
consumer can re-sort sellers by the average review score and the base or total price. Figure A2 provides the
list of choices the seller makes on a typical platform: a geographical location of viewers and a language they
speak, as well as a bid for the cost per click and the daily budget. Figure A3 provides an example of the ad
campaign information available to sellers. It includes the number of clicks, impressions (display of the listing),
and conversions (specific actions, such as a purchase, on the seller’s website), as well as the click-through rate
(clicks divided by impressions), the average cost per click and conversion, and the total cost of the ad.

B      Data Processing and Aggregation
The dataset, as supplied by the data provider, contains a sample of 52,788 goods across 27,315 sellers in the
United States and 52,804 goods across 8,757 sellers in the United Kingdom for the period from May 1, 2010,
to February 7, 2012. We minimally process the data to deal with omissions, duplications, and inconsistencies.
First, we drop prices denominated in a foreign currency, leaving only those in the dollar and sterling for each
country, respectively. Second, we drop prices above 500,000 as those are likely to stand for errors and missing
values; in fact, most prices are below 5,000 dollars. This leaves us with 52,776 and 52,767 goods and 27,308
and 8,757 sellers in the United States and the United Kingdom, respectively. Finally, in a small number of
cases we have more than one daily observation for the same country, seller, and good. If the duplicated
observations appear to have the same price, we aggregate them in one data point by summing over clicks. If,
instead, prices differ, we take the mode price, sum over clicks, and drop price quotes different from the mode.31
These transformations affect a tiny share of observations and our assumptions do not affect the results in any
meaningful way.
    Since the data contain many missing values at the daily frequency (no clicks for a particular quote line on
a given day) and to enhance comparison with existing studies, we aggregate the data to the weekly frequency
by taking the mode price for a good, seller, and week.32 To show that this aggregation procedure does not lead
to a significant loss in variation, we compute the share of intraweek price variation in total daily variation for
each good and seller:                                                      
                                                Vb t log pist − log pweekly
                                                                      ist
                                         ωis =                                                             (B1)
                                                       Vb t log pist
                                weekly
where pist is the daily price, pist    is the mode price within a given week, and V     b is the sample variance. In
line with our usual approach, we then compute the raw mean over sellers (no weights), ω̄i = s∈Si ωis /Si ,
                                                                                                       P

and the click-weighted mean (within goods), ω̄w   i =    s∈Si Q is ωis /Q i ; the average of ω̄i with between-good
                                                                                               w
                                                       P

weights Wi = Q i /Q is also computed. With no weights or within-good weights only, the share of intraweek
variation in prices for the median good is zero; with between-good weights, it is around 13 percent in the
United States and 11 percent in the United Kingdom (Table B1). Hence, goods that receive a small number
of clicks have almost no intraweek variation in prices (and also a lot of missing values when no one clicks on
them); the intraweek variation for popular goods is reasonably small and does not seem to create any problems
for aggregation.

     When we have more than one mode for duplicated observations, we use the smallest one since we know that smaller prices receive
more clicks. We prefer the mode to the mean or the median in order not to generate artificial price quotes, which may spuriously
break price spells.
  32
     When there are more than one mode, we keep the one with the earliest first occurrence.

Notes: Column (1) reports the share of goods with unobserved entry and exit (truncated from both sides), while Column (2), truncated from either side
(but not both). A good entry (exit) is truncated if it enters (exits) within the first (last) five weeks. Columns (3) and (4) report the mean and standard
deviation of life duration for halftruncated goods, while Columns (5)–(7), the mean, standard deviation, and median for nontruncated goods. Columns
(8) and (9) show the lower bound of the mean and median life duration, respectively (see the text), and Column (10) the total number of goods. To
compare, the mean (median) duration in Cavallo, Neiman, and Rigobon (2014) for the U.S. sample is 37 (15) weeks; for H&M and Zara only, the mean
and median duration are all in the interval of 10–12 weeks.
