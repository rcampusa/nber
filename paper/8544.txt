        Using the 1995 Survey of Consumer Finances and an elaborate life-cycle model, we quantify the
potential financial impact of each individual’s death on his or her survivors, and we measure the degree
to which life insurance moderates these consequences. Life insurance is essentially uncorrelated with
financial vulnerability at every stage of the life cycle. As a result, the impact of insurance among at-risk
households is modest, and substantial uninsured vulnerabilities are widespread, particularly among
younger couples. Roughly two-thirds of poverty among surviving women and more than one-third of
poverty among surviving men results from a failure to insure survivors against an undiminished living
standard. We also identify a systematic gender bias: for any given level of financial vulnerability, couples
provide significantly more protection for wives than for husbands.

1. Introduction

        The purpose of this study is to examine life insurance holdings and financial vulnerabilities among

couples over the life cycle. Two separate concerns motivate our analysis. First, there are reasons to suspect

that life insurance coverage is poorly correlated with underlying financial vulnerabilities. A well-known

insurance industry adage holds that life insurance is “sold and not bought.” Alternatively, households may

purchase long-term policies relatively early in life, and subsequently fail to adjust coverage appropriately

because of inertia and/or other psychological considerations. Second, households that purchase little or no

life insurance may leave either or both spouses at risk of serious financial consequences.

        With respect to the first concern, the available evidence is limited. Using a sample of older workers

drawn from the 1992 wave of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), Bernheim, et. al. [2001] documented

a startling mismatch between life insurance holdings and underlying vulnerabilities (defined as the decline

in living standard that a survivor would experience in the absence of insurance). In particular, they found

virtually no correlation between these two variables. Notably, this finding did not permit them to distinguish

between the hypothesis that insurance bears little relation to needs at the time of purchase, and the hypothesis

that households purchase long-term contracts with initially appropriate insurance coverage, but fail to adjust

this coverage through time as their circumstances change.

        The second concern has received considerably more attention. One branch of the literature examines

the experience of widows. Holden, Burkhauser, and Myers [1986] and Hurd and Wise [1989] documented

sharp declines in living standards and increases in poverty rates (from 9 to 35 percent) among women whose

husbands actually passed away. A second branch of the literature projects the consequences of widowhood

for married individuals. Analyzing data gathered during the 1960s from households in middle age through

early retirement, Auerbach and Kotlikoff [1987, 1991a, 1991b] found that roughly one-third of wives and

secondary earners would have seen their living standards decline by 25 percent or more had their spouses

died. Bernheim, et. al. [2001] adopted a similar approach, but used more recent, high quality data, more


                                                       1
accurate estimates of survival-contingent income streams, and a more elaborate life cycle simulation model.

They documented significant underlying vulnerabilities among older working couples: ignoring life

insurance, one-third of secondary earners would have experienced significant (20 percent or greater) declines

in living standards had their spouses died in 1992, while one-fifth would have experience severe declines (40

percent or greater). More importantly, only one in three households in these at-risk populations held

sufficient life insurance to avert significant or severe financial consequences. While primary earners

(typically husbands) were less frequently at-risk of significant or severe consequences, they generally had

much less protection (insurance on the secondary earner’s life) for any given level of risk exposure. Notably,

none of the studies mentioned above examined uninsured exposures among younger households. This is a

significant omission, as younger couples generally have more contingent income to protect, and hence greater

underlying vulnerabilities.

        In the current study, we reexamine both sets of issues using data obtained from the 1995 wave of the

Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF). Relative to the HRS (studied by Bernheim, et. al. 2001), the primary

advantage of the SCF is that it includes adult respondents of all ages. This permits us to extend the existing

literature by examining financial vulnerabilities and life insurance coverage at all stages of the life cycle.

This extension comes at a cost, as the SCF data are in some ways less comprehensive. Most notably,

matching Social Security earnings histories are not available for the SCF sample.

        Following Bernheim, et. al. [2001], we adopt a concrete and easily understood yardstick for

quantifying financial vulnerabilities: the percentage decline in an individual’s sustainable living standard that

would result from a spouse’s death.1        The use of this yardstick permits us to make apples-to-apples

comparisons of vulnerabilities across households, and to investigate correlations between vulnerabilities and

insurance coverage. We also compare actual life insurance holdings to a natural benchmark, defined as the


        1
          To calculated this decline, we make use of an elaborate life cycle model. The model is embodied in
financial planning software, Economic Security Planner (or ESPlanner). Economic Security Planning, Inc. provides
free copies of the software for academic research. For additional information, consult www.ESPlanner.com.

                                                       2
level of coverage required to assure survivors of no change in their sustainable living standard. It is worth

emphasizing that we do not regard this benchmark as a definitive standard of adequacy or rationality.

Rational decision makers may elect to purchase either higher or lower levels of insurance. However, when

combined with other evidence on household objectives, comparisons with the benchmark potentially shed

light on the adequacy of life insurance coverage.

        With respect to the first issue, we corroborate the previous finding of Bernheim, et. al. [2001] (based

on the HRS) that there is little correlation between financial vulnerabilities and life insurance holdings. Our

analysis further illuminates this issue by demonstrating that the correlation is essentially zero throughout the

entire life cycle. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that life insurance bears little relation to needs

at the time of purchase; however, it tends to refute the hypothesis that households purchase long-term

contracts with initially appropriate insurance coverage, but fail to adjust this coverage through time as their

circumstances change.

        With respect to the second issue, we find that uninsured vulnerabilities are considerably greater

among younger couples. This is particularly noteworthy because, as mentioned above, younger couples

were not included in previous studies. Nearly two-thirds of secondary earners between the ages of 22 and

39 have significant uninsured financial vulnerabilities (projected reductions in living standards exceeding

20 percent), and nearly one-third have severe uninsured vulnerabilities (projected reductions exceeding 40

percent). Moreover, for this age group, only one in five households with at-risk secondary earners (those

who would experience significant or severe declines in living standard upon the death of their spouse,

ignoring insurance) held sufficient life insurance to avert significant or severe financial consequences. For

the entire sample, in the absence of life insurance, 56 percent of secondary earners and 6 percent of primary

earners would have experienced significant or severe declines in living standard upon the death of a spouse.

Actual life insurance holdings reduce these figures to, respectively, 42 percent and 5 percent. Thus, the

overall impact of life insurance holdings on financial vulnerabilities among at-risk households is modest.


                                                         3
Roughly two-thirds of poverty among surviving women and more than one-third of poverty among surviving

men resulted from a failure to ensure survivors of an undiminished living standard through insurance.

        We also find evidence of a significant gender bias in life insurance holdings. Specifically, for any

given level of financial vulnerabilities, couples provide significantly more protection for wives than for

husbands. For example, couples with severely at-risk wives on average hold $166,628 of life insurance,

while couples with severely at-risk husbands on average hold only 15 percent of this amount ($24,827). :Life

insurance reduced the average impact of a husband’s death on the living standard of a severely at-risk wife

from a 65.5 percent decline to a 47.6 percent decline. In contrast, life insurance reduced the average impact

of a wife’s death on the living standard of a severely at-risk husband by a much smaller amount, from a 68.4

percent decline to a 64.1 percent decline.

        The paper proceeds as follows: section 2 discusses methods, section 3 describes the data, section 4

presents basic results, section 5 provides sensitivity analysis, and section 6 concludes.


2. A Strategy for Measuring Financial Vulnerabilities

        A. Concepts

        We clarify our strategy for measuring financial vulnerabilities through an example. Imagine that a

husband and wife each live for at most two years (equivalently, they are within two years of maximum

lifespan). Both are alive initially, but either may die before the second year. The household’s well-being

depends on consumption in each year and survival contingency. As discussed further below, we allow for

the possibility that some ongoing expenditures are either exogenous or determined early in life by “sticky”

choices. We refer to these expenditures as “fixed consumption,” and to residual spending as “variable

consumption.” Let y1 denote initial assets plus first period earnings net of fixed consumption, and let y2s

denote second period earnings net of fixed consumption in state s = W, H, B, where the state identifies

survivors (wife, W, husband, H, or both, B). The couple divides first period resources between variable



                                                      4
consumption, c1, saving, A, and insurance premiums, piLi, i = H, W, where Li represents the second-period

payment to i if his or her spouse dies, and pi denotes the associated price per dollar of coverage. Assets A

earn the rate of return r. The couple faces the following constraints: c1 = y1 - A - pWLW - pHLH, c2B = y2B +

A(1+r), and c2i = y2i + A(1+r) + Li for i = W, H, where c2i denotes second period variable consumption in

state i (for the moment, we ignore non-negativity restrictions on life insurance and assets) Defining

                            , these equations imply:


                                                                                                              (1)


        We equate living standard with per capita variable consumption adjusted for family composition.

To determine each individual’s living standard when both are alive, we divide variable consumption by a

factor 2". We assume that 0 < " # 1; the second inequality reflects economies of scale associated with

shared living expenses. To maintain a living standard that is constant across time and states of nature (in

other words, one that is undiminished if and when either spouse dies), the couple must spend 2"C dollars in

every period and state where both are alive for every C dollars in any state where only one survives. From

(1), it is apparent that the household’s highest sustainable living standard is:


                                                                                                              (2)




The couple can guarantee that spouse j’s death will not diminish i’s living standard from its highest

sustainable level, c*, by purchasing a life insurance policy with face value                                  .2

        We measure underlying financial vulnerabilities by comparing an individual’s highest sustainable

living standard, c*, with                      , which represents the living standard he or she would enjoy if



        2
         In the special case where the household has Leontief preferences (defined over per capita adjusted
expenditures), this is also the utility maximizing outcome.

                                                         5
widowed, ignoring life insurance.              We define the variable IMPACT (ignoring insurance) as

                    , i = W,H. This is a measure of the percent by which the survivor’s living standard would,

with no insurance protection, fall short of or exceed the couple’s highest sustainable living standard.

Similarly, we measure uninsured financial vulnerabilities by comparing c* with                                            ,

which represents the living standard that the individual would actually enjoy if widowed, based on actual

life insurance coverage,         . We define the variable IMPACT (actual) as                                 . This is a

measure of the percent by which the survivor’s living standard would, given actual levels of coverage, fall

short of or exceed the couple’s highest sustainable living standard. The IMPACT variables are based on a

concrete and easily understood yardstick for quantifying the consequences of a spouse’s death.3 We also

compare actual household life insurance holdings,                      , with the benchmark level,                 .

         For the preceding example, we implicitly assumed that individuals could borrow at the rate r and

issue survival-contingent claims at the prices pH and pW. As a practical matter, households encounter

liquidity constraints. They are also typically unable or at least very reluctant to purchase negative quantities

of life insurance (buy annuities).4 In solving for each household’s highest sustainable living standard, we

take these restrictions into account, smoothing consumption to the greatest extent possible.5

         When the life insurance constraint binds, the benchmark living standard for a survivor,                  (where

i = H or W), may be greater than the benchmark living standard for the couple while both spouses are still



         3
          Note that, when actual life insurance is below the benchmark, the intact couple saves on insurance
premiums, so its actual consumption exceeds c*. Hence, the IMPACT variables understate the change in living
standard that an individual experiences upon a spouse’s death. However, since life insurance premiums typically
account for a small fraction of expenditures, the degree of understatement is small.
         4
          A non-negativity constraint for life insurance purchases is equivalent to the restriction that life annuities are
not available for purchase at the margin. For further discussion, see Yaari (1965), Kotlikoff and Spivak (1981), and
Bernheim (1987).
         5
          Formally, one can think of the outcome that we identify as the limit of the solutions to a series of utility
maximization problems in which the intertemporal elasticity of substitution approaches zero. In the limit (the
Leontief case), the household is actually indifferent with respect to the distribution of consumption across any years
in which its living standard exceeds the minimum level.

                                                            6
alive,       . This observation raises the following practical issue: when calculating IMPACT, should we set

              , or          ? Were we to use       , actual IMPACT would be positive not only for households

that depart from the benchmark by purchasing additional insurance (                      ), but also for constrained

households that conform to the benchmark by purchasing no insurance (                             ). In contrast, the

use of       implies that actual IMPACT is positive when                  and zero when                      . Since

we wish to use actual IMPACT as a measure of the extent to which a household deviates from the

consumption-smoothed benchmark, we therefore select                  rather than      . As a result, the value of

IMPACT ignoring insurance is always non-positive (even though, absent insurance, the survivor’s material

living standard might actually increase upon his or her spouse’s death), and it equals zero whenever the

corresponding benchmark insurance level,           , is zero.


         B. Implementation

         We actually evaluate each household’s financial vulnerabilities using a more elaborate and realistic

life cycle model. As mentioned previously, the model is embedded in a financial planning software program,

Economic Security Planner (or ESPlanner). Although a complete description of the model would be

prohibitively lengthy, it is important to summarize some key features.6

         For our base-case calculations, we assume that each individual lives to a maximum age of 95. We

include children as members of the household through age 18. We represent household scale economies as

follows: an expenditure of (N + $K)"C, when there are N adults and K children in the household provides

the same standard of living for each household member as does an expenditure of C when there is only one

adult in the household (this generalizes the adjustment factor used in our simple illustration). The coefficient




         6
          The software has many capabilities that we do not make use of here due to data limitations. For example,
it can account for a variety of special expenditures (college education, weddings, etc.), plans to change homes,
various kinds of state contingent plans (e.g. a non-working wife plans to return to work and spend less on a child’s
education if her husband dies), and estate plans (including intended bequests).

                                                          7
$ is a child-adult equivalency factor; we set it equal to 0.5.7 The exponent " captures economies of scale

in shared living. We set it equal to 0.678, which implies that a two-adult household must spend 1.6 times

as much as a one-adult household to achieve the same living standard.8

         Insurance needs depend on differences in survival-contingent income streams. Consequently, a

careful and thorough treatment of the social security system is essential. In calculating benefits for

retirement, survivors, parents, children, spouses, and dependent children, the model accounts for eligibility

rules, early retirement reductions, delayed retirement credits, benefit re-computation, the legislated phased

increase in the normal retirement age, the earnings test, restrictions on maximum family benefits, the wage

indexation of average indexed monthly earnings, and the price indexation of benefits once they are received.

         Various characteristics of the tax system, such as rate structure and the treatment of married couples,

can alter insurance needs by influencing the distribution of after-tax income across the various survival

contingencies. Consequently, a careful treatment of taxation is also critical. The model calculates federal

and state income and payroll taxes for each year in each survival contingency.9 It incorporates a wide range

of provisions, including federal deductions and exemptions, the decision to itemize deductions, the taxation

of social security benefits, the earned income tax credit, the child tax credit, the phase-out at higher income

levels of itemized deductions, and the indexation of tax brackets to the consumer price index. In computing

federal deductions, it determines whether the sum of state income taxes, mortgage interest payments, and

property taxes is large enough to justify itemization. Contributions to tax-favored retirement savings accounts



         7
           Our child-adult equivalency factor is that used by the OECD (see Ringen, 1991). Nelson’s (1992) work
suggests a smaller value, but she considers total household expenditures whereas our child-adult equivalency factor
applies only to non-housing consumption expenditure; for our base-case results, we treat housing expenditure as
inflexible. It appears from Nelson’s work that a higher equivalency factor is appropriate for non-housing
expenditures.
         8
         The OECD uses a value of 0.7 for " (see Ringen, 1991). Williams, et. al. (1998) consider values of 0.5 for
both " and $.
         9
        The SCF does not contain data on the state of residency. Therefore, we assume all households reside in
Massachusetts.

are excluded from taxable income, and withdrawals are included. Though the model determines total saving

simultaneously with life insurance, tax-favored saving is specified exogenously.

        Choices concerning housing may also affect life insurance needs. Unlike many other expenditures,

housing outlays are not easily smoothed. It is difficult to scale mortgage, property tax, and insurance

payments up and down with other expenditures. Cost and inconvenience discourage many households from

moving or refinancing mortgages; others form psychological attachments to their homes, and resist changing

residences prior to death (Venti and Wise, 2000). Moreover, few households access the equity in their homes

through refinancing or reverse annuity mortgages (Caplin, 2000). Consequently, for our base-case

calculations, we treat housing as fixed consumption. In effect, we assume that couples and survivors remain

in the same home until death, and die with home equity intact. Formally, we subtract housing expenses from

income off-the-top, itemizing mortgage interest and property taxes as deductions for federal income tax

purposes when it is optimal to do so, prior to smoothing variable consumption.

        Several potentially important factors are omitted from our analysis. We do not model uncertainty

concerning future income and non-discretionary expenses (e.g. medical care). Since small groups of

individuals can share risks to some extent, the adverse effect of uncertainty on living standard is probably

greater for widows and widowers than for couples. For this reason, our analysis tends to understate insurance

needs. We also neglect the possibility that an individual might remarry after a spouse’s death. The extent

to which remarriage mitigates the financial consequences of a spouse’s death depends on one’s view of the

marriage market.10 Although relatively few elderly individuals remarry after the death of a spouse (see

Bernheim, et. al. [2001]), remarriage is more common among younger households.

        Table 1 summarizes some illustrative life insurance calculations.11 We begin with a couple

consisting of a 40 year-old man earning $45,000 per year, and a 38 year-old woman earning $25,000 per year.

The man intends to retire at age 64, the woman at age 63. They have two children, ages 5 and 7. The net

value of their non-housing assets is $50,000; in addition, they own a $150,000 home, and have an unpaid

mortgage balance of $120,000. They expect their real earnings to grow at the rate of one percent per year

until retirement. They also expect to earn a real after-tax return of 3 percent on their non-housing

investments. According to our model, this couple must purchase $285,922 in term insurance on the

husband’s life, and no insurance on the wife’s life, to ensure each potential survivor of an undiminished

living standard. The remainder of the table illustrates the sensitivity of insurance needs to changes in various

household characteristics and economic parameters. As one would expect, benchmark life insurance falls

with age and with the earnings of the insured spouse; it rises with the addition of a child, with an increase

in the rate of earnings growth, and with a reduction in the real interest rate (these last two changes increase

the present discounted value of future human capital). There is one surprising finding: benchmark insurance

also rises with the removal of one child. This result is attributable to the associated changes in social security

survivor benefits, which are quantitatively important for the hypothesized family. For an otherwise identical

family with high income (for which social security survivor benefits are less important), benchmark

insurance rises monotonically with the number of children.

        C. Interpretation

        We do not regard any single measure of financial vulnerability as ideal. Though elaborate, the life

cycle model used in our analysis is still an abstraction, and we have imperfect information concerning the

economic circumstances of each household (see the Appendix). Nor do we regard the benchmark level of

life insurance as an objective standard of adequacy or rationality. Optimal insurance coverage depends on

a variety of considerations, including (but not limited to) the manner in which marginal utilities vary across

survival states, the weights that households attach to the well-being of each family member, degrees of risk

aversion, and load factors (more generally, the degree to which the industry departs from actuarially fair

pricing). Consequently, it is possible to rationalize a wide range of behaviors.

         Nevertheless, the absence of a significant correlation between life insurance and financial

vulnerabilities (measured by benchmark life insurance) would be difficult to reconcile with theories of

rational financial behavior. Even if a household places less weight on the well-being of a particular spouse,

and even if it must pay actuarially unfair rates, it should still obtain greater insurance protection when the

spouse in question is exposed to more severe financial consequences. To explain the absence of a

correlation, one would need to believe either that our measure of benchmark life insurance is largely

unrelated to underlying vulnerabilities, or that marginal utilities vary in a way that just offsets the differences

in measured vulnerabilities. Both possibilities strike us as improbable.

         Evidence of widespread and substantial uninsured vulnerabilities (as measured by actual IMPACT

or by the divergence of actual insurance from the benchmark) are also more difficult to rationalize than it

might at first appear. Most potential explanations presuppose that households deliberately choose different

living standards for survivors. Yet this premise is inconsistent with preliminary findings from a financial

planning case study at Boston University, involving nearly 500 subjects. Each of these individuals

constructed a comprehensive financial plan using the same financial planning software employed in the

current study. Participants hoped to benefit from these sessions, and therefore had strong incentives to

provide accurate information. Though the software permits users to specify different living standards for

intact couples and each potential survivor, the vast majority of subjects selected the same living standard for

each contingency.12 While it is perfectly rational for individuals to have other objectives, it is irrational for

individuals with these objectives to purchase coverage that diverges significantly from our benchmark

(assuming, of course, that the benchmark is derived from a model that correctly depicts all important aspects

of the household’s opportunity set).



         12
           Even with risk aversion, such choices are reasonable if load factors are low. For evidence on load factors
in the context of life annuities, see Mitchell, Poterba, Warshawsky, and Brown (1999).

3. Data

          The 1995 wave of the SCF was fielded between June and December 1995. It surveyed over 4000

households, with oversampling of the wealthy.13 The data cover demographics, income, wealth, debt and

credit, pensions, attitudes about financial matters, the nature of various transactions with various types of

financial institutions, housing, real estate, businesses, vehicles, health and life insurance, current and past

employment, current social security benefits, inheritances, charitable contributions, education, and retirement

plans. The architects of the SCF data files imputed missing information, supplying five “implicates” for each

household.14 We use the first implicate.

          Our final sample consists of 1,033 couples. We excluded couples for the following reasons: a) a

spouse was self employed or owned and actively managed a business (67 percent of excluded observations);

b) a spouse was temporarily unemployed (11 percent); c) neither spouse had regular earnings as an employee

(54 percent); d) labor earnings were defined in terms of a unit other than time worked, for example by the

piece (0.7 percent); e) mortgage information was inconsistent (7.4 percent); f) property taxes were greater

than 5 percent of the value of the home (2.6 percent); g) a spouse was over the age of 85 (1.6 percent); or h)

the couple’s reported income and other economic resources were insufficient to support its reported fixed

expenditures (3.3 percent).15

          Accurate measurement of life insurance coverage is, of course, particularly critical for our analysis.

Fortunately, the SCF data match up reasonably well with other sources of information concerning this

variable. In table 2, we make some comparisons between statistics on life insurance coverage (including all

individual and group policies) drawn from the SCF and from a survey fielded by the Life Insurance

Marketing Research Organization (LIMRA), an authoritative industry source. Generally, the figures are quite


          13
               The SCF sampled 2,874 married couples and 1,425 single individuals.

               Note that some households fall into more than one category.

                                                           12
close. Certainly, there is no indication that the SCF understates life insurance coverage. It is, of course,

possible that households underreported certain forms of insurance (e.g. employer-provided policies) in both

surveys. As an additional check on the validity of the data, we computed the aggregate amount of in-force

life insurance implied by the SCF survey responses, and compared this with total in-force life insurance

reported by the industry (obtained from the American Council on Life Insurance [1999]). Since the latter

figure is derived directly from company records, it is presumably reliable. The SCF survey data accounts

for roughly 81 percent of aggregate in-force life insurance ($9.52 trillion out of $11.70 trillion). Since some

life insurance policies are owned by companies, trusts, and foreign individuals rather than by U.S.

households, the SCF figure appears to be in the right ballpark.

        An important limitation of the SCF is that it contains information only on the total amount of life

insurance held by each household, and not on the division of this insurance between spouses. Using data

from the 1992 Health and Retirement Survey (HRS), we estimated a regression equation explaining the

fraction of a couple’s total life insurance held on the life of the husband as a function of the age of each

spouse, the husband’s earnings, the husbands share of the couple’s total non-asset income, family size, and

the husband’s share of the couple’s total benchmark life insurance. We then used this regression to impute

the fraction of total insurance held on the life of each spouse for every couple in the 1995 SCF. Because we

do not wish to rely on these imputations more than is necessary, much of our analysis concerns household

aggregates. This approach is somewhat different from that of Bernheim, et. al. [2001], who treated an

individual spouse as the unit of analysis throughout.


4. Results

        Table 3 provides a variety of summary statistics, including some simple information on insurance

coverage. According to figures in panel A, the average benchmark level of life insurance for a household

exceeded actual life insurance holdings by a wide margin (more than two-to-one for the mean, and nearly



                                                      13
three-to-one for the median). Panel B indicates that the average level of insurance actually held on the lives

of husbands and primary earners diverged sharply from the average benchmark, whereas the average level

of insurance actually held on the lives of wives and secondary earners was quite close to the average

benchmark.16 This implies that, on average, wives and secondary earners faced substantial uninsured

vulnerabilities, whereas husbands and primary earners did not.

         In the second-to-last line of panel B () liv. std., ignore ins.), we tabulate means and medians for

IMPACT calculated as if each household held no life insurance. This variable measures underlying financial

exposure. Without insurance, the average living standards for surviving husbands, wives, primary earners,

and secondary earners would have been, respectively, 5.7 percent, 28.6 percent, 3.8 percent, and 30.5 percent

below their benchmark levels. Since the corresponding medians for husbands and primary earners are zero,

we can infer that more than half of these individuals were not at-risk of a reduction in sustainable living

standard. Likewise, since the corresponding median living standard reductions for wives and secondary

earners were 21.5 percent and 24.6 percent, respectively, we conclude that more than have of these

individuals confronted significant underlying vulnerabilities.

         In the final line of panel B () liv. std., actual), we tabulate means and medians for IMPACT based

on actual insurance holdings. This variable measures uninsured financial exposure. Life insurance reduced

the mean value of IMPACT by roughly 40 percent for wives and secondary earners. The decline in the

median value of IMPACT for secondary earners is a bit larger, while the proportional decline in median

IMPACT for wives is closer to two-thirds. For husbands and primary earners, life insurance had a relatively

minor absolute effect on mean and median IMPACT, but the average underlying vulnerabilities were small

for these groups to begin with.

         Based on these initial findings, one might be inclined to conclude that, on average, life insurance



         16
           It is important to bear in mind that we have imputed the shares of a household’s insurance held on the
lives of each spouse, as described in section 3.

                                                         14
addresses between 40 percent and 50 percent of the underlying exposure for the most vulnerable spouse.

However, this conclusion is premature. Underlying financial exposures vary dramatically across households.

From an inspection of averages (table 3), one cannot determine whether the distribution of insurance holdings

matches up with the distribution of exposures. As we will see, the averages mask a startling mismatch

between vulnerabilities and insurance holdings. Moreover, simple averages also fail to reveal substantial

uninsured vulnerabilities for sizable minorities of husbands and primary workers.

        Table 4 provides a first glimpse at the relation between benchmark insurance and actual insurance

across households. In panel A, we group households into four categories based on the benchmark insurance

level. As indicated in the second column, similar fractions of the data sample fall into each of these groups.

The figures in the third column suggest that there is practically no relationship between benchmark insurance

and the likelihood of holding insurance. In this sense, the decision to obtain insurance appears to be

uncorrelated with underlying vulnerabilities. The fourth and fifth columns permit comparisons between the

medians of benchmark insurance and actual insurance for each of the four groups. There is perhaps a small

correlation across groups between insurance purchases and the benchmark. A similar conclusion follows

from a comparison of means (columns 6 and 7), though the average level of actual insurance for those with

no underlying vulnerabilities (benchmark insurance of zero) is anomalously large.

        Though there is some indication that benchmark insurance is mildly correlated with actual insurance,

the proper interpretation of this correlation is unclear. From panel A, it is apparent that differences in the

median and mean levels of actual insurance across groups correspond reasonably closely to differences in

median household income (second-to-last column). Consider the alternative hypothesis that households with

more income mechanically acquire more insurance without much deliberate consideration of vulnerabilities

and needs. It is reasonable to entertain this possibility because many employers automatically provide life

insurance equal to some multiple of salary, and because life insurance agents frequently base

recommendations on simple rules of thumb involving multiples of earnings. This hypothesis would account


                                                     15
for the positive correlation between benchmark and actual insurance levels among those for whom the

benchmark is positive. Moreover, it would explain the otherwise anomalously high levels of insurance

holdings among those for who benchmark insurance is zero (and who also tend to have higher incomes).

        Panel B of table 4 contains the same information as panel A, except that insurance levels are

expressed as ratios to household earnings. This serves as a rough control for earnings, and permits us to

evaluate the extent of the relationship between benchmark and actual levels of insurance that exists

independently of the mechanical “income effect” hypothesized in the preceding paragraph. Once again, we

divide the sample into four groups of roughly equal sizes (as indicated in the second column). Though the

percent insured rises slightly with the ratio of benchmark insurance to earnings across the first three groups,

it is lowest for the most vulnerable group (those with ratios of benchmark insurance to earnings in excess

of 8). Moreover, regardless of whether one looks at medians (columns 4 and 5) or means (columns 6 and

7), the correlation across groups between the ratio of benchmark insurance to earnings and the ratio of actual

insurance to earnings is weak at best. These observations suggests that the small correlation between

benchmark and actual insurance levels noted in our discussion of panel A results from an income effect, and

not from deliberate evaluation of other factors affecting vulnerabilities.

        Table 5 summarizes the relationship between benchmark and actual levels of life insurance through

some simple univariate regression models. Panel A presents results based on levels of life insurance, while

panel B examines ratios of life insurance to earnings. In each panel, we estimate the equation of interest

using three different methods: OLS, Tobit (to check for potential biases arising from the sizeable fraction

of households who hold no insurance), and median regression (to check for sensitivity to outliers). In

addition, we also estimate a Probit model explaining the likelihood that a household’s actual insurance

holdings are strictly positive.

        In panel A, we find that a one-dollar increase in the benchmark tends to coincide with a 22 cent

increase in actual insurance holdings. For each of the three methods employed, we estimate this coefficient


                                                      16
with considerable precision. Households with higher levels of benchmark insurance are also more likely to

hold strictly positive insurance, but the difference is not statistically significant. In panel B, we find that the

correlations noted in panel A result almost entirely from systematic differences in income. The ratio of

benchmark insurance to earnings is almost completely unrelated to the ratio of actual insurance to earnings,

and is in fact negatively related to the likelihood of holding insurance.

        The logic of examining simple univariate regressions is that benchmark insurance functions as a

sufficient statistic for the full range of factors – ages of spouses, number of children, division of earnings

between spouses, and so forth – that determine underlying vulnerabilities. Certainly, it would not be sensible

to control for all of the factors affecting vulnerabilities, as this would leave no residual variation in

benchmark insurance from which to identify the covariation with actual insurance.

        There are, however, valid reasons to investigate the correlation between benchmark and actual levels

of insurance conditional upon a subset of the factors that determine vulnerabilities. As mentioned at the

outset of this paper, Bernheim, et. al. [2001] previously documented the absence of a correlation between

insurance holdings and vulnerabilities among older workers. One of our primary objectives is to distinguish

between two alternative explanations for this pattern: that insurance purchases are largely uncorrelated with

vulnerabilities, or that households purchase long-term policies based on vulnerabilities relatively early in life,

but subsequently fail to adjust coverage appropriately because of inertia and/or other psychological

considerations. To accomplish this objective, we must study the relationship between life insurance and

underlying vulnerabilities conditional on age.

        The final column of panels A and B in table 4 provide a separate reason to control for age. Note that

both the absolute value of benchmark insurance and the ratio of the benchmark to household earnings decline

sharply with the couple’s average age (defined as the average of the husband’s and wife’s ages). This stands

to reason, since younger individuals generally have more future human capital to protect. Now consider the

following two-part hypothesis: (1) young individuals tend to procrastinate with respect to decisions


                                                        17
concerning life insurance, and (2) when they finally obtain insurance, the amount purchased is closely related

to vulnerabilities. Since younger households have greater vulnerabilities, the first portion of the hypothesis

would tend to create a negative correlation between insurance holdings and underlying vulnerabilities. In

principle, this could obscure the positive correlation implied by the second portion of the hypothesis.

         Table 6 contains various regressions in which we control for the effects of age. In each case, the

dependent variable is the ratio of actual life insurance to household earnings.17 There are two separate sets

of results. For the first four regressions, we include linear and quadratic terms in the couple’s average age

(defined as above), as well as an interaction term between age and the ratio of benchmark life insurance to

household earnings. The interaction term permits us to investigate the hypothesis that the correlation

between insurance holdings and vulnerabilities changes with age.                   If households initially purchase

appropriate levels of insurance but subsequently fail to adjust their holdings as circumstances change, we

would expect to obtain a positive coefficient for the benchmark insurance term, and a negative coefficient

for the interaction term. For the last four regressions in table 6, we adopt a more flexible functional

specification. In particular, we divide the population into five age groups, and control both for age-group

dummies and for interactions between these dummies and the benchmark-insurance-to-earnings ratio. This

is equivalent to estimating a separate univariate regression for each age group. At the bottom of the table,

we report test statistics for two hypotheses. The first is that there is no relationship between actual insurance

and benchmark insurance at any age. The second is that the relationship between actual insurance and

benchmark insurance does not change systematically with age.

         In the first three specifications of table 6, the coefficient of the benchmark-insurance-to-earnings

ratio is small, slightly negative, and statistically insignificant, while the insurance-age interaction term is

indistinguishable from zero. This implies that there is essentially no relationship between actual insurance


         17
            Scaling the insurance variables by earnings is, of course, a perfect control for earnings only if the earnings
elasticity of insurance purchases is unity. When an earnings variable (either levels or logs) is added to the list of
explanatory variables for any specification in table 5, the results described below change relatively little.

                                                           18
and benchmark insurance at any age. The test statistics at the bottom of the table confirm this impression.

For the fourth specification (a probit model), the coefficient of the benchmark-insurance-to-earnings ratio

is negative and marginally significant, while the coefficient of the interaction term is positive but

insignificant. One rejects the hypothesis that vulnerabilities (as measured by benchmark insurance) have no

effect on the likelihood of holding insurance at any age, but the direction of the effect is counterintuitive: the

probit coefficients imply that the likelihood of holding insurance is negatively correlated with benchmark

insurance for households under 100 years of age.

        Regression results based on a more flexible functional specification tell a similar story. The age-

specific benchmark insurance coefficients are generally small, frequently negative, and almost always

insignificant. For the OLS and Tobit specifications, one cannot reject the joint hypothesis that there is no

significant correlation between benchmark insurance and actual insurance at any age. In every specification,

we fail to reject the hypothesis that this correlation does not vary significantly with age.

        Table 7 provides further information on the distributions of the IMPACT variables. Recall that the

measurement of actual IMPACT requires us to impute the share of household insurance held on the life of

each spouse. As discussed previously, ignoring insurance, IMPACT is never strictly greater than zero. This

reflects the fact that we have imposed a non-negativity constraint on life insurance purchases. An

individual’s living standard may rise upon a spouse’s death; however, without life insurance, it cannot exceed

the living standard that the he or she would enjoy as a survivor assuming implementation of the (constrained)

benchmark financial plan. Note also that actual IMPACT is exactly equal to zero for a substantial fraction

of the population. Generally, these are individuals for whom actual and (model-generated) benchmark levels

of insurance protection are both zero.

        From table 7, it is once again evident that insurance holdings match up rather poorly with financial

vulnerabilities. Overall, 36.8 percent of wives, 64.1 percent of husbands, 32.0 percent of secondary earners,

and 68.8 percent of primary earners had strictly positive life insurance protection despite the fact that they


                                                       19
would have experienced increases in living standards upon the deaths of their spouses (in Table 7, those with

actual IMPACT greater than zero). Insurance reduced the fraction of individuals at-risk of severe financial

consequences (defined as a decline in living standard of 40 percent or greater) from 31.0 percent to 19.3

percent for wives, from 32.5 percent to 20.6 percent of secondary earners, from 3.5 percent to 2.9 percent

of husbands, and from 1.9 percent to 1.6 percent for primary earners. Similarly, insurance reduced the

fraction of individuals at-risk of significant financial consequences (defined as a decline in living standard

of 20 percent or greater) from 51.9 percent to 37.9 percent for wives, from 55.9 percent to 41.7 percent for

secondary earners, from 10.0 percent to 8.5 percent for husbands, and from 6.0 percent to 4.7 percent for

primary earners. Roughly speaking, only 15 to 25 percent of households with significant financial exposures

held sufficient life insurance to avert significant consequences for survivors.

        Table 8 provides further information on the extent to which insurance mitigates financial

vulnerabilities. We subdivide the population based on underlying financial exposure, measured by the value

of IMPACT, ignoring insurance. For each subgroup, we then calculate the means of both IMPACT variables,

as well as the percentage of households holding no life insurance, and averages for benchmark and actual

insurance.

        We draw three conclusions from table 8. First, life insurance had, at best, a moderate impact on

financial exposures among the at-risk population. For example, among severely at-risk wives, insurance

reduced the average consequences of a spouse’s death (mean IMPACT) by only 27 percent (17.9 percentage

points), from -65.5 percent to -47.6 percent. This is a far cry from the one-half overall reduction in mean

IMPACT for wives noted in table 3. For this same group, households would have needed to hold an average

of $630,079 in total life insurance to assure both the husband and wife of an undiminished living standard.

In fact, on average, they held only one-quarter of this amount ($166,628). This implies an even larger

discrepancy (more than $460,000) than the overall difference (just under $240,000) noted in table 3.

        Second, for a fixed level of financial exposure, households were more inclined to protect women than


                                                     20
men. For example, among severely at-risk husbands, insurance reduced the average consequences of the

wife’s death (mean IMPACT) by only 6 percent (4.3 percentage points), from -68.4 percent to -64.1 percent.

This contrasts sharply with the corresponding figures for wives, noted above. One might question the

reliability of this finding on the grounds that we have imputed the division of insurance between spouses

based on patterns in the HRS. However, the gender difference is plainly not an artifact of the imputation

procedure. Note in particular that couples with severely at-risk wives on average held in total $166,628 of

life insurance, while couples with severely at-risk husbands on average held only 15 percent of this amount

($24,827).

        Third, the likelihood of holding insurance bears little if any relation to underlying vulnerabilities,

as measured by IMPACT (ignoring insurance). Indeed, the fraction of couples without life insurance is

generally largest for those with severe financial exposures (IMPACT ignoring insurance less than -40

percent).

        Table 9 provides disaggregated results for various population subgroups. To conserve space, we

confine our attention to primary and secondary earners (results for husbands and wives are similar). In

addition to reporting the percentage of each subgroup with severe and significant exposures based on

IMPACT with actual insurance (Freq. Actual) and on IMPACT ignoring insurance (Freq. Ins=0), we also

report the fractional reduction in each exposure rate resulting from insurance coverage (Frac. Addr.).18

        Significant and severe uninsured financial vulnerabilities were more common among low income

households, couples with disparate earnings, relatively young households, couples with dependent children,

and non-whites. Thus, factors that are highly correlated with underlying vulnerabilities (particularly earnings

disparaties, age, and children) are also highly correlated with uninsured vulnerabilities. This finding is, of

course, implied by the poor correlation between vulnerabilities and insurance holdings.

        According to table 9, conditional upon the existence of a significant or severe vulnerability,


        18
             Formally, frac. addr. (fraction addressed) = [(Freq. Ins=0) - (Freq. Actual)]/(Freq. Ins=0).

                                                            21
households with lower incomes, greater income disparities between spouses, no children, and non-whites are

less likely to moderate the financial consequences of a spouse’s death through life insurance (see the column

labeled “frac. addr.”). The relationship between age and the conditional likelihood of addressing a

significant or severe vulnerability was hump-shaped, with a peak in the 40-55 year age range. Households

were generally less likely to address vulnerabilities for primary earners. Note that a low proclivity to address

exposures can coincide either with high (as in the case of lower income households) or low (as in the case

of older individuals and primary earners) levels of underlying vulnerability.

        When one compares households of similar ages, our results are quite close to those derived from the

HRS data in Bernheim, et. al. [2001].19 For example, we find that 13.4 percent of secondary earners between

the ages of 56 and 70 have significant uninsured vulnerabilities while 7.6 percent have severe uninsured

vulnerabilities; the comparable figures in Bernheim, et. al. [2001] for 60 to 69 year old survivors are 14.1

percent and 8.9 percent. Moreover, the data exhibit the same qualitative patterns with respect to the

magnitudes of vulnerabilities, as well as with respect to the propensity to address vulnerabilities, across

household categories.

        It is, however, important to reiterate that data limitations precluded previous studies from shedding

light on the insurance holdings of younger households. Consequently, our findings concerning age are

particularly noteworthy. According to table 9, nearly two-thirds of secondary earners between the ages of

22 and 39 have significant financial vulnerabilities (projected reductions in living standards exceeding 20

percent), and nearly one-third have severe vulnerabilities (projected reductions exceeding 40 percent).

Moreover, for this age group, only one in five households with at-risk secondary earners (those who would

experience significant or severe declines in living standard upon the death of their spouse, ignoring



        19
           The age-adjusted frequencies of severe and significant uninsured financial exposures reported here and in
Bernheim, et. al. [2001] are lower than Auerbach and Kotlikoff’s [1987, 1991a, 1991b] estimates. Possible
explanations for the disparity include increases in female labor force participation since the 1960s, changes in
patterns of insurance coverage, and methodological differences.

                                                        22
insurance) held sufficient life insurance to avert significant or severe financial consequences.

         Thus far, we have measured the consequences of a spouse’s death in terms of the proportional change

in sustainable living standard. For many individuals, the potential financial consequences of a spouse’s death

are also severe in absolute terms. With maximal consumption smoothing (benchmark insurance), sustainable

consumption for 3.58 percent of surviving wives and 2.61 percent of surviving husbands would fall below

the 1995 poverty thresholds published by the U.S. Census Bureau. Taking into account actual levels of

insurance coverage, poverty rates would have been 10.45 percent among surviving wives and 4.16 percent

among surviving husbands. These findings imply that 66 percent (6.87 of 10.45 percentage points) of

poverty among surviving women and 37 percent (1.55 out of 4.16 percentage points) of poverty among

surviving men resulted from a failure to ensure survivors of an undiminished living standard through

insurance. Ignoring insurance, poverty rates would have been 13.17 percent among surviving wives and 4.26

percent among surviving husbands. Consequently, insurance eliminated only 28 percent of the avoidable

poverty among surviving widows (2.72 out of 9.59 percentage points), and only 6 percent of the avoidable

poverty among surviving men (0.1 out of 1.63 percentage points).


5. Robustness

         In table 10, we examine the extent to which our estimated frequencies of significant and severe

uninsured vulnerabilities are sensitive to changes in key assumptions and parameters. To conserve space,

we focus on primary and secondary earners. For purposes of comparison, we reproduce our base-case results

in the first line of the table.

         Changes in the real interest rate, baseline wage growth rate, and maximum lifespan alter the results

relatively little.20 In each case, this reflects the opposing effects of offsetting forces. With higher interest

rates, a given level of life insurance coverage generates higher real income. However, since survivors are



         20
              For our base case, we assume that the inflation rate and real interest rate are both 3 percent.

                                                              23
typically more dependent on long-duration life annuities than intact couples, the present discounted value

of their resources tends to decline by a larger proportion when the rate of return rises. For older workers,

the rate of wage growth is relatively unimportant because it affects comparatively few years of earnings.

Moreover, while a given rate of growth produces a larger absolute increase in earnings for primary earners,

secondary earners tend to be younger, and therefore benefit from higher growth over a longer time frame.

A reduction in maximum lifespan reduces the resources that a survivor needs to achieve a given living

standard, but increases the living standard that the intact couple can achieve from available resources.

        The consumption growth rate refers to steepness of the sustainable living standard trajectory. For

our base-case, we compute the highest living standard that is sustainable throughout life in all contingencies;

this corresponds to a consumption growth rate of zero. For sufficiently patient (impatient) households, it may

be more natural to construct benchmarks based on a rising (falling) living standard trajectory. The

proportional effects of a change in the consumption growth rate on the resource needs of survivors and intact

couples are approximately equal. Our results are therefore robust with respect to changes in this parameter.

        The frequencies of exposure to significant and severe financial consequences are noticeably lower

in the absence of household scale economies (an extreme and somewhat implausible assumption). It is

somewhat higher when we reduce the rate of pension survivor benefits from 100 percent to 50 percent, but

the change is much smaller than that reported in Bernheim, et. al. [2001]. The discrepancy is presumably

attributable to differences between the age distributions of the SCF and HRS samples. For younger

households, pension survivor benefits make less of a difference both because they are further in the future

and thus more heavily discounted, and because younger workers have not yet accumulated substantial

pension entitlements.

        As mentioned previously, our base case assumptions concerning housing are consistent with

empirical evidence indicating that individuals avoid changing residences (increasingly so as they age), and

that they resist using housing equity to finance ordinary living expenses. However, since some widows do


                                                      24
move, we examine sensitivity to two alternative assumptions. For the first, we adopt the extreme position

that housing consumption is completely and continuously flexible, and that housing equity is a perfect

substitute for other forms of wealth. For the second alternative, we adopt an intermediate position: a survivor

downsizes the couple’s primary residence by 30 percent, but thereafter avoids using housing equity to finance

ordinary living expenses.21 Though the first alternative dramatically reduces the estimated frequencies of

individuals at risk of severe or significant financial consequences, the effect of the second (and, we think,

more plausible) alternative is relatively small.

         As in Bernheim, et. al. [2001], our base case calculations assume that survivors do not alter their

labor force participation. Since non-working wives approaching retirement age have limited employment

options subsequent to their husbands’ deaths, this assumption was appropriate for the HRS sample. It is

somewhat more problematic for the younger households that are included in the SCF. Conceivably, some

couples may hold apparently low levels of insurance on a primary earner because, in the event of his or her

death, they expect the surviving spouse to find full-time employment. We note, however, that this

explanation is inconsistent with a finding reported in section 4: fixing the level of underlying vulnerability,

couples are less likely to obtain insurance for the protection of primary earners (and husbands) than for

secondary earners (and wives). Since primary earners are already (in most cases) fully employed, secondary

earners have greater latitude to increase labor force participation. Consequently, for a given level of

vulnerability, one would expect to observe greater protection of primary earners, which is not the case.

         To evaluate the sensitivity of our results with respect to possible changes in labor force participation,

we consider an extreme alternative assumption: all survivors, whether out of the labor force or employed

part-time, return to full-time employment. We impute full-time earnings based on regressions of earnings



         21
            In this exercise, we assume that the financing for the new house is the same as the continuation financing
for the old house. Consequently, upon a spouse’s death, the decline in home equity equals the reduction in the value
of the home, and there is an offsetting increase in non-housing assets; mortgage payments are unchanged, but other
housing expenses fall by 30 percent.

                                                         25
on demographic characteristics, estimated separately for fully employed men and women. A survivor’s

contingent earnings are set equal to the maximum of imputed earnings and actual earnings. Due to familiar

sample selection problems, this procedure tends to overstate potential earnings for non-workers; it therefore

understates survivors’ financial vulnerabilities. As indicated in table 10, the estimated frequencies of

financial vulnerability are reasonably sensitive to this alternative assumption. This contrasts with the findings

of Bernheim, et. al. [2001]. The difference is not particularly surprising, since the ability to alter labor

supply is more important for younger workers. Note, however, that substantial uninsured vulnerabilities are

reasonably widespread even with this extreme alternative assumption. This too is not surprising, given the

high levels of vulnerabilities among dual earner households noted in table 9.

        In principle, shifts in non-labor income might also cushion the financial impact of a spouse’s death.

Our analysis makes no allowance for this possibility. Presumably, the most important source of potential

support is assistance from relatives. Bernheim, et. al. [2001] report that, between the first two waves of the

HRS, only 6.2 percent of new widows received any assistance of this type. Between the second and third

waves, the figure was 7.5 percent; and between the third and fourth waves, it was only 2.5 percent. In

addition, support may have been modest and/or temporary in many of these cases. Consequently, there is

little evidence that external support payments are significant in practice. Although the HRS only provides

information on older widows, we conjecture that these figures are lower for young widows (except perhaps

where young children are present).

        As emphasized in section 3, the SCF collects information only on total life insurance for each

household, and not on the proportions attributable to each spouse. Our base case results apportion this

insurance using the imputation method described previously. If in some cases these imputations falsely

imply that insurance is held to protect spouses who are not financially vulnerable, then our calculations will

overstate uninsured vulnerabilities for at-risk individuals. To examine the potential significance of

imputation error, we consider an extreme alternative assumption: all life insurance is held to protect the


                                                       26
secondary earner (who is, in general, considerably more vulnerable). As indicated in table 9, the effects on

our results are minimal. This is not surprising for two reasons: total household life insurance is typically

small relative to benchmark insurance, and, in any case, our imputations attribute most life insurance to the

primary earner.

        If important economic variables are measured with error, our calculations may overstate the thickness

of the upper and lower tails of the distribution of IMPACT, thereby exaggerating the frequencies of

significant and severe financial vulnerabilities. Measures of household assets tend to be particularly noisy.

However, as illustrated in the final two rows of table 10, our findings are not sensitive to moderate changes

in the values of wealth (a 20 percent increase or decrease).

        As mentioned in section 2, we have ignored the possibility that remarriage might cushion the impact

of a spouse’s death. Bernheim, et. al. [2001] report that remarriage occurs with low frequency among the

HRS sample, but it is probably more common for the younger households included in the SCF. Since it is

difficult to model the consequences of remarriage, we did not conduct pertinent sensitivity analysis.

Consequently, we cannot rule out the possibility that low levels of insurance among young households are

attributable to the expectation that a survivor will benefit financially from remarriage. However, this

hypothesis strikes us as odd. Even young individuals must consider the risk that they may be unable or

unwilling to remarry, the value of retaining the option not to remarry, and the effect of financial status on

remarriage prospects.

        Although the estimated fractions of individuals with significant and severe uninsured financial

vulnerabilities are sensitive to certain critical assumptions, it is important to emphasize that the poor

correlation between coverage and vulnerability is robust. From table 10, we see that the change in the

estimated incidence of vulnerability is largest when we assume either that there are no economies of shared

living, that housing expenditures are completely flexible, or that all survivors work full time. However, for

all of these alternative scenarios, regressions analogous to those reported in section 4 continue to indicate


                                                     27
that households with greater vulnerabilities (measured by benchmark insurance) typically have no more

coverage on average, at any age, than those with greater vulnerabilities.


6. Conclusions

        Using the 1995 Survey of Consumer Finances and an elaborate life-cycle model, we have quantified

the potential financial impact of each individual’s death on his or her survivors, and we have measured the

degree to which life insurance moderates these consequences. We have found that life insurance is

essentially uncorrelated with financial vulnerability at every stage of the life cycle. This finding is consistent

with the hypothesis that life insurance bears little relation to needs at the time of purchase; however, it tends

to refute the hypothesis that households purchase long-term contracts with initially appropriate insurance

coverage, but fail to adjust this coverage through time as their circumstances change.

        The impact of insurance among at-risk households is modest, and substantial uninsured

vulnerabilities are widespread, particularly among younger couples. Nearly two-thirds of secondary earners

between the ages of 22 and 39 have significant financial vulnerabilities (projected reductions in living

standards exceeding 20 percent), and nearly one-third have severe vulnerabilities (projected reductions

exceeding 40 percent). Moreover, only one in five of these at-risk households held sufficient life insurance

to avert significant or severe financial consequences. Combining all age groups, 56 percent of secondary

earners and 6 percent of primary earners would have experienced significant or severe declines in living

standard upon the death of a spouse in the absence of life insurance. Actual life insurance holdings reduce

these figures to, respectively, 42 percent and 5 percent. Thus, the overall impact of life insurance holdings

on financial vulnerabilities among at-risk households is modest. Roughly two-thirds of poverty among

surviving women and more than one-third of poverty among surviving men results from a failure to ensure

survivors of an undiminished living standard through insurance.

        We have also provided evidence of a significant gender bias in life insurance holdings. Specifically,



                                                       28
for any given level of financial vulnerabilities, couples provide significantly more protection for wives than

for husbands. For example, couples with severely at-risk wives on average hold $166,628 of life insurance,

while couples with severely at-risk husbands on average hold only 15 percent of this amount ($24,827).

                                                Data Imputation


Non-Asset Income. Our calculations require data on each spouse’s past and future covered earnings as well
as future total (covered and uncovered) earnings. We assume that all earnings are covered. For respondents
who were working at the survey date, we have 1995 self-reported labor earnings. In order to impute past and
future earnings we use a model that assumes that the cross section age-earnings profile for fully employed
workers remains constant through time. We allow real wages for all ages to grow over time, using the
historic Social Security real wage growth for past years, and a 1 percent overall real wage growth factor for
future years. (In our robustness analysis, was also look at a 0 percent and 2 percent overal real wage growth
factor for future years.) In estimating past earnings we assume that the first year of employment is the
maximum of 1951 and the year the person was 22.22 Households where one of the spouses was temporarily
not working, as opposed to out of the labor force, were dropped from our sample.

The SCF provides information on other kinds of non-asset income. We treat some of these income sources,
such as Veteran’s Benefits, SSI, disability income, welfare, child support, and regular help from friends or
relatives, as non-taxable. Except for Social Security disability income and child support, we assume these
income streams continue, with full adjustments for inflation, until the respondent’s death. Social Security
disability income is assumed to end at age 62, when the recipient becomes eligible for Social Security
retirement benefits. We divide child support received by the number of children to obtain child support per
child and assume it is received until the child in question reaches 18.23 We treat other kinds of special
receipts, such as income from trust funds and royalties, as taxable. We assume they will be received for ten
years beyond the survey date, and that the payments will be constant in nominal terms. Relatively few
respondents receive these kinds of income flows, and the amounts are generally small relative to average
earnings. We assume that SCF respondents retire at their stated intended ages of retirement or age 70,
whichever is smaller. For those who fail to say when they will retire, we use age 65.

Pension Plans, Retirement Accounts, and Social Security. The SCF provides information on nominal
benefits currently received from defined benefit pension plans as well as expected nominal benefits for future
pension recipients. We assume that all pensions are indexed to inflation and that a surviving spouse would
receive 100 percent of the monthly benefit or lump-sum distribution. We further assume that employer-
sponsored defined contribution plans and all private retirement accounts (IRAs and Keoghs) provide for tax-
deductible contributions and tax-deferred accumulation. Contributions in all future years up to age 59 are
set equal, in real terms, to contributions in the survey year. If total contributions are greater than the legal
limits ($30,000 or 25% of income) contributions are truncated. The proportion given by the employer
remains constant. Any contributions (by the employee or the employer) over the legal limit are included in
employee non-deductible and tax-favored contributions.

The SCF contains information on IRA account balances, but not annual contributions. We impute
contributions based on tobit regressions from the Consumer Expenditure Survey. Contributions are
calculated as a function of marital status, work status, age, earnings, and family size.



        22
             For workers who were under 22 in 1995, we assume that 1995 was their first year of employment.
        23
           The HRS reports only the sum of child support and spousal support. However, we confine our attention
to couples, 98 percent of which are married. Since spousal support generally ends upon remarriage (and also
declines somewhat on average when individuals become unmarried partners), we can safely assume that the entire
reported amount is child support.

                                                         42
If an individual is already receiving Social Security benefits, we assume that benefits have already started.
Otherwise, we impute the initial age of benefit receipt as follows. If the individual is still working, we
assume that benefits will start at his or her projected retirement age (but not earlier than age 62). If the
individual is retired, we use the reported start date for those currently receiving benefits, for those not yet
receiving benefits we assume benefits will start at age 62 for those currently under 62, and at the current age
for those over 62. In all cases, the initial age of benefit receipt is between 62 and 70. For respondents
currently receiving social security disability benefits, we assume that they switch to retirement benefits at
age 62.

Our calculations also require information on the age at which individuals begin to receive private pension
benefits. For those not yet receiving benefits, we use the age at which the individual expects benefits to
begin, as reported in the SCF.

Individuals with previous marriages lasting more than ten years and ending in divorce or separation and
individuals with previous marriages lasting more than nine months and ending in the spouse’s death are
eligible to receive Social Security benefits based on the earnings history of their prior spouse. This presents
us with a problem, since we do not have any information about prior spouses. We assume that all such
individuals receive benefits based on either their own earnings history or that of their current spouse.

Housing. Our calculations require information on a variety of specific housing expenditures, including
mortgages, home insurance premiums, property taxes, and other recurring expenses. Association fees,
homeowner or condo/coop/townhouse association fees and rent on the site for households owning and living
in mobile homes are added to home insurance premiums to form recurring house expenditures. When you
own part of a farm, you are classified as a homeowner. The rent you pay is then also added to your insurance
premium. While it does not contain information on home insurance premiums, it does include the face
amount of insurance. We imputed annual home insurance premiums by multiplying by 0.0025 home value.

If the mortgage payment (minus property taxes and insurance premium if respondent states these are included
in their payments) is negative then the observation is dropped. If the annual property tax is greater than 5%
of the home value the observation is dropped.

With regards to mortgages, the SCF reports the balance remaining, the number of years remaining, the
interest rate, and the payment. In order to ensure consistency, we imputed the balance remaining on the
mortgage based on the years remaining and the interest rate and payment.

In some instances, rental payments reported in the sample include heat and electricity expenses; in such
cases, respondents were not asked separately about these utility payments. We apportion the reported
number into separate components by assuming that the ratio of rent to utilities is the same for these
respondents as the average ratio computed from the Health and Retirement Study. If rent includes all
utilities, rent is set to 0.77*rent. If rent includes some utilities, rent is set to 0.89*rent. We have no
information on utility expenditure if it is not included in rent. The SCF does not include any information
concerning property taxes paid on second homes. We assume that this property is taxed at the same rate as
the primary home. Finally, we set monthly rental payments equal to zero for the few respondents who report
that they live in a house or apartment that they neither rent nor own.

In addition, for our base case we assume that all households plan to remain in the same house before and after
retirement. One test of robustness allows widows and widowers to move to smaller homes. For this case
we assume that the move to homes that are 70% of the size of their previous homes.

Other Variables. For confidentiality reasons, the SCF does not report the respondent’s date or month of birth
or state of residency. We assume that each respondent was born on the fifteenth of June. For the purposes

                                                      43
of computing state taxes, we use Massachusetts law. We set the maximum age of life to 95 for all
individuals. Many households have adult children living with them. For the purposes of this project, only
children 18 or under are included.

We assume for all respondents a fixed amount for funeral expenses which is set equal to the median of the
reported expenses ($5000) for HRS spouses for spouses actually died in 1991 (90 observations). The HRS
reports information on actual funeral expenses and legal fees of deceased spouses. We set intended bequests
equal to zero.

The SCF allows mortgages to end with a balloon payment. When there is a balloon payment, we assume that
they refinance for the amount of the balloon payment with a 15 year mortgage (8% interest rate). There is
no space in ESP for future mortgages so these are included in special expenditures. Interest payments on the
first home are included in deductible special expenditures. Payments on the balance are included in non-
deductible special expenditures. Non-deductible special expenditures also include child support or alimony
payment and support to other family members. These are assumed to be paid in the current year and the next
four years (a total of 5 years). Non-deductible special expenditures also include child support or alimony
payment and support to other family members. These are assumed to be paid in the current year and the next
four years (a total of 5 years).

As a measure of a household’s net worth, we use total non-housing assets minus total non-housing liabilities.
Total non-housing assets include checking and saving accounts, money market funds, CDs, government
saving bonds, T-bills, stocks, mutual funds, investment trusts, business equity, bonds, bond funds, real estate
other than primary and vacation homes, the cash value of life insurance policies, and some miscellaneous
items. Total non-housing liabilities include personal loans, student loans, credit card balances, car loans,
installment loans, and other non housing debt. Housing debt (mortgages and equity lines of credit) are
considered separately (see above). We assume that, apart from mortgages and other outstanding housing
debt, households cannot borrow against future income. For our base case, we use a 3 percent rate of inflation
and a 3 percent real pre-tax rate of return.

Credit Constraints. We assume respondents’ borrowing limit is set equal to zero

Expected change in living standard. The expected change in living standard after retirement or in case of
death of one partner is set equal to zero.
