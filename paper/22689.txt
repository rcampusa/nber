                                           ABSTRACT

We present evidence that pressure to maximize short-term stock prices and earnings leads banks
to increase risk. We start by showing that banks increase risk when they transition from private to
public ownership through a public listing or an acquisition. The increase in risk is greater than for
a control group of banks that intended but failed to transition from private to public ownership, a
result that is robust to using a plausibly exogenous instrument for failed transitions. The increase
in risk is also greater than for a control group of banks that were acquired but did not change their
listing status. We establish that pressure to maximize short-term stock prices helps to explain
these findings by showing that the increase in risk is larger for newly public banks that are more
focused on short-term stock prices and performance.

1. Introduction
          It is now well understood that risk taking by financial institutions is one of the main

causes of financial crises and severe recessions (Jorda, Schularick and Taylor, 2013). Yet, we

know relatively little about what gives rise to such risk-taking in the first place. Some have tied

the problem to management compensation, which is often structured so that managers benefit

from good performance but bear only a small share of the costs of bad performance (Bolton,

Mehran and Shapiro, 2010; and Bebchuk, Cohen and Spamann, 2010). Others have argued that

explicit or implicit government guarantees of bank debt enable banks to take risks without

bearing their full social costs (Kane, 1985; Pennacchi, 1987; and Farhi and Tirole, 2012). Yet

others have suggested that behavioral biases lead financial firms to neglect the risk of adverse

tail outcomes (Gennaioli, Shleifer and Vishny, 2012).


       In this paper, we put forth and empirically examine another explanation – namely that a

focus on short-term stock prices rather than long-run value induces financial institutions to

increase the risk they take. This view is motivated in part by the observation that the growth of

the U.S. banking sector over the past 25 or so years was concentrated among publicly-traded

banks, as can be seen in Figure 1.


       Our explanation is based on the "short-termism" model of Stein (1989), which shows that

when firms place weight on short-term stock prices they have incentives to take difficult-to-

observe actions that boost current earnings at the expense of long-run profitability. Stock market

investors rationally attribute higher current earnings in part to better long-run fundamentals and

value, which in turn, creates incentives for firms to pump up short-term earnings. This type of

reasoning has often been used to argue that the stock market induces firms to take less risk

because long-term risky projects like R&D lower short-run profitability. But in banking, the

                                                 	  
	  
	  


easiest way to increase short-run profitability is to take more risk. For example, banks can loosen

lending standards, leading them to make more loans with higher yields but also higher default

rates. And they can use more short-term funding, thereby lowering current funding costs but

increasing rollover and run risk.


        To examine the effect of the stock market on bank risk-taking we estimate the change in a

bank’s risk when it transitions from private ownership to public stock market ownership. These

transitions occur either when a privately held bank goes public through an initial public offering

(IPO) or when it is acquired by a publicly-traded bank holding company (BHC). We are able to

track a bank following its acquisition because acquired banks often remain legally distinct

companies that still must submit their own regulatory filings and undergo their own supervisory

reviews.


        We start by presenting evidence that after banks make this transition they experience a

decline in their confidential safety and soundness ratings as assessed by bank supervisors. The

supervisory ratings include the six so-called "component" ratings (Capital Adequacy, Asset

Quality, Management, Earnings, Liquidity, and Sensitivity to Market Risk), a "composite"

CAMELS rating based on the component ratings, and a loan-level risk rating from the Federal

Reserve's Survey of Terms of Business Lending (STBL). In addition, we document that after a

transition to public ownership there is an increase in risk as measured by a decline in capital

ratios, a shift to riskier activities, and a greater reliance on short-term funding, among other

measures of risk.


        While this evidence is consistent with stock market pressure leading to an increase in

risk, it is difficult to interpret this empirical relationship as being causal; the factors that give rise



                                                    2
                                                                                                             	  
	  


to the IPO or acquisition in the first instance could be correlated with a change in the

environment that increases risk or the incentive to take risk. For example, an IPO might come in

response to growth opportunities associated with population and business expansions that

increase the demand for residential and commercial mortgages. But these growth opportunities

could also be associated with a riskier economic environment.


       To address this identification challenge, we use a difference-in-differences (DD)

approach that compares the change in risk of banks that switch ownership status (the treatment

group) to a set of banks that intended to go public or be acquired but did not because their deals

were cancelled (the control group). The idea here – following Seru (2014) and Bernstein (2014)

in their work on innovation – is to compare the change in risk of banks in the treatment group to

a set of banks in the control group whose decisions were likely driven by the same factors. For

example, if the intention to go public is correlated with an expansion of growth opportunities and

increase in risk, then the comparison with banks that intended to go public but did not end up

doing so should alleviate the concern that the treatment group is facing a substantially different

environment than the control group. Using this estimation strategy, we find a significant

deterioration in the CAMELS, loan risk ratings, and financial risk measures of treated banks

relative to the control group of banks with cancelled IPOs or acquisitions. Moreover, there are no

significant differences in pre-treatment trends in CAMELS ratings and treated and control banks

appear to be well-balanced along key pre-treatment covariates that may affect risk. Finally, the

subsequent performance of treated banks is consistent with an increase in risk-taking: their return

on equity initially rises relative to control banks, but then falls, and treated banks also perform

worse during the financial crisis of 2007-2009.




                                                  3
                                                                                                  	  
	  


       While this approach goes some distance in dealing with endogeneity concerns, it is

possible that deal cancellations are correlated with factors related to bank risk. Therefore, we

follow Bernstein (2014) by instrumenting for deal completion with an index of stock returns in

the two months after the deal is announced. Deals are more likely to be cancelled when banking

industry stock returns are low in this two-month window. Under the assumption that banking

industry stock returns over this short window are uncorrelated with longer-term, bank-specific

risk-taking incentives, the predicted value of this first-stage regression should be purged of the

component of deal failure that could be correlated with risk-taking incentives. Indeed, we find

that the results are robust to this instrumental variables approach.


       To examine the causal interpretation further, we also use a different control group for the

treated banks, comprised of successful mergers in which there was no change in public/private

status. In particular, we find that when a private bank is acquired by another private bank or

when a public bank is acquired by another public bank there is no deterioration in CAMELS or

loan risk ratings, nor is there an increase in financial risk measures. Risk only increases when a

private bank is acquired by a public bank.


       While the results described above suggest that the transition from private to public

ownership causes an increase in risk, there are a number of possible explanations of this

behavior. One such explanation, based on the rational short-termism model of Stein (1989), was

suggested above: banks increase risk to pump up short-term earnings and thereby increase

market perceptions of their long-run value. A related explanation has a more behavioral twist:

the stock market may over-extrapolate higher earnings into the future, underweighting the role

that risk plays in raising short-term earnings as well as the mean reversion in earnings that could

follow. Such an interpretation would be consistent with the evidence in La Porta (1996) and

                                                  4
                                                                                                  	  
	  


other studies documenting that stock analysts tend to place too much weight on past earnings

growth in forecasting future earnings growth. In this case, banks would also have an incentive to

increase risk as a way of increasing short-term earnings and thus the short-term stock price.


       An even simpler explanation is that banks increase risk not because they want to increase

short-term stock prices but because the transition to public ownership shifts ownership from

undiversified owner-managers to a broad base of diversified shareholders who can bear more

risk. It is also possible that banks increase risk because public ownership makes it easier for them

to raise additional equity capital, allowing them to more easily weather adverse shocks

associated with greater risk-taking.


       While we cannot rule out the possibility that greater shareholder diversification and

reduced costs of equity financing may help to explain our baseline findings, we present evidence

that the effects we have identified are stronger among banks that are likely to be more concerned

with short-term stock prices. This finer cross-sectional evidence is broadly supportive of a short-

termism interpretation, whether the rational limited-information version or the more behavioral

perspective discussed above.


       To establish the relevance of short-termism, we show first that our risk measures increase

more if the bank has a smaller board, fewer insider board members, and better governance

according to the measure developed by Gompers, Ishii and Metrick (2003). Thus, the more banks

are focused on the stock price, the more risk they take. Second, we find a greater increase in risk

for banks owned by institutional investors that turn over their shares more rapidly and by CEOs

that trade more actively in the bank’s stock. These findings are consistent with the implication

that banks that are more focused on short-term stock prices should increase risk more. Third, we



                                                 5
                                                                                                   	  
	  


document that the increase in risk is larger for banks that mention the phrase “short-term” more

frequently in their quarterly earnings calls, behavior that has elsewhere been shown to be

associated with a focus on short-term earnings management (Brochet, Loumioti, and Serafeim,

2015). Finally, we show that the increase in risk is greater at times when there is more downward

pressure on earnings – during periods of low interest rates and low credit spreads.


       The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data and

presents the basic finding that banks increase risk when they go public or are acquired by a

publicly traded BHC. Section 3 then attempts to establish that this is a causal relationship

through our DD approach. Section 4 introduces cross-sectional evidence in an attempt to better

understand the mechanism underlying our findings. Section 5 concludes.




2. Data and Descriptive Evidence
       To construct the sample, we start with the universe of U.S. commercial banks that are

held by a bank holding company (BHC) and have non-missing information on total assets as

reported to regulators in the Reports of Condition and Income (“Call Reports”) between 1990

and 2012. This yields a starting panel of 220,194 commercial bank-quarter observations for

8,314 (3,511) unique commercial banks (BHCs).



2.1. Information on Bank Risk-Taking
       Our first main type of risk measure is based on confidential supervisory information from

the National Information Center (NIC) of the Federal Reserve System. The NIC dataset covers

all on-site examinations of safety and soundness conducted by banking regulators, whose main

outcome is six "component" ratings – Capital Adequacy, Asset Quality, Management, Earnings,


                                                 6
                                                                                                   	  
	  


Liquidity, and Sensitivity to Market Risk – and an overall "composite" CAMELS rating. Each of

these ratings ranges between a value of 1 and 5, with the risk profile and risk-management

practices of banks rated 1 or 2 considered "strong" and those rated 3, 4, or 5 considered "weak."

An advantage of having individual component ratings is that we can measure bank risk-taking

along several dimensions. In addition, the supervisory ratings also capture an ex-ante aspect of

bank risk-taking in that they account for not only the current risk profile of the bank, but also the

ability of management to identify, measure, monitor and control the six types of risks that are

rated.

                         We complement these data with confidential information on loan-level risk from the

Federal Reserve's Survey of Terms of Business Lending (STBL), which is available for the 1997

to 2012 period.1 (See Berger, Kashyap, and Scalise (1995) for an early study that uses STBL.)

The survey asks participating banks about the terms of all commercial and industrial loans issued

during the first full business week of the middle month in every quarter. Banks report the risk

rating of each loan by mapping their internal loan risk ratings to a scale defined by the Federal

Reserve. Loan risk ratings vary from 1 to 5, with 5 representing the highest risk.

                   In addition to supervisory risk data, we use Call Reports to construct a set of risk

measures based on the level of bank capital, the composition of asset portfolios, the maturity

structure of bank liabilities, and the sources of bank income. The definitions of the variables used

in the analysis are in the Appendix.

          The STBL is a quarterly survey on the terms of business lending of a stratified sample of about 400
banks conducted by the U.S. Federal Reserve, which typically covers a very large share of assets in the
U.S. banking sector. For example, the combined assets of the banks responding to the survey for the
fourth quarter of 2011 represented about 60 percent of all assets of U.S. commercial banks.


                                                                                                                           7
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    	  
	  


2.2. Information on Private-to-Public Transitions
       To construct our sample of private-to-public transitions, we use the NIC data and several

other standard sources of historical information on BHC stock listing status. From the NIC data,

we retrieve the full history of top-tier bank holding companies of each commercial bank. We

determine whether a BHC is publicly traded using historical stock market listing information

from the New York Fed CRSP-FRB link database, as well as data on all IPO filings of financial

firms (SIC codes between 6000 and 6999) from Thomson Financial’s SDC New Issues database,

Capital IQ Key Developments database, and SNL Financial Capital Offerings database. This

process leads to a final merged BHC-commercial bank sample running from 1990-2012 of

178,980 commercial bank-quarter observations for 7,166 (3,251) unique commercial banks

(BHCs) whose historical stock listing status we are able to confirm.

       The sample of private-to-public transitions used in the analysis – which we refer to as the

“Switchers” sub-sample – is comprised of all commercial banks that are in the final merged

BHC-commercial bank sample and experience a private-to-public transition sometime during the

1990-2012 period. Private-to-public transitions occur in one of two ways: either a privately-held

bank completes an initial public offering (IPO) or a privately held bank is acquired by a publicly-

traded bank holding company (BHC). To identify the transitions due to IPOs, we find all the

completed IPOs from the three sources detailed above. We identify transitions due to

acquisitions using the Merger Table from the NIC data, which keeps a full historical record of

dates and identities of target and acquirer banks. We are able to track the ratings of a commercial

bank after it has been acquired because acquired banks often remain legally distinct companies

that must still submit their own regulatory filings and thus retain their identifiers. The Switchers

sub-sample consists of 1,294 (758) commercial banks (BHCs) that underwent a private-to-public

transition sometime during the 1990-2012 period, yielding 26,776 commercial bank-quarter

                                                 8
                                                                                                      	  
	  


observations. Of these transitions, 406 (206) are commercial banks (BHCs) that completed an

IPO, resulting in 15,411 commercial bank-quarter observations. This sample excludes

acquisitions of failed banks that were under FDIC receivership or had a CAMELS rating of 5 at

the time of the acquisition.

       Finally, we also construct a sub-sample of private-to-public transitions that were

attempted but failed either because the IPO filing was withdrawn or the acquisition was not

completed. This sub-sample serves as the control group in our baseline identification strategy.

After submitting an initial registration statement to the SEC (usually Form S-1) to announce their

intention to go public, filers have the option to withdraw the IPO filing by submitting the SEC’s

Form RW during the IPO marketing period (the “book-building" phase). Potential acquirers also

typically announce their intention to bid for a target, which can be followed by an announcement

to withdraw the bid. To identify withdrawn IPOs, we flag the filings that are classified as

withdrawn from the lists of all IPO filings contained in the three sources detailed above. To

identify withdrawn acquisitions, we use all acquisitions filings of financial firms that are

classified as not completed from other data sources, which include Thomson-Financial’s SDC

M&A database, Capital IQ Key Developments database, and SNL Financial Mergers and

Acquisitions database. Filing withdrawals are common both in IPO and M&A markets, as

approximately 15 percent of all IPO and M&A announcements of financial firms are ultimately

not completed. This figure is in line with the 20 percent IPO withdrawal rate reported by

Bernstein (2014) in his study of R&D-intensive firms. The control group consists of 227 (176)

commercial banks (BHCs) that either withdrew their IPO application or were the target of a

withdrawn private-to-public acquisition attempt, yielding 4,793 commercial bank-quarter

observations.



                                                9
                                                                                                 	  
	  


2.3. Descriptive Statistics and Suggestive Evidence
       Table 1 presents summary statistics of our main sample. Banks in the Switchers sub-

sample tend to be smaller and have somewhat riskier supervisory ratings relative to other banks

in the full sample. In Table 2, we provide evidence of a statistical relationship between

ownership status of the BHC (public or private) and the supervisory risk variables, as well as the

risk measures based on Call Report data. Specifically, in Panels A and B we report results of

pooled (Panel A) and firm fixed effects (Panels B) regressions, with each of the eight supervisory

ratings as the dependent variable in the ten-year period (1997-2006) leading up to the financial

crisis of 2007-2009. We also report results for two alternative scores that are constructed by

aggregating across the ratings – the Overall Quality Score (Column 9), which is measured as the

riskiest of the individual ratings, and the Bad Rating Dummy (Column 10), which takes the value

one if the bank is rated weak (3 or higher) in any of the individual ratings. The explanatory

variables are a dummy variable that equals one for commercial banks that are held by a publicly-

traded BHC, bank size (total assets of the commercial bank), and year-quarter fixed effects. We

also include a fixed effect for the regulatory agency that performs the supervisory assessments

since this agency may change after a bank transitions to public ownership, as discussed in greater

detail in Section 3.5 below.

       Across the full set of ratings, the coefficient of the publicly-traded BHC variable is

positive and strongly statistically significant, indicating that publicly-traded banks score

consistently worse across all supervisory ratings. In Panel C, we report the results of the same

fixed-effect regressions except that the dependent variables in these regressions are risk measures

based on Call Report data. These regressions all indicate an increase in risk after a bank

transitions to publicly-traded status. For example, the first column shows that the Tier 1 capital

declines after the transition and the second column shows that risk-weighted assets increase.

                                                10
                                                                                                     	  
	  


Other variables measuring risk on the asset and liabilities side of the balance sheet all show an

increase in risk. The last column in Panel C reports the results of a regression in which the

dependent variable is “Risk Factor,” which is a linear combination of the risk measures based on

Call Report data, with weights calculated using principal component analysis. This regression

shows an increase in Risk Factor after a bank transitions to publicly-traded status.

                  These findings differ from a number of cross-sectional studies (Kwan, 2004 and Nichols,

Wahlen and Wieland, 2009), which do not find statistically significant differences in risk across

ownership status, especially after controlling for size. These studies may not find an effect

because they use proxies for risk that are based on measures of ex-post operating performance,

such as non-performing loans or volatility of operating performance. This approach has limited

power in normal times as we discuss in greater detail below and demonstrate in Table 10.2 By

focusing on ex ante measures of risk and on changes in ownership status, we are able to

document a difference in risk in normal times.




3. Identifying the Effect of the Stock Market on Bank Risk-Taking
                  One concern with the descriptive evidence in Table 2 is that the private-to-public

transition could be endogenous and correlated with bank risk. For example, an IPO might come

in response to growth opportunities such as population and business expansions that increase the

      	  Other papers have shown that banks increase risk when they convert from a mutual form of organization
to stock ownership (Esty, 1997; Schrand and Unal, 1998). These papers interpret the finding as evidence
that shareholders have incentives to increase risk when they get all of the benefits on the upside but bear
only a part of the losses on the downside. Since the conversion is often also associated with an initial
public offering of stock, it is possible that the stock market pressure hypothesis we have advanced here
might also be part of the explanation.

	  


                                                                                                                      11
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    	  
	  


demand for residential and commercial mortgages. If these same growth opportunities also

increase bank risk, then the estimates would not have a causal interpretation.


3.1. Empirical Framework
           To address this identification challenge, we use a difference-in-differences (DD)

approach that compares the change in risk of banks that switch ownership status (the treatment

group) to the change in risk of a set of banks that intended to go public or be acquired but whose

deals were cancelled (the control group). The idea here – following Seru (2014) and Bernstein

(2014) in their work on innovation – is that we are comparing the change in risk of banks in the

treatment group to a set of banks whose private-to-public transition decisions were plausibly

driven by the same factors. For example, the intention to go public could be correlated with an

increase in the demand for residential and commercial mortgages if banks seek capital to fund

these mortgages. However, the increased demand for credit could, in principle, be associated

with an increase in the risk of the bank’s existing portfolio. Comparing within-bank changes in

risk of treated banks to those of relatively similar banks in the control group should help to

alleviate selection concerns such as these. Of course, it is important that the reason that the deal

is withdrawn is not correlated with a change in the bank’s risk environment, an issue we take up

in Section 3.4 below.


           More formally, to examine the effect of private-to-public transitions on bank risk-taking,

we use the following baseline DD regression specification:


                             𝑅𝐼𝑆𝐾!" = 𝛼 + 𝛽! ×𝐴𝑓𝑡𝑒𝑟!" + 𝛽! ×𝐴𝑓𝑡𝑒𝑟!" ×𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡! + 𝛾×𝑍!" + 𝜇! + 𝜇! + 𝜀!"                         (1)


where i and t index commercial banks and year-quarters. RISK is measured by the variety of

supervisory ratings and financial information. After is an indicator variable that takes a value of


                                                                   12
                                                                                                                                      	  
	  


one for all the bank-quarters after the announcement date and zero otherwise, and Treatment is

an indicator variable that takes a value of one for commercial banks in the treatment group and

zero for those in the control group. Zit controls for bank-level covariates of risk and, in the

baseline specification, is measured as bank size (total assets), while 𝜇! and 𝜇! are year-quarter

dummies and commercial bank fixed effects, respectively. The inclusion of bank size, as well as

bank and time fixed effects means that our estimates compare the (within-bank) response of risk

measures for treated banks to that of similarly-sized control banks in the same year-quarter. We

evaluate statistical significance using robust clustered standard errors adjusted for non-

independence of observations within BHCs.3 In order to better focus on the build-up of risk pre-

crisis, in all our baseline tests we examine a ten-year window running up to the crisis (1997-

2006). The focus on the pre-crisis period helps to ease the potential concern that changes in

supervisory standards after the crisis may be driving our results. The null hypothesis is that the

coefficient of interest, 𝛽! , which captures the effect of changes in stock listing status on bank

risk, is equal to zero.


                        Before reporting our baseline findings for the DD estimation, we present comparisons of

the treatment and control groups prior to the intended private-to-public transitions. Table 3,

Panel A shows that the only difference between treatment and control groups is size, with banks

in the treatment group larger than those in the control group (a log difference of 31.5%). But

other balance sheet ratios including the Tier 1 capital ratio, deposits to assets, and loans to assets

are essentially the same across the two groups. Importantly, there is no difference in the average

CAMELS ratings and the year-to-year change in CAMELS ratings in the pre-transition period.

          We verify that the results are robust to clustering at the commercial bank level.


                                                                                                                                                            13
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    	  
	  


setting. We report estimates from linear-probability regression analysis of the likelihood that an

IPO or private-to-public M&A deal is successfully completed for three different specifications:

one that includes the full set of baseline controls in the year prior to the announcement (Column

1); one that adds the composite CAMELS rating in the year prior to the announcement (Column

2); and one that also adds the annual change of the composite CAMELS ratings in each of the

two years prior to the treatment (Column 3). Pre-announcement balance sheet variables,

CAMELS ratings and changes in CAMELS rating are not statistically significant in these

regressions.


3.2. Baseline DD Estimates
        Table 4 reports results from estimating our baseline DD regression (1) for each of the

supervisory risk ratings (Panel A) and for the risk measures based on financial information

(Panel B). For each of the supervisory risk rating measures in Panel A, the estimates indicate that

after a private-to-public transition there is a deterioration in a bank’s supervisory ratings relative

to a similarly-sized bank that attempts but does not complete a transition.


        The results in Panel B indicate that the transition to public ownership leads to riskier

bank behavior across numerous financial measures. Among other things, banks reduce their Tier

1 capital ratio, shorten the maturity of their liabilities, and increase reliance on more volatile

sources of funding. Furthermore, Panel B indicates that banks grow their risk-weighted assets

after they transition to public ownership. The fact that they do not also grow their total assets

(see Appendix Table A.1), suggests that they move their portfolios into riskier asset classes after

the transition.


        There are a few ways to help gauge the economic significance of our estimates. Our first

approach is to examine how a private-to-public transition moves a bank in the empirical

                                                  14
                                                                                                     	  
	  


distribution of the CAMELS rating. Since our DD specification includes bank fixed effects, we

use the within-bank distribution (i.e., the distribution after removing bank fixed effects) as the

benchmark. The estimated 0.224 increase in CAMELS following a transition is a sizable effect

that corresponds to a full quartile of the conditional distribution of the rating. A second approach

is to compare the effect of a private-to-public transition to that of bank size. We calculate these

marginal effects by multiplying the respective estimates by the within-firm standard deviation of

bank size. The marginal impact of a private-to-public transition is substantially larger than the

effect of a large, two-standard deviation change in the effect of bank size (0.013*1.88=0.024) on

the composite CAMELS rating.


       While the effect is somewhat stronger for the composite CAMELS and the STBL loan

risk ratings, the effects are still sizable across component ratings, including the management,

asset, capital, and earnings quality categories. Depending on the rating, the magnitude of the

implied effect of a private-to-public transition ranges between about 1/3 and 1/2 of a one

standard deviation movement in the within-bank distribution. These effects are similar in size to

the effect of the Bad Rating Dummy, which takes the value one if any of the component ratings

are weak (3 or higher). Thus, the effect of transitioning to public status is not just that it moves

banks from being very safe (rating of 1) to somewhat less safe (rating of 2), but it meaningfully

increases the likelihood that the bank has a weak component rating.


       Furthermore, the estimates for the financial risk measures are roughly comparable in

magnitude to those for the supervisory ratings. For example, the estimated 0.096 increase in the

Risk Factor following a transition (Column 10 of Panel B) also corresponds to about a full

quartile move in the conditional distribution of the factor. The marginal impact of a private-to-



                                                 15
                                                                                                   	  
	  


public transition on the Risk Factor is also much larger than the effect of a large, two-standard

deviation change in the effect of bank size (0.019*1.88=0.036).


                                 Our baseline estimates for the supervisory ratings are little changed if we match to the

control group of banks based on the time at which the transition announcement occurs and on

(pre-treatment) size. (See Appendix Table A.2.) This matched-sample DD approach (Heckman,

Ichimura, and Todd, 1997) addresses the potential concern that our linear controls for size in the

DD analysis may not fully capture non-linear relationships between size and the outcomes of

interest.4


                                 Figure 2, Panel A shows results of a graphical analysis in which we plot a dummy for bad

composite CAMELS (3 or higher) in event time leading up to and after the year when a bank

announces a private-to-public transition. In line with our baseline estimates, there is a sharp

increase in the likelihood that a treated bank receives a bad CAMELS rating beginning right after

the announcement (t=+1), but there is no change for banks in the control group. The likelihood

that a treated bank receives a bad CAMELS ratings continues to increase in the subsequent years

(t = +2 to t=+4). In line with the evidence presented in Table 2, there are no meaningful trends in

this variable in years prior to announcement (t=-1 to t=-5) and little difference in the levels for

the treated and control banks during the pre-treatment period. Panel B of Figure 2 shows a

similar pattern for the Risk Factor: no pre-treatment trends or differences in the likelihood of a

high value of the Risk Factor for treated and control banks before a transition, and an increase in

this likelihood of a transition only for the treated banks.

3.3. Robustness to Using an Alternative Control Group
       Next, we estimate specification (1) using an alternative control group of mergers that are

successful but do not lead to a change in public/private status because they involve either a

private bank that is acquired by another private bank or a public bank that is acquired by another

public bank. Since this control group is comprised only of M&A deals, we limit the treatment

group to acquisitions of a private bank by a public bank, thereby excluding IPOs. Bloom, Sadun,

and Van Reenen (2012) use a similar approach to estimate the productivity effect of transferring

ownership to a U.S. multinational. In using this control group, we are making the identifying

assumption that while an acquisition could select for banks facing an increase in the risk

environment, this increase does not depend on the type of ownership change (i.e., private to

public, private to private, public to public). The resulting sample consists of up to 14,479

commercial bank-quarter observations involving 464 unique BHCs and 788 unique commercial

banks in the run-up to the crisis period between 1997 and 2006.


       As in our baseline DD estimation, we check to see whether there are any significant

differences in the treatment and control groups before the acquisition. Table 5, Panel A shows

that the only statistically significant difference in balance sheet variables between the two groups

is size, with the treatment group being somewhat smaller (a log difference of about 19%).

Moreover, CAMELS and the change in the CAMELS pre-acquisition are the same across the

two groups. The similarity of the two groups is also evident in Panel B, which reports estimates

of a linear-probability regression analysis of the likelihood that a bank becomes the target of a

private-to-public acquisition bid as compared to other types of acquisitions. We examine three

different specifications: one that includes the full set of prior-year baseline controls (Column 1);

one that adds the year-prior composite CAMELS rating (Column 2); and one that also adds the


                                                 17
                                                                                                     	  
	  


changes in the composite CAMELS rating in each of the two years prior to the acquisition

(Column 3). There are no statistically significant coefficients, indicating that there are no balance

sheet differences across the two groups, nor are there differences in pre-acquisition CAMELS

and trends in CAMELS.


       DD estimates using this alternative control group are reported in Table 6. Panel A shows

results for each of the supervisory ratings and Panel B shows results for the financial measures of

risk. In line with our baseline results, the estimates indicate that there is a deterioration in

CAMELS and loan risk ratings, as well as an increase in financial risk measures when private

banks are acquired by public banks, but not for other acquisitions where public/private status is

unchanged. For example, the estimates in Column 7, Panel A show that there is an increase in the

composite CAMELS rating of 0.095, which is smaller than the baseline estimate of 0.224 and

corresponds to about a one third standard deviation move in the (within-bank) distribution of the

combined CAMELS rating. Overall, our DD estimates are stable across different control groups,

suggesting that our findings are not simply an artifact of a particular choice of control group.


3.4. Robustness to Using a 2SLS-IV Estimator
       We now address the potential concern that deal cancellations (used in our baseline DD

estimation) could be correlated with factors related to bank risk, thus leading to a selection bias

in the estimates. We follow the approach of Bernstein (2014), which instruments for deal

completion with an index of stock returns in the two months after the deal is announced. Under

the assumption that stock returns over this short window are uncorrelated with longer-term risk-

taking incentives, the predicted value of this first-stage regression should be purged of the

component of deal failure that could be correlated with changes in the risk environment.


       Specifically, we estimate the following 2SLS-IV specification:

                                                 18
                                                                                                    	  
	  


                  𝑅𝐼𝑆𝐾!!"#$ = 𝛼 + 𝛽! 𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑑  𝐷𝑒𝑎𝑙! + 𝛾! 𝑅𝐼𝑆𝐾!!"# + 𝛾! 𝑍! + 𝜇! + 𝜀!                                               (2)

where RISKiPost is the average bank risk proxy in the quarters after the announcement date,

RISKiPre is the corresponding average in the quarters prior to the announcement, and

𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑑  𝐷𝑒𝑎𝑙 is a predicted probability that a private-to-public transaction occurs. This

predicted probability is estimated from the (first-stage) regression,

               𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑑  𝐷𝑒𝑎𝑙! = 𝛼! + 𝛽! 𝑆&𝑃𝐵𝑎𝑛𝑘  𝑅𝑒𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛𝑠! + 𝛾! 𝑍! + 𝜇! + 𝜀!                                                                   (3)

where we are using the S&P Bank Index returns in the two months following each

announcement as the instrument.

                  Table 7 shows that the instrument has predictive power in the first stage and does not

appear to be selecting on observables. As shown in Table 7, deals announced when the bank

stock index performs poorly are less likely to be completed. This is evident in Panel A, where we

show that deals are less likely to be completed when index returns are in the bottom quartile

rather than the top quartile. It is also evident in Panel B, where we report various versions of the

first stage of our 2SLS-IV analysis. Panel A also shows that other bank characteristics appear to

be unrelated to index stock returns, so there is no indication that our instrument is selecting on

observables.

                   Table 8 reports the 2SLS-IV estimates for each of the supervisory ratings (Panel A), and

each of the financial risk measures (Panel B). After instrumenting with stock returns, transitions

to public listing status continue to be associated with a significant deterioration in banks'

supervisory ratings and to a significant increase in financial risk measures.5 The estimated stock

market impact remains sizable across all supervisory ratings and all financial risk measures.

          For example, the estimates in Column 7, Panel A show that there is an increase in the composite
CAMELS rating of 0.303, which is economically significant and somewhat larger than our baseline DD
estimates in Table 4.


                                                                                                                         19
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    	  
	  


       It is reassuring about the validity of the instrument that if we measure the instrument over

different time windows (after the transition, a year before the announcement, or a year after the

announcement) it does not predict the composite CAMELS ratings in the years after the

announcement. Since bank index stock returns over these different time windows do not affect

the likelihood that the transition occurs, the evidence from this placebo test corroborates the

exclusion restriction that the instrument affects bank risk only through its impact on the outcome

of the ownership transitions. (See Appendix Table A.3.)


3.5 Addressing Other Endogeneity Issues: Attrition and Supervision
       Another issue we need to address is whether our results are in some way biased by the

fact that we can only track a bank’s risk after an acquisition (but not an IPO) if it remains a

separate subsidiary of the acquiring BHC. About 2/3 of acquired banks are not merged into

another bank subsidiary of the acquiring BHC at the time (within one quarter) of acquisition and

by two (three) years after the acquisition, 50% (47%) of the acquired banks are not merged into a

subsidiary of the acquiring BHC. A potential selection concern with our findings is that an

acquiring BHC only chooses to merge an acquired bank into one of its subsidiaries if the risk of

the acquired bank did not increase after the acquisition, leaving us with observations only on the

banks that increased risk.


       We think that this selection concern is unlikely to explain our findings for three reasons.

First, there are no observable differences in the banks that are absorbed into a subsidiary bank

and those that are not, including the risk level of the bank prior to the acquisition. (See Appendix

Table A.4.) Second, as we showed in Section 3.3 above, the results are robust to using as a

control group mergers where public-private status did not change. In order for attrition to explain

our results, it would have to be the case that public BHC acquirers of private banks have a

greater propensity to merge risky targets into their subsidiaries than do private BHC acquirers or

public BHC acquirers of other public BHCs. Finally, the results are robust to excluding all

mergers and focusing only on IPOs. (See Appendix Table A.5.) In this case, we can track the

bank without concern that there are post-treatment endogenous mergers.


       Another concern is that switching to public status could change the bank’s supervisor

from one regulator to another. If the supervisors that tend to regulate public BHCs are more

rigorous in their assessments, then we would be more likely to see an increase in risk even if the

bank’s behavior does not change. We first note, however, that this would not explain the increase

in risk measured from Call Reports. In fact, one would expect that if the new supervisors were

more rigorous in their assessments – or if continuing supervisors became more rigorous – then

these financial risk measures would decline. But we see these risk measures actually increase.

More directly, there is no evidence that a transition to public status triggers a change of the

regulator that supervises the bank (Appendix Table A.6, Panel A). Even then, if there are new

supervisors, we note that we have controlled for the effects of new supervisors by including fixed

effects for the regulatory agency that provides the supervisory assessments in all the

specifications that involve the CAMELS ratings.


3.6. Evidence on Bank Performance
       If, as we show, treatment banks take greater risk once they transition to public ownership,

their performance should initially improve, but they should experience an increased likelihood of

poor subsequent performance. Table 9 tracks the change in the quarterly return on equity (ROE)

and quarterly return on assets (ROA) in the quarters after the transition relative to the quarter

prior to the transition. These changes for the transitioning banks net out the changes in quarterly

ROE and ROA of control banks that announced a transition that was later not completed. Note

                                                21
                                                                                                     	  
	  


that the annual ROE – the typical ROE number that is calculated for banks – would be roughly

four times the numbers reported in the table.


                   Table 9 shows that by six quarters after the transition, quarterly ROE is 90 basis points

higher than it was prior to the transition for the treated banks relative to the control banks, but by

three years after the transition quarterly ROE is 60 basis points below the pre-transition level,

and by four years it is 110 basis points below the pre-transition level. Given a mean quarterly

ROE of 2.9% and a cross-sectional standard deviation of 2.8%, these are sizable effects; the

initial boost in performance is about one-third of a standard deviation and the decline in

performance four years out is close to 40% of a standard deviation. A similar pattern exists for

quarterly ROA.


                   Another implication of our findings is that if treatment banks take greater risk in the ten

years prior to the financial crisis they should perform more poorly during the crisis across a

variety of measures including ROE and ROA, and they should have more non-performing loans

and greater loan loss provisions during the crisis. To examine this prediction, we conduct a DD

analysis with these and other measures of bank operating performance as the dependent variable

and with cancelled deals as the control group. We add to our baseline specification an interaction

of the crisis dummy with the treatment effect (i.e., Treatment x After x Crisis), which allows us

to test whether there was greater underperformance of the treated banks relative to control banks

during the crisis.6 The results are reported in Panel A of Table 10.

          Note that we are excluding Crisis and the interactions Treatment x Crisis and After x Crisis. Crisis is
excluded because it is collinear with the time dummies. After x Crisis is excluded because it is collinear
with Crisis given that After is always one when Crisis is one (as we are excluding the small number of
transitions that occur during the crisis to alleviate concerns about mechanical correlation between
transitions and performance in the crisis). This implies that Treatment x Crisis is also collinear with
Treatment x After x Crisis.


                                                                                                                         22
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    	  
	  


Panel B reports results without the interaction term. The estimates indicate that newly listed and

acquired treatment banks significantly underperformed during the crisis, a result that holds along

all the measures of performance considered. There is no evidence that banks that transition to

public share ownership underperform in normal times.




4. Cross-Sectional and Time-Series Evidence
       We have interpreted the results as evidence that banks try to pump up short-term earnings

to influence market perceptions of their long-run value as would be implied by the short-termism

model of Stein (1989) or a related behavioral story in which investors over-extrapolate earnings

growth. However, there are other potential explanations of our findings. One simple explanation

is that after banks transition to public ownership their shares are held by more diversified

investors who are in a better position to bear risk. Another possibility is that publicly-traded

banks can raise capital more easily and more cheaply than privately-owned banks after an

adverse shock. In this view, the lower costs of external finance for publicly-traded banks makes

them more willing to take risk.


       We cannot rule out these explanations, but we can explore whether there is evidence that

is consistent with our short-termism interpretation. Thus, we explore whether the risk-taking

effects that we have identified are stronger among banks that are likely to be more focused on the

short-term stock price.


       To examine the finer implications of the short-termism story, we start by adding to the

baseline DD specification (1) an interaction term of the treatment effect with standard measures

of corporate governance, which include board size, the percentage of insider board members, and

the number of anti-takeover provisions based on the index developed by Gompers, Ishii and

                                                23
                                                                                                     	  
	  


Metrick (2003), which we refer to as GIM. These variables arguably all measure the extent to

which the firm is insulated from takeovers, thereby reducing the extent to which they care about

the short-run stock price. We expect that banks that score worse on these governance measures

(larger board size, more insiders on the board, and more anti-takeover provisions) would take

less risk after they transition to public ownership. Note that we do not observe these variables for

the banks that do not transition to public ownership so we set their values to zero. By taking this

approach we are able to examine whether the effect of the transition to public ownership is

stronger for banks that are less insulated from the stock market.


                                                           Table 11, Panels A and B report estimates from this triple-DD specification for the

composite CAMELS rating (Panel A) and our Risk Factor measure. As predicted, the results

indicate that the composite CAMELS rating deteriorates less and there is a decline in the Risk

Factor relative to control banks if the bank has a larger board, more insider board members, and

worse governance according to the GIM measure. Thus, insulation from stock-market pressure

leads to less risk-taking.


                                                           Panels C and D of Table 11 present another set of variables, those that measure the extent

to which shareholders and managers have short investment horizons. The results indicate that the

risk-taking effects are more pronounced for banks that are held by institutional shareholders and

CEOs that turn over their shares more frequently.7 Moreover, the risk-taking effects are larger

when bank executives more frequently use the phrase “short-term” in earnings calls, which

Brochet, Loumioti and Serafeim (2015) show is related to accounting choices such as

discretionary accruals, which tend to increase short-term earnings. Thus, the collection of

  Gaspar, Massa and Matos (2005) show that firms with high institutional share turnover are more likely to receive a
takeover bid. Thus, the effect measured in Panel C could be related to the results in Panel B linking risk-taking to
governance variables that affect the likelihood of a takeover.


                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    24
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         	  
	  


evidence we present here suggests that the risk-taking effects are larger when short-term stock

prices are of greater concern to bank managers.


       Panels E and F of Table 11 look at time-series variation in the treatment effect. In

particular, we examine whether risk-taking incentives of publicly-held banks are increased

relative to privately-held banks at times when there is more downward pressure on bank

earnings, i.e. when interest rates are low (as measured by the Fed funds rate) and when credit

spreads are tight (as measured by the spread of yields on long-term investment-grade corporate

bonds over those of comparable-maturity Treasuries and the spread of A2/P2 overnight

commercial paper rates over AA overnight commercial paper rates, respectively). These panels

show that supervisory ratings deteriorate more and financial risk measures increase more during

periods when the Fed funds rate and credit spreads are low. The findings are consistent with the

work of Hanson and Stein (2015) showing that commercial banks increase the duration of the

securities holdings when short-term rates are low presumably in an effort to increase yield.




5. Conclusion
       In this paper, we argue and present evidence that a focus on short-term stock prices

induces publicly-traded banks to increase risk relative to privately-held banks. Our findings raise

a number of additional questions.


       First, what effect does the increase in risk-taking incentives of publicly-traded banks have

on the behavior of privately-held banks? If these incentives essentially increase the supply of

credit by publicly-traded banks, they make privately-held banks less profitable and may induce

them to take more risk as well. Alternatively, these private banks – which may be more focused



                                                  25
                                                                                                      	  
	  


on long-run value – could reduce their supply of credit in response, acting as something of a

stabilizing force.


        Second, do these sorts of risk-taking incentives exist in other non-bank financial

intermediaries? Kacperczyk and Schnabl (2013) and Chernenko and Sunderam (2014) present

evidence that suggests that they do. These papers show that assets under management in

institutional money market funds are much more sensitive to yield than are retail money market

funds, which in turn creates strong financial incentives for institutional money market funds to

increase risk, much as stock-market pressure creates incentives for banks to increase risk. It

would therefore not be surprising if institutional bond funds engaged in similar behavior, or if

open-ended bond funds took more risk than closed-end funds (which do not see greater fund

flows when yield increases). Similar incentives might also exist in insurance. While reaching for

yield has been shown to exist in insurance (Becker and Ivashina, forthcoming), our results raise

the question of whether it is more pronounced among publicly-traded insurance companies as

compared to mutual organizations.


        Finally, what are the implications of bank risk-taking behavior for regulation? Our

findings provide some support for the view that compensation schemes should require

management to hold stock for longer periods to mitigate their incentives to pump up short-term

earnings and the short-term stock price. Of course, the wisdom of such a policy depends on

whether one believes that the risk-taking behavior documented here is socially excessive. Our

findings also point to a tension in regulatory policy. While bank regulators may want to limit the

extent to which banks respond to stock market pressure, securities regulators try to promote good

corporate governance, which tends to increase the power of shareholders to impact firm



                                                26
                                                                                                    	  
	  


behavior. As we have shown, good governance – and the stock market pressure associated with it

– may actually lead to an undesirable increase in risk.

    The variables used in this paper are extracted from four main data sources: the National Informa-
tion Center (NIC) of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Terms of Business
Lending (STBL), Call Reports, and lists of announced (completed and withdrawn) IPOs and M&As
from SDC, Capital IQ, and SNL Financial. For each data item, we indicate the relevant source in
square brackets. The variables are defined as follows:

   Bank Risk – Outcome Measures Based on Supervisory Data [NIC/STBL]:

     Capital Adequacy rating: "A financial institution is expected to maintain capital commensurate
     with its risks and the ability of management to identify, measure, monitor, and control these
     risks. The capital adequacy of an institution is rated based on, but not limited to, an assessment
     of the following evaluation factors: the level and quality of capital and the overall financial con-
     dition of the institution; the ability of management to address emerging needs for additional
     capital; balance-sheet composition, including the nature and amount of intangible assets, mar-
     ket risk, concentration risk, and risks associated with nontraditional activities; risk exposure
     represented by off-balance-sheet activities" (source: Commercial Bank Examination Manual).

     Asset Quality rating: "The asset-quality rating reflects the quantity of existing and potential
     credit risk associated with the loan and investment portfolios, other real estate owned, other
     assets, and off-balance-sheet transactions. The ability of management to identify, measure,
     monitor, and control credit risk is also reflected here. The asset quality of a financial institu-
     tion is rated based on, but not limited to, an assessment of the following evaluation factors: the
     adequacy of underwriting standards, soundness of credit-administration practices, and appro-
     priateness of risk-identification practices; the level, distribution, severity, and trend of problem,
     classified, nonaccrual, restructured, delinquent, and nonperforming assets for both on- and off-
     balance-sheet transactions; the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses and other
     asset valuation reserves; the credit risk arising from or reduced by off-balance-sheet transac-
     tions, such as unfunded commitments, credit derivatives, commercial and standby letters of
     credit, and lines of credit; the diversification and quality of the loan and investment portfo-
     lios; the extent of securities underwriting activities and exposure to counterparties in trading
     activities; the existence of asset concentrations; the adequacy of loan and investment policies,
     procedures, and practices; the ability of management to properly administer its assets, includ-
     ing the timely identification and collection of problem assets; the adequacy of internal controls
     and management information systems; the volume and nature of credit-documentation excep-
     tions" (source: Commercial Bank Examination Manual).

     Management rating: "The capability of the board of directors and management, in their respec-
     tive roles, to identify, measure, monitor, and control the risks of an institution’s activities, and
     to ensure a financial institution’s safe, sound, and efficient operation in compliance with ap-
     plicable laws and regulations is reflected in this rating. The capability and performance of
     management and the board of directors is rated based on, but not limited to, an assessment of
     the following evaluation factors: the level and quality of oversight and support of all institu-
     tion activities by the board of directors and management; the ability of the board of directors
     and management, in their respective roles, to plan for and respond to risks that may arise from
     changing business conditions or the initiation of new activities or products; the adequacy of
     and conformance with appropriate internal policies and controls addressing the operations and
     risks of significant activities; compliance with laws and regulations; responsiveness to recom-
     mendations from auditors and supervisory authorities; management depth and succession; the
     extent that the board of directors and management are affected by or susceptible to dominant

                                                   30
influence or concentration of authority; reasonableness of compensation policies and avoidance
of self-dealing" (source: Commercial Bank Examination Manual).
Earnings rating: "The earnings rating reflects not only the quantity and trend of earnings, but
also factors that may affect the sustainability or quality of earnings. High levels of market risk
may unduly expose the institution’s earnings to volatility in interest rates. The rating of an
institution’s earnings is based on, but not limited to, an assessment of the following evaluation
factors: the level of earnings, including trends and stability; the ability to provide for adequate
capital through retained earnings; the quality and sources of earnings; the level of expenses in
relation to operations; the adequacy of the budgeting systems, forecasting processes, and man-
agement information systems in general; the adequacy of provisions to maintain the allowance
for loan and lease losses and other valuation allowance accounts; the exposure of earnings to
market risk such as interest-rate, foreign-exchange, and price risks" (source: Commercial Bank
Examination Manual).
Liquidity rating: "In evaluating the adequacy of a financial institution’s liquidity position, con-
sideration should be given to the current level and prospective sources of liquidity compared
to funding needs. Liquidity is rated based on, but not limited to, an assessment of the following
evaluation factors: the adequacy of liquidity sources compared with present and future needs
and the ability of the institution to meet liquidity needs without adversely affecting its oper-
ations or condition; the availability of assets readily convertible to cash without undue loss;
access to money markets and other sources of funding; the level of diversification of funding
sources, both on- and off-balance-sheet; the degree of reliance on short-term, volatile sources
of funds, including borrowings and brokered deposits, to fund longer-term assets; the trend
and stability of deposits; the ability to securitize and sell certain pools of assets; the capability
of management to properly identify, measure, monitor, and control the institution’s liquidity
position, including the effectiveness of funds-management strategies, liquidity policies, man-
agement information systems, and contingency funding plans" (source: Commercial Bank Ex-
amination Manual).
Sensitivity to Market Risk rating: "The sensitivity to market risk component reflects the degree
to which changes in interest rates, foreign-exchange rates, commodity prices, or equity prices
can adversely affect a financial institution’s earnings or economic capital. Market risk is rated
based on, but not limited to, an assessment of the following evaluation factors: the sensitivity
of the financial institution’s earnings or the economic value of its capital to adverse changes in
interest rates, foreign-exchange rates, commodity prices, or equity prices; the ability of manage-
ment to identify, measure, monitor, and control exposure to market risk given the institution’s
size, complexity, and risk profile; the nature and complexity of interest-rate risk exposure aris-
ing from nontrading positions; where appropriate, the nature and complexity of market-risk
exposure arising from trading and foreign operations" (source: Commercial Bank Examination
Manual).
CAMELS ("composite") rating: "The composite rating generally bears a close relationship to the
component ratings assigned. However, the composite rating is not derived by computing an
arithmetic average of the component ratings. When assigning a composite rating, some com-
ponents may be given more weight than others depending on the situation at the institution.
The ability of management to respond to changing circumstances and address the risks that
may arise from changing business conditions or the initiation of new activities or products is
an important factor in evaluating a financial institution’s overall risk profile, as well as the level
of supervisory attention warranted" (source: Commercial Bank Examination Manual).
Maximum Risk Score: Is defined as the tightest of the eight supervisory risk ratings ("component"
CAMELS, "composite" CAMELS, and STBL loan risk rating) for each bank in any given quarter.

                                              31
  Bad Rating Dummy: An indicator that equals one if the bank is rated as weak (a rating of 3
  and above) along any of the eight supervisory ratings ("component" CAMELS, "composite"
  CAMELS, and STBL loan risk rating) in any given quarter.

                                       Table 1: Summary Statistics

This table presents summary statistics (means) for the main samples used in the analysis. Column (1) refers
to the starting merged BHC-Commercial Bank Sample, which consists of 178,980 commercial bank-quarter
observations for the universe of commercial banks held by a BHC between 1990 and 2012. Column (2) refers
to the Switchers sub-sample, which is defined as those commercial banks in the starting sample that over
the sample period experience a switch from being held by a privately-held BHC to a publicly-traded BHC.
Switches occur for two reasons, an IPO or an acquisition of a privately-held target by a publicly-traded BHC,
and lead to 26,776 commercial bank-quarter observations involving 758 BHCs and 1,294 commercial banks
between 1990 and 2012. Column (3) refers to the baseline identification sub-sample, which is defined as those
commercial banks in our merged BHC-Commercial Bank Sample that over the sample period announce and
either complete ("treatment" group) or withdraw ("control" group) a switch from being held by a privately-
held BHC to a publicly-traded BHC. The announced switches are due to two reasons, an IPO or an acquisition
of a privately-held target by a publicly-traded BHC, which leads to a sample of 31,569 commercial bank-
quarter observations involving 934 unique BHCs and 1,521 unique commercial banks between 1990 and 2012.
Definitions for all variables are in Appendix.

The starting sample is the merged BHC-Commercial Bank Sample, which consists of 234,535 commercial bank-quarter observations for the universe of
commercial banks held by a BHC between 1990 and 2012. The Switchers sub-sample is defined as those commercial banks in the starting sample that over
the sample period experience a switch from being held by a privately-held BHC to a publicly-traded BHC. Switches occur for two reasons, an IPO or an
acquisition of a privately-held target by a publicly-traded BHC. The Switchers sample consists of 26,776 commercial bank-quarter observations involving
758 BHCs and 1,294 commercial banks between 1990 and 2012. The period considered is the run-up to the crisis, which leads to a sample of up to 14,479
commercial bank-quarter observations involving 464 unique BHCs and 788 unique commercial banks between 1997 and 2006. Panel A of this table reports
descriptive evidence for the starting sample. Specifically, we report parameter estimates from OLS regressions of each management score on a dummy that
equals one for commercial banks that are held by a publicly-traded BHC, while controlling for bank size. For the Switchers sample, we report parameter
estimates from OLS regressions of each management score (Panel B) and of bank decisions (Panel C) on a dummy that equals one for commercial banks that
are held by a publicly-traded BHC, while also controlling for commercial bank fixed effects. Year-quarter dummies are included in all regressions. Standard
errors (in parentheses) are clustered at the BHC level, with ***, **, and * denoting significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

     Table 3: Difference-in-Differences Analysis, Diagnostic Tests – "Identification sample" with
                                  Cancelled Deals as Control Group

The sample is the identification sub-sample, which is defined as those commercial banks in our merged BHC-
Commercial Bank Sample that over the sample period announce and either complete ("treatment" group) or
withdraw ("control" group) a switch from being held by a privately-held BHC to a publicly-traded BHC. The
announced switches are due to two reasons, an IPO or an acquisition of a privately-held target by a publicly-
traded BHC, which leads to a sample of 31,569 commercial bank-quarter observations involving 934 unique
BHCs and 1,521 unique commercial banks between 1990 and 2012. This table reports tests of the validity of
the control group construction for the difference-in-differences analysis. Panel A reports summary statistics of
pre-treatment CAMELS ratings, their trends, as well as balance sheet characteristics for banks in the treatment
(Column 1) and control (Column 2) samples, respectively. These variables are measured as of the quarter prior
to the announcement of a transition. Column 3 reports t-tests of the null hypothesis that treated and control
banks are similar along each characteristic. Panel B reports OLS estimates from a linear probability model
relating the likelihood of a deal succeeding to the pre-announcement characteristics of the commercial bank
involved. Year-quarter dummies are included in all regressions. Standard errors (in parentheses) are robust,
with ***, **, and * denoting significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

           Table 4: Difference-in-Differences Analysis, Baseline Tests – "Identification sample" with Cancelled Deals as Control Group

The starting sample is the identification sub-sample, which is defined as those commercial banks in our merged BHC-Commercial Bank Sample that over
the sample period announce and either complete ("treatment" group) or withdraw ("control" group) a switch from being held by a privately-held BHC to a
publicly-traded BHC. The announced switches are due to two reasons, an IPO or an acquisition of a privately-held target by a publicly-traded BHC, which
leads to a sample of 31,569 commercial bank-quarter observations involving 934 unique BHCs and 1,521 unique commercial banks between 1990 and 2012.
The period considered is the run-up to the crisis, which leads to a sample of up to 14,479 commercial bank-quarter observations involving 464 unique BHCs
and 788 unique commercial banks between 1997 and 2006. This table reports the main results of the difference-in-differences analysis of each management
score (Panel A) and bank decisions (Panel B). Specifically, the DD specification that is estimated is RISK it = α + β1 A f terit + β2 A f terit Treatmenti +
γZit + µt + µi + εit , where A f ter is an indicator variable that takes a value of one for all the quarters after the announcement date and zero otherwise, and
Treatment is an indicator variable that takes a value of one for commercial banks in the treatment group and zero for those in the control group. Year-quarter
dummies as well as commercial bank fixed effects are included in all regressions. Standard errors (in parentheses) are clustered at the BHC level, with ***,
**, and * denoting significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

                                    M&A Deals as Control Group
The sample is the identification sub-sample, which is defined as those commercial banks in our merged BHC-
Commercial Bank Sample that over the sample period become targets of a completed M&A deal, which in-
volves either an acquisition of a privately-held target by a publicly-traded acquirer that lead to an ownership
switch ("treatment" group) or an acquisition between two publicly-traded or two privately-held BHCs that do
not lead to an ownership switch ("control" group). The resulting sample consists of 21,757 commercial bank-
quarter observations involving 1,089 unique BHCs and 1,631 unique commercial banks between 1990 and
2012. This table reports tests of the validity of the control group construction for the difference-in-differences
analysis. Panel A reports summary statistics of pre-treatment CAMELS ratings, their trends, as well as bal-
ance sheet characteristics for banks in the treatment (Column 1) and control (Column 2) samples, respectively.
These variables are measured as of the quarter prior to the M&A deal. Column 3 reports t-tests of the null
hypothesis that treated and control banks are similar along each characteristic. Panel B reports OLS estimates
from a linear probability model relating the likelihood of a deal involving a private to public switch to the
pre-announcement characteristics of the target commercial bank. Year-quarter dummies are included in all
regressions. Standard errors (in parentheses) are robust, with ***, **, and * denoting significance at the 1%, 5%,
and 10% level, respectively.

The starting sample is the identification sub-sample, which is defined as those commercial banks in our merged BHC-Commercial Bank Sample that over
the sample period become targets of a completed M&A deal, which involves either an acquisition of a privately-held target by a publicly-traded acquirer
that lead to an ownership switch ("treatment" group) or an acquisition between two publicly-traded or two privately-held BHCs that do not lead to an
ownership switch ("control" group). The resulting sample consists of 21,757 commercial bank-quarter observations involving 1,089 unique BHCs and 1,631
unique commercial banks between 1990 and 2012. The period considered is the run-up to the crisis, which leads to a sample of up to 14,479 commercial
bank-quarter observations involving 464 unique BHCs and 788 unique commercial banks between 1997 and 2006. This table reports the main results of
the difference-in-differences analysis of each management score (Panel A) and bank decisions (Panel B). Specifically, the DD specification that is estimated
is RISK it = α + β1 A f terit + β2 A f terit Treatmenti + γZit + µt + µi + εit , where A f ter is an indicator variable that takes a value of one for all the
quarters after the M&A deal (completion) date and zero otherwise, and Treatment is an indicator variable that takes a value of one for commercial banks in
the treatment group and zero for those in the control group. Year-quarter dummies as well as commercial bank fixed effects are included in all regressions.
Standard errors (in parentheses) are clustered at the BHC level, with ***, **, and * denoting significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

                                 Cancelled Deals as Control Group

The sample is the identification sub-sample, which is defined as those commercial banks in our merged BHC-
Commercial Bank Sample that over the sample period announce and either complete or withdraw a switch
from being held by a privately-held BHC to a publicly-traded BHC. The announced switches are due to two
reasons, an IPO or an acquisition of a privately-held target by a publicly-traded BHC, which leads to a sam-
ple of 31,569 commercial bank-quarter observations involving 934 unique BHCs and 1,521 unique commercial
banks between 1990 and 2012. This table reports tests of the validity of the S&P Bank Index as an instrument
for deal completion in a two-stage least square (2SLS) analysis. Panel A reports summary statistics of pre-
announcement CAMELS ratings, their trends, as well as balance sheet characteristics for banks that experience
an S&P Bank Index drop (Column 1) and other banks in the sample (Column 2), respectively. These variables
are measured to include all quarters in the pre-announcement period starting from one year prior to the an-
nouncement of a transition. Column 3 reports t-tests of the null hypothesis that banks that experience an S&P
Bank Index drop are similar to other banks in the sample along each characteristic. A bank is classified as expe-
riencing an S&P Bank Index drop if the two-month S&P Bank Index returns following its deal announcement
are at the bottom of the distribution of all announcements in the same year. Panel B reports OLS estimates from
a linear probability model relating the likelihood of a deal succeeding to alternative definitions of S&P Bank
Index drop and to the pre-announcement characteristics of the commercial bank involved. Filer year dum-
mies are included in all regressions. Standard errors (in parentheses) are robust, with ***, **, and * denoting
significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

The sample is the identification sub-sample, which is defined as those commercial banks in our merged BHC-Commercial Bank Sample that over the sample
period announce and either complete ("treatment" group) or withdraw ("control" group) a switch from being held by a privately-held BHC to a publicly-
traded BHC. The announced switches are due to two reasons, an IPO or an acquisition of a privately-held target by a publicly-traded BHC, which leads
to a sample of 31,569 commercial bank-quarter observations involving 934 unique BHCs and 1,521 unique commercial banks between 1990 and 2012. This
table reports the main results of a calendar-time analysis of the evolution of a bank’s operating performance after the quarter when it announces a private-
to-public transition (t = 0). We report results for two metrics of bank operating performance, return on equity (ROE) in Panel A and return on assets (ROA)
in Panel B, respectively. Specifically, the specification that is estimated is P erf ormanceit+ N P erf ormanceit 1 = α + β1 Treatmenti + γZit + µt + εit ,
where Treatment is an indicator variable that takes a value of one for commercial banks in the treatment group and zero for those in the control group, and
N is the number of quarters since the quarter when the private-to-public transition is announced. Year-quarter dummies are included in all regressions.
Standard errors (in parentheses) are clustered at the BHC level, with ***, **, and * denoting significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

The sample is the identification sub-sample, which is defined as those commercial banks in our merged BHC-Commercial Bank Sample that over the sample
period announce and either complete ("treatment" group) or withdraw ("control" group) a switch from being held by a privately-held BHC to a publicly-
traded BHC. The announced switches are due to two reasons, an IPO or an acquisition of a privately-held target by a publicly-traded BHC, which leads
to a sample of 31,569 commercial bank-quarter observations involving 934 unique BHCs and 1,521 unique commercial banks between 1990 and 2012. This
table reports the main results of the difference-in-differences analysis of alternative metrics of bank performance for a specification that allows for time-series
heterogeneity in the treatment effect by adding an interactive term with a crisis dummy (Panel A) and for the baseline specification (Panel B). Specifically,
the interactive DD specification that is estimated is P erf ormanceit = α + β1 A f terit + β2 A f terit Treatmenti + β3 A f terit Treatmenti Crisist +
γZit + µt + µi + εit , where A f ter is an indicator variable that takes a value of one for all the quarters after the announcement date and zero otherwise,
Treatment is an indicator variable that takes a value of one for commercial banks in the treatment group and zero for those in the control group, and Crisis
is an indicator variable that takes a value of one for all quarters between 2007Q4 and 2009Q4. Year-quarter dummies as well as commercial bank fixed effects
are included in all regressions. Standard errors (in parentheses) are clustered at the BHC level, with ***, **, and * denoting significance at the 1%, 5%, and
10% level, respectively.

The sample is the identification sub-sample, which is defined as those commercial banks in our merged BHC-Commercial Bank Sample that over the sample
period announce and either complete ("treatment" group) or withdraw ("control" group) a switch from being held by a privately-held BHC to a publicly-
traded BHC. The announced switches are due to two reasons, an IPO or an acquisition of a privately-held target by a publicly-traded BHC, which leads to a
sample of 31,569 commercial bank-quarter observations involving 934 unique BHCs and 1,521 unique commercial banks between 1990 and 2012. This table
reports the main results of the difference-in-differences analysis of a dummy for bad management score, which is defined as a rating of 3 or worse, and of
the bank risk factor for a specification that allows for cross-sectional (Panels A to D) and time-series (Panels E and F) heterogeneity in the treatment effect
by adding an interactive term. Specifically, the interactive DD specification that is estimated in Panels A to D is RISK it = α + β1 A f terit + β2 A f terit
Treatmenti + β3 A f terit Treatmenti Xi + β4 A f terit Xi + γZit + γ1 A f terit Zit + µt + µi + εit , where A f ter is an indicator variable that takes a
value of one for all the quarters after the announcement date and zero otherwise, Treatment is an indicator variable that takes a value of one for commercial
banks in the treatment group and zero for those in the control group, and X is the cumulative density function of the sorting variable used in turn in each
column, which include the total number of directors (Column (1) of Panels A and B), the ratio of the number of directors that are insiders to the total number
of directors (Column (2) of Panels A and B), the GIM index of takeover protection by Gompers, Ishii, and Metrick (2003) (Column (3) of Panels A and B), the
average institutional investors’ portfolio turnover based on Cahart (1997) (Column (1) of Panels C and D), the frequency of CEO net-sales of stock (Column
(2) of Panels C and D), the frequency of words related to short-term horizon in the transcripts of earnings conference calls (Column (3) of Panels C and D).
Note that in Panels A to D the term A f terit Xi cannot be estimated indendently from A f terit Treatmenti Xi because Xi does not vary within private
banks, and thus drops out of the estimation due to collinearity. Year-quarter dummies as well as commercial bank fixed effects are included in all regressions.
Standard errors (in parentheses) are clustered at the BHC level, with ***, **, and * denoting significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

This figure describes the evolution of aggregate total assets in the U.S. commercial banking sector from 1990
to 2014. Aggregate total assets of commercial banks are measured as the sum of consolidated assets reported
by each commercial bank in its Call Report filing for the universe of U.S. filers. Note that this definition does
not include nonbank assets of bank holding companies (BHCs), which would equal to the difference between
total assets as reported by BHCs in their Y-9C and those of commercial bank assets as defined in the figure. For
each commercial bank, we estimate the ownership status of its (top-holder) BHC based on a NIC indicator for
whether the BHC’s securities are traded and are subject to registration, or it is required to report to the SEC.
Panel A shows the level of aggregate total assets of U.S. commercial banks that are held by a publicly-traded
BHC and of U.S. commercial banks that are held by a privately-held BHC from 1990 to 2014. Panel B shows
the growth rate of these aggregate series. Specifically, we plot each of the two series scaled by its respective
1990Q1 level. Sources: National Information Center (NIC) and Call Reports.

               Figure 2: Bank Risk Taking Before and After a Private-to-Public Transition
The sample is the identification sub-sample, which is defined as those commercial banks in our merged BHC-
Commercial Bank Sample that over the sample period announce and either complete ("treatment" group) or
withdraw ("control" group) a switch from being held by a privately-held BHC to a publicly-traded BHC. The
announced switches are due to two reasons, an IPO or an acquisition of a privately-held target by a publicly-
traded BHC, which leads to a sample of 31,569 commercial bank-quarter observations involving 934 unique
BHCs and 1,521 unique commercial banks between 1990 and 2012. This figure shows the likelihood (average
annual frequency) of a bad CAMELS rating (vertical axis, Panel A) and a high (top decile) Risk Factor (vertical
axis, Panel B) in event time leading to and after the year when a bank announces a private-to-public transition
(t=0) for treated (the black line) and control banks (the gray line). Observations to the left (right) of the t=0 line
correspond to years before (after) transition announcement.

         Appendix Table A.1: How Do Switchers Take On More Risk? Additional Analysis of Bank Decisions in the Run-Up to the Crisis
The sample is the identification sub-sample, which is defined as those commercial banks in our merged BHC-Commercial Bank Sample that over the
sample period announce and either complete ("treatment" group) or withdraw ("control" group) a switch from being held by a privately-held BHC to a
publicly-traded BHC. The period is 1997 to 2006. The announced switches are due to two reasons, an IPO or an acquisition of a privately-held target by a
publicly-traded BHC, which leads to a sample of up to 14,479 commercial bank-quarter observations involving 464 unique BHCs and 788 unique commercial
banks between 1997 and 2006. This table reports the main results of the difference-in-differences analysis of bank decisions on Capital Adequacy and Asset
Quality (Panel A), and Liquidity and Risk (Panel B). Specifically, the DD specification that is estimated is Decisionit = α + β1 A f terit + β2 A f terit
Treatmenti + γZit + µt + µi + εit , where A f ter is an indicator variable that takes a value of one for all the quarters after the announcement date and zero
otherwise, and Treatment is an indicator variable that takes a value of one for commercial banks in the treatment group and zero for those in the control
group. Year and quarter dummies as well as commercial bank fixed effects are included in all regressions. Standard errors (in parentheses) are clustered at
the BHC level, with ***, **, and * denoting significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

  Appendix Table A.2: Matched-Sample Difference-in-Differences Analysis, Baseline Tests – "Identification sample" with Cancelled Deals as
                                                            Control Group

The sample is the identification sub-sample, which is defined as those commercial banks in our merged BHC-Commercial Bank Sample that over the
sample period announce and either complete ("treatment" group) or withdraw ("control" group) a switch from being held by a privately-held BHC to a
publicly-traded BHC. The announced switches are due to two reasons, an IPO or an acquisition of a privately-held target by a publicly-traded BHC, which
leads to a sample of 31,569 commercial bank-quarter observations involving 934 unique BHCs and 1,521 unique commercial banks between 1990 and 2012.
This table reports the main results of the matched-sample difference-in-differences analysis of each management score (Panel A) and of a dummy for bad
management score, which is defined as a rating of 3 or worse (Panel B). Specifically, the DD specification that is estimated is CAMELSit CAMELS it =
α + β1 A f terit + β2 A f terit Treatmenti + γZit + µt + µi + εit , where A f ter is an indicator variable that takes a value of one for all the quarters after
the announcement date and zero otherwise, and Treatment is an indicator variable that takes a value of one for commercial banks in the treatment group
and zero for those in the matched control group. To implement the estimator, we use a methodology analogous to long-run event studies (e.g., Barber and
Lyons (1997)) and for each bank-quarter construct a "benchmark" CAMELS, CAMELS it , for a matched portfolio of banks. Matching is done with respect
to year and commercial bank size. Year and quarter dummies as well as commercial bank fixed effects are included in all regressions. Standard errors (in
parentheses) are clustered at the BHC level, with ***, **, and * denoting significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

Appendix Table A.3: Instrumental Variable (2-SLS) Analysis, Placebo Test – "Identification sample"
                           with Cancelled Deals as Control Group

The sample is the identification sub-sample, which is defined as those commercial banks in our merged BHC-
Commercial Bank Sample that over the sample period announce and either complete or withdraw a switch
from being held by a privately-held BHC to a publicly-traded BHC. The announced switches are due to two
reasons, an IPO or an acquisition of a privately-held target by a publicly-traded BHC, which leads to a sample
of 31,569 commercial bank-quarter observations involving 934 unique BHCs and 1,521 unique commercial
banks between 1990 and 2012. This table reports a placebo test of the validity of the exclusion restriction in
the (2-SLS) instrumental variable analysis of Table 8 that uses the S&P Bank Index as an instrument for deal
completion. The dependent variable is the average of the composite CAMELS rating after transitions. Panel
A reports OLS estimates for alternative definitions of the S&P Bank Index drop in the two-month window

for alternative definitions of the S&P Bank Index drop in the two-month window from a year before and from
a year after the transition announcement, respectively. Filer year dummies are included in all regressions.
Standard errors (in parentheses) are robust, with ***, **, and * denoting significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10%
level, respectively.

    Appendix Table A.4: Difference-in-Differences Analysis, Diagnostic Tests – Balancing Tests of
                     Pre-Event Characteristics of Banks in the M&A Sample
The starting sample is the identification sub-sample, which is defined as those commercial banks in our merged
BHC-Commercial Bank Sample that over the sample period become targets of a completed M&A deal, which
involves either an acquisition of a privately-held target by a publicly-traded acquirer that lead to an ownership
switch ("treatment" group) or an acquisition between two publicly-traded or two privately-held BHCs that do
not lead to an ownership switch ("control" group). The resulting sample consists of 2,431 unique commercial
banks between 1990 and 2012. This table reports tests of the validity of the M&A sample construction for the
difference-in-differences analysis. Panel A reports summary statistics of pre-treatment CAMELS ratings, their
trends, as well as balance sheet characteristics for banks whose chartered is discontinued in the same quarter
when their BHC is acquired (Column 1), for banks whose chartered is discontinued in the next quarter after
the acquisition of their BHC (Column 2), and for banks whose charter is not discontinued either in the quarter
when their BHC is acquired or in the next quarter (Column 3), respectively. These variables are measured
as of the quarter prior to the M&A deal. Column 4 reports t-tests of the null hypothesis that banks whose
chartered is discontinued either in the quarter when their BHC is acquired or in the next quarter and those
banks whose charter is not discontinued until later or at all are similar along each characteristic. Panel B reports
OLS estimates from a linear probability model relating the likelihood that the bank charter is discontinued
either in the quarter when their BHC is acquired or in the next quarter to the pre-announcement characteristics
of the target commercial bank. Year-quarter dummies are included in all regressions. Standard errors (in
parentheses) are robust, with ***, **, and * denoting significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

The starting sample is the identification sub-sample, which is defined as those commercial banks in our merged
BHC-Commercial Bank Sample that over the sample period become targets of a completed M&A deal, which
involves either an acquisition of a privately-held target by a publicly-traded acquirer that lead to an ownership
switch ("treatment" group) or an acquisition between two publicly-traded or two privately-held BHCs that do
not lead to an ownership switch ("control" group). The resulting sample consists of 2,431 unique commercial
banks between 1990 and 2012. This table reports tests of the validity of the M&A sample construction for the
difference-in-differences analysis. Panel C reports summary statistics of pre-treatment CAMELS ratings, their
trends, as well as balance sheet characteristics for additional finer partitions of the sub-sample of banks whose
chartered is not discontinued in the quarter when their BHC is acquired or in the next quarter, which include
those whose charter is not discontinued for up to 1 year after their BHC is acquired (Column 2), for up to 2
years after their BHC is acquired (Column 3), and for up to 3 years after their BHC is acquired (Column 4),
respectively. These variables are measured as of the quarter prior to the M&A deal. Panel D reports additional
OLS estimates from a linear probability model relating the likelihood that the bank charter is discontinued
within N quarters after its BHC is acquired to the pre-announcement characteristics of the target commercial
bank. Year-quarter dummies are included in all regressions. Standard errors (in parentheses) are robust, with
***, **, and * denoting significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

                     Table A.5: Bank Fixed Effects Analysis of Supervisory Ratings– ALL BHCs, "switchers sample" – IPOs only

The sample is the switchers sub-sample, which is defined as those commercial banks in our merged BHC-Commercial Bank Sample that over the sample
period experience a switch from being held by a privately-held to a publicly-traded BHC. The table reports results for switches that occur due to an IPO,
which leads to a sample of 15,411 commercial bank-quarter observations involving 206 unique BHCs and 406 unique commercial banks between 1990 and
2012. This table reports parameter estimates from OLS regressions of each management score on a dummy that equals one for commercial banks that are
held by a publicly-traded BHC, while controlling for a standard set of bank characteristics. Year and quarter dummies as well as commercial bank fixed
effects are included in all regressions. Standard errors (in parentheses) are clustered at the BHC level, with ***, **, and * denoting significance at the 1%, 5%,
and 10% level, respectively.

Appendix Table A.6: Additional Robustness of Baseline Tests to Supervisory Identity– "Identification sample" with Cancelled Deals as Control
                                                                  Group

The starting sample is the identification sub-sample, which is defined as those commercial banks in our merged BHC-Commercial Bank Sample that over
the sample period announce and either complete ("treatment" group) or withdraw ("control" group) a switch from being held by a privately-held BHC
to a publicly-traded BHC. The announced switches are due to two reasons, an IPO or an acquisition of a privately-held target by a publicly-traded BHC,
which leads to a sample of 31,569 commercial bank-quarter observations involving 934 unique BHCs and 1,521 unique commercial banks between 1990 and
2012. The period considered is the run-up to the crisis, which leads to a sample of up to 14,479 commercial bank-quarter observations involving 464 unique
BHCs and 788 unique commercial banks between 1997 and 2006. This table reports the main results of the difference-in-differences analysis of supervisory
identity and frequency (Panel A) and each management score in a specification that adds controls for supervisory frequency (Panel B). Specifically, the DD
specification that is estimated is RISK it = α + β1 A f terit + β2 A f terit  Treatmenti + γZit + µt + µi + εit , where A f ter is an indicator variable that
takes a value of one for all the quarters after the announcement date and zero otherwise, and Treatment is an indicator variable that takes a value of one
for commercial banks in the treatment group and zero for those in the control group. Year-quarter dummies as well as commercial bank fixed effects are
included in all regressions. Standard errors (in parentheses) are clustered at the BHC level, with ***, **, and * denoting significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10%
level, respectively.
