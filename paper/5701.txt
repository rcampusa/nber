        This paper reports on a randomized evaluation of an earnings subsidy offered to long-term

welfare recipients    in Canada.    The program -- known as the Self-Sufficiency     Project (SSP) --

provides a supplement      equal to one-half of the difference between a target earnings level and a

participant’s   actual earnings.   The SSP supplement is similar to a negative income tax with two

important differences: (1) eligibility is limited to long-term welfare recipients who find a full-time

job; and (2) the payment depends on individual earnings rather than family income. Our evaluation

is based on a classical randomized design: one half of a group of single parents who had been on

welfare for over a year were eligible to receive the SSP supplement,       while the other half were

assigned to a control group, Results for an early cohort of SSP participants and controls suggest that

the financial incentives of the Self-Sufficiency Program increase labor market attachment and reduce

welfare participation.

       In Canada, as in the United States, welfare expenditures and caseloads have expanded

steadily over the past three decades.           Behveen 1981 and 1991, for example, federal and

provincial expenditures u~iated         with the Canada Assistance Plan almost tripled, with incr=ses

in individual provinces ranging from 200 to almost 500 percent (Courchene, 1994). Faced with

rising welfare wsts and budget deficits, Canadian policy makers have begun -thing                              for

measures to increase welfare recipients’ self-sufficiency and reduce their dependence on

government transfers.

       Most welfare recipients in Canada do not work. For example, in British Columbia and

New Brunswick, only about 20 percent of single parents who receive public assistanu report any

earnings in a given month. * This circumstance, of course, is not unique to Canada —- the

proportion of welfare =ipients        who work in the United States is also small. The low rates of

labor market attachment on both sides of the border reflect a similar dilemma for many welfare

recipients.    On the one hand, available jobs tend to pay low wages; on the other hand, by

rducing     benefits by up to a dollar for every dollar of sings,            the welfare system imposes a

very high “tax rate” on r~ipients’ work effort.

       This paper presents early findings from art experimental evaluation of a new program

designed to encourage work and self-sufficiency among the welfare population in Canada. The

program -- known as the Self-Sufficiency Project or SSP -- attempts to balan~                           the dual

challenges of low wages and high marginal tax rates by offering an earnings subsidy to welfare

raipients     who fmd a full-time job and leave welfare.            Specifically, participants in the SSP

progmm receive one-half of the difference between their actual mings                   and an earnings “target”

set ~nsiderably     above the level of welfare benefits available to most families.                     The SSP

evaluation is b-      on a randomized design: one-half of a group of long-term welf~e recipients

in two provinces (British Columbia and New Brunswick) were eligible for the supplement (the

program group); the other half were not (the control group). As in other recent evaluations of

U.S. welfare programs (=,        for example, Friedlander and Burtless, 1995), this randomized

design makes    it possible   to draw credible inferences about the impact of SSP from simple

comparisons between the outcomes of those who were offered the supplement and those who

were not.

       The full SSP evaluation entails a five-year follow-up of some 6,CKK)families. The findings

in this paper are based on the first 18-24 months of follow-up data for about 2,000 families in

an initial cohort of SSP enrollees.2      Already, however, systematic and highly significant

differences in labor market attachment and welfare participation rates between the program and

control groups suggest that the financial incentives of SSP aff=t a sizeable proportion of single-

parent welfare recipients.

       As background information for the SSP demonstration, S~tion I describes the nature of

the work incentives facing Canadian welfare recipients. Section II describes the design of SSP

and discusses the incentive effwts of the program using a standard labor supply framework.

Section III describes the characteristics of the research sample analyzed in this paper. Section

IV presents estimates of the impact of the SSP program on labor market outcomes and welfare

receipt.   Section V presents some preliminary findings on the extent to which responses to the

SSP program vary with the relative generosity of the supplement. Section VI analyzes the wages

of jobs taken by SSP participants, and Swt.ion VII discusses possible response biases that affect

the size of the impacts reportd in the main body of the paper. Finally, Section VIII summarizes

the paper’s findings and outlines the evaluation’s future research.



I. Work InHtiv~       in the ~         Welh    System

       There is no single national welfare program in Canada. Instead, the Canada Assistance

Plan s~ifies    a cost-sharing arrangement between the federal and provincial governments and



   %ese individuals were enrolled in the SSP demonstration betwmn November 1992 to
December 1993.

                                               -2-
each provinm administers its own welfare, or Income Assistance (IA), program. Nevertheless,

the provincial LA systems share many key features, most notably that IA applicants are subj=t

to a “rids    test” and that IA payments are offset by income from employment or other sources.

M benefits are linked to family size: in 1992, a single parent with one child was entitled to a

maximum of $9,841 per ya             in New Brunswick (one of the less generous provinces) and

$12,478 per year in British Columbia (one of the more generous provinces).3

       IA recipients are discouraged from worlcing by benefit rules that reduw IA payments

dollar-fordollar    with any earnings (or other iname) above a modest “disregard” amount (e.g.

$200 per month for single-parent families in New Brunswick). Canadian welfare rwipients who

work also stand to lose certain in-kind benefits, including subsidized housing, free dental

services, and prescription drugs. (Unlike the United States, there is no food stamp program in

Canada),     Finally, welfare recipients’ earnings are subject to payroll and income taxes. The

latter are especially important Wuse,       except for the first few hundred dollars of wages, higher

earnings reduce the income tax credit paid to low-income families, leading to a net positive

income tax liability. The combination of a 100 percent implicit tax rate in the welfare system

and a significant marginal tax rate in the income tax system crates a strong disincentive to work

for many IA recipients.



l-r.   The Self-Sufficiency Proj@

       The work disincentives built into the Canadian welfare system pose a critical question for

policy makers.     If incentives could be modified to “make work pay, ” would a larger fraction of

IA recipients take jobs and leave welfare? Over the past 25 years, a variety of programs have

b=n proposed and implemented (some experimentally) to answer this question, including a

and Canadian welfare systems. All monetary figure presented in this paper are in Canadian dollars.

negative iname       tax (NTT’),4 enhan~         or flexible earnings disregards         (~     Greenberg,

Michalopoulos, Robins, and Wood, 1995), income tax credits (e.g. the Earned Inmme Tax

Credit in the United States), and direct job training or placement services.                  The available

evidence suggests that few of these programs have a large effect on work activity. Research on

the experimental NIT programs run in the United States and Canada in the 1970s concluded that

they increased work incentives for some families and reduced them for others, with a net

nega-ve effect on work for eligible families. Research on enhand            earnings disregard programs

points to a similarly mixed conclusion.        Although a higher earnings disregard increases work

incentives for non-working welfare recipients, it may lower work incentives for those who are

working, and it may encourage some non-recipients to enter welfare (Moffitt, 1992), Tax credit

programs lead to the same combination of higher work incentives for some (at the lowest levels

of earnings) and reduced work incentives for others (whose earnings fall in the “phase-out”

range).5 Finally, evaluations of many different types of employment, education, and training

services programs suggest that most have only a modest capacity to increase employment and

earnings, although some spific        programs have been more successful.4

       In this context, the SSP supplement was conceived as an alternative approach to

encouraging work among welfare recipients, with explicit provisions to minimize the labor supply

disincentives of a conventional negative income tax. 7 The three key ingredients of the SSP

program are: (1) a substantial financial incentive for work relative to non-work, (2) a relativel y

low marginal tax rate on the earnings of those who work, and (3) a “full-time” work requirement

program.



A.      The Earnings Supplemt

        Assuming that the 30-hour work requirement is met, the SSP mings                     supplement is equal

to half the differenw between a participant’s gross labor mings                   and a target or “break-even”

earnings levels      Unearned inmme (such as child support or rental r~ipts)                 or earnings of other

family members do mt affat the supplement payment. The supplement is also independent of

family sti.     During the first year of the SSP demonstration, the target mings                   level was set at

$37,000 in British Columbia and $30,000 in New Brunswick (Canadian dollars). These levels

were designed to provide a substantial work incentive for most families. For example, a British

Columbia participant who worked 30 hours per w~k (1 ,500 hours per year) at $7 per hour (1

dollar above the minimum wage) would earn $10,500 per year and coll~t a $13,250 SSP

supplement.

        Figures 1 to 3 show simplified relationships betwen hours of work and total income under

IA and SSP for a single parent with one child who earns the minimum wage in British Columbia

and New Brunswick.g The two figures for British Columbia reflect the two different -ings

disregards in that province’s IA program: the basic earnings disregard ($200 per month) and an

enhand      disregard ($200 plus 25 percent of earnings) available during the first 12 months of

employment. As the figures make clear, SSP has two essential differences from the conventional

welfare program.       First, SSP offers substantially higher total income than IA for a “full-time”

job (30 or more hours per week).             Second, unlike IA, which has a 100 percent tax rate on


     8Forrnally, the supplement is given by S = .5(E* - E), where S is the supplement, E- is the target earnings
level, and E is actual eam.ings. This is a conventional NIT fomula, except that benefits are available only for full-
tirne workers and depend on individual earnings rather than family income,
     %-     figures do not take into ~unt    the intentions of SSP or IA with other M and transfer progmrns. Since
SSP benefits are subj~t to provincial and federal income tax~, and IA benefiu are not, the relative generosity of
SSP is exaggerated in the figures. The relative generosity of SSP for larger families is over-stated in Figure 1-3,
sinw IA kfits      rise with family sin while SSP benefits do not.

additional earnings, SSP benefits are reduced by only $.50 for each $1.00 of earnings.                      Thus,

SSP offers a tinancial incentive for higher work effort and also rewards individuals who find a

higher-wage job.       While Figures 1 to 3 ignore child care COSNand the complex interaction

betw=n     SSP and the provincial and federal income tax systems, the basic character of the

SSP/IA amparison        is unchanged when these issues are taken into account. As described more

fully in Section V, most single parents’ net incomes (accounting for taxes, child care costs, and

so forth) are $3,000 to $5,~           per year higher under SSP than if they had worked the same

amount and remained on IA.



B.      Eligibility Requirements

        Eligibility for the SSP demonstration wa limited to single parents who had b~rt on IA for

at least 12 of the previous 13 months. 10 People who were assigned to the program group were

given up to 12 months from the date of notification of eligibility to obtain a full-time job and

initiate a first supplement payment. Those who begart receiving SSP payments within this time

frame then became eligible for SSP supplements over the next three years (that is, for up to 36

months after the date of their first supplement payment).               Those who did not initiate an SSp

payment within the initial 12-month period lost any further eligibility. Supplement initiators were

required to discontinue IA receipt, although they could return to IA (and give up the supplement

payments) at any time during their period of eligibility.

        The SSP earnings supplement is paid monthly and is limited to individuals who work a

minimum     of 30 hours per week during the month and who earn at last the minimum wage.

Supplement recipients are ~uired             to mail in pay stubs verifying their hours of work and

sings      for the month. Individuals who do not m=t the minimum 30-hour work requirement



     ‘%s limit on eligibility was intended botb to reduce the incentive for people to apply for IA simply to gain
eligibility for 55P (so-called entry effects), and also to target program resourm to recipients with the gratest
difficultie-s in getting off welfare, A ~~te   experiment is being conducted in British Columbia to measure whether
new applimts to IA extend their welfare spells to become eligible for SSP.

for any given mont-b may receive a pro-rated                 portion of their supplement for the period.

However, pro-rating over a “partial month” is permitted only twice during each 12-month period

– after that the supplement is discontinued until the full-time hours threshold is met again.



c.      Other F~           of SSP

        The mandate of the SSP demonstration to test a volunfary earnings supplement pses a

potential problem for implementation.           On the one hand, for the demonstration to replicate art

on-going program, it is important that individuals understand the details of the program and the

potential benefits of finding a full-time job. On the other hand, it is vital that the SSP evaluation

not be compromised by “Hawthorne effects” arising from s~ial                   treatment of the participants,

or by the availability of extra services to the program group.                  Thus, the SSP “treatment”

combined an outreach program designed to inform the program group about the benefits and

operation of the supplement with a modest package of information and referrals to existing

community services.        Once informed about their eligibility for the SSP supplement, potential

participants were asked to attend an information workshop at art SSP office, where program staff

explained     the supplement offer and provided information on the child care, housing,

transportation, and job-counselling sexvices available to all IA recipients. 11

        In the 12-month period of potential eligibility for art initial supplement payment, SSP staff

regularly contacted the program group members to answer questions about the supplement and

to invite them to a money management workshop.                     After the expiration of their one-year

eligibility window, program group members who chose not to initiate a supplement were no

longer contacted by SSP staff. Those who initiated a supplement continued to receive supplement

payments if they met the eligibility r~uirements,             They were invited to attend further money

management workshops, but post-supplement contact was limited and mainly client-driven.




     ‘lNinety-six percent of people assigned to the SSP program group attended the initial information session.

D.      ---
        The expected impacts of the SSP program depend on incentives that vary from person to

person and over time, depending on what individuals would do in the absence of the program.

For analytical purposes, it is useful to distinguish betw=n four “counterfactual” groups, based

on whether an individual would work more or less than 30 hours per week in the absence of the

SSP supplement offer, and whether an individual would have continued to receive IA payments

in the absence of SSP. 12 By design, SSP pardcipants who work full-time rtiive                              a higher

income than they would under IA for a similar or lesser amount of work.                             Thus, standard

economic thary suggests that the SSP supplement will induce some pple                        who othemise would

have remained on IA and worked less than 30 hours per week to move from welfare to full-time

employment.        A similar prediction holds for pple            who othewise would be off IA and either

working part time or not at all. These predicted positive effects for non-workers and part-time

workers will be larger, the bigger the net income for a full-time job under SSP relative to net

income in the absence of the supplement, and the more that individuals value extra income versus

non-working time (i.e., the larger the compensated wage elasticity of labor supply).

        Individuals who would have worked full time in the absence of a supplement offer receive

a windfall from the SSP program. These ~ple                 can mive      a supplement without changing their

work hours, and some of them may be able to cut their hours and still remain eligible. Consider

first individuals in the “windfall group” who othemise would have been off IA. The supplement

offer provides them with higher net income, and also lowers their net wage, since once on SSP

each additional dollar of earnings reduces their supplement payment by 50 cents.                           For these

individuals, standard mnomic              theory predicts t!!at the supplement will reduce hours and

earnings. 13 By comparison,         for individuals who would have worked full time but remained on

IA, the effect of the SSP supplement is ambiguous because the supplement raises their net income



     ‘*All four of these “counterfactual” groups are present in the control group in later months of the demonstmtion.
     13This is the standard response to a negative income tax.

(reducing work incentives) but raises their net wage (possibly increasing work incentives).

         Overall, then, the ex~ted     impacts of the SSP program depend on three factors: the

fractions of individuals on and off 1A working full time or less than full time in the absence of

the program; the relative generosity of the program; and the willingness of individuals to

substitute non-working time for income.       The smaller the fraction of people who would be

ex~ted      to work full time in the absence of the program, the more likely the program is to

generate incr~s     in work effort (higher hours, earnings, and full-time employment rates). The

larger the fraction of people for whom SSP is a windfall, the smaller the predicted effects of the

program.     This reasoning suggests that the actual eff~t of the SSP program may vary over the

wurse of the demonstration, with potential y smaller effwts later in the demonstration,            when a

larger fmction of participants might have b~n ex~ted            to be working full time anyway.

      Another consideration that arises in predicting the impact of the SSP program is stigma.

Existing research suggests that many welfare participants have a strong distaste for “being on

welfare”: They resent the reporting requirements imposed by the system or feel ostracized by

friends and ~ial   contacts (Moffitt, 1983b). Since the SSP supplement does not depend on living

arrangements or on other family members’ incomes, and the program rquires               no contact with

case workers, some people may prefer to leave welfare and participate in SSP even if the

financial gain is relatively modest.     To the extent that individuals attach greater stigma to

continuing IA receipt than to SSP participation, one would ex~t          an Wi[ioml      positive effwt

of SSP on full-time employment, hours, and earnings.

        Sample members were contacted at home and informed that they had kn                        selected to

participate in a research project involving the possibility of a wage supplement. They were then

asked to sign an informed consent waiver granting access to various administrative r~ords

(including federal tax rmrds)        and to complete a baseline intemiew.           Roughly 90 percent of

sel=ted individuals agreed to participate, yielding a first cohort re-ch              sample of 2,122 (701

from New Brunswick and 1,421 from British Columbia). After signing the consent waiver and

completing the baseline interview, sample members were randomly assigned to either the control

group (1,056 individuals) or the program group (1,066 individuals).

        Data on the research sample are currently available from the baseline survey, IA

administrative rmrds,       SSP Program Management Information System records, and a survey

conducted at approximately 18 months after the date of random assignment. (Additional surveys

are scheduled for 36 and 54 months after the date of random assignment. ) The baseline survey

collected retrospective labor market information from the time of enrollment back until

approximately one year before enrollment. The 18-month survey collected similar retrospective

data from the time of the suney back to the date of enrollment.

        Unfortunately, not all individuals in the first cohort of the research sample could be located

or would agr= to participate in the 18-month survey. The overall response rate was 90 percent,

and was slightly higher in New Brunswick (92 percent) than in British Columbia (89 percent).

While high by conventional standards, the response rate was significantly lower for the SSP

program group (88 percent) than for the control group (92 ~rcent).               This difference introduces

a potential biw into comparison of outcomes betw~n the program group members and control



     14SSP intake was staggered over a two-yar period to ease program management and to allow a relatively small
staff to provide information sessions for wple members who were offered the wage supplement.

group members who rqnded            to the 18-month survey. Nevertheless, most of the analysis in

this paper is based on the subset of program and control group members who responded to the

18-month su~ey.      A formal analysis of the potential biases due to differential response rates is

presented in Section VII below. For simplicity, we refer to the subsample of individuals who

resWnded to the 18-month survey as the “18-month sample”. It consists of 1,910 individuals:

942 progxam group members and 968 control group members, with 1,264 individuals from

British Columbia and 646 from New Brunswick.



A.       Overview of the Provinti    Mr     Market Settings

         Before describing the SSP re=ch    wmples in more detail, it is useful to describe the labor

market context for the SSP evaluation. Table 1 summarizes some relevant information about the

British Columbia and New Brunswick economies, as well as the IA and SSP program parameters

in the two provinces.    British Columbia is the third largest province in Canada (population 2.9

million) while New Brunswick is much smaller (O.6 million); together, they comprise about 15

perant    of Canada’s total population.    In both provinces,   labor market conditions    improved

slightly over the 1992 to 1994 period, although unemployment rates remained at relatively high

levels. British Columbia had a higher employment-to-population ratio and a lower unemployment

rate than New Brunswick, but a higher proportion of families in poverty.         During the sample

period the minimum wage wu $1.00 higher in British Columbia than in New Brunswick ($6.00

versus $5 .OC)per hour). Average monthly earnings of full-time female workers were similarly

about 25 percent higher in British Columbia.

         Average IA benefit rates are about 30 percent more generous in British Columbia,

averaging $1,079 per month, versus $733 in New Brunswick.             The more generous welfare

system in British Columbia is one reason why the SSP break-even level was set higher there than

in New Brunswick.       Overall, however, the SSP program is potentially a bit more generous in

New Brunswick: For an individual working 30 hours per w~k at the minimum wage in both


                                                -11-
provinm,      gross earnings and SSP supplements are more than twice the average IA benefits in

New Brunswick, whereas the relative difference is somewhat smaller in British Columbia.



B.       The SSP Samples: Hptive          Statistics

         Table 2 wntains information on the characteristics of the 1,910 individuals in the 18-month

sample (that is, individuals in the first cohort of the SSP sample who responded to the 18-month

su~ey).     The data are taken mairdy from the baseline survey, although some information from

IA administrative records is also presented.             Column 1 of the table shows the average

characteristics of the full sample, while columns 2 and 3 show data separately by province.

Columns 4 and 5 show mm          chmcteristics    for mmple members in the program group (those

eligible for SSP subsidies) and for those in. tie control group (those not eligible for SSP

subsidies), Finally, column 6 presents the t-statistics associated with a test to determine whether

the mm      characteristics of the progmm group and control group are identical.’s

         The personal and family background characteristics in Table 2 suggest that the SSP target

group are mainly female, have relatively low levels of education, and grew up in families with

poorly-educated parents. A sizeable prcentage (35 to 45 percent) were raised by a single parent

or in some other non-traditional family mgement,             and many report that their own parents

received some form of welfare.      On average, =mple members have 1.5 children, and virtually

all need some child care serviees.

         The IA and work histories of the research sample are also informative.      Sample members

r~ived     IA payments in 30 of the last 36 months, on average, and about 60 percent had been

on IA continuously for over two years. The average IA benefit amount rmeived in the month

before random assignment was $655 in New Brunswick and $1,004 in British Columbia. These

amounts are about 10 pereent lower than the average statutory benefit rates for single parents



    ‘sAssuming random assignment ad ignoring non-response to the 18-month survey, the mm   of the program
group and the control group should k significantly different only by chance.

                                                  -12-
with the average number ofihildren     in the respective provinces (see Table 1), reflecting benefit

reductions for earnings and other factors.

      Almost all of the sample members report that they have worked for pay at some time in

the wt.   Indeed, the average number of years of paid employment is fairly high (6 to 8 years,

depending on the province).     Nevertheless, only about 20 permnt worked in the month before

random assignment, and the mean number of months worked in the 10 months prior to the

baseline is 2. Average sings        (among those who worked) are about $500 per month in New

Brunswick and $600 in British Columbia. The gap is consistent with other data showing roughly

20 percent higher wages in British Columbia than in New Brunswick.

      On the bwis of the information in Table 2, two primary conclusions can be drawn about

the SSP target population.    First, the target group -- single parents with a lengthy history of IA

receipt -- are mainly poorly educated women from disadvantaged family backgrounds. Normally,

such individuals would be ex~ted       to have low wages and intermittent employment histories.

Second, although most of the SSP population has held a job sometime in the pint, and many have

long work histories, their recent labor market attachment is relatively weak.       Thus, the SSP

population could be characteri~     as having relatively disadvantaged “permanent characteristics”

(such as education and family background) and relatively poor “transitory outcomes” (such as

low levels of work in the past year), This combination suggests that, in [he absence of the SSP

progrum, we might expect to see some mdesr improvement in labor market outcomes for many

of the sample members over the next few yms, but that members of the SSP target population

would be likely to exprience      low wages and intermittent employment rates.

IV.    Basic Impacts During the First 18 Months

A.     M-1ogy

       Although a full a=sment        of the SSP program will require information from art extended

follow-up period, several features of the SSP design make it useful to examine impacts at 18

months.    Eligibility for the SSP supplement is contingent on initiating a supplement payment

within one year after enrollment.        Thereafter, participants can move in and out of full-time

employment and continue to qualify for supplement payments whenever they meet the hours

requirements of the program.         These rules establish a strong incentive for program group

members to find full-time employment by the twelfth month of the experiment, and suggest that

any impacts observed near the end of the eligibility period may be close to an upper bound for

later impacts on full-time employment.        If the main effect of SSP is to speed the transition from

welfare to work for those who eventually would find full-time employment anyway, then the

program impacts will tend to dissipate over time as control group members “catch up. ” On the

other hand, if those receiving the SSP supplement stay employed longer than they would have

in the absence of the program, the impacts could grow over time. The expectation is that the

main effect of SSP will be to s@         the transition from welfare to work, so the impacts should

dissipate somewhat over time.

       For purposes of this paper, information collected in the baseline interview artd 18-mortth

survey is used to determine labor market status on a month-by-month basis from 10 months

before program enrollment to 17 months after enrollment. ‘b Information is presented on five

labor market outcomes: total monthly earnings; monthly hours of work; an indicator for any

employment during the month (monthly hours of work greater than zero); an indicator for any

full-time employment during the month; and an indicator for any part-time employment during

the month. Sin~ SSP eligibility is predicated on working at lmt 30 hours per week, full-time

employment is defined = working more than 130 hours in a month (30 hours per w=k times

4.33 weeh per calendar month), and part-time employment is defined as working 1 to 129 hours

in a month. ”

       Data from IA and SSP administrative                 records are used to measure four program

participation outmmes: an indicator for being on IA (receiving an IA payment during the month);

average monthly IA payments; an indicator for being on ei[her IA or SSP; and the sum of

average monthly LA and SSP supplement payments.                         Since these data are taken from

administrative ~rds,          information is available for a slightly longer time frame — up to 23

months after mdom assignment.

       The data are summarid            in two ways. First, a series of graphs shows average monthly

outmmes for the program group and the control group, along with a monthly impact estimate.

This estimate is simply the difference in average outcomes betw=n the program group and the

control group. Given the randomized design, this impact estimate should be a valid indicator of

the program’s effect. Also shown as a test of the random assignment procedure are the outcomes

and estimated impacts for the 10 months before baseline.                   Under     random assignment the

program impacts in the months before baseline should be close to zero, and statistically

significant only by chance.

       In addition to the graphs of monthly outcomes, a table is presented showing employment

and welfare outmmes based on quarterly averages of the monthly outcomes from the first quarter

before baseline to the sixth quarter after the baseline. This table presents both unadjusted impact

estimates and adjusted estimates based on regression models that include 18 baseline covariates

and a dummy variable indicating membership in the program group. 18 Because of the

randoti        design, adjusting for the effwts of baseline covtiates          is not necessary to obtain valid

program estimates. However, the adjustment typically improves the precision of the estimated

impacts.

        All the outwmes and impact estimates reportd in this wtion are based on the subsample

of individuals who responded to the 18-month survey (that is, the sample described in Table 2).

As we show in Section V~, below, an analysis of response patterns to the 18-month survey

suggests that non-response biases may lead to a slight overstatement of the SSP impacts in this

subsample. These ptenti           biases should be kept in mind.



B,      Program T-up

        Before presenting the impact estimates. it is instructive to describe the extent of SSP

participation among the 942 program group members eligible for the supplement. ‘g Program

tti-q      is not the same as program imps.cl bmause some program group members are “windfall”

beneficiaries -- that is, they would have worked full time in the absence of SSP and for them the

SSP supplement is simply a windfall. Indeed, the difference between the program take-up rate

and the actual experimental impact on the full-time employment rate is an estimate of the size

of the windfall group.

        Figure 4 shows the fraction of the program group receiving SSP supplement payments

during each of the first 23 months of the program. The participation rate grows steadily for the

first 15 months, reaching a peak of 25 ~rcent by month 15. Thereafter, it drops off slightly and

whether the ~ndent      lived in subsidi~ housing at baseline; two dummy variabl= for the pr=nce of physical
or emotional problems at baseline; du~y variables for First Nation ancestr-y, European or Canadian ancestry, and

used as one of the re~ion     control variablw.
     19A more extended discussion of progmm take-up is presented in Mijanovich and brig, 1995.

muld be =ived           as late as month 14, the drop-off after month 15 reflects job losses among

those who had earlier qualified for the supplement.

       We emphasiu that the 25 percent take-up rate of the program group represents an upward

boti       on SSP’S behavioral impact on full-time employment.                Only if there are no windfall

recipients is the behavioral impact on the full-time employment rate equal to the program take-up

rate. To measure the true experimental effect we rely on the experimental design: under random

assignment the experiences of the control group provide a valid counterfactua.1 for the program

group’s behavior in the absenw of SSP. Thus differences betw=n the observed outcomes of the

program and control groups maure            the behavioral impact of the SSP subsidy. In the remainder

of this ~tion         we examine these impacts on. a variety of labor market and program-related

outcomes.



c.     Unadjusted Monthly Impacts

       Figures 5 to 9 show the average monthly labor market outcomes for the program and

control groups, along with the estimated SSP impacts in each month. Figures 10 to 13 present

similar data for welfare-related outcomes. For referenw, a vertical line in each graph separates

the pre-baseline period from the post-baseline period. As noted earlier, if random assignment

wu successful, the program group and conwol group outcomes should coincide during the pre-

baseline    period.     Inspection   of the figures shows that, with the exception of the part-time

employment rate, the two groups’ outcomes were virtually identical during the pre-baseline

period.zo

       A cursory look at the figures reveals another striking pattern. With the exception of the

part-time employment rate, all of the labor market outcomes show discrete jumps between month


    201”hepart-timeemploymnt rate differenw are shtistically significant in 4 of the 12 months before b-line,
while the overatl employment rate differences are not statistically significant in any month before baseline. Lothe
month just before baseline, neither outcome’s difference is statistically significant.

                                                       -17-
-1 and month 1. For example, in Figure 5, average monthly earnings of the control group rise

about $50, while those of the program group rise about $70. The jumps in the labor outcomes

around the baseline are much larger than the changes betw=n any other pair of months, and are

not reflected by a corresponding jump in IA participation.     We suspect that the jumps are due

to a “seam problem” arising from the fact that labor market data for month -1 are taken from the

baseline suwey, wherm       labor market data for month 1 are taken from the 18-month sumey.

      To investigate the reasons for the “jump” in employment and earnings around the baseline

period more fully, we calculated the number of new jobs starting in each month. This exercise

revealed an unusually large number of new jobs coded as starting in month 1. There are two

explanations for this phenomenon.     One is that respondents were more likely to repofi “under-

the-table” jobs in the 18-month suney than in the baseline survey, leading to apparent job starts

in month 1 for jobs that were really held at baseline.         Another is that recall errors, in

combination with particular features of the 18-month computer-assisted intemiew program, led

to measured job starts in month 1 for jobs that actually started somewhat later. Since there is

no evidence of a larger (or smaller) j ump for progm     group members relative to control group

members,   however, we believe that the impact estimates are la.rgel y unaffected by this apparent

seam problem.

      The patterns for the control group in Figures 5 to 8 reveal a more-or-less steady trend

toward greater labor market activity in tie months following baseline.       This trend is clearly

accelerated among the program group.          The earnings impacts (Figure 5) are statistically

significant from months 5 through 17 and incrmse gradually from about $40 in month 5 to a

peak of about $140 in month 14. This is a sizeable impact (roughly 60 percent) relative to mean

earnings of the control group in the same month. During the last thrm months of the observation

window,    the earnings   of the program   group dip slightly, while those of the control group

continue to rise, implying a d=line in the estimated program impact to around $100 per month

in month 17 (or roughly a 40 percent program-control group difference). Because eligibility for


                                               -18-
the SSP supplement ended at month 12, the employment impacts betw~n months 10 and 14 may

be the largest impacts that will uur     during the demonstration period.

      Hours of work follow a pattern similar to earnings.       The hours impacts (Figure 6) are

statistically significant in months 5 through 17, and rise gradually from around 6 hours per

month in month 5 to21 hours in month 14. Again, this is a sizeable impact (about a 70 percent

increase) mmpared to the mean hours of the control group. As with earnings, average hours of

work of the program group fall off after month 14, while hours of work of the wntrol group

rise, leading to a 15-hour differenw by month 17. If the earnings impacts are divided by the

corresponding hours impacts, the mtio tends to fall between $6.50 and $7.00. This suggests that

program group members we taking fairly low-paying jobs – only $1.00 to $2.00 per hour above

the minimum wage. In Section VI, below, more detailed information is presented on the wage

effects of the SSP program.

      The overall employment rate (Figure 7) follows a pattern similar to earnings and hours.

The employment impacts are statistidly     significant from months 6 through 17 and rise gradually

to a peak impact of 14 percentage points in month 14 before falling slightly.         As shown in

Figures 8 and 9, almost all of this impact is accounted for by a rise in full-time employment and

a drop in non-employment.      Although simple economic models suggest that the SSP program

might reduce part-time work, this is not the case for the definition of part-time work depicted

in Figure 9. Other classifications of full- and part-time work based on a less stringent hours

criterion show a slightly more negative impact on part-time employment.

      A comparison of SSP take-up rate among the program group with the experimental impact

on the full-time employment rate (i.e., figure 4 versus figure 8) suggests that a sizeable fraction

of SSP participants are “windfalls”. For example, the impact estimate in month 15 is 15 percent

while the take-up rate is 25 percent, implying that 10 percent of the program group received

windfall benefits from SSP. Thus, roughly thr~-fifths of SSP pticipants      in the progmm group

were responding to the financial incentive, while about two-fifths would have worked full time


                                                -19-
anyway.

       In light of the 30hour-per-w=k             threshold imposed by the SSP eligibility rules, it is

interesting to ask whether there is a “clustering” of hours among SSP participants at aacf~                     the

minimum level required for eligibility. 21 Throughout the entire post-baseline period, 21 percent

of program group members who were employed full time (i. e., working at least 130 hours per

month) averaged exactly 30 hours of work per week, compard to 13 percent of full-time control

group members. *        An additioti      18 prcent     of program group members who were employed

full-time worked exactly 35 hours ~r week, compared to 12 percent of control group members.

Overall, some W percent of program group members who were employed full time worked less

than 40 hours per w=k,           while only 45 percent of the control group members who were

employed full time worked less than 40 hours per w=k.                   Thus, there is some indication that

program group members are clustering at or near the 30-hour threshold, but a substantial number

are also working more.

       As shown in Figures 10 and 11, the impacts of the SSP program on IA receipt and average

IA payments mirror the impacts on employment. u                   From months 4 through 17, average IA

payments and the IA receipt rate decline faster for program group members than for control

group members.        By month 17, the average IA payment for program group members is about

$130 less thm the average IA payment for control group members. ner~fter,                          the difference

closes slightly. The per~ntage of progmm group members who have left IA reaches a peak of

about 33 percent in month 17, and then levels off betwmn months 18 and 23. By comparison,

the percentage of the control group who have left IA follows a fairly steady upward trend. Thus,



    21An analysis of federal and provincial tax and transfer program interactions with the SSP program suggests that
a substantial fraction of program group members face very high marginal tax rates when they work more than 30
hom per week. If individuals can freely choose their hours of work, this should lti to a con=ntration of hours
at exaetly the minimum eligibility level.
    22Note that such conditional comparisons must be interpreted very carefully, and are not in general valid
estimatea of the cauaat effect of the SSP program.
    ‘Note W the IA status variable in Figure 11 is defined in teti             of not receiving IA to permit aier
comparison with the employment outcome-a.

                                                       -20-
SSP’S impact on IA r=ipiency peaks in month 15, and falls back to about 10 percentage points

by months 21 to 23. Because labor market information is not yet available beyond month 17,

we cannot determine whether the employ ment-relatd         impacts exhibit a parallel decline after

month 18.

      Our fti     program impact wncems the sum of IA benefits and SSP supplement payments.

This mmbined outcome is of interest for at least two reasons. First, the sum of IA benefits and

SSP payments provides useful information about the overall cost of the SSP program.             An

important question for the viability of SSP is whether the savings in welfare benefits generated

by the program are offset by the costs of the supplement,       Second, a comparison of the SSP

impact on receipt of IA and its impact on the r~eipt of LA plus SSP provides another measure

of the relative size of the windfall group. In tie absence of any windfalls, the number of pple

who take up SSP will be qua.1 to the number who are induced to l=ve IA, and the fraction of

people who r~ive      either IA or SSP in the program group will equal the fraction who receive

IA in the control group. If some supplement rmipients would have moved off IA anyway, then

tie fraction who r=eive either IA or SSP in the program group will exc~           the fraction who

receive IA in the control group.

      As shown in Figure 12, the sum of average IA and SSP payments for the program group

is higher than average IA payments for the control group throughout the first 23 months of the

experiment.     Moreover, the percentage of people receiving IA or SSP in the program group is

consistently higher than the percentage on IA in the control group (Figure 13). These findings

suggest that a si.zeable percentage of people (roughly 10 percent by month 20) receive supplement

payments under SSP, but would have moved off IA even in the absence of the program.

Supplement payments for this windfall group add to the costs of SSP without any corresponding

reduction in IA benefits. Consequently, by the second year of the experiment, average costs for

IA and SSP benefits in the program group are $80 to $100 dollars per month higher than the

average cost for IA benefits alone in the control group.     A good portion (but not all) of these


                                               -21-
higher average rests are windfall benefits.

         It is worth noting that tie mmbination of higher earnings and higher combined IA and SSP

payments among the program group imply substantially higher gross incomes than in the control

group.     For example, in month 15, members of the program group had about $235 more in

monthly earnings and SSP/IA payments than members of the control group. This is a substantial

relative gain — roughly 23 percent of mean total earnings and IA benefits for the control group.

Thus, by month 15, SSP was having a substantial anti-poverty effwt.



D.       Unadjusted and Adjwti        Quarterly Im~ts

         We turn now to a brief overview of the quarterly program impacts, and a comparison of

the unadjusted and adjusted impacts. Table 3 (panels A to I) presents quarterly averages of the

labor market and welfare-related outcomes of the control and program groups, along wifi

unadjusted and adjusted qua.rterly impacts. 24 The first thing to note about these results is the

similarity behveen the unadjusted artd adjusted impacs. The regression adjustments lead to some

modest increase in the precision of the impact estimates (lower standard errors), but have little

or no effect on the estimates themselves (with one exception noted below). A wend                      thing to

note is that none of the unadjusted impacts in the quarter before random assignment (quarter -1)

are statistically significant. x In fact, in only one c-         does the unadjusted impact in quarter -

1 exceed its standard error.

         The unadjusted and adjusted employment, earnings, and hours impacts (panels A to C) all

@in       quarter 5 (months 13 to 15) and are statistically significant at the 5 percent level from

quarters 3 to 6. The maximum employment impact is 12 to 13 percentage points (about 40

percent of the control group mean), the maximum monthly earnings impact is $137, and the

maximum hours impact is 20 hours per month. The impacts on full-time employment (panel D)


    2%e quarterly outim     are simple averages of the underlying monthty figures, expressed as a monthly rate.
    ‘Adjusted impacts for quarter -1 are not computed kause one of tie covariatfi is the quarter -1 value of the
dependent variable.

                                                     -22-
are virtually identical to the impacts on overall employment, but are much larger as a percentage

of the control group outcome.       For example, the full-time employment impact in quarter 5 is

about 13 percentage points (or just over 100 prcent) of the control group mm         for the quarter.

         Although the unadjusted impacfi on part-time employment (panel E) are generally small

and statistically insignificant, the adjusted impacts are uniformly negative and are actually

statistically significant in quarters 2 and 6.     Here, adjustment for the effects of covariates

(mainly, the part-time indicator for the pre-baseline quarter) makes a slight difference with

res~t     to inferences about tie effect of the SSP program.

         As suggested by Figure 11, the estimated impact of SSP on the IA r~eipt rate rises

throughout the first year and a half of the experiment (see panel F of Table 3), reaching close

to 14 percentage points by qtier     6. Similarly, the impact on the average amount of IA benefits

r=ived      (see panel G) rises steadily, ending with a net impact of $135 (or 18 percent of the

control group mean). Nevertheless, the presence of individuals who rmeive SSP but would have

moved off IA anyway results in a total combined r=ipt         rate for IA and SSP that is actually 9

to 10 Perwntage points higher in the program group than in the control group (in panel H). The

estimated adjusted impacts on average IA and SSP costs (panel I) are $66 to $90 per month in

quarters 4 to 6 of the experiment.



v.       Variation in the Impacts of SSP by Program Generosity

A.       M~        of SSP Generosity

         Even though the SSP demonstration is built around a single treatment, there are substantial

differences in the “generosity” of the SSP program across individuals in the research sample.

This variation arises for several reasons. First, individuals with higher wages receive lower SSP

benefits for the same amount of work (although their total income is higher). For example, an

individual in British Columbia working 30 hours per week at the minimum wage of $6.00 per

hour receives a monthly subsidy of $1,156 (with total monthly income of $ 1,935), whereas an


                                                 -23-
individual who earns $10.00 per hour rweives a monthly subsidy of $899 (with total monthly

income of $2,198). Second, buse               of different SSP target earnings levels in the two provinces,

two individuals with the same wage will receive a higher supplement in British Columbia than

in New Brunswick. Third, the generosity of the SSP program relarive to IA varies across single

parents because of variation in IA benefit rates by province and family size. Sin& most people

would be on IA in the absence of the SSP supplement offer, the difference in net incomes

betwen SSP and IA is a key determinant of behavioral responses to the program.                          Finally, the

relative generosity of SSP depends on individual-s~ific                  circumstan~s,      such as child support

payments and non-wage income sources.2s

        To assess the degree of variation in the generosity of the SSP supplement, we calculated

two measures of relative generosity. The first& based on a simple comparison between the total

earnings and supplement payments that an individual would receive working 30 hours per week

on SSP, versus the maximum monthly IA payment @ased on family size and province of

residence) that art individual would r~eive if not working. This measure makes no adjustments

for provincial or federal taxes or child tax credits, or for differences in other transfers that would

arise by moving off IA.          The ~ond,        more sophisticated measure is based on the estimated

differen~    in net inmmes between working 30 hours per wmk on the SSP program and working

30 hours per week on IA.             This measure takes into account the differences in federal and

provincial taxes, refundable child tax credits, and child care subsidies, using detailed tax tables

and individual-s~ific       information on family size, alimony and child support payments, arid other

income sources.        For simplicity, the ~ond           measure is estimated under the assumption that

British Columbia sample members would receive the standard earnings disregard ($200 per




     261Abenefits are reduced dollar-fordollar by child support payments and by income from other family memkm,
whereas SSP ttenefits are inde~ndent of non-wage income or the incomes of other family members. Another source
of ptential variation in relative generosity ariw for people living in social housing, for which rent formulas exclude
IA inmrne but include eurnings and SSP hcome. For the sample and time period analyd in this paper, however,
SSP subsidies were excluded from the calculation of social housing rent.

month) if on IA.*’

       Both generosity mmures rquire an estimate of the gross hourly wage for individuals in

the research sample,        Observed wages for sample members who worked in the pre-baseline

period (months -1 to -12) were used to estimate a standard human capital wage equation.                      We

employed a standard tw~step selection prtiure                to account for possible non-randomness in the

subset of pre-baseline workers.        Predicted wages were then assigned to all program group and

control group members, with the minimum wage assigned for anyone whose predicted wage was

below the provincial minimum wage.2*

       Table 4 presents an overview of the alternative generosity measures. An initial analysis

revealed that much of the systematic variation in either generosity measure is accounted for by

only two factors: the provin~ of residence, and whether an individual has one or more than one

dependent chi.ld.29 Based on this fact, data ‘are presented for the four province/family size

subgroups shown across the columns of the table. Note that the groups based on family size

within each province are about qual in numbers (~                the last row of the table).

       Rows 1 and 2 of Table 4 show average predicted wages for each province/family size

subgroup, and the fraction of wage predictions within $1.00 of the provincial minimum wage.

Predicted wages in New Brunswick are about 25 percent lower than in British Columbia, and are

more highly con~ntrated        just above tie minimum wage,            Row 3 shows the fraction of ach

group who were working at baseline. This is fairly similar across subgroups, although sample

members in New Brunswick with one child have a slightly higher baseline employment rate than

the other groups.

       Rows 4 through 7 present information on the simple generosity measure, which compares

gross pay on SSP at 30 hours of work per week to the statutory IA benefit, assuming zero hours

of work.     A mmparison across subgroups revds          that while IA benefits are higher for larger

families (especially in British Columbia), predicted earnings and SSP supplements are about the

same. Thus, the relufive generosity of the SSP program is smallest for larger families in British

Columbia.     In absolute terms, SSP is most generous for families with one child in British

Columbia.     If generosity is expressed as a fraction of the basic IA benefit level, however (as in

row 7), SSP is most generous for small families in New Brunswick.

       Rows 8 to 10 present similar information using the more complex generosity measure

based on net (that is, after tax and transfer) income comparisons at 30 hours per week.

Consideration of taxes and transfers leads to a notable reduclion in the apparent generosity of the

SSP program across family siu categories, mainly because of the higher transfers and tax credits

available on IA.30 Nevertheless, the ranking of relative generosity across the four family

sire/province subgroups is similar: SSP is least generous for single parents with two or more

dependents in British Columbia, and most generous for single parents in New Brunswick with

one child.



B.     Variation in SSP Impacts

       In light of the variation in relative generosity of the SSP program by province and family

size, and the theoretical prediction from simple labor supply models that the SSP impact should

vary by the relative generosity of the program, it is interesting to compare SSP impacts across

provinces and within provinces between individuals       with larger and smzdler families. As a first

step in this comparison, statistical tests were performed to determine whether the SSP impacts

on the outcomes analyzed in Table 3 were different for British Columbia and New Brunswick.

In no case were the differenws statistically significant, although the labor market outcomes



   3%ven ~unting for taxes and transfers, SSP yields a higher net income than IA (at 30 hours of work per
week) for all but a handful of individuals with very large families in British Columbia.

exhibit somewhat different patterns over time for program and control group members in the two

provinus.     Specifically, whereas earnings of the British Columbia control group rise steadily

from baseline, earnings of the New Brunswick control group show a pronounced “dip” betw=n

months 7 and 14, One explanation for this pattern is the highly seasonal nature of employment

in this province. 31 Among the program group in New Brunswick, however, there was no

evidence of such a dip, suggesting that the program group may have taken more stable jobs to

ensure continuing supplement eligibility.

       Although average SSP impacts are not very different between British Columbia and New

Brunswick, a closer lcx)k at the differences by family size in the two provinces reveals an

interesting pattern.    Table 5 summarizes the average monthly labor market impacts by quarter

for the four family size/provinu         subgroups.     For simplicity’s sake, only unadjusted program

impacts for three key outcomes are reported: average hours of work, average earnings, and the

overall employment rate. 32 Despite the fact that SSP is least generous for individuals in British

Columbia with larger families, the data in Table 5 suggest that the program had its largest impact

on this subgroup, Indeed, the earnings, hours, and employment impacts in quarters 5 and 6 for

single parents with two or more dependent children in British Columbia are roughly fwice u.s

large as the comesponding impacts for any other subgroup.33 While not shown in the table,

the larger labor market impacts for this subgroup are partially reflectd                     in lower welfare

participation rates. In quarter 6, the (unadjusted) difference in the percentage on IA betw=n the

program group and the control group is -19. I prcent for the British Columbia subgroup with

province/family sim subgroup were also checked to determine whether they differed in the pre-baseline quarter: In
all ~,     differen-   are small and statistically insignificant.
     33Formal twta of the hypotheis tit the SSP labor market impacts are the same for larger British Columbia
families as for all other subgroups are rejected at the 5 percent level for quatiers 5 and 6.

two or more children, versus an average impact of -13.8 perunt (~               Table 3, panel F) .34

        In light of the relatively small sample sizes in the first cohort of the SSP research sample,

it is difficult to rach any strong conclusions about the variation in program impacts across

subgroups.    By the same token, the SSP demonstration was not explicitly designed to test the

effects of different generosity levels, and the variation in generosity indud         by family size and

inkrprovincial   differen~s    is limited.   Nevertheless, we tentatively conclude that there is no

strong relationship between simple measures of program generosity and the magnitude of the

prog-      impacts. If anything, the program resprtses seem to be largest for British Columbia

parents with more children, a group for whom tie SSP program is relatively less generous than

conventional IA. It will be interesting to see whether these conclusions continue to hold over

longer time frames, and for the entire SSP sample.



VI.     Measurin g Wage Outimes        A~           with SSP

        Having measured significant employment responses to the SSP incentive, it is interesting

to try to characterize the wages of the “net jobs” generated by the program.                Conventional

models of the work-welfare decision suggest hat these net jobs should be disproportionately

drawn from the low end of the wage distribution.          According to these models, individuals who

fa~ relatively low-wage opportunities are further from the margin betwmn working and staying

on welfare, and are less likely to work in the absence of a supplement.                 By comparison,

individuals with better wage opportunities might be expected to leave IA even without the SSP

supplement: For them, the SSP program is more likely to serve as a windfall.                   Empirical

confirmation of these predictions would provide some evidence that low wages are a prim~

reason for continuing welfare participation.         It is also interesting to ask whether program

participants who are indud      to work by the SSP supplement will move up the wage distribution



     3%e differen~ in the impact of SSP on larger British Columbia families versus its overall impact on 1A
participation in quarter 6 is just significant at the 5 percent level.

u   they ~umulate          work experiena.          With the limited data currently            available, only a

preliminary look can be taken at this important question.                In subquent       research, data will be

used over a longer time frame to study the extent of wage progression among supplement takers.

        Table 6 presents a variety of comparative information on the distributions of wages among

the program group and the control group. To handle interprovincial wage differences using the

pooled sample, wages are normalized relative to the minimum wage in the appropriate province.

For example, a wage of $6.50 is $1.50 above the minimum wage of $5.00 in New Brunswick,

but only $.50 above the minimum wage of $6.00 in British Columbia.                         Using this approach,

wage outwmes were divided into six categories: missing wage; 35less than the minimum wage;

up to $.99 above the minimum wage; $1.00 to $1.99 above the minimum wage; $2.00 to $2.99

above the minimum wage; and more than $3.00 above the minimum wage. The resulting wage

distributions for month 13 (that is, the first month after the close of the eligibility period for

program group members to initiate a supplement) and month 17 (the last month for which data

are available) are shown in Table 6.

        The first row of each panel shows the percentages of individuals in the program group and

control group who were not working. In the overall sample, 58.8 percent of the program group

were not working in month 13, comptied with 72.4 percent of the control group. The difference

–   13.6 percentage points + is the unadjusted program impact on the employment rate. The

remaining rows of the table pertain to s~ific                  wage intervals, including the missing wage

category (row 2). A comparison of columns 1 and 2 shows the “excess fraction” of jobs for the

progmm group in a particular          wage interval. 36 For example, in month 13, 13.9 percent of the

program    group held a job that paid up to $.99 above the minimum wage ($6.00 in British

Columbia and $5.00 in New Brunswick), compared with 5.8 percent of the control group. The

difference (8. 1 prcentage points) is an estimate of the SSP program effect on the percentage of

jobs with wmpensation that cannd be easily converted to an hourly wage.
    36Note that fractions in each wage internal reflect all individuals, not just those who held a job.

pple     who held a minimum-wage-t&$ .99-above-the-minimum wage range in month 13.

        By construction, the sum of the differences in each wage internal betw~n the program

group and the mntrol group is equal to the overall difference in employment rates between the

groups. Dividing the difference in the percentage employed in a pardcular wage intenal by the

overall difference in employment rates therefore gives the fraction of “net jobs” created by the

SSP supplement in that wage internal.              For example, in month 13, jobs in the minimum-to-

minimum-plus-$.99         range internal accounted for 8.1 percentage points of the total 13.6

percentage point increase in employment, or 59.6 percent of the net jobs.                           Following this

procedure, the distribution of net jobs was constructed across all the wage intervals, as shown

in column 3 of Table 6.37 Note that there cart be a negative entry in this column if a smaller

fraction of program group members than control group members hold jobs in a given wage

interval. This may happen if the SSP supplement induces some people who would have held a

job in a particular wage intema.1 to find a job in a different wage interval.                        For example,

someone in New Brunswick may forgo a relatively high-wage job in the fishing industry for a

steadier low-wage job in the se~ice industry, to ensure her continuing eligibility for SSP.

        If the SSP program generates jobs that are “just like” those held by workers in the control

group, then the distribution in column 3 will be qual to the conditional distribution of wages for

workers in the control group. On the other hand, if the SSP program induces some pple                           with

relatively low-wage opportunities to find jobs, then the distribution in column 3 will have more

jobs in low-wage intervals than the distribution of wages for working controls. Column 4 gives

the difference between the fraction of net jobs attributable to SSP in a particular wage interval

(that is, column 3) and the fraction of control group jobs in the same interval (that is, the entry

in column 2 divided by the fraction of control group members with a job).



    37Formatly, la f ~ repwnt the fraction of the entire control ~mple in wage interval j (including non-workers).
Similarly, la f! represent the fraction of the program group in interval j. Finally, let f 5 and f ~ represent the
non-working titions of the control group and program group. Then the fraction of net jobs attributable to jobs in
wage inteIvat j is ( f! - f;) / ( f~ - ft ). Standard errors for this fraction can be constructed by the delta method.

                                                        -30-
       The resulfi for month 13 suggest that about 60 percent of the net jobs attributable to SSP

paid within $.S9 per hour of the minimum wage, and another 30 percent paid from $1.00 to

$1.99 per hour above the minimum wage.            These wages are relatively low compared to the

distribution of wages for control group members who were working in the same monti, of whom

36 percent were earning at lat      $3.00 per hour above the minimum wage.3* Consistent with

the predictions horn simple mrtomic       models of welfare participation, it seems that individuals

who are induced to move off IA and into employment by the SSP supplement tend to be those

with relatively low-wage opportunities.

       There is no evidence of a program effwt on the probability of holding a job that pays less

than the minimum wage, which is r~ssunng          since individuals holding jobs below the minimum

wage are ineligible for a supplement.       However, the SSP program seems to lead to a modest

reduction in the fraction of individuals with a missing wage. One explartation for this apparent

effect on missing-wage jobs is that SSP eligibility rules lead some workers who would otherwise

work in casual or pi~-rate    jobs with compensation that cannot be easily converted to an hourly

wage to find jobs for which hourly wages can be easily calculated. Similarly, it is possible that

the SSP supplement I=ds program group members to choose lower-wagejobs — perhaps because

higher-wage jobs have less predictable hours. In any case, the sampling errors for the percentage

of net jobs in the missing-wage category are relatively large, so any apparent shortage of such

jobs among the program group must be interpreted cautiously.

       The wage distributions for month 17 (the last month for which labor market data are

available) are fairly similar to the distributions for month 13. In comparing these distributions,

it must be kept in mind that while the net employment impact of SSP in month 13 was 13.6




    3%s   co-     from dividing the 10.0 percent of control group mernbrs earning $3.00 or more above the
minimum wage by the Pe=ntage of working control group members (27,6 percent), yielding 36.2 percent of
working mnt rol group membrs ting      at least $3.00 above the minimum wage.

                                                  -31-
perunt,   the net impact in month 17 was only 7.5 Wrcent.                A smaller fraction of the progmm

group was working in month 17 than in month 13, whereas a slightly larger fraction of the

control group was worting in the later month. Although it is possible that these changes might

have caused a rightwa.rd shift in the distribution of wages for the net jobs attributable to the SSP

program, this does not ap~           to be the case.39 There is certainly no evidenm of relative wage

progression in the program group between months 13 and 17,                       Of course, the four-monti

difference is probably fm too short to measure any reasonable degr~ of wage progression.w

        Two main conclusions can be drawn from these analyses.                 First, wages for the jobs tiat

can be attributed to the SSP supplement tend to be clusterd                   near the bottom of the wage

distribution.     This pattern is consistent with conventional economic models of welfare

participation that suggest that many individuals rationally chmse to receive IA rather than work

because their wage opportunities are relatively constrained.             Second, based on the very limited

comparison of months 13 and 17 after random assignment, no evidence is found that the

distribution of wages for the net jobs attributable to the SSP program has shifted upward over

time.



VII.    Evrdtig      the ~ti      of Non-Response to the 18-Month Survey

        Up to this point our analyses have kn              conducted on the subset of the SSP research

sample who completed the 18-month sumey.                As noted earlier, about 10 percent of the sample

either could not be located or refused to respond to the sumey. Although no survey-based data

are available for the non-respondents, IA and SSP administrative r=ords allow comparisons

between pple       who responded to the 18-month survey and those who did not. In this section,


    391flarger SSP employment impacta are generated by drawing more low-wage workers into employment, then
the net jobs attributable to the progm” will have lower wages in periods with a larger employment impact. On the
other hand, the additiod control group rnembem employed in month 17 might have had higher-than-average wages,
so that month 17 has both a smaller impact and a greater percentage of net jobs in the low-wage internals.
    %-        on wnventiod       ~timates of human capital earnings functions, one might expect onty a 2 to 5
pe~tage     point inc~      in wagm for each year of experienw in the labor market, or less than a percentage point

the patterns of non-response are described and an attempt is made to evaluate the effects of non-

response bias on the estimates of the SSP program impacts.



A.     Analyti of R~nse          Rates

       Table 7 shows the per~ntages of individuals in the first cohort of the SSP research sample

who completed the 18-month suwey, by research group, by province, and by whether the

individual was r~iving        IA payments in month 18.41 Row 1 of the table contains response

rates for the overall sample and for the control and program groups. As shown in mlumn 4, the

control group had a 3.3 per=rttage point higher response rate, and this difference is statistically

significant at mnverttional    levels.   Response rates were slighdy higher in New Brunswick than

in British Columbia     (see rows 2 and 3), although the difference in response rates between the

program group and the control group was very similar in the two provinces.

       Different response rates for the progmm group and the control group do not necessarily

imply any bim in the comparison of outcomes betwwn respondents in the two groups. IndA,

if respc)nse probabilities were constant within groups and independent of other characteristics,

then the differences in measured outcomes of tie survey respondents would provide unbiased

estimates of the true program effect. As shown in rows 4 to 6 of Table 7, however, response

rates within the program and control groups vary by 1A status at the time of the suwey.               Within

the control group, IA raipients      at month 18 were more likely than non-recipients to respond to

the survey. Within the program group, however, 1A rmipients and non-recipients had about the

same response rates. Since IA r-ipients        are over-represented among controls in the respondent

sub=mple, but not among the program group in the respondent subsample, the gap in IA receipt

rates betw=n the program and control groups in the respondent subsample overstates the true




    41Note that IA and SSP administrative &ta are used for both r~pondents and non-respondents to the 18-month
survey. The Hits in Table 7 are very similar if res~nse rates are compati by IA status in any particular month
ktween 15 md 20 months after random assignment.

                                                    -33-
difference for the entire sample.42

       The higher response rate for IA recipients over non-recipients in the control group could

be due to a number of factors, including: (1) Some non-IA r~ipients may have moved out of

provinm, whereas IA r~ipients are all in-province; (2) IA recipients are less likely that to have

undergone a change in their living arrangements or labor market status, making it less likely that

they have changed addresses within province; (3) non-IA recipients may feel less obligation to

respond to a survey than those who are still receiving LA. In principle, all of these factors should

have a similar effect on relative respnse        rates in the program group. On the other hand, two

other considerations may depress the relative response rate of IA rwipients in the program group.

First, since the SSP supplement moves some people from welfare to work, those who remain on

IA may be disproportionately unresponsive to the request for information (a “selection” effect).

S=ond, because individuals in the program group were repeatedly contacted with information

about the supplement, those who remained on IA may have become tired of defending their

choice (a “harassment” effect) .43

       While it is difficult to precisely measure the relative contributions of the selection and

hmsment       effects, a lower bound on the harassment effwt can be calculated by assuming full

response among the Selwt group leaving IA for SSP. In other words, suppose that all the people

in the program group who were moved off IA by the SSP program would have responded to the

18-month suwey.       Based on the IA receipt rate in the control group, this would account for an




    42Formally, la p(IA IC) and p(IA IE) represent the probability of IA receipt among the control and program
groups. The tme experimental impact on IA receipt is p(IA ~E) - p(IA IC), Let R denote the event of ~ponding to
the 18-month survey. Then the ~ed          impact in the respondent subaample is
             p(IA~ R,E) - p(IA~R,C) = p(IAl E)~(R~ IA, E)/p(R~ E) - p(IAl C)~(Rl IA, C)/p(R~ C).
Sin= response rat= for IA recipienk and non-mipients                are about quat in the program group,
p(R IIA, E)/p(R IE) = 1, while p(R IIA, C)/p(R ~C) > 1, implying a downward bias (that is, a larger negative
YE)        in P(MI R,E) - P(IAI R,C) relative to p(IAIE) - p(IA~C).
    43Alternatively, some program group members who tried unsuccessfully to find full-time employment may have
become so di~uraged that they refused to be interviewed.

                                                     -34-
additional 124 respondents on IA in the program group,” implying an overall response rate of

90.2 per~rtt for program group members who would have been on IA in the absen~ of the

program.     Sin@ the response rate in the control group for IA recipients was 93.3 percent, a

“lower bound” estimate is that the harassment eff~t reduced the response rate for IA rmipients

in the program group by 3.1 Wrcentage pints.

       Further analysis of response rates for members of the program group who were not on IA

reveals that those who r~ived       a supplement payment in month 18 had a relatively high response

rate (94. 5 percent). Averaging the response rates for IA recipients and SSP supplement takers,

the overall response rate for program group members who received any form of payment (either

SSP or IA) was 89.8 percent. By comparison, the response rate for those who received neither

IA nor a supplement payment was 78.9 percent. The relative response rate for program group

members who r~ived         any form of payment (IA or SSP) versus those who received nothing is

therefore similar to the relative differential for IA recipients and non-recipients in the control

group: For both groups, people who received some form of payment are over-represented in the

respondent subsample.       It follows that the estimated program impact for total receipt (IA plus

SSP) in the respondent subsample is an overestimate of the true program impact.



B.     ~g          the Sign and Magnitude of Non-Response Bias

       Because IA and SSP supplement payment data are obtaind               from administrative records,

non-response in the 18-month survey is not a problem for estimating the impact of the SSP

supplement on the IA and SSP outcomes.             For such outcomes as the probability        of working,

however, the 18-month su~ey is the only source of data.                Furthermore, since IA and SSP

supplement status are mechanically correlated with labor market outcomes, and since response

rates vary by program status and IA/SSP supplement status, one might expect respnse                 rates to


    %e    IA receipt rate in the control group in month 18 wu 0.7917, while the rate in the progmm group was
0.6754. Since the control group sample comprises 1,066 individuals, 124 (= 1,066*[0.79 17-0.67545]) ~ple were
moved off IA by the program.

                                                    -35-
vary by progm      status and employmem status, leading to biases in tie estimated program

impacts for all the labor market outwmes discussed in Swtion IV.

      One way to evaluate the effwt of this bias is to assume hat response rates for the 18-

month suwey depend only on program status and IA or SSP supplement status as of month 18.

It is then possible to simply “reweight” the labor market outcome data for each subgroup (say,

mntrol group members who were on IA in month 18) by the inverse of their response

probabilities, and calculate adjusted estimates of the mean labor market outcomes for the program

group and rhe antrol    group.   While this assumption is probably tm strong, it nevertheless

captures some of the m=surable variation in response rates, and gives some indication of the

likely sign and magnitude of non-response bias.

      Table 8 illustrates the application of this idea to the observed IA and combined IA and SSP

receipt rate outcomes of the program and control groups. For each quarter, three estimates of

a particular outcome are presented: an estimate based on the overall sample, including non-

respondents to the 18-month survey (labeled the “all” sample); an estimate based on the

unweighed average for respondents to the 18-month suney (labeled the “unweighed” wmple);

and an estimate based on a weighted average of the data for respondents to the 18-month survey

(labeled the “weighted” sample). The inverse response probabilities are used as weights for six

groups defined by IA and SSP status in month 18: control group members on IA; control group

members off IA; program group members on IA who did not rweive an SSP supplement

payment; program group members who were off IA and received an SSP supplement payment;

program group members who received both IA and an SSP supplement payment; and program

group members who received neither IA nor an SSP supplement payment.

      The first half of the table shows the percentages receiving IA in each quarter and the

estimated program impacts. As expected given the response patterns in Table 7, the unweighed

averages from the 18-month survey respondents overstate the fraction of IA recipients in the

control group in quarters 1 to 6, I=ding to downward-biased estimates of the progmm impacts.


                                              -36-
The weighting procedure “wrrects” the IA rtieipt rates for non-response biases and gives rise

to program impacts that are very close to the estimates based on the full sample.

      In general, the same bmic pattern emerges in the second half of the table, where data are

presented on combined IA and SSP receipt.       The weighted averages using only the survey

respondent subsa.mple tend to be closer to the overall averages than the simple unweighed

averages.   However, the estimated program impacfs based on the unweighed averages for the

respndent   subsarnple tend to be slightly closer to the averages based on the full sample. The

non-response biases in the unweighed means for the program and control groups effectively

“difference out, ” leading to almost no bias in the program impacts from the unweighed data.

      Table 9 shows what happens when the =me weighting pr~edures         are applied to two of

the estimated labor market outcomes (employment and mings).        In these cases, however, no

estimates are available from the overall sample to compare against the weighted or unweighed

averages from the respondent subsample. The weighting adjustments tend to raise the average

outcomes for the mntrol group members and lower the average outcomes for the program group

members, lading    to slightly smaller program impacts than arise from the unweighed data.

These adjustments reflect the patterns of non-response in the two groups. In the control group

sample, people who are off IA are under-represented.   Since these tend to be people with better

labor market outcomes (more hours, higher earnings), the weighting adjustment raises the mean

outcomes for the control group, In the program group sample, however, pple       who are on IA

have relatively low response rates (no higher than those off IA), while those who are rweiving

an SSP supplement have very high response rales. Since ~ple       who receive a supplement are

n~ssarily    working full time, the weighting    adjustment   lowers the hours, earnings, and

employment rate of the program group.       The net effect of the two adjustments lowers the

estimated program impacts on tie probability of working, average monthly hours, and average

monthly earnings by about 10 percent.

      Two main conclusions can be drawn based on this analysis. First, experimental impacts


                                             -37-
derived from the subsample who responded to the 18-month survey overstate the effect of the

SSP supplement on IA =ipt       rates, but (very slightly) understate the effwt of the supplement

on the combined IA and SSP =ipt       rate. Second, and more tentatively, non-response biases in

the 18-month survey probably lead to an overstatement of the SSP supplement’s net impact on

labor market outimes     such as the probability of working or earnings.   The magnitude of the

bias is perhaps 10 perwnt.   Thus, if the measured impact on the probability of working, using

the 18-month sumey data, is 11 percentage points, the true impact is probably about 10

peruntage points.



VIII. Conclusions

      As in most other counties, welfare expenditures and caseloads in Canada have risen over

the past several dmdes,      placing growing fiscal strains on federal, provincial, and local

governments.   It has long been argued that a key to reducing welfare dependency is to provide

gainful employment opportunities for welfare r~ipients.          Previous efforts at stimulating

employment have utilized a vtiety of approaches, most of which have enjoyed moderate success.

In this paper, we have presented early findings from a unique social experiment being conducted

in two very different sites in Canada (lower mainland British Columbia        and southern   New

Brunswick)   that offers a generous financial incentive for long-term welfare recipients to find a

full-time job and leave welfare. To our knowledge, this is the first time such an approach has

been subjected to a formal test and evaluation.

      The early findings from the Self-Sufficiency Proj-t    indicate that a significant number of

single parents respond to the program’s financial incentives by taking full-time jobs.    In fact,

after 14 months, the fraction of welfare recipients working full time among those who were

offered the SSP earnings supplement is about twice that of a randomly assigned control group.

There is no strong evidence that the impact of the SSP supplement differs systematically by the

generosity of SSP relative to the alternative of remaining in the IA program, although small


                                               -38-
sample sizes and the” single treatment” design of the demonstration make it difficult to draw firm

conclusions.   There is some eviden=,    however, that the program impact is higher for larger

families in British Columbia.

      Although the SSP supplement lads to an increase in full-time employment, it appears that

r=ipients are taking jobs that pay relatively low wages — within $1.00 to $3.00 per hour above

the minimum wage. This is consistent with the view that many long-term welfare recipients have

low wage opportunities. Unless the SSP participants experience substantial wage growth in their

three years of program eligibility, it is conceivable that many recipients will return to welfare

when the supplement ends.

NOTE:          Standard errors are in parentheses.
               An asterisk indicates that the impact estimate is statistically significant at the 5 percent level.
               The unadjusted impact is the simple tierence in mean outcomes between the program
and control groups. The adjusted impact is a regression-adjusted Uerence, controlling for the
lagged (quarter -1) value of the dependent variable; age; province; number of children in three age
ranges; nmber of addts in the household; a dummy if the person ever worked for pay; the number
of years of paid work before baseline; dummies for two levels of schooling (high school graduation
with no post-seeon~      education and some post-secondary education); dummies for the presence
of self-reported physical or emotional problems at baseline: a dummy for subsidized housing at
baseline; dummies for First Natiou European or Camdian, or Asian antes@; a dummy for being
born outside of Canada; and a m~          of the number of months on IA in the three years before
