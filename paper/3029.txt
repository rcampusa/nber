        THE EMPLOYERS' COSTS OF WORXERS' COMPENSATION INSURANCE:
               MAGNITUDES, DETERMINANTS, AND PUBLIC POLICY


                                 ABSTRACT


    This   paper presents estimates of the average cost of the workers'

compensation insurance program for a homogeneous group of employers by state.

These estimates are of interest because they reflect the operation, direct

nominal costs, and efficiency of workers' compensation.   The paper estimates

                                                                 The main finding

is that when cost equations are estimated by ordinary least squares there is a

unit elasticity of costs with respect to benefits, but instrumental variable

estimates of the effect of benefits yield a greater than unit elasticity.

                                 I.   Introduction

     Workers     compensation insurance is the primary program that provides cash

benefits, niedical care, and rehabilitation services to workers who are

disabled by work-related injuries and illnesses.      The program is larger than

unemployment insurance, AFDC, and food stamps, as measured by total

expenditures (Bixby, 1989).     The provisions of workers' compensation

insurance, such as coverage and benefit levels, are determined exclusively by

the states, which distinguishes workers' compensation frotu most other social

insurance programs in the United States.     Also, in contrast to most other

social insurance programs, the insurance arrangements in workers' compensation

include a mixture of private insurance carriers, state insurance funds, and

self- insuring employers.

     These distinctive attributes of workers' compensation are the basis for

three topics examined in this paper.     One topic is the relative cost

efficiency of the various insurance arrangements used to provide benefits.

Specifically, we examine whether the costs of workers' compensation insurance

provided by private insurance carriers in a jurisdiction are affected by the

presence of a competitive state insurance fund.      The second topic concerns the

interstate differences in the employers' costs of workers' compensation

insurance.     We are interested in the magnitude of these costs in 1983 (the

most recent year with data available for all variables in our study), and in

how they have changed since 1972.     In 1972, the National Commission on State

Wor1en's Compensation Laws conditionally supported the enactment of federal

standards for the program as a means of reducing the disparity in costs and

benefits among the states (see National Conimission, 1972, p. 26).     We estimate

the effect such standards would have on the level and dispersion in workers'

conpensation insurance costs.

     Finally, we use the interstate variability in state workers' compensation

programs to estimate the relationship between insurance costs and benefits.

This relationship is of interest because in the absence of a behavioral

response to insurance, costs would rise proportionally with benefits, all else

equal.     On the other hand, if either employers or employees change their

behavior in response to higher benefits, costs may rise more or less than

proportionally with benefits.

     The paper is organized as follows.      We present estimates of the

employers' costs of workers' compensation insurance in section II.         A simple

model that focuses on benefits as the determinants of these costs is presented

in section III.     This model is then expanded to allow for other institutional

factors.     In section IV we fit the data on costs to several relevant

variables.     The empirical work analyzes an unbalanced panel of 29 states for

which necessary data are available in four years between 1972 and 1983.         In

section V we use the estimated reduced form parameters to examine the

potential influence of Federal standards for workers' compensation laws on the

level and dispersion of workers' compensation costs in these 29 states.

        II.   Measuring the Employers' Costs of Workers' Compensation

    Until recently, workers' compensation insurance has been a highly

regulated line of insurance.   The program is primarily financed by insurance

premiums paid by employers; about 20 percent of all benefits are paid directly

by self-insuring employers.1   Employers who purchase insurance from private

companies or from state insurance funds are assigned to one or more industrial

or occupational classifications.   Most states follow the uniform

classifications prescribed by the National Council on Compensation Insurance

(MCCI), or use a roughly comparable classification system.       As the basis for

our estimates, we have selected 45 widely used insurance classifications       that

accounted for 62% of all payroll for employers who purchased workers'

compensation insurance nationally.2   Twelve of   the   selected classifications

are manufacturing industries, seven are contracting industries (e.g., concrete

work), and the remainder are primarily service and sales industries.

     After each of the employer's operations is assigned to a particular

insurance classification, an initial insurance rate called the manual rate is

located in the state's schedule.   Manual rates are stated as a certain number

of dollars per $100 of weekly earnings for each employee.3       As of 1983,


     1The ultimate incidence of workers' compensation costs may differ from
the party that nominally finances the program.  We return to this issue in
section V.

     2This estimate of the extent of payroll covered by the selected
classifications is based on data for 36 states which report such information
to the NCCI.  By 1983, two of the rate classifications were merged, leaving us
with 44 insurance classifications. Strictly speaking, our subsequent
econometric estimates only apply to these selected insurance classifications.

     3our statistical  analysis involves the 29 states listed in Table 2.   In
Utah, workers' compensation premiums are assessed against the full overtime
premium, while in the other 28 states in this study, hours of overtime work
are valued at the regular hourly wage.   Since the overtime premium is a modest
portion of payroll, manual rates in Utah were not adjusted for interstate
differences in payroll bases.   See Burton and Krueger (1986), pp. 130-131.
forty-six states and the District of Columbia had rating systems that could be

compared for the 45 insurance classifications that we examine.    For each of

these jurisdictions, we calculate a weighted average manual rate for the 45

insurance classifications, using the distribution of national payroll among

these classifications as the weights.

     Most employers, however, do not pay insurance premiums that are solely a

product of their payroll times the manual rate for their insurance

classification.   Insurance premiums are often adjusted to an employer's own

accident experience (i.e., experience-rating), premium discounts for quantity

purchases, and dividends received from mutual companies or participating stock

companies.4   In addition, by 1983 most states allowed carriers to deviate from

the manual rates after obtaining the insurance commissioner's approval, and

six states allowed "open competition" among insurance carriers.   Using an

approach described in detail in Burton and Krueger (1986), we adjust the

manual premiums to reflect these factors.5   The first four columns of Table 1

report weighted averages of manual rates adjusted for experience-rating,

premium dicounts, deviations, open competition, and dividends.

     The estimates of "adjusted manual rates" in Table 1 can be interpreted as

the percent of payroll expended on workers' compensation by a homogeneous


         most of the years we study, data are not available to make state
specific adjustments for experience-rating or dividend payments. Since most
states use a uniform experience-rating formula we use the national average
experience-rating and dividend offset in these states. We use state specific
data for states that substantially deviate from the norm. See Burton and
Krueger (1986).

     5The cost measures for the states that allow open competition are
adjusted to reflect more recent state-level information on the impact of open
competition.  The adjusted manual rates for the six states with open
competition in effect as of January 21, 1983 are the manual rates shown in
Table 3 of Burton and Krueger (1986) times the estimated net impact of open
competition shown in Table 7-12 of Hunt, Krueger and Burton (1988)

sample of employers.            The results indicate, for example, that as of January 1,

1983         the 45 types of employers spent, on average,                .905 percent of payroll on

workers' compensation premiums in Alabama.                        The mean cost among all 47 states

in that year was 1.290 percent of payroll.

             It is also useful to examine the dollar amount of workers' compensation

weekly premiums paid per employee.              To compare such figures across states, it

is necessary to control for differences in the average wage that stem from the

state's industrial mix.6            Consequently, we calculate a weighted average of

each state's wage using the individual state's industry wage distribution and

the national industry employment distribution.                        The last four columns in Table

1 present estimates of the "net cost" of workers' compensation insurance,

which equals the adjusted manual rate times the "industry-adjusted" state

average wage.            These figures are in nominal dollars.               The table indicates, for

example, that the 45 types of employers spent, on average, $2.565 per week per

employee on workers' compensation premiums in Alabama in 1983.



                                III.   A Model of Insurance Costs

             A simple model of the determination of workers' compensation costs is

presented to guide the empirical work,'                    We assume that all workers have a

probability          p    of incurring a work-related injury that will result in a

workers' compensation benefit of            B   dollars.             If the average workers'

compensation insurance costs per worker is denoted C, then expected profit

for the insurer per covered worker (if)               is     if   — (l-p)C   +   p(C-B)


             6This adjustment is necessary because the numerator - -                 costs per employee
-
    -   is    standardized for industrial composition.

     7We note that Butler and Worrall (1988) develop a more extensive model
that allows for variations in the duration of work-related injuries as well.
      If insurance rates are actuarially fair the average workers' compensation

cost per worker is     C — p8.   It is more realistic, however, to allow for a

loading factor that is proportional to workers' compensation rates to cover

administrative costs.      In this situation,          C —    C   +   p8,       where    is the

proportional loading factor that is built into workers' compensation rates.

The average cost of workers' compensation insurance to employers, therefore,

is    C —   p8/(l-).   Taking the natural log of costs gives


(1)     log(C) —   - log(l-)     +     log(p)   +    log(B)

       So far we have assumed that the probability of a work-related injury is

exogenous.     If an employee's probability of receiving workers' compensation

benefits depends positively (or negatively) on the benefit rate because of

reasons discussed below, then insurance costs would rise more (or less) than

proportionally with benefits.          In particular, if the functional form relating

the compensated claims rate and the benefit level is                        p   —   AB   then



(2)    log(C) — a + (1 +   -y)log(8)


where -y is the elasticity of workers' compensation recipiency with respect to

average benefits, and a —      log(A/(l-)]          is a constant.8

       This model predicts a log-log relationship between costs and benefits.

If the coefficient on the benefit variable in equation (2) is greater than

one, there is support for the view that                       employees respond to increased

workers' compensation benefits by increasing the number of claims they



        constant elasticity specification is estimated in most of the previous
empirical research on the benefit-claims relationship.   See Butler and Worrall
(1983), Butler (1983), and Krueger (1988).   These papers also provide a
choice-theoretic model of work injuries.

successfully file.     This increase in claims could come about either through a

moral hazard effect, in which workers take less care on the job and incur more

work injuries in response to increased income security (the "true injury

effect"), or through an incentive to report claims for injuries that would not

have been reported in the absence of a sufficient monetary incentive (the

'reporting effect"), or a combination of both effects.

     A finding that the coefficient on benefits is less than one would support

the conclusion that           increased workers' compensation benefits lead to a

safer work environment, perhaps because experience rating causes higher

benefits to enhance the incentive for employers to provide safe working

conditions.    Alternatively, a negative estimate of      may reflect employer or

carrier decisions to more aggressively oppose claims in response to higher

benefits.     Finally, if the coefficient on benefits equals one, there is

evidence that on net workers' compensation benefits have no effect on the

number of claims.     This could come about because the various effects

described above are either offsetting or insignificant.      Most previous

studies, such as Chelius (1977) and Butler and Worrall (1983), have found a

positive relationship between benefits and costs, which has been interpreted

as evidence of a moral hazard effect.9

     If the frequency of on-the-job injuries is not affected by the workers'

compensation benefit level, it is necessary to control for the injury rate as

shown in equation (1) for two reasons.       First, a high injury rate may lead to

political pressure for high benefits, which would bias the estimate of y



     9See Kniesner and Leeth (1989) for an analysis of the relative importance
of moral hazard and reporting effects. Ehrenberg (1988) discusses the
difficulty in distinguishing among the various possible consequences of higher
workers' compensation benefits on reported workplace injuries.
                                              8


unless the injury rate is included in the equation; and second, even if the

injury rate and benefit level are uncorrelated, including the injury rate will

improve the precision of the estimates.             On the other hand, if higher benefits

cause more (or fewer) workers' compensation claims, one should exclude the

injury rate from the equation to allow its effect to load on the benefit

variable.        Since it is not clear p   priori   which assumption is correct, we take

an eclectic approach and estimate each equation with and without the injury

rate.     The work injury rate (p)    is derived from the annual OS}{A survey of all

work-related injuries and illnesses, including those without any lost

Other Regressors

        It is desirable to control for other relevant institutional and economic

variables that influence workers' compensation costs in a state.            We estimate

the simple model in equation (2), and estimate models that include explanatory

variables measuring medical benefits, the presence of a competitive state

insurance fund, the proportion of the sate's workforce that is unionized, the

extent of coverage under the state workers' compensation law, and the

proportion of cases accounted for by permanent partial disabilities.

        The insurance arrangements that deliver workers' compensation benefits

differ from state to state, with variation in the importance of private

carriers, competitive or exclusive state funds, and self-insurance.            It is

widely believed that these types of insurance arrangements influence the costs

of workers' compensation.       The workers' compensation program is unique among



     10Although the workers' compensation claims rate may be a preferable
measure of p it is not available by state in the early years of our sample.
                                      9


social insurance programs in the extent of private sector involvement in the

enforcement of the program, collection of premiums, and delivery of benefits,

and thus offers an unusual opportunity to study the relative efficiency of

private versus public provision of social insurance.

     Although the debate over the proper insurance delivery system ranges over

several issues, this study can only estimate the relative cost to employers of

insurance purchased in states that allow private sector insurance companies to

compete against the state insurance fund.11   Differences in services, tax

liabilities, reserving practices, and reporting requirements that vary among

the insurance schemes are not directly accounted for by the model,

     One hypothesis is that the presence of a state insurance fund will be

associated with higher insurance costs to employers because a state

bureaucracy will be inefficient and have some monopoly power.   An alternative

view, however, is that state-fund insurance is less costly than private

insurance because state-operated funds benefit from economies of scale and

tax-exempt status, and the absence of a profit motive leads to smaller loading

factorsJ2   We include a dummy variable indicating the presence of a state

fund in our equation to test these hypotheses.


     11Because benefit data are unavailable for states with an exclusive state
fund, these states are not included in the sample.   In addition, we do not
consider the importance of self-insurance because all states in our sample
allow large firms to self-insure, and the decision to self-insure is
endogenous. Our conclusions are qualitatively unchanged, however, when we
include a polynomial in -the proportion of losses due to self-insured firms in
the equations below (this variable is reported in Price, 1986). Butler and
Worrall (1983) included a polynomial in the proportion of payroll in nonseif-
insuring firms to control for selection into the sample.
     12
       Millis and Montgomery (1938) and Somers and Somers (1954) provide early
discussions of these hypotheses.  See Butler and Worrall (1986) for a more
recent theoretical and empirical analysis of the returns to scale, efficiency,
and hidden costs of public versus private workers' compensation insurance.
                                      10

     Another factor expected to influence the cost of workers' compensation to

employers is the extent of unionization.   Butler and Worrall (1983) find a

positive and statistically significant relationship between unionization and

workers' compensation claims.   If unions play a critical role providing

"voice" in the work-place, this finding is to be expected since unionized

workers would be better informed about and more likely to exercise their

rights under workers' compensation laws than nonunionized workers.

Alternatively, the union rate may be positively related to the injury rate

because unions find it easier to organize more dangerous work-places, all else

equal.   We expect that among the states the proportion of workers unionized

will be positively associated with workers' compensation costs.

     The fraction of the states workforce covered by workers' compensation

legislation is expected to be related to the employers' costs of insurance.

If employees in exempt occupations are at greater risk of work-related

disabilities than employees in covered occupations, a greater proportion of

covered workers in a state is expected to be associated with greater workers'

compensation costs.   The opposite result would imply that exempt occupations

are safer than covered occupations.

     Permanent partial disability benefits are paid to workers with relatively

serious injuries, so that losses of actual earnings or of earning capacity

continue even after maximum medical recovery.   The statutes and practices used

to compensate and classify these cases vary widely among the states.     We

control for this institutional feature by including a variable measuring

permanent partial disability cases as a proportion of all cases.     Since

permanent partial cases account for a disproportionate share of workers

compensation benefit payments, we expect a positive relationship between the
                                       11

relative importance of permanent partial cases and insurance costs.                 We also

expect that higher medical benefits will increase the cost of workers'

compensation insurance.



                             IV.   Data and Results

     We fit the workers' compensation costs presented in section II to the

institutional and economic variables indicated in the above discussion.                 Table

2 presents sunimary statistics and describes the variables.           Data are available

for 29 states for the years 1972, 1975, 1978 and 1983.            Unfortunately,

complete data are unavailable for all these states in all years, so the final

sample consists of 108 observations.

     Because of its importance for the estimation and the policy analysis, we

describe the indemnity benefit variable in detail.            There are four principal

types of workers' compensation indemnity benefits     -   -    temporary   total,

permanent total, permanent partial, and survivors' benefitsJ3              Conditional on

filing a successful claim, the expected workers' compensation benefit is

determined by the weekly benefit and the discounted duration over which

benefits are paid.

     The weekly workers' compensation benefit is determined by the nominal

replacement rate, the maximum weekly benefit, the minimum weekly benefit, and

the weekly wage of the disabled worker.     Unless a worker's benefit exceeds the

maximum benefit or is less than the minimum benefit, the benefit equals the

weekly wage times the replacement rate.     The distribution of benefits is

doubly censored because workers in the lower tail of the earnings distribution


     131n many states there are also temporary partial indemnity benefits, but
these benefits account for a relatively insignificant share of total workers'
compensation payments and are not considered further.

are paid the minimum benefit and workers in the upper tail are paid the -

maximum benefit.        To estimate the expected weekly benefit from the statutory

provisions, we calculate the mean of the censored benefit distribution for
              14
each state.

     Many states impose limits on the duration of benefit payments or on the

total dollar amount of benefits.        We apply the NCCI's commutation procedures

to discount weekly permanent total and fatal benefits durations for interest,

mortality, dollar amount limitations, and escalation of benefits where

applicable.        The duration index times the expected weekly benefit yields an

estimate of the total expected benefit package for the disability class.        In

addition, we adjust temporary totaUbenefits to reflect the length of the

waiting period which is required before benefits begin, and the length of the

retroactive period upon which compensation is paid for the waiting period.

     Estimates of scheduled and nonscheduled permanent partial benefits for

1972 to 1978 were provided by Butler and Worrall and updated by the authorsJ5

These permanent partial benefits calculations take into account the weekly

benefit levels as well as the number of weeks for which benefits are payable.

For our purposes, the scheduled and nonscheduled benefits were weighted by the

relative frequency of those types of injuries in each state and collapsed into

an overall permanent partial benefit.


      14The distribution of earnings that we use to calculate expected benefits
is the national wage distribution centered on each state's average weekly
wage.   This procedure follows the NCCI's methodology.

     15The statutes in most states contain a schedule that lists the number of
weeks or dollar amounts of benefits paid for the physical loss or the loss of
use of specified parts of the body.  A scheduled benefit involves any injury
specifically enumerated in the statute.  Nonscheduled benefits involve
injuries that are not included in the statutory list. See Berkowitz and
Burton (1987, p. 99).
                                         13

     Because of ulticollinearity, it is not sensible to include separate

variables for temporary total, permanent total, permanent partial, and fatal

benefits.      We therefore combined the four benefit variables into one overall

benefit measure by weighting each type        of   benefit by its national claims

frequency.      This approach to estimating workers' compensation benefits is

particularly useful for our purposes because we can impose the National

Comnission's proposed minimum     standards    on each state law and actuarially

simulate the effect of federal minimum        standards   on benefits.

Results

     Table 3 presents reduced form least squares regression estimates of cost

equations using the log of adjusted manual rates as the dependent variable and

allowing for a variety of different independent variables.           Table 4 contains

parallel results using the log of net costs as the dependent variable.16            The

equations are estimated on an unbalanced panel of states from 1972 to 1983.17

In some specifications we exploit the longitudinal nature of the data and

estimate within state (or fixed effects) regressions to control for time-

invariant state effects, such as the efficiency of the state administrative
          18
agency.


     16The log-log specification for costs and benefits seems appropriate for
three reasons: first, estimation of the Box-Cox transformation finds that the
best fit is approximately log-log; second, a plot of the data reveals a
nonlinear, increasing relationship between costs and benefits; and third, the
model in section III predicts a log-log relationship between costs and benefits.

     17We do not include separate year dummies because we want the common
time-series variation in benefits to identify the equations. A Chow test of
structural change does not reject the hypothesis that the determinants of
workers' compensation costs are stable over the years examined at the 01
level for all of the specifications presented in Tables 3 and 4.

     18Since our sample consists of observations on states that vary greatly
in size, there is reason to suspect conditional heteroscedasticity. We
therefore performed a series of Breusch-Pagan (1979) tests by regressing the

        The results indicate that for either measure of workers' compensation

costs we cannot reject the null hypothesis that there is a unit elasticity

between costs and benefits, regardless of the set of included regressors.        The

estimated elasticity between benefits and costs is slightly greater than one

if state dummies are omitted from the equation, and slightly less than one if

state dummies are added to the equation.     These results imply that for a given

proportional change in indemnity benefits, workers' compensation insurance

costs will rise by the same proportion.      This finding does not support the

generally positive relationship between benefits and the number of reported

injuries found in most earlier studies.      However, if the state-level benefit

variable is measured with error, the elasticity between benefits and costs

will be biased downward asymptotically, and the attenuation bias will be

greater in the fixed effects models if (as seems likely) the state dummies

absorb more of the signal than noise in the benefit variable.

        The possibility of an errors-in-variables problem with the benefit

variable lead us to use the states' maximum benefit, minimum benefit, waiting

period and retroactive period as instruments for the benefit variablej9

These results are reported in Appendix Table Al for models without the injury

rate.     Instrumenting for the benefit variable with these proxies in the

adjusted manual rate equations leads the coefficient (standard error) on


squared-residuals of the estimated2equations on the total employment of each
state; the sample size times the R of these ancillary regressions
asymptotically follows a chi-square distribution with one degree of freedom.
Results of these tests show no evidence of conditional heteroscedasticity.
For instance, the chi-square statistic for the test corresponding to the first
column of Table 1 is only .08.

     19These parameters relate to temporary total benefits, which account for
the greatest share of cases.  A chi-square test of instrument-error
orthogonality fails to reject when no covariates are in the equation at the
.10 level, but rejects when covariates are included.
                                        15


benefits to increase to 1.303 (.186) when there are no covariates, and to

1.087 (.202) when state dummies and covariates are included.     Similar results

are found for net costs.    Thus, measurement error may indeed bias the estimate

of   downward, and instrumenting for benefits brings our estimates closer to

the previous literature.    Nonetheless, the estimate of    even after correcting

for measurement error is not statistically significantly different from zero

in the fixed effects specification.

     One explanation for the smaller point estimates of the net injury

response to higher benefits in our analysis than in the previous literature is

that the additional claims that result from increased benefits have relatively

low costs.   Such claims would have little effect on our costs measures, but

would have a larger effect on measures of injuries that treat all claims

equally.

     Another key variable is the dummy variable indicating the presence of a

state insurance fund.    We find that the presence of a state fund is associated

with nearly a 20 percent increase in average insurance costs, all else equal.

Moreover, this conclusion is unchanged when either measure of costs is the

dependent variable.     Since no state added or eliminated a competitive state

insurance fund in the period covered by our sample, we can not estimate the

effect of the state fund once the 28 state dummy variables are included in the

model unless additional covariance restrictions are made.2°


     201-iausman and Taylor (1981) show that the effect of a variable that is
constant over time can still be estimated in a fixed effects specification if
one of the included variables is uncorrelated with the time-invariant
component of the error term and correlated with the variable of interest.
Aniemiya and MaCurdy (1986) and Breusch, Mizon, and Schmidt (1989) derive
consistent estimators in this context based on stronger identification
assumptions.  In the present application, however, it seems to us that there
is no legitimate covariance restriction to use to identify the effect of a
state fund in the fixed effects specifications.

    As expected, the models that include the log of the injury rate typically

find a positive relationship between reported injuries and the cost of

workers' compensation insurance.   The coefficient on the log injury rate is

substantially less than one, however, possibly due to inaccurate reporting of

work injuries to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.      When the

coefficient on the injury rate is constrained to equal one, the other

coefficients retain the same sign and are of similar magnitude.

     The proportion of cases that are classified as permanent partial

disabilities has the expected positive sign.   The variable becomes

statistically insignificant when the state dummies are added, however.

Curiously, we find that the union membership rate has a positive effect on

costs in the regressions without state dummy variables, but has a sizable

negative impact when we include the state dummies.    One possible explanation

for this pattern is that in the fixed effects specification the union rate is

identified by within state time-series variation in union membership, and over

this time period the union rate was generally trending down while workers

compensation costs were trending up.   The coefficients for the medical benefit

index and the coverage rate are consistently positive and consistently

statistically insignificant.



      V.   Federal Standards and Workers' Compensation Insurance Costs

     The National Commission on State Workmen's Compensation Laws concluded

that, "State workmen's compensation laws in general are inadequate and

inequitable" (National Commission, 1972, p. 119).21   The National Commission



     21The conclusion that workers' compensation benefits are inadequate is
also supported by empirical work by Viscusi and Moore (1987).
                                              17


proposed thst all ststes voluntarily incorporate 19 essential recommendations

into their workers' compensation laws to rectify the inequity and inadequacy

of the program.           Moreover, if the states failed to adopt these

recommendations, the Commission endorsed the passage of federal minimum

standards to encourage compliance with its recommendations.           The justificatior

for federal standards offered by the National Commission was that their

enactment "will remove from each State the main barrier to effective workmen's

compensation reform: the fear that compensation costs may drive employers to

move away to markets where protection for disabled workers is inadequate but

less expensive" (National Commission, 1972, p.          27).

     Several objections can be offered to this justification.             Perhaps most

important, higher benefits in a state could be offset by lower wages, and

therefore employers in high benefit states would not be at a competitive

disadvantage.     However, while there is evidence of a trade-off between-

benefits and wages, the results are not compelling that benefit increases are

fully offset by lower wages (see Ruser, 1985, Viscusi and Moore, 1987, and

Hamermesh and Wolfe, 1989) .          Employers certainly act as if they will bear the

burden of higher benefits, and they effectively lobby many legislators
                                             22
(National Commission, 1972, p. 125).

     We will not attempt to resolve the issue of the incidence of workers'

compensation costs in this paper.           There is another argument against federal

standards, however, that we will address.           The implicit assumption underlying

the National Commission's assertion that federal standards will reduce

interstate differences in costs is that states with low benefits have low


     220n September 22, 1987, for instance, the Wall Street Journal (p. 1)
reported that, "Wide differences in [workers' compensation] benefits from
state to state    .draw corporate fire."
                      .   .
                                       18

costs, and therefore forcing these states to improve benefits will decrease

dispersion in costs.    If, however, low benefit states already have relatively

high costs, then federal standards will only increase the dispersion in costs

among states and thus defeat the basic rationale for standards.

     We use the estimated elasticity of costs with respect to benefits to

simulate the impact that proposed national standards for workers' compensation

benefits would have on the level and dispersion in employers' direct costs of

workers' compensation insurance.    Specifically, we focus on the eight

essential recommendations that directly affect indemnity benefits.    These

recommendations require the maximum benefit to be at least 100 percent of the

state average weekly wage for temporary total, permanent total, and fatal

cases, and require a replacement rate of at least two-thirds the gross weekly

wage for these cases.    In addition, the recommendations require temporary

total, permanent total, and fatal benefits to be paid for the duration of the

disability, or for life, without any limitations on the total dollar amount.

     The actuarial methods described in section III were used to estimate the

expected, discounted value of benefits for a successful claim in each state

assuming that the essential benefit recommendations were fully adopted and

enforced.   State laws that did not meet the standards were brought up to the

level of the National Commission's recommendations, while provisions that

already met or exceeded the minimum standards were not altered.23    Our

estimates predict that in 1972 workers' compensation benefits would have been

36 percent greater than actual costs on average in the 29 states if the eight


    231n accordance with compliance evaluation criteria established in ll
ComDliance of State Laws with Workers' Comøensation Recommended Standards
(Washington, DC, 1976) maximum weekly benefits were set at the average weekly
wage of workers covered by the unemployment insurance program two years prior
to the year considered.
                                                     19


essential benefit recommendation were incorporated into each state law.                                 By

1983, compliance with the benefit recommendations would have increased

benefits by an average of 14 percent.

        Our approach to estimating the effect of compliance with minimum

standards on insurance costs is based on the equations estimated in Tables 3

and 4:


(3)      log(C) —              X1                        +       c.
                                    l + 2 log(B.)

where X. is a vector of independent variables, .                           is       the average benefit leve

in state i,      t.        is an estimation error, and l and                        are coefficient vectors

Assuming the parameters and control variables remain constant, the "simulated

log cost of workers' compensation insurance for state                                 I   is



(4)      log(C) —              X l + 2 log(S)            +       Li



where          is the "simulated" average cost,                       is the expected benefit in state

i under full compliance with the minimum standards, and all other variables

and parameters are defined as before.

        The difference between the log of workers' compensation costs assuming

full compliance with the benefit standards and the log of actual costs is


(5)      log(C)        -       log(C)   —   [   log(B)       -   log(B)

Intuitively, this equation makes sense because if benefits are unchanged by

national standards, there is no change in costs.                           Finally, we solve equation

(5) for          to obtain:


(6)     C. —     exp       (
                               log(C) +     [
                                                log()        -   log(B)    J    I
                                        20

     The mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation for the

simulated and actual costs based on equation (6) are presented in Table 5.

The simulated costs were estimated under two extreme assumptions: first, using

the elasticity          estimated in the most parsimonious model (model 1 of

Tables 3 and 4); second, using the elasticity estimated in the within state

analysis (model 6 of Tables 3 and 4).

     As to be expected, the simulation results indicate that the direct cost

of workers' compensation insurance to employers would have increased in our

sample if the National Commission's recommendations were adopted.     The

evidence regarding the effect of national standards on the dispersion in costs

across states, however, is mixed.     In the 1970s the simulations suggest that

national standards would have increased the standard deviation in workers

compensation costs, while in 1983 the standard deviation would have been

reduced.     Furthermore, in every year the coefficient of variation is lower

under the assumption that states would have complied with the National

Commission's proposed minimum standards.     Since adjusted manual rates and net

costs have an approximately log normal distribution, the coefficient of

variation may be the most appropriate measure of dispersion in this situation.

     Several caveats are in order regarding the robustness of the simulated

costs.     First, the volume of litigation may initially increase following

enactment of federal minimum standards due to the uncertainty that accompanies

changes in the law.    And second, the parameters and structure of the models

may change if national minimum standards are actually established.    As a

result, we take the simulated costs as a rough indication of the consequences

of federal standards rather than a precise estimate.

                                VI.   Conclusions

     The results of our snalysis of workers' compensation costs support three

main conclusions.    First, when cost equations are estimated by OLS the

elasticity of workers' compensation costs with respect to benefits is

statistically indistinguishable from one.      Instrumental variable estimates of

the cost-benefit elasticity are greater than one, but still smaller than would

be expected based on estimates of the claims-benefit elasticity in the past

literature.    One possible explanation for this finding vts-a-vis the previous

research is that higher workers' compensation benefits may induce claims that

are relatively minor and of small cost.      If this were the case, the elasticity

of costs with respect to benefits would be less than the elasticity of claims

with respect to benefits.

     Second, after controlling for factors such as the benefit level and

injury rate    workers' compensation insurance costs are higher in states that

have state-operated insurance funds competing with private carriers than in

states with only private insurance carriers.     There are several possible

explanations for this finding, including the possible inefficiency associated

with a state bureaucracy, and omitted variables that are correlated with the

presence of state insurance funds and workers' compensation costs.      Clearly,

the sources of this relationship should be examined further before policy

actions are taken.

     Finally    our simulations indicate that the federal minimum standards

proposed by the National Conunission on State Workmen's Compensation Laws would

increase the average costs of workers' compensation insurance and decrease the

coefficient of variation among the states in all time periods.      The impact of

the minimum standards on the standard deviation of costs is mixed; for 1983
                                      22

and for the four years combined the standard deviation for either cost measure

would be decreased by the standards, but in the three other years studied the

standard deviation would increase.   As a result, the success or failure of the

national Commission's prescription to narrow the dispersion in workers'

compensation costs among the states by requiring minimum federal standards

appears dependent on the time period of interest and the measure of dispersion

used.
