                                         ABSTRACT

This paper combines data on GDP, unemployment, and Google's COVID-19 Community
Mobility Reports with data on deaths from COVID-19 to study the macroeconomic outcomes of
the pandemic. We present results from an international perspective using data at the country level
as well as results for individual U.S. states and key cities throughout the world. The data from
these different levels of geographic aggregation offer a remarkably similar view of the pandemic
despite the substantial heterogeneity in outcomes. Countries like Korea, Japan, Germany, and
Norway and cities such as Tokyo and Seoul have comparatively few deaths and low
macroeconomic losses. At the other extreme, New York City, Lombardy, the United Kingdom,
and Madrid have many deaths and large macroeconomic losses. There are fewer locations that
seem to succeed on one dimension but suffer on the other, but these include California and
Sweden. The variety of cases potentially offers useful policy lessons regarding how to use non-
pharmaceutical interventions to support good economic and health outcomes.

1.    Introduction

This paper combines data on GDP, unemployment, and Google’s COVID-19 Commu-
nity Mobility Reports with data on deaths from COVID-19 to study the macroeconomic
outcomes of the pandemic and suggest tentative policy lessons. We present results
from an international perspective using data at the country level as well as results for
individual U.S. states and key cities throughout the world.
     The evidence to date can be summarized in a stylized way by Figure 1. On the
horizontal axis is the number of deaths (per million population) from COVID-19. The
vertical axis shows a cumulative measure of the macroeconomic losses apart from the
value of the loss in life; for simplicity, here we call this the “GDP loss.” Throughout
the paper, we will show data for various countries, U.S. states, and global cities to fill
in this graph quantitatively. We will also show the dynamics of how countries traverse
through this space over time. For now, though, we summarize in a stylized way our
main findings.
     One can divide the graph into four quadrants, based on many versus few deaths
from COVID-19 and on large versus small losses in GDP. Our first significant finding is
that there are communities in all four quadrants.
     In the lower-left corner of the diagram — the quadrant with the best outcomes —
are Germany, Norway, China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan as well as U.S. states such
as Kentucky, Montana, and Idaho. Some combination of good luck and good policy
means that these locations have experienced comparatively few COVID deaths as a
fraction of their populations while simultaneously keeping economic activity losses
relatively low.
     In the opposite quadrant — the one with the worst outcomes — New York City,
Lombardy, the United Kingdom, and Madrid are emblematic of places that have had
comparatively high death rates and large macroeconomic losses. Some combination
of bad luck and policy mistakes is likely responsible for the poor performance on both
dimensions. These locations were unlucky to be hit relatively early in the pandemic,
perhaps by a strain of the virus that was more contagious than the one prevalent in
other locations. Being hit early also meant that communities often did not take appro-
priate measures in nursing homes and care facilities to ensure that the most susceptible
were adequately protected and that the medical protocols at hospitals were less well-

developed.
   The other two quadrants of the chart stand out in interesting ways, having good
performance on one dimension and poor performance on the other. Compared to New
York, Lombardy, Madrid, and the U.K., Sweden and Stockholm had comparable death
rates with much smaller losses in economic activity. But of course, that is not the only
comparison. Relative to Norway and Germany, Sweden had many more deaths and
comparable losses in economic activity. Relative to the worst outcomes in the northeast
quadrant, Sweden is a success. But relative to what was possible — as illustrated by
Germany and Norway — Sweden could have done better.
   California, in the quadrant opposite of Sweden, also makes for a fruitful compar-
ison. Relative to New York, California had similarly large losses in economic activity,
but far fewer deaths. At the start of the summer, both states had unemployment rates
on the order of 15 percent. But New York had 1700 deaths per million residents, while
California had just 300. From New York’s perspective, California looks enviable. On
the other hand, California looks less successful when compared to Germany, Norway,
Japan, and South Korea. These places had similarly low deaths but much smaller losses
in economic activity. Once again, relative to what was possible — as illustrated by the
best-performing places in the world — California could have done better.
   One essential caveat in this analysis is that the pandemic continues. This chart and

the graphs below that it is based on may very well look quite different six months from
now. One of the most critical dimensions of luck is related to whether a location was
hit early by the pandemic or has not — yet? — been severely affected. Will a vaccine or
cheap, widespread testing end the pandemic before these places are impacted?
   Still, with this caveat in mind, probably the most important lesson of the paper is
that there many observations in the lower-left quadrant of the graph: good outcomes
on both the GDP and COVID mortality outcomes are possible.



Good policy can support better outcomes.        We read our findings as suggestive (al-
though not conclusive) evidence of the importance of good policies. Places like China,
Germany, Japan, Norway, South Korea, and Taiwan are heterogeneous along various
dimensions. The set includes large, dense cities such as Seoul and Tokyo. The set con-
tains nations that were forewarned by experiences with SARS and MERS and countries
like Germany and Norway that did not have this direct experience. There are places that
were hit early, like China and South Korea, and places that were hit later, like Germany
and Norway.
   At the same time, our paper does not highlight precisely what these countries did
to get these good outcomes. Such a task is next to impossible using aggregate data and
requires the use of the micro data analysis that exploits local variation (as in the many
papers we will cite below).
   However, our findings suggest where to look for these more in-depth lessons. For
example, China, Taiwan, and South Korea focused early on non-pharmaceutical in-
terventions (NPIs) such as widespread use of masks, protection of the elderly, better
indoor ventilation, limited indoor contact, and widespread testing and quarantine. In
the case of Taiwan, C. Jason Wang (2020) report how the aggressive use of IT and big
data supported the successful application of NPIs, a model copied to a large extent by
China and South Korea.
   Conversely, countries such as Spain and Italy, which suffered a harsh first wave but
did not improve enough in terms of using analytics to track the epidemic, are again on
a tight spot regarding cases, hospital occupancy, and deaths. As we move through the
second wage of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. and Western Europe, the lessons regarding
NPIs can improve both economic activity and death outcomes.

Government-mandated policy versus self-protecting behavior.               By good policy, we
do not just mean government-mandated actions, but also all self-protecting volun-
tary changes in private behavior (perhaps induced by government information cam-
paigns). Think about the case of the airline industry. Flight occupancy can fall because
of government-imposed mandates such as international travel quarantines but also
through the widespread voluntary cancellation of travel.
      A growing consensus suggests that voluntary changes have played a crucial role.
For instance, Arnon, Ricco and Smetters (2020), using an integrated epidemiological-
econometric model and county-level data, argue that the bulk of reductions in U.S.
contact rates and employment came from voluntary changes in behavior. However,
the authors show that government-mandated NPIs reduced COVID-19 deaths by 30%
during the first three months of the pandemic.
      Goolsbee and Syverson (2020) compare consumer behavior within the same com-
muting zones but across boundaries with different policy regimes to conclude that
legal restrictions account only for 7 percentage points (p.p.) of the overall reduction
of over 60 p.p. in consumer traffic. Nonetheless, the authors document that NPIs shift
consumer activity across different industries (e.g., from restaurants into groceries).
      Equivalent results to Arnon, Ricco and Smetters (2020) and Goolsbee and Syver-
son (2020) are reported using smartphone data by Gupta, Nguyen, Rojas, Raman, Lee,
Bento, Simon and Wing (2020) and unemployment insurance claims and vacancy post-
ing by Forsythe, Kahn, Lange and Wiczer (2020).1 Similar findings regarding the pre-
ponderance of voluntary changes in behavior are reported for Europe by Chen, Igan,
Pierri and Presbitero (2020), South Korea by Aum, Lee and Shin (2020), and Japan by
Watanabe and Yabu (2020).
      At a more aggregate level, Atkeson, Kopecky and Zha (2020) highlight, using a range
of epidemiological models, that a relatively small impact of government mandates is
the only way to reconcile the observed data on the progression of COVID across a wide
cross-section of countries with quantitative theory.
      Notice that even if most of the reduction in mobility comes from voluntary deci-
sions, we might still be far from a social optimum as agents do not fully account for
the contagion externalities they create. Importantly, government information surely
  1
   Couture, Dingel, Green, Handbury and Williams (2020) show that smartphone data is a reliable
snapshot of social activities.
                      MACROECONOMIC OUTCOMES AND COVID-19                             5


plays a key role in shaping agents’ beliefs about the state of the epidemic and, therefore,
influences voluntary behavior.



Literature Review. Over the last few months, a gigantic literature on COVID-19 and
economics has appeared. It is beyond our scope to review such literature, which touches
on multiple questions, from the design of optimal mitigation policies (Acemoglu, Cher-
nozhukov, Werning and Whinston, 2020) to COVID-19’s impact on gender equality (Alon,
Doepke, Olmstead-Rumsey and Tertilt, 2020). Instead, we highlight three sets of papers
that have explored the interaction between COVID-19, the policy responses to it, and
economic outcomes.
   The first set of papers has extended standard economic models to incorporate an
epidemiological block. Among those, early efforts include Álvarez, Argente and Lippi
(2020), Eichenbaum, Rebelo and Trabandt (2020), Glover, Heathcote, Krueger and Rı́os-
Rull (2020), and Farboodi, Jarosch and Shimer (2020). In this tradition, the contribu-
tions of models with many different sectors (Baqaee and Farhi, 2020a,b; Baqaee, Farhi,
Mina and Stock, 2020) are particularly interesting for the goal of merging microdata
with aggregate outcomes and the design of optimal reopening policies. These models
will also serve, in the future, as potential laboratories to measure the role of luck vs.
policy that we discussed above.
   A second set of papers has attempted to measure the effects of lockdown policies.
The results using Chinese data in Fang, Wang and Yang (2020) indicate that early and
aggressive lockdowns can have large effects in controlling the epidemic and findings
using German (Mitze, Kosfeld, Rode and Wälde, 2020) and Canadian data (Karaivanov,
Lu, Shigeoka, Chen and Pamplona, 2020) point out to the effectiveness of face masks
in slowing contagion growth. Amuedo-Dorantes, Kaushal and Muchow (2020) study
U.S. county-level data to argue that NPIs interventions have a significant impact on
mortality and infections.
   A subset of these papers has dealt with Sweden, a country that implemented a
much more lenient lockdown policy than its Northern European neighbors. Among
the papers that offer a more favorable assessment of the Swedish experience, Juranek,
Paetzold, Winner and Zoutman (2020) have gathered administrative data on weekly
new unemployment and furlough spells from all 56 regions of Sweden, Denmark, Fin-
    6                            FERNÁNDEZ-VILLAVERDE AND JONES



land, and Norway. Using an event-study difference-in-differences design, the authors
conclude that Sweden’s lighter approach to lockdowns saved between 9,000 and 32,000
seasonally and regionally adjusted cumulative unemployment/furlough spells per mil-
lion population by week 21 of the pandemic. If we compare, for example, Sweden with
Norway, these numbers suggest a crude trade-off (without controlling for any other
variable) of around 61 jobs lost per life saved.2 On the negative side, Born, Dietrich
and Müller (2020) and Cho (2020), using a synthetic control approach, find that stricter
lockdown measures would have been associated with lower excess mortality in Sweden
by between a quarter and a third.
    The third set of papers has studied how to monitor the economy in real time (Ca-
jner, Crane, Decker, Grigsby, Hamins-Puertolas, Hurst, Kurz and Yildirmaz, 2020; Stock,
2020), how the sectoral composition of each country matters for the reported output
and employment losses (Gottlieb, Grobovsek, Poschke and Saltiel, 2020), and the im-
pact of concrete policy measures. Among the latter, Chetty, Friedman, Hendren, Step-
ner and Team (2020) argue that stimulating aggregate demand or providing liquidity to
businesses might have limited effects when the main constraint is the unwillingness of
households to consume due to health risks and that social insurance programs can be a
superior mitigation tool. Goldberg and Reed (2020) extend the analysis of current eco-
nomic conditions related to COVID-19 to emerging market and developing economies.



Structure of the paper. In the remainder of the paper, we present the detailed evi-
dence that underlies this stylized summary. Section 2 lays out a basic framework for
thinking about Figure 1. Section 3 presents evidence for countries using data on GDP
from the first and second quarters of 2020 to measure the macroeconomic outcomes. It
also shows evidence for U.S. states using monthly unemployment rates. Section 4 then
turns to a complementary source of data on economic activity, the Google Community
Mobility Reports. We show that these economic activity measures are highly correlated
with GDP and unemployment rates. The Google measures have additional advantages,
however. In particular, they are available for a large number of locations at varying
geographic levels of aggregation, are reported at the daily frequency, and are reported

   2
     Among many other elements, this computation does not control for the possibility that Sweden, by
getting closer to herd immunity, might have saved future deaths or, conversely, that higher death rates
today might have long-run scarring effects on Swedish GDP and labor market.

with a lag of only just a few days, an important feature given the natural lags in NIPA
reporting. We reproduce our earlier findings using the Google data and produce new
charts for key cities worldwide. The city-level data is important because of concerns
about aggregating to, say, the national level across regions of varying densities. Sec-
tion 5 shows the dynamic version of our graphs at the monthly frequency using the
Google data, so we can see how different locations are evolving. Finally, Section 6 offers
some closing thoughts.

2.       Framework

We focus on two outcomes in this paper: the loss in economic activity, as captured
by reduced GDP or increased unemployment, and the number of deaths from COVID-
19 per million people.3 Even with just these simple outcome measures, it is easy to
illustrate the subtle interactions that occur in the pandemic.

                                                                  Keep economy open


                                                         COVID DEATHS PER MILLION PEOPLE

            Note: Holding health policy and “luck” constant, economic policy implies a
            tradeoff between economic activity and deaths from COVID-19.



     To begin, Figure 2 illustrates a simple tradeoff between economic activity and deaths
from the pandemic. In the short term, economic policy can shut the economy down
sharply, which increases the economic losses on the vertical axis but saves lives on
the horizontal axis. Alternatively, policy could focus on keeping the economy active
to minimize the loss in GDP at the expense of more deaths from the pandemic.
     Figure 3 shows that the story is more complicated when health policy and luck are
brought under consideration. There can be a positive correlation between economic
losses and COVID deaths. Good NPIs — for example, widespread use of masks, bet-
ter indoor ventilation, protecting nursing homes, and targeted reductions in super-
   3
     There is a growing concern about the long-run health consequences for individuals who survived a
COVID-19 infection. However, it is too early for any systematic international comparison of those long-
run effects.

                                                                or bad luck

spreader events such as choirs, bars, nightclubs, and parties — can reduce the number
of deaths with a limited impact on production. Furthermore, by reducing the death
rate, such policies encourage economic activity by allowing people to return safely to
work and the marketplace.
   Similarly, luck plays an important but not yet fully-understood role. Where does the
coronavirus strike early versus late? Perhaps a country is in the lower-left corner today
with low deaths and little loss in GDP, but only because it has been lucky to avoid a
severe outbreak. Two months from now, things may look different. Alternatively, is a
region hit by a less infectious and deadly virus strain (see our next subsection)?
   Given the steep age pattern of COVID-19 mortality rates, basic demographic differ-
ences influence the trade-off between deaths and GDP losses. This is another dimen-
sion of what we can call luck. COVID-19 has a steep age and obesity gradient. Younger
and less-obese countries, many of them emerging market and developing economies,
have experienced much better outcomes than one would have expected (Goldberg and
Reed, 2020).
   To complicate matters, all of these forces play out over time, which gives rise to

           Note: Putting the two together explains why the data can be hard to interpret.



important dynamic considerations. For example, a community may keep the economy
open in the short term, which may lead to a wave of deaths, and then be compelled
to shut the economy down to prevent even more deaths. Two communities can end
up with large economic losses, but very different mortality outcomes, because of these
timing considerations. This can be thought of as being embodied in Figure 3.
   Figure 4 puts these mechanisms together in a single chart. It reveals that the corre-
lation between economic losses and COVID deaths that we see in the data is governed
by a sophisticated collection of forces, both static and dynamic. When we see a cloud
of data points in the empirical versions of this graph, we can think about how these
various forces are playing out.


Evidence on the Role of Mutation. We have mentioned several times that a simple
mechanism behind luck is the strain of the virus that attacked one location. From
March to May of 2020, a SARS-CoV-2 variant carrying the Spike protein G614 that likely
appeared in some moment in February replaced D614 as the dominant virus form
globally (Korber et al., 2020).
   While the global transition to the G614 variant is a well-established fact, its practical
                      MACROECONOMIC OUTCOMES AND COVID-19                             11


consequences are still debated. Korber et al. (2020) present experimental evidence that
the G614 variant is associated with greater infectivity and clinical evidence that the new
variant is linked with higher viral loads, although not with greater disease severity. Hu et
al. (2020), Ozono et al. (2020), and Zhang et al. (2020) report similar findings. However,
these latter results regarding greater infectivity and higher viral load are not yet the
consensus among scientists (Grubaugh et al., 2020).
   In other words, there is some evidence — although far from conclusive — that the
pandemic’s timing may have played a role in determining the quadrant where each
place falls in Figure 1. If indeed the original D614 variant is less infectious, Asian coun-
tries (who were exposed more to this earlier form of the virus) faced a more straight-
forward trade-off between containing the epidemic and sustaining economic activity.
Even within the U.S., California, likely due to its closer ties to Asia, experienced a higher
prevalence of lineages of D614 at the start of the health crisis than New York, closer to
Europe, and thus it had better outcomes regardless of the policies adopted.

This section shows the empirical versions of the trade-off graphs for various countries
and U.S. states using GDP and unemployment as measures of the economic outcomes.


3.1           International Evidence

We use GDP data from the OECD (2020)4 and death data from Johns Hopkins University
CSSE (2020) to study the international evidence on COVID-19 deaths and GDP. Figure 5
plots the COVID-19 deaths per million population as of October 9 against the loss in
GDP. “GDP Loss” is the cumulative loss in GDP since the start of 2020 (we currently
have data from Q1 and Q2) and is annualized. For example, a value of 6 means that the
loss since the start of 2020 is equivalent to a six percent loss in annual GDP.

     Note: “GDP Loss” is the cumulative loss in GDP since the start of 2020 and is annualized. For
     example, a value of 6 means that the loss since the start of 2020 is as if the economy lost six percent
     of its annual GDP.


         Before discussing our findings, some warnings are appropriate. First, we only have
observations up to 2020Q2. Second, the numbers released so far are likely to be revised
     4
    We also use data from various national statistical agencies for several countries not in the OECD
database; see Appendix A.
                          MACROECONOMIC OUTCOMES AND COVID-19                                      13


substantially. Even in normal times, the revisions of GDP early releases are consid-
erable (Aruoba, 2008). The difficulties in data collection during the pandemic suggest
that the revisions for 2020 are bound to be even larger.5 Third, GDP is only an imperfect
measure of economic activity. There are reasons to believe that those imperfections are
even more acute nowadays.
       For instance, consider government consumption. This item is measured by the
sum of employee compensation, consumption of fixed capital, and intermediate goods
and services purchased. Many government services, from the local DMV to public
schools, were not offered (or only offered under a very limited schedule) during the
lockdowns. However, most government employees were still paid (furloughs were rare
in OECD countries), and the consumption of fixed capital is imputed according to fixed
depreciation tables. Thus, except for some reduction of intermediate goods and ser-
vices purchased, government consumption remained unchanged from the perspective
of GDP. Indeed, in the U.S., real government consumption increased 0.6 percent in
2020Q2 while GDP dropped 9.1 percent. While part of the increase can be attributed
to the fiscal stimulus and the fight against COVID-19, a substantial part of government
consumption operated well below normal levels during that quarter with little impact
on measured GDP.
       With these considerations in mind, Figure 5 suggests that there has not been a
simple tradeoff between deaths and GDP. Rather, countries can be seen to fall into
several groups.
       First, we have countries with low deaths and moderate GDP losses: Taiwan (with
positive GDP growth!), Korea, Indonesia, Norway, Japan, China, Poland, and Germany.
Such countries illustrate an important lesson from the crisis: it was possible to emerge
with relatively good performance on both dimensions. Importantly, this group is het-
erogeneous. It includes countries in both Asia and Europe. It includes countries with
large, densely populated cities. And it includes countries that are globally highly con-

   5
    Recall, for example, the note on the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Impact on June 2020 Establishment and
Household Survey Data: “The household survey is generally collected through in-person and telephone
interviews, but personal interviews were not conducted for the safety of interviewers and respondents.
The household survey response rate, at 65 percent, was about 18 percentage points lower than in months
prior to the pandemic.” https://www.bls.gov/cps/employment-situation-covid19-faq-june-2020.pdf. A
similar issue relates to the state unemployment rates that we will use later. These rates are a combination
of survey measurement on small state-level samples and a pooled time series model run by the BLS.
During the last months, we have seen large revisions in these rates.

nected to the rest of the world, including Germany and China, the two major export
powerhouses of the world economy. Other countries nearby in the diagram include
Poland, Greece, and Estonia.
   Presumably, both good policy and good luck play important roles here. For exam-
ple, Greece, a dense country with a poor track record in terms of economic governance
and a public health system starved of resources after a decade of budget cuts, has
performed so far surprisingly well. Greece’s government approved restrictive measures
when the number of cases was minimal and directed a well-coordinated health strat-
egy. At the same time, Greece is less well connected with the rest of the European
Union and has a fragmented geography, which has slowed down the virus’s spread.
Uncovering the explanation for Greece’s success could yield important lessons.
   Next, in the graph’s upper-right part, we have countries with high death rates and
large GDP losses: France, Spain, Italy, the U.K., and Belgium. Some combination of
bad luck and imperfect policy led these regions to suffer on both dimensions during
the pandemic. The United Kingdom, as an example, has suffered from more than 600
deaths per million people and already lost the equivalent of 6 percent of a year’s GDP.
Also, high COVID-19 incidence might trigger nonlinear effects on mortality. There is
evidence that the Italian and Spanish health systems were overwhelmed in March 2020,
leading to many deaths that could have been avoided. Ciminelli and Garcia-Mandicó
(2020) show that mortality in the Italian municipalities that were far from an ICU was
up to 50 percent higher, which they argue was due to the congestion of the emergency
care system during those crucial weeks.
   A few countries in Figure 5 are harder to classify. India and the Philippines have
experienced a considerable reduction in GDP, but comparatively few deaths per million
people. As we will see later, however, the situation in India is still very much evolving.
The United States and Sweden also stand out, with many COVID-19 deaths but smaller
reductions in GDP than France, Italy, or Spain. As with India, however, the dynamic
graphs we show later suggests that the position of the United States is still in flux.
   The case of Sweden is particularly interesting because its government defied the
consensus among other advanced economies and imposed much milder restrictions
and explicitly aimed for herd immunity. Compared to the U.K., Spain, or Italy, Sweden
looks like a success story: it has a comparable number of deaths when normalized by
                       MACROECONOMIC OUTCOMES AND COVID-19                        15


population, but a significantly smaller loss in GDP. The shutdown in the U.K., Spain,
and Italy has already cost these economies the equivalent of 6 percent of their annual
GDP, while the loss in Sweden has been just 2 percent of GDP.
      On the other hand, with an alternative comparison, Sweden looks worse. In terms of
deaths, Sweden has had around 575 deaths per million population vs. 50 in Norway, 60
in Finland, 115 in Denmark, and 115 in Germany. The other Nordic countries are a nat-
ural comparison group in terms of socio-economic conditions, although differences in
population distribution and mobility within this group should not be underestimated.
Regarding economic outcomes, Norway and Sweden both report GDP losses of around
2 percent, while Denmark, Germany, and Austria are only slightly larger.
      In the case of the U.S., the current high levels of infection and deaths mean that
the country is still moving to the right in Figure 5. The recent rise in cases in Western
Europe is at such an early stage that it is impossible to gauge whether these countries
will also witness significant levels of additional deaths.
      Finally, notice that Figure 5 correlates COVID-19 deaths and GDP losses without
controlling for additional variables (initial income per capita, industrial sectoral com-
position, density, demographics, etc.). We checked for the effects of possible controls,
and we did not find any systematic pattern worth reporting.



3.2     U.S. States and Unemployment

We now consider economic outcomes and deaths from COVID-19 across U.S. states. In
this case, our measure of economic activity is the unemployment rate. Figure 6 shows
the unemployment rate for U.S. states from August 2020 plotted against the number of
deaths per million people as of October 9.
      The heterogeneity in both the unemployment rate and in COVID deaths is remark-
able. States like New York, Massachusetts, and New Jersey have more than 1200 deaths
per million residents as well as unemployment rates that even after several months of
recovery exceed 10 percent in August. In contrast, states like Utah, Idaho, Montana, and
Wyoming have very few deaths and unemployment rates of between 4 and 7 percent.
      Figure 7 cumulates the unemployment losses since February to create a more infor-
mative measure of the macroeconomic cost of the pandemic. In particular, we mea-
sure “cumulative excess unemployment” by summing the deviations from each state’s

Note: Cumulative excess unemployment adds the deviations from each state’s February 2020 rate
for each month and then divides by 12 to annualize. In other words the loss to date is equivalent to
having the unemployment rate be higher by x percent for an entire year.

February 2020 rate for each month and then dividing by 12 to annualize. In other words,
a number like 6 in the graph implies that the loss to date is equivalent to having the
unemployment rate be elevated by 6 percentage points for an entire year.
      In this figure, it is interesting to compare New York, California, and Washington
DC. Both New York and California have had large declines in economic activity, the
equivalent of having the unemployment rate be elevated by about 5 percentage points
for an entire year. However, the number of deaths is very different in these two states.
New York has around 1700 deaths per million people, while California has around 400
as of October 9. What combination of luck and policy explains this outcome? Both
states got hit relatively early by the coronavirus. Was California lucky to get a strain from
Asia that was less contagious and less deadly while New York got a strain from Europe
that was more contagious and more deadly? Or did the policy differences between New
York and California have enormous effects?
      When compared to New York, California looks like a resounding success. On the
other hand, one can also compare California to states like Washington and Minnesota,
not to mention Kentucky and Nebraska. All of these other states had similar death rates
but smaller employment losses. Did California shut down too much? Or were Nebraska
and Minnesota lucky? Or did population density play an imporant role?
      Finally, Washington DC stands out as a state with relatively small employment losses
— equivalent to an unemployment rate that is elevated by just 2 percentage points for
a year — but substantial deaths. DC looks somewhat like Sweden in this graph, but
when we turn to the Google activity data below, the story will be a bit different: the
prevalence of government jobs with stable employment may have limited the rise in
the DC unemployment rate.



3.3     International Comparisons of Unemployment

Given our previous analysis, it would seem natural to compare the evolution of unem-
ployment rates among the advanced economies. However, such a comparison is not
especially informative in gauging the effects of COVID-19.
      Many countries have passed generous government programs to induce firms to
keep workers on the payroll even during lockdowns, count workers on furloughs with
reduced pay as being employed, or classify workers who lost their jobs as out of the
         18                       FERNÁNDEZ-VILLAVERDE AND JONES



labor force if they are not searching for a new job due to the “stay-at-home” orders.
Furthermore, severance costs make firing workers after a relatively transitory shock
unattractive: firms might end up paying more in severance packages than just keep-
ing their workers at home with pay for a few months. That means that the measured
unemployment rate in some of the most severely hit countries has only increased by a
few percentage points (from 13.6% in February 2020 to 15.6% in June 2020 in Spain) or
even fallen (from 9.2% in February 2020 to 8.8% in June 2020 in Italy).6
         The main exception is the United States, which features substantially different labor
market regulations: unemployment jumped from 4.4% in February 2020 to 14.7% in
March 2020 but then declined to 7.9% in September 2020.



4.        Activity from the Google Mobility Report Data

GDP and unemployment rates are standard macroeconomic indicators that are ex-
tremely useful. However, they also suffer from some limitations related to frequency
and availability. In this section, we turn to another source of evidence: the COVID-
19 Community Mobility Report data from Google (2020). For shorthand, we will refer
to this as the “Google activity” measure. These data show how daily location activ-
ity changes over time in a large number of countries and regions. The outcomes are
grouped according to several destinations: retail and recreation, grocery and phar-
macy, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residences.
         The Google activity measure has several key advantages relative to GDP or unem-
ployment. First, it is available at a daily frequency, rather than quarterly or monthly.
Second, it is reported with a very short lag of just a few days. By comparison, we
only have 2020Q2 GDP data for a handful of countries and our latest unemployment
rate data for U.S. states is from August. Finally, the Google data is also available at
a very disaggregated geographic level, allowing us to look at cities as well as states and
countries. In what follows, we focus on Google activity, defined as the equally-weighted
average of the “retail and entertainment” and “workplace” categories.

     Similar arguments would apply to a comparison of employment rates. The number of hours worked
is reported by the OECD only at an annual frequency.

4.1     Google Activity over Time

Figures 8 shows the (smoothed) Google activity data over time for a large number of
countries, highlighting a few. Italy and Spain show very sharp declines in activity start-
ing quite early compared to the declines in the U.S., the U.K., and Germany. Activity re-
covers somewhat in May in Italy and Spain, but only gradually in the U.K. This appears
to be a case of the U.K. being slow to get the pandemic under control, suffering from
more deaths as a result, and being forced to keep its economy shut down for longer.
      The U.S. and Germany are also interesting, in comparison. They have somewhat
similar changes in activity, but, as we’ve seen, very different COVID outcomes. Among
the highlighted countries, Germany had the smallest loss in economic activity and the
fewest deaths.
      Next, consider Figure 9 which highlights the Scandinavian countries. These coun-
tries have even milder shutdowns than Germany and the United States. Sweden’s shut-
down is initially the mildest but by June it looks similar to Germany, Denmark, and
Norway.

Global Cities. Figure 10 shows the Google activity measure for 14 key international
cities or regions. Lombardy and Seoul have very early shutdowns with 20 percent de-
clines in activity by the first of March. Madrid and Paris and then New York City and fi-
nally London follow them down, with all four seeing activity down by around 80 percent
as of April 1. Seoul recovers very quickly, while Tokyo sees a slow decline. Stockholm
also has mild losses according to the Google activity measure.



U.S. States. Figure 11 shows the Google activity data for U.S. states. The heterogeneity
of experience stands out, with some states close to “normal” by the summer while
others remain 30 to 40 percent below baseline. Interestingly, Washington DC stands
out: it has the largest decline of any state at virtually all dates, with activity more than
50 percent below baseline throughout the summer. Recall the contrast with the unem-
ployment data shown earlier in Figures 6 and 7. As the nation’s capital, Washington DC
is a special place: a large fraction of jobs are in the government sector and so therefore
experienced small declines, while many employees are highly mobile, both nationally
and internationally, resulting in large losses in Google activity.

   Finally, Figure 12 combines some of the key states and countries into a single graph
for ease of comparison. The declines in Google activity in Italy and the U.K. are sub-
stantially larger than the declines in New York state and California, while Germany
stands out as having even milder declines in activity than Florida. While the U.K. was
slower than Italy (and slower than Spain and Germany — see Figure 8) to shut down, it
was as fast as New York and contracted economic activity more severely. New York state
had much worse outcomes in terms of deaths (1700 versus 600), and this is true even if
we compare New York City (2800) versus London (650)

4.2     Correlating Economic Activity and Google Mobility


                    Figure 13: Cumulative Google Activity and Lost GDP




Note: “GDP Loss” reports the cumulative loss in GDP since the start of 2020 as a percent of annual GDP.
“Google Cumulative Reduced Activity” measures the total amount of lost Google activity at an annual rate.
The correlation in the graph is 0.65.



      Before showing the “tradeoff” graphs with the Google activity measure, we first
demonstrate that this measure is correlated with the GDP loss and cumulative excess
unemployment. The correlation with the GDP loss is shown in Figure 13. Here and
in what follows, we add up the areas in the Google activity graphs shown above to
get a cumulative loss in Google activity. In particular, “Google Cumulative Reduced
Activity” measures the total amount of lost Google activity at an annual rate. A value
of 20 indicates that, relative to baseline, it is as if activity at retail, entertainment, and
workplace locations was reduced by 20 percent for an entire year. For example, a 40
percent reduction in activity each month for six months would deliver this value.
      Figure 13 illustrates that the Google activity measure is a useful proxy for economic
activity. The correlation between the loss in GDP and the cumulative reduction in
activity is 0.65 (the square root of 0.43).
      Figure 14 shows this same kind of evidence for U.S. states, only this time for cumu-
late excess unemployment. The correlation with Google activity is 0.50 if Washington

       Figure 15: Covid Deaths (Latest) and Cumulative Google Activity (September)




  Note: Google activity is the equally-weighted average of the “retail and entertainment” and
  “workplace” categories. “Cumulative” refers to the fact that we add up the losses for every month
  since February 2020.




4.3     Cumulative Results

Countries. Figure 15 shows the cumulative lost activity according to the Google mo-
bility data as of October 9. The first thing to appreciate is that the graph looks very
similar to the GDP loss graph in Figure 5. This is of course just another way of saying
that the GDP data and Google data are highly correlated.
      The key takeaways from this figure are therefore also similar. Belgium, the U.K.,
Spain, and Italy have both very high deaths and very large losses in macroeconomic
activity. Taiwan, Korea, and Japan, as well as Denmark, Norway, and Germany are in the
lower left of the graph, with good performance on both dimensions. Sweden stands out.
It looks successful compared to countries like the U.K., Spain, and Italy, with similar
deaths but much smaller losses in GDP. On the other hand, compared to Norway and
Germany, Sweden looks much less successful, with similar losses in economic activity
but far more deaths. The United States is a similar case in that it has fewer deaths
and smaller losses in economic activity than the U.K., Spain, and Italy, but looks much
worse than Norway and Germany. India stands out in the “northwest” quadrant of the
graph, having large losses in economic activity with comparatively few deaths. The

U.S. and India have the additional disadvantage — discussed more below — that their
situations are still very much evolving.


Cities.     Figure 16 shows one of advantages of the Google data by disaggregating to the
city level for a collection of key cities around the world. Broadly speaking, we see the
same types of outcomes for cities that we saw for countries and states with the earlier
macroeconomic data. New York City has by far the highest death rate in the world
at around 2800 per million people. Interestingly, it also has the largest cumulative
economic loss, equivalent to around 35 percent of a year’s activity.
    The economic loss is only slightly larger than losses in other cities such as London,
Paris, and San Francisco. These cities have far fewer deaths than New York City, how-
ever, at around 650 per million for London and Paris and just 220 for the San Francisco
Bay Area.
    Madrid, Boston, and Lombardy stand out the way Spain and Italy did before, with a
high death rate and large economic losses. In contrast, Seoul and Tokyo are much like
South Korea and Japan. Stockholm also plays the same role that Sweden did.
    Finally, cities such as Los Angeles and Houston lie in the middle, with deaths some-
what similar to Paris and London, but with noticeably less cumulative loss in economic
activity.

U.S. States.       Figure 17 shows the Google activity data and deaths for U.S. states. Apart
from Washington D.C. — where the large decline in activity contrasts with the small rise
in the unemployment rate, as noted above —the pattern is quite similar to what we saw
in the unemployment data back in Figure 7.

5.     Dynamic Versions of the Trade-off Graphs

We now take advantage of the high-frequency nature of both the Google activity data
and the Covid data to examine the dynamic evolution of our outcomes. In what follows,
we show our outcomes at the monthly frequency, from March through September.
Each dot in the graph is a monthly observation, connected in order, and with the lo-
cation name highlighted next to the most recent observation. After experimenting with
different ways of showing these data, we focus on plots for the current (flow) Google
activity measure instead of the cumulative loss in economic activity.

     Note: The vertical axis is the current flow of Google activity, averaged for each month. The
     horizontal axis plots log(1+deaths) where deaths are as of the 15th of each month.




Countries. Figure 18 shows the dynamics for the flow of Google activity for a small
set of countries, focused on the U.S. and some key European economies. The general
pattern is that between March and April, countries move sharply up and to the right,
as Covid deaths explode and the economies severely restrict economic activity. After
April, countries break in two directions. Italy, Germany, Norway, and the U.K. see their
Covid deaths stabilize either by May or certainly by June, and economic activity starts
to recover: the dynamics take the lines sharply downward. In Sweden and the United

States, in contrast, the pandemic continues: deaths continue to increase and economic
activity recovers much less; the movement is more to the right instead of straight down.
   Figure 19 shows this same kind of graph for an additional dozen countries including
Taiwan, South Korea, India, Japan, Mexico, France, and Spain. The same two types of
experiences are seen among these additional countries. Most have a large sharp move
up and to the right followed by a recovery in economic activity and a stabilization of
deaths, illustrated by the vertical nature of the lines in the graph. In contrast, Mexico,
India, and Indonesia experience a persistent move to the right as the pandemic contin-
ues and deaths have yet to stabilize.

  Note: See notes to Figure 18.




Global cities.    Figure 20 shows similar dynamics for key cities around the world. New
York City, Lombardy, Madrid, London, and Paris all move sharply up and to the right
with the onset of the pandemic. By May, however, the stabilization of deaths and the
gradual reopening of the economies is apparent in the vertical portion of the curve.
   Stockholm is an interesting contrast in that Google activity declines by only about
20 to 30 percent for the entire spring, far less than in many other cities. On the other
hand, the rightward move continues for longer, resulting in appreciably more deaths.

  Note: See notes to Figure 18.



   Finally, Tokyo and Seoul are interesting to compare. Tokyo had a much larger de-
cline in economic activity peaking at around 45 percent in April and May. By compari-
son, Seoul saw reductions of 20 percent or less each month. While both cities end with
enviably low deaths, the death rate in Seoul is around 4 per million versus around six
times larger at 24 per million in Tokyo.
   Figure 21 shows a similar graph for several other cities in the United States. Here
the continued rightward moves in Houston, Miami, Los Angeles, and San Francisco are
evidence that the pandemic is not yet under control.


U.S. states.       The next two figures show the dynamics for U.S. states, confirming the
two types of patterns we’ve seen in countries and cities. Figure 22 shows that in states
like New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, deaths have
stabilized. By contrast, Figure 23 shows many states where this is not true. The contin-
ued rightward movement documents the continued rise in deaths from COVID-19.

6.    Conclusion

We have combined data on GDP, unemployment, and Google’s COVID-19 Community
Mobility Reports with data on deaths from COVID-19 to study the pandemic’s macroe-
conomic outcomes.
     Our main finding is that most countries/regions/cities fall in either of two groups:
large GDP losses and high fatality rates (New York City, Lombardy, United Kingdom,..)
or low GDP losses and low fatality rates (Germany, Norway, Kentucky, ...). Only a few
exceptions, mainly California and Sweden, depart from this pattern.
     This correlation has a simple explanation at a mechanical level. Through some
combination of government mandates and voluntary changes in behavior, those ar-
eas that suffered high mortality reduced economic activity dramatically to lower social
contacts and slow down the pandemic’s spread. In comparison, those locations that
were able to control the virus from the beginning could maintain economic activity
and suffer fewer deaths.
     This observation suggests that controlling the epidemic is vital to mitigating GDP
losses. It is easy to be sympathetic with this view, as it avoids the classical trade-offs
in economics between alternative ends. With COVID-19, the evidence suggests that it
is possible to be successful on both dimensions, minimizing deaths as well as other
economic losses.
     Nonetheless, it is challenging given our current data to gauge the extent to which a
low death toll was the product of good luck versus good policy. Taiwan, South Korea,
and Germany have been praised for their early and aggressive testing programs and
intensive use of contact tracing, and several papers have highlighted the effectiveness
of non-pharmaceutical interventions. But Taiwan and South Korea might have been hit
by a less contagious form of the virus and might have benefited from prior experience
with SARS and MERS. More of the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in Germany might have
occurred among younger cohorts than in other European countries. Further research
will be required to separate the roles of luck from policy and to determine which poli-
cies were especially effective.
     These arguments also work in reverse when we analyze the two main outliers in
our data set: California and Sweden. California seems to have lost too much GDP
given the severity of the health crisis it faced. Sweden could have reduced its mortality
   34                        FERNÁNDEZ-VILLAVERDE AND JONES



without too much GDP loss, at least as suggested by its Nordic neighbors’ performance.
But again, California was hit early by the first form of virus, perhaps less contagious.
From the perspective of California’s policymakers, the decisions taken ex-ante in March
might be fully justified even if too tight ex-post. Sweden might have suffered from
higher density in Stockholm, worse demographics, and other social differences with
its neighbors.
   Finally, we should notice that COVID-19 has policy spillovers, both in terms of health
and economic outcomes. Had Italy controlled its epidemic earlier, France and Ger-
many might have suffered a milder crisis. And if China had not undertaken draconian
measures in Wuhan, South Korea might look very different today. Before rushing to
judgment regarding the effect of different policies, these spillover effects must be ana-
lyzed in more detail. Regarding economic outcomes, a fall in global economic activity
has dire consequences even for countries that have been able to control the virus. For
example, Goldberg and Reed (2020) document that emerging market and developing
economies have suffered from massive capital outflows and large price declines for
certain commodities, especially oil and nonprecious metals.
   Our conclusions are subject to a fundamental consideration. Health professionals
in China started to suspect the presence of a new respiratory disease in the last week of
December 2019. The first public message regarding the pandemic occurred on Decem-
ber 31, 2019, and was reported as a minor news item by a few Western media outlets.
Only ten months have passed since that news.
   Furthermore, the pandemic continues. Even in the best-case scenario in which
effective vaccines and rapid tests become widely available by early 2021, we still face, at
the very least, several more months of the current situation. There are already some
indications that an additional wave of the pandemic may crest in the autumn and
winter.
   All the graphs that we report may look quite different six months from now. By then,
it may be much more apparent how much the divergence in outcomes is driven by luck
and by policy.

A.       Data Sources

Our GDP data comes mainly from the OECD (2020). We look at quarterly GDP, total,
in percentage change with respect to the previous period. We add a few observations,
such as Taiwan, not covered by the OECD.
       Our death data comes from Johns Hopkins University CSSE (2020). We must re-
member, nevertheless, that data about deaths are subject to undercount and interpre-
tation.
       Regarding undercounting, and especially during the start of the epidemic, not all
patients that died were tested for COVID-19. This was particularly true in Italy and
Spain, where deaths were initially heavily concentrated in nursing homes, whose man-
agement became overwhelmed with the health crisis. Regarding interpretation, COVID-
19 is particularly lethal for older individuals with comorbidities. Imagine the case of a
patient with terminal cancer that dies while infected with COVID-19. Should we count
this as a COVID-19 death?
       However, undercounting is likely to be of an order of magnitude more important
than interpretation discrepancies. Several countries have centralized vital record sys-
tems that track all death certificates issued. Since these certificates are important for
basic administrative procedures, compliance is close to universal. We can then use the
total number of deaths observed in 2020 and subtract a forecast of deaths for 2020,
given deaths in past years (and controlling for aging, weather, etc.) to obtain a measure
of excess deaths.
       The differences between death data from Johns Hopkins University CSSE (2020) and
excess deaths can be considerable. Consider the case of Spain.7 Excess deaths between
March 13 and October 7 according to the national mortality registry were 44,493, while
the Johns Hopkins University CSSE (2020) deaths for the same period were 32,429, a
difference of 37.2 percent.8
       At the same time, excess deaths have their own interpretation problems. First, if
COVID-19 caused the deaths of many older individuals that were forecast to die in a
   7
    See https://momo.isciii.es/public/momo/dashboard/momo dashboard.html for details.
   8
    March 13 was the first day total deaths were outside the 99 percent confidence interval of the forecast
that used historical data, weather, and demographics. October 7 was the last day, so far, where total deaths
were outside that confidence interval. Also, notice that the national mortality registry only reports data
from electronic death certificates, which are issued by the local offices that cover around 93% of the total
population. Thus excess deaths are likely to be around 48,000.
    40                      FERNÁNDEZ-VILLAVERDE AND JONES



few months, a higher excess death in March will be compensated by an negative excess
death, let’s say, in November, masking the true COVID-19-related deaths in that month.
Conversely, low deaths in previous years (such as mild flu season in 2019) might have
implied a high mortality in 2020 even in the absence of the epidemic.
    Second, the lockdowns also affected other death causes, both lowering them (fewer
traffic and work accidents) and increasing them (fewer medical procedures undertaken,
worsening physical and mental health triggered by the lockdowns and the economic
crisis).
    While we do not believe that Figure 5 would dramatically change once researchers
have more accurate counts of COVID-19 deaths, this is an additional aspect where
caution is necessary.
