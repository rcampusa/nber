    STOCK MARKET FORECASTABILITY AND VOLATILITY:     A STATISTICAL APPRAISAL


                                    ABSTRACT

      This paper presents and implements statistical tests of stock market

 forecastability and volatility that are immune from the severe statistical

 problems of earlier tests.   Although the null hypothesis of strict market

 efficiency is rejected, the evidence against the hypothesis is not

 overwhelming.   That is, the data do not provide evidence of gross violations

 of the conventional valuation model.
