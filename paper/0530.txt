         Does the Investment Interest Limitation Explain
                   the Existence of Dividends?


                             AB S TRACT




    Miller and Scholes show that under certain conditions the Federal

Income tax taxes dividend income at a rate no higher than the rate on

capital gains. Tabulations of actual 1977 tax returns show that the

special circumstances under which this can occur apply to less than

3% of dividend income and no significant role can be ascribed to their

result in the determination of corporate dividend policy.

      "[the deduction of interesti permits the taxpayer to make loans for the
      purchase of wholly exempt securities and then deduct the interest paid on
      such loans from his otherwise taxable income, thereby reducing the tax."
                                                     —— A Senate report of 19181


      Miller and Scholes (1918) propose the following strong dividend invariance

proposition: "Given the firm's investment decision, the firm's dividend

decision will have no effect on the wealth or economic welfare of its

[rationall shareholders." This stands in sharp contrast to the conventional

view that taxable shareholders will prefer capital gains to dividends both

because capital gains are taxed at a lower rate and because taxation of such

gains is deferred until realization. This note begins with a short restatement

of the conditions necessary for dividend invariance to hold, and concludes with

a   measurement made from a large sample of the U.S. tax returns of the extent to
which these conditions   hold. It is shown that the special circumstances under

which Miller and Scholes' hypothesis can occur are so rare that no role may logi-

cally be ascribed to the hypothesis in the determination of corporate dividend

policy.

       Conventional finanical wisdom suggests that individual shareholders

could have saved half or more of the over eight billion dollars in taxes paid

on twenty—six billion dollars in dividend income reported on their 1911 indivi-

dual income tax returns. This would require only that firms make more extensive

use of well known   techniques   for converting dividends to capital gains.

       Miller and Scholes present a clever explanation for this seemingly irra—

tional behavior of firms. They suggest that earlier authors have not read the
                                         —2—

tax code carefully, and that the rational, wealth—maximizing taxpayer—

shareholder will actually pay a lower rate of tax on dividends than on capital

gains. This surprising outcome is the result of the interaction of a time

honored tax dodge ——   borrowing   to finance tax favored investment ——and a little

known section of the current tax law which regulates that practice. In essence,

Miller and Scholes propose that for each dollar of dividend income that share-

holders receive they should borrow a sufficient sum of money to produce a one

dollar interest expense deduction. If the loan proceeds are invested in a

single payment annuity or some other tax favored security a net reduction in

taxable income is achieved.2 Furthermore, if the altered cash flow presents a

problem for the taxpayer, it may be possible to borrow against the increasing

cash value of the annuity to finance the interest payments due on the loan. By

this strategy, which Miller and Scholes dub "dividend laundering" it is possible

to build   a portfolio with the risk—return structure of the stock, but with the
tax deferral advantage of the annuity.3 In an optimal portfolio enough income
would be sheltered in this fashion to bring the taxpayer's current bracket rate
on ordinary income down to the effective bracket rate on capital gains. Because

this strategy minimizes taxes without changing the risk—return structure of the

portfolio, it dominates any portfolio with a lesser amount of debt.

     Absent any other consideration this arbitrage opportunity would not

explain the existence of dividends, because capital gains could be sheltered

through the same mechanism. Indeed, because of the sixty percent capital

gains exclusion, the distribution of profits as capital gains would economize

on the possibly costly tax shelter. The hypothesized preference for divi-

dends is a consequence of Section 163(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, the

investment interest limitation.
                                         —3—



That regulation effectively limits the deduction of interest paid to mortgage

payments plus dividend and interest income plus 10,000 dollars.5

      The intent of this rule was to allow deductions for interest paid on

mortgages and loans used to purchase assets producing taxable income and to

disallow the deduction if the proceeds of the loan are invested in a tax

favored device. Actually, any amount of interest or dividend income may be

sheltered with this device but the regulation does restrict the ability of

taxpayers to shelter labor income from taxation and it introduces an addi-

tional distinction between the taxation of dividends and that of capital

gains. For the taxpayer constrained by this section marginal capital gains

are   taxed at the regular capital gains rate but each additional dollar of
dividend income would allow the taxpayer to increase his borrowing suf-
ficiently to wipe out the additional tax liability. Such taxpayers may     be

expected   to prefer firms   to pay out profits as dividends rather than convert

those   profits to capital gains. Simply put, increased dividends allow the
taxpayer   who is constrained by the limit on interest deductions to increase his

borrowing for investment in tax shelter annuities. If this situation were

widespread, and the reasoning in Miller and Scholes' paper suggests it might

be, section 163(d) would provide an explanation for the observed dividend

policy of pubic corporations.

        Section 163(d) is a recent addition to the tax law. An early version in

effect from 1969 to 1915 set a maximum investment interest deduction of 150%

of the sum of $25,000 and investment income, but investment income was

defined to include realized capital gains as well as interest, dividends,

rents and royalties. Only in the Tax Reform Act of 1975 were capital gains
                                        _)4..




excluded from investment income, so that only for tax years 1916 and beyond

does section 163(d) have any possible relevance to the dividend payout

sion. While there has been some increase in dividend payouts since 1975

there remains a very large base ——23 billion dollars ——   wanting explanation.
        Miller and Scholes' article contains almost no data to support their

conclusions about the importance of section 163(d). The figures offered by

them on aggregate tax sheltered investment and aggregate interest deductions

are consistent with all or no taxpayers preferring dividends to capital

gains, depending on the correlation between investment in tax shelters and

debt.

        A measure of the fraction of dividends received by taxpayers constrained or

nearly constrained by section 163(d) would be the most powerful empirical test

of dividend laundering as an explanation for observed dividend payouts.

Fortunately quite conclusive evidence on who receives dividends is available in

the 1977 Tax Model file prepared by the U.S. Treasury. The Tax Model is a

public use sample of 155,000 actual federal income tax returns selected from the

universe of 86 million returns. Because the sample is weighted heavily towards

high income taxpayers (and includes the return of every taxpayer with any income

item over 200,000 dollars) sampling errors are roughly independent of income

level. For reasons of econonr in this tabulation a subset of the treasury file

is used including one half of the returns with adjusted gross income over 200,000

dollars and one tenth of all other returns.
                                        —5—




     In   Table one column five shows the number of taxpayers constrained or

nearly constrained by section 163(d). A taxpayer is regarded as being nearly

constrained if a reduction in dividends of one thousand dollars would subject

him to the limitation on the deduction of investment interest. The estimate

number of such taxpayers is small; however in the highest income categories

almost 1/3 of taxpayers are constrained. Columns six and seven show the total

dividends received by all taxpayers and by constrained (or nearly constrained)

taxpayers, respectively. Miller and Scholes do suggest that the number of

constrained shareholders may not be very relevant to the dividend payout deci-

sion ——they may be few in number but important in corporate decision making. In

no income class do constrained taxpayers receive as much as fifteen percent of

dividend income for that class, and overall they receive only about two and one

half of percent of such income. It is not credible that so small a segment

of the ownership of a public corporation could determine dividend policy to the

detriment of the other taxable owners of the stock. Nor does the conclusion

change significantly if the point estimate of dividends received by constrained

taxpayers is off by several standard errors.

     Because the constraint implicit in section 163(d) is not binding for any

significant fraction of taxpayers, or for taxpayers receiving any significant

fraction of dividend income, it is impossible to ascribe to that section any

significant role in the determination of corporate dividend policy.

2There is an alternative simpler strategy not mentioned by Miller and Scholes.

The   taxpayer could sell his stock and purchase an insurance policy with the same
risk and return as the stock. We know that the insurance company could offer
such a policy; it   need   only add the relevant stock to its portfolio to be per-
fectly hedged.   The more complicated procedure does manage to avoid a capital

gains realization. The point to remember is that the borrowing and lending

doesn't create any new tax shelters, it simply alters the rewards of those which

already exist.


3or fairly detailed, but hardly conclusive views of the legality of this proce-

dure, the reader is referred to Klein (1962) and Asiniov (1977). In principle

the interest deduction may be disallowed if the combination of loan and tax

shelter has no significant beneficial function other than the reduction of

taxes. In practice the IRS is likely to disallow the deduction if the only

security for the loan is the cash value of the shelter. For the taxpayer with a

small enough spread between his borrowing and lending rate this need not be a

serious obstacle, since some other collateral may be used.


Details of Section 163(d) are in Bierman and Stechel (1977).


5Briefly, the investment interest deduction is the interest deduction less the

home mortgage deduction.

effectively tax—free and taxpayers should display complete indifference between

dividends and unrealized capital gains.
