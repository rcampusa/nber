          A Multinominal Logistic Approach to the Labor Force Behavior
                           of Japanese Married Women




                                   ABSTRACT


       Using a multanornial logistic approach, we analyze the inter-
 dependencies among the labor force participation decisions of
married women an Japan. These decisions are working part—tame,

working full-time, being unemployed (in the labor market but
unable to find work), and not participating. Our focus is on the
interdependency between the decision to work part-time and the
decision to work full—time. Our results indicate that married

women working full—time view part-time work as a good substitute,
but the reverse is not observed. We also obtain estimates of the

own—wage elasticity for both forms of participation and find that

part—time labor force particicipation of Japanese married women
is substantially more elastic than that of their full-time coun-

terparts. These findings reinforce the view that married women in
Japan with loose ties to the labor market are quite responsive to
changes in the returns to work.

      Recent contributions rrom Hill (1983, 1984)         and Sharnada and
Haguchi (1985) have made £aqnifacant changes an the analysis of
female labor force behavior an Japan. These studies specifically
focus on female employees an the labor market by isolating self-
employed arid family workers in the informal sector. These recent
results showed a positive effect 01 wages on          labor   force par-
ticipation decisions of married women.1 What is massing from
their analyses is a systerintac examination or the behavior of
marraea women who choose to work only        part-time,   accounting for
approximately half of the married women in urban Japan according
to the 1980 Population Census of Japan.          As studies using United
States    and Canadian data have    shown, the    response of part-time
working married women to changes in the returns to work is quite
different from that of their full-tame counterparts (for example,

Mcrcensterri and Hamovitch 1976; Long and Jones 1980; Nakamura and
Nakarnura   1983) . The   increa sang importance of part-time working

     In this paper, we investigate the interdependency of   four
alternative labor force participation statuses using a multi-
nomial logistic approach. The four mutually exclusive and exhaus-
tive labor force participation decisions are working full-tame,

working part-time, unemployment, and not participating. by ais-
taricuishang among the participation decisions we can obtain
separate estimates of the own—wage elasticity of married women
working part-tame and full-tame, and also identify inter-
depedencies through their cross-wage elasticities.
     The organization of the subsequent sections is as follows:
Section II outlines the model and our a-priori expectations of
the effects of the variables in the model on labor force par-

ticipation behavior, Section Ill reports the empirical results,
and, finally, Section IV gives our conclusions.
LI. 1b QI &ilysi.
     The variables in our model are cross-sectional market

averages primarily drawn from the 1980 Population Census of
Japan. The units of observation are the urban areas of the 47

prefectures of Japan. The advantages of using cross-sectional
market averages, as discussed by Cain and Dooley (1976) and Link
and Settle (1981), are that. variations in tastes and transitory
wages within a given geographical area can be averaged out. By
differentiating married women whose spouses are present from
other women, distinguishing urban Japan from rural Japan, and
separating full—time and part-time work decisions, our sample

represents a relatively homogeneous group of married women,
resulting in consistent estimates of the structural par-ameters.
     Our multinomial logistic approach assumes that a married
woman faces four mutually exclusive alter-natives with the cor-

responding probabilities p1w. p2. p3, arid p4, which represent the
probability that the woman chooses full-time work, part-time

work, unemployment, or non-participation, respectively. By
definition, the sum   of   the probabilities as equal to one. The

logistic probability function is:

 Further insight into the part-came labor supply decj.saons ct
Japanese married women awaits the availability of indivi<ual and
longitudinal data. See Dooley (1982) for arguments an favor of
using micro data in place of aggrecate cross-sectional data.

         By solving for the log-odds ratio or the                   type of par-
ticipation decision (p relative to p4) ,                the   logistic equation
can     be expressed in the linear form:

The marginal effect of X on p is obtained from:

        In our model, the p are unobserved and constrained to the
interval from zero to one. For the estimation of equation (3) , we

substitute Pf (the proportion of married women, spouse present,
ages 15 and older who are full-time participants in the labor

market) for p1; p (the proportion of those women who are part-
t.ame   participants.)    for p2; Pu (the proportion of unemployed
married women) for p3; and p (the proportion of those women who
are non-participants) for p4.

        Our theoretical framework suggests that the following vari-
ables are important in         analyzing
                                 the interdependency among Pf
PpV r'u and p: full-time women's wages, part-time women's wages,
men's wages, the unemployment rate, women's education, the en-
rol:Lment      of pro-school children in          either nurseries or day-care
centers,       and the proportion of employment an manufacturing and
hoiè1è and retail trade.3

following expectations about the effects of the independent
variables.

     1.) Full-came women's wages have a positive effect on full—
tame participation and a negative effect on part-time participa-
tion because married women may substitute full—time work for
part-tame work as the relative wage for full-time work rises.
     2.) Part—tame women's wages have a negative effect on full—
time participation and a positive effect on part—time participa-
tion for reasons similar to those stated in 1.

     3.) Men's wages have a negative effect on both full—time arid
part—tame participation because of the income effect (Kal-
lingsworth 1983).

     4.) The unemployment rate can have either positive or nega-
tive effects on any measure of participation depending on whether
the added worker or discouraged worker effect dominates (Furugori
1980; Shimada arid Higuchi 1985).

     5. Women's education can also have either positive or
negative effects. If,   as   they acquire more education, women's
reservation wages increase, the effect will be negative (Long and
Jones 19b0). On the other hand, higher levels of education may
reflect a taste for work arid/or access to jobs with nonpecuniary

benefits, resulting in a positive efiec.t 'Cain and Dooley 1976).

     6.) The proportion of pre-school children in nurseries and
day-care centers has a positive effect on all participation
decisions   since married   women with pre - school children   can sub-
stitute the use of nurseries and day-czre centers for their own
time inputs in child-rearing (Schultz 1978).
     7.) The proportion of employmcnt an manufacturing and

                                   -'-)-
wholesale arid   recaal   trade has a posatave effect on any par-

tacapataon measure, reflecting andutraes which heavily employ
women (Japan 1982, 1984).

        Using a multinomial logistic approach, we estimate a model
of the labor force participation decisions of Japanese married
women, using data from the 1980 Population Census for the urban
areas of the 47 prefectures of Japan. The parameter estimates are
given in Table 1, and the marginal effects of the independent

variables and their estimated elasticities calculated at the
sample means are reported in Table 2.
        Full-time women's wages have a statistically significant
coefficient in the full-time equation (ln(Pf/p) dependent) and

in the unemployment equation (ln(p/p) dependent), but are not
significant in the part-time equation (ln(p/p) dependent).4 The
sign of the marginal effect is not directly obtained from the

sign of the estimated logit coefficient, but from the application
of equations (4) and (5) of Section II. The signs of the marginal

effects of full—time wages, positive for full-time participation
and negative for part time participation, are as expected. The
positive marginal effect on unemployed participants and the
negative effect on non-participants shows movement into the labor
force of women attracted by a relatively higher wage but who were
unable to find work.

        Our estimated own-wage elasticity for full-time participa-
tion is 0.15. Hill (1984), using 1970 Japanese Population Census
data, found this elasticity to be 0.44 for all women, large

relative to our estimate as a result of the lumping together of

full-tame and part-time, single and married women. Shimada and

Haguchi     (1985) ,   using cross—sectional macro data for 1977, es-
timated     own—wage elasticities in the range 0.04 to 0.22 for
married women ages 35 and older, results which are comparable to
ours. Looking at U.S. and Canadian studies, we find that our
estimate as similar to the 0.27 estimate for full-time U.S.

married women (those whose average weekly hours exceed 32) of
Morgenstern and Hamovitch (1976), but is significantly different
from that of Nakamura and Nakamura (1983) whose estimates for
U.S. and Canadian full tame working married women (those whose
annual hours of work are greater than or equal to 1,400) range
from -0.03 to -0.09.

        The coefficient of part-time women's wages is statistically
sienaficant     in both   the full—tame and the part—tame equations,
but   as   not an the unemployment equation. The marginal effect of
part-time wages on the probability of part-time participation is
positive as hypothesized. The strong negative marginal effect of
the part-time wage on the full-time participation probability is
indacative of movement from full-time work to part-time work as
the   relative part-tame wage rises.
        There are no    related studies of Japanese women's part—time
labor participation for us        to   compare our results to, however
th-re   have been some               data. Our estimated own-wage
                            done using U.S.
elasticity for part-time married women's labor participation in
      s 0.79, as compared with estimates of 0.25 and 0.55
rer:rte-d   by Long and Jones     (1980) and   Morgenstern   and Hamovitch
(I'76) ,    respectively.    Their lower estimates may be     the   result of
the omission of a full-time women's wage variable from their

part-time labor supply regressions producing estimates which are
                   5
biased downwards. Also, Japanese married women are more loosely
attached to the labor market, putting household work ahead of
part-time work.

     Men's wages have a statistically significant coefficient in
all three equations, and the marginal effect as negative an all
three, as anticipated. Our men's wage elasticities are -0.62 and
—0.51 for full—time and part-time married women's participation
decisions, respectively. These are similar to the estimates found
by Hill (1984) of -0.52, Nagano (1980) in the range -0.38 to
-0.72, Shimada et al. (1981) in the range -0.02 to -0.31, and
Shimada and Higuchi (1985) in the range -0.02 to -0.40 leading to
the conclusion that women's labor force participation is irielas—
tic with respect to men's wages.
     The two   most consistently significant variables in the three
equations are the unemployment rate and the proportion of
children an nurseries and day—care centers. The negative marginal
effect of the unemployment rate on the probabilities of full—time
and part-time participation reflects the dominance of the dis-
couraged worker effect over the added worker   effect, supporting
the earlier findings of FurUgori (1980) and Shimada and Haguchi
(1985). The strong positave effect of the nursery/day-care vari-

able on any   participation decision indicates that greater
availabalaty of these facilities enab1e married women to sub—
he omission of a full-tame women's wae variable would cause
the estimated coefficient on the part-time women's wage variable
to be biased dcn-ards. This happens t a rise an the relative
full-time wage results an die substiticution of full-tame work
for part-came work, if the two wages are positively correlated.

statute for   their o.m time in   child-care   makinq   it easier   for
them to participate in the labor market.

     The results obtained for the women's education and industry
mix variables are in general disappointing. We reestimated the
three equations leaving out the education variable, but there
were almost no qualtatative or quantitative differences from the
results reported here. The marginal effect of the variable for
the proportion of employment an manufacturing and wholesale and
retail trade is negative in the full—time equation and positive
in the part—tame equation. These industries are particularly
vulnerable to seasonal and cyclical variations. Employers find at

advantageous to hire part-time working married women with lower
wages and quasi—faxed costs than their full-time counterparts.

      Our major interest in this study was the interdependency
among the labor force participation decisions of Japanese married
women, particularly between the decisions to work part-tame and
full—time. Based on our multinomial logistic approach, we can
conclude that full-time working married women view working part-
time as a good substitute, but the reverse as not witnessed. A
possible reason for this is that full-time work requires a much
stronger commitment to the labor market that married part—time
participants are unwilling to make even at higher wages.
      We also find a major difference between the own—wage elas-
ticities of part-time and full-time working married women. The
estimate for the former is substantially higher than that for    the
latter,   while both estimates are positive. These findings rein-
force the view that Japanese married women with loose attachments
to the labor market are quite responsive to changes an the
returns to work.
