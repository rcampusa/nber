        This paper models and tests the implications of costly enforcement of property rights on the
pattern of foreign direct investment (FDI). We posit that domestic agents have a comparative advantage
over foreign agents in overcoming some of the obstacles associated with corruption and weak institutions.
We model these circumstances in a principal-agent framework with costly ex-post monitoring and
enforcement of an ex-ante labor contract. Ex-post monitoring and enforcement costs are assumed to be
lower for domestic entrepreneurs than for foreign ones, but foreign producers enjoy a countervailing
productivity advantage. Under these asymmetries, multinationals pay higher wages than domestic
producers, in line with the insight of efficiency wages and with the evidence about the ‘multinationals
wage premium.’ FDI is also more sensitive to increases in enforcement costs.

        We then test this prediction for a cross section of developing countries. We use Mauro’s (2001)
index of economic corruption as an indicator of the strength of property right enforcement within a given
country. We compare corruption levels for a large cross section of countries in 1989 to subsequent FDI
flows from 1990 to 1999. We find that corruption is negatively associated with the ratio of subsequent
foreign direct investment flows to both gross fixed capital formation and to private investment. This
finding is true for both simple cross-sections and for cross-sections weighted by country size.

1. Introduction

        The large increase in FDI in recent decades has stimulated a growing empirical and

theoretical literature.1 The salient empirical regularities emerging from this literature include

the finding of a hefty “multinational wage premium” – multinationals’ wages exceed the

wages paid by domestic producers by a significant margin, and multinationals’ productivity

tends to be higher than that of domestic producers.2 The purpose of this paper is to outline

and to test a model that provides an interpretation to these findings. Specifically, we identify

situations where it is in multinational’s self interest to pay a wage premium relative to

domestic producers.

        A number of previous papers have concentrated on knowledge spillovers as an

argument for a multinational wage premium. Fosfuri, et al (2001) introduce a model where a

multinational pays its trained workers a higher wage to induce it to resist moving to a local

competitor. Our analysis focuses on the role of weaknesses in the enforcement of property

rights, as measured by the domestic level of corruption, on the pattern and behavior of

multinationals. Weak property rights, and corruption in particular, have been identified as a

major obstacle to development, potentially reducing both FDI and domestic investment.3

          Despite efforts to limit such behavior, corruption and bribery appear to be prevalent

features of foreign direct investment activities. For example, Hines (1995) examines the

impact of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 forbidding foreign bribery by American

firms on subsequent FDI growth in corrupt nations originating in the United States. Hines

finds that the law put US firms at a competitive disadvantage in those states as growth in FDI

originating in the US in corrupt states was significantly lower than in non-corrupt states

subsequent to the law’s passage.

      We conjecture that in countries where the enforcement of property rights is limited and

costly, domestic entrepreneurs will have an advantage, i.e. that they have access to cheaper

means of enforcing property rights. This may be due to multitude of reasons, like better

familiarity of the court system and the government, better knowledge of the key people that

should be bribed and of local networks that help in resolving disputes, etc. Thus, one expects

domestic agents to have comparative advantage relative foreign agents in overcoming some

of the obstacles associated with corruption and weak institutions. This in turn would suggest

that FDI would be more sensitive to weakening of property rights versus domestic

investment. Our model focuses on the implications of this presumption on employment and

investment patterns of domestic versus foreign entrepreneurs.4

      Specifically, we model such circumstances in a principle agent framework with

costly ex-post monitoring and enforcement of an ex-ante contract with domestic labor.

The home advantage is manifested in the assumption that the ex-post monitoring and

enforcement cost of the labor contract is lower for domestic entrepreneurs than for

foreign ones. Under these disadvantages, foreign producers require a countervailing

productivity advantage to compete. Given circumstances where both multinationals and

domestic producers exist side-by-side, we show that multinationals pay higher wages than

domestic producers, in line with the insight of efficiency wages and with the evidence

about the ‘multinationals wage premium.’ We also show that multinational investments

are more sensitive to weakness (or more costly enforcement of) property rights.

4
  The literature has dealt with other possible dimensions associated with home advantages and disadvantages of
domestic versus foreign entrepreneurs. For example, Razin, Sadka and Yuen (1999) studied the implication of
multinationals having access to cheaper cost credit and possibly inferior information about the quality of
domestic projects relative to domestic entrepreneurs on the patterns of FDI. Our approach abstracts away from
these issues, assuming equal financial costs for both domestic and foreign agents. This allows us to identify the
implications of the home advantage associated with contract enforcement on the patterns of investment. An


                                                        2
        A growing literature also exists concerning the impact of corruption on foreign direct

investment. Wheeler and Mody (1992) estimate a cross-country panel of manufacturing and

electronics investment in which a principal component they label “Risk” includes such socio-

economic factors as the Business International indicators of corruption and bureaucratic red

tape. They find no significant impact of this component on capital expenditures by U.S.

multinationals. Similarly, Hines (1995) finds no measurable impact of corruption on total

inward FDI in host nations after 1977.

        However, later studies find robust evidence that corruption reduces the level of FDI

entering into a country. Wei (2000) examines a panel of bilateral stocks of FDI from 12

source countries to 45 host countries and finds a large and statistically significant negative

impact of corruption on inward FDI. His point estimates indicate that the increase in

corruption from the level of Singapore’s to that of Mexico is the equivalent of a 20

percentage point increase in the tax rate on multinationals. Similarly, Wei (1997) finds that

uncertainty in corruption levels also has a measurable negative impact on inward FDI.

        While these studies establish a negative relationship between corruption and FDI,

their results do not imply that FDI flows are more sensitive to host country corruption levels

than domestic investment. The possibility that corruption is especially harmful to FDI, i.e.

relative to its adverse impact on domestic investment, is important in terms of the general

consensus that FDI plays an important role in transferring technology to developing

countries.5

        Below, we directly examine the impact of corruption on the share of FDI in a host

country’s overall investment portfolio. In particular, we estimate the impact of an index of

domestic corruption on the ratio of average FDI flows to both gross fixed capital formation

and private domestic investment over the following ten years. We find that corruption is


implication of our assumptions is that, unlike in Razin et. al. (1999), FDI unambiguously improves the host
county’s welfare.

robustly negatively correlated with the ratio of FDI to total domestic investment. This

suggests that corruption discourages foreign direct investment more severely than it does

domestic investment, as predicted by our theoretical model. We then demonstrate that this

result is robust to the inclusion of a number of conditioning factors, as well as treatment for

simultaneity issues.

           This paper is organized into five sections. Section 2 introduces a simple principal-

agent model of foreign direct investment with imperfect property right protection. Section 3

discusses the empirical methodology and data used in the paper. Section 4 reviews our

results. Section 5 concludes.



2. A Simple Model of FDI with Imperfect Property Right Enforcement

           In this section, we introduce a simple model of FDI with imperfect property right

enforcement. We assume that there is a sector containing two firms, a multinational

subsidiary and a domestic firm. Both of these firms are assumed to face a principal-agent

problem vis-à-vis their laborers, with costly ex-post monitoring and enforcement of an ex-

ante contract. FDI is assumed to co-exist with domestic production, where the technological

superiority of foreign subsidiaries and the relative superiority of domestic firms concerning

the agency problem lead to an interior solution for the share of FDI in host-country

investment.

           The production functions of the domestic and foreign firms are assumed to be Cobb-

Douglas in capital, K, and labor, L. We distinguish the foreign firm with stars. The

production function of the domestic firm is assumed to satisfy

                                                 Y = zAK α Lβ                                            (1.1)

    For example, see Barrel and Pain (1997). However, see Aitken and Harrison (1999) for an opposing view.

where z is the effective productivity shock, the outcome of labor’s effort and the realized

exogenous state of nature, ε :

                                      1 + ε with L effort
                                      
                                    z=                                                       (1.2)

                                      



Labor’s effort therefore contributes 1 − χ to output.

          Similarly, the foreign firm production function is assumed to satisfy

                                         Y * = z * A* K *α L*β                                (1.3)

where z * satisfies

                                        1 + ε * with L effort
                                        
                                   z* =                                                      (1.4)
                                         χ (1 + ε * ) no L effort
                                        

          We assume that ε and ε * are independently distributed uniform on the interval

 −ε , ε  .
        

          We start the analysis with the simplest benchmark by ignoring the possibility of

random monitoring and random shirking. In the absence of spending monitoring and

verification costs, the representative entrepreneur in the domestic and foreign sector observes

only the effective productivity shocks, z and z * respectively. Verification of labor effort can

be done only ex-post, after the realization of output. The cost of verifying labor’s effort is

assumed to equal proportions c and c* of the labor inputs, cL and c* L* respectively. Since

the cost is likely to be highly correlated within a country, we assume that c* = ψ c .

Moreover, we assume that the domestic firm enjoys a low cost of verifying and enforcing

effort, such that ψ > 1. However, we assume that the foreign subsidiary enjoys a

countervailing productivity advantage over its domestic counterpart, so that A* ≥ A .

        The opportunity cost of labor’s time is assumed to equal ω .6 There are two possible

labor types, differing in the amount of effort e needed to yield the high output [alternatively,

two possible qualities of matches between labor and capital, differing in the effort input

needed]:

                                        b

where ea < eb and a + b = 1.

        Labor’s utility satisfies

                                           U = C − [ω + e] L                                          (1.6)

where C is labor consumption and       ω ≥ 0 is the shadow price of leisure. With perfect

information, labor is paid the sum of (ω + ei ) L ( i = a, b ) with effort, and ωL with no effort.

Labor knows its type, and its effort decision is endogenous. The entrepreneurs observe only

the effective productivity shock [ (1 + ε ) χ or 1 + ε , depending on labor’s effort]. Ex-post, the

entrepreneur may decide to pay the verification and enforcement cost in order to reveal

labor’s effort. In the absence of verification and enforcement, labor’s compensation is not

contingent on effort.

        The labor contract sets the compensation rule ex-ante. It has the following

dimensions

    -   A threshold φ of the effective productivity shock z that will trigger the costly

        verification and enforcement.

    -   In the absence of verification, or if the verification will reveal no shirking, labor

        would be paid wn L . If shirking is detected, labor would be paid zero.7


6
  The opportunity cost of labor could be alternatively interpreted as leisure or as the prevailing wage in a
traditional sector.
7
  Maximizing the penalty associated with shirking (i.e., paying zero when shirking is detected), is optimal.

                                                     6
      We assume that the various parameters induce a separating equilibrium, where the more

efficient type (a) would supply effort, and the less efficient type (b) would shirk.

         In rational-expectation equilibrium, labor would prefer putting effort to shirking if

the penalty for shirking exceeds the cost of effort. Under the assumptions above, this

condition satisfies

         Henceforth, we assume that

         This implies that the density function of effective productivity shock z is

         The decision problems faced by the domestic and foreign entrepreneurs are identical.

The domestic entrepreneur sets the contract in order to maximize the expected profits V,

where

                           V = [1 − (1 − χ )b] AK α Lβ − (1 + ρ ) K − LE (lc)               (1.11)


                                                    7
where the cost of capital is equal to 1 + ρ and E ( lc ) represents the expected cost per worker,

which satisfies



                                              φ
                                                      b          φ

           The first term on the RHS of equation (1.11) represents expected output. The second

term is the cost of capital; the third is the expected cost of labor. The cost of employing a

worker, E (lc) , takes into account that the wage payment to shirking labor will be zero when

the worker shirks, and that employing labor is associated with the expected cost of

monitoring and enforcement [the second term of E (lc) ].8

           Henceforth we focus on the case where the entrepreneur pays labor the reservation

wage that just induces laborers of type a to supply effort:

                                                          2ε ea

           Optimizing V with respect to φ , K, and L, we infer:



CLAIM 1: An internal separating equilibrium (i.e., where type b would shirk, and type a

would supply the needed effort) is characterized by

                                                      (  ) χ . For analytic simplicity, we combine the labor

monitoring and enforcement costs together. However, in the range (1 − ε ) χ ≤ z ≤ (1 − ε ) , the entrepreneur
would optimally choose only to pay the enforcement costs and not monitor, since monitoring is not needed to
                                                                              (     )
establish that a worker is of type b in that range. Similarly, within the range 1 − ε ≤ z ≤ φ , the entrepreneur
would always need to monitor to establish labor’s type, but would only face enforcement costs when the laborer
turned out to be of type b. While this is clearly a simplification, it drives none of the qualitative results. We
return to this simplification in the conclusion.

             Our results follow the logic of efficiency wages. Higher monitoring costs would

induce lower incidence of monitoring and enforcement, leading the entrepreneur to pay

higher wages. The net outcome is higher wage, needed to keep the penalty associated with

shirking high enough despite the drop in the incidence of monitoring. A by-product of it is

that investment and employment will drop.

             Finally, the level of monitoring and enforcement costs will affect the relative levels of

domestic and foreign investment, as noted in the following claim:



CLAIM 3: Higher enforcement costs (maintaining constant the relative cost disadvantage of

the foreign producer, ψ) reduce the ratio of multinational investment to domestic investment

at a rate that increases with the enforcement cost gap.

        Denoting the optimal stock of capital in the domestic firm by K , and the probability

of enforcing and monitoring in the domestic industry by Q, we demonstrate in the appendix

as predicted in Claim 3.

        The intuition behind Claim 3 is that higher enforcement costs increase the ratio of

expected enforcement costs to total worker cost, which is cQ / E ( lc ) for the domestic firm

and c * Q * / E ( lc *) for the foreign firm.10 The decrease in the ratio of foreign to domestic

investment resulting from an increase in enforcement costs will then be proportional to the

difference in the monitoring and enforcement cost ratios of domestic and foreign producers.

The observation that the enforcement cost ratio increases with the level of enforcement cost

implies that the greater is the cost gap, the larger is the drop of the relative capital share

induced by a given increase in the monitoring and enforcement costs, c.

        Our model therefore predicts that multinationals characterized with higher

productivity and higher cost of monitoring and enforcement will opt to pay higher wages.

Moreover, the greater is the cost of domestic enforcement c, the lower will be the ratio of

foreign direct investment to domestic investment. In the following section, we test the latter

empirical prediction.

3. Empirics

3.1 Methodology

        The theoretical model above implied that foreign direct investment would constitute a

smaller share of the overall investment package in countries that had inferior property rights

protection. In this section, we test this theory empirically for a cross-section of countries

using data on government corruption.

        We first estimate the following specification

                      FDI
                            = α + β1Corrupti + β 2 Devi + β 3Ores & Metalsi + ε i                     (1.17)
                     GFCF i

where FDI / GCFCi represents the average ratio of inward foreign direct investment to gross

fixed capital formation from 1990 through 1999, Corrupti represents the index of corruption

from Mauro (1995), discussed in more detail below, Devi represents a zero-one dummy

indicating a developed country, Ores & Metalsi represents the share of exports comprised of

ores and metals, and ε i represents a disturbance term that is assumed to be independently and

identically distributed normal.

        We estimate equation (1.16) with and without the Ores & Metalsi variable, which is

introduced to identify countries that are intensive in activities traditionally associated with

high levels of foreign direct investment.11 We also estimate equation (1.16) with and without

weighting our observations by country size, as measured by gross domestic product in 1989.

Finally, we report our results with developed and developing countries pooled with the Devi

dummy included as well as the two samples separated.




11
  The oil industry is also commonly associated with high shares of foreign direct investment. Using the set of
oil-exporting countries identified in Mankiw, Romer and Weil (1992), two of the countries in our data set,
Gabon and Iran, can be considered oil-exporting. We re-ran the regressions with these two countries omitted
and obtained very similar results. These are available upon request.

                                                     11
       Our coefficient of interest is β1 , the impact of the corruption index in 1989 on

subsequent inward foreign direct investment as a share of gross fixed capital formation. The

model is estimated using ordinary least squares with White’s heteroscedasticity-consistent

standard errors below.

       Since heterogeneity in government investment may add noise to the denominator in

the dependent variable in our specification above, we repeat our estimation using the ratio of

average inward foreign direct investment to private domestic investment, FDI / PVTi , from

1990-1999. This specification results in a smaller sample, but provides a good check of the

robustness of the results we report for the larger sample.



3.2. Data

       Corruption data was obtained from Mauro (1995). The data are from Business

International’s index of institutional efficiency, and reflect the reports of analysts concerning

the functioning of the domestic bureaucracy, with a grade of 10 indicating a “smoothly

functioning, efficient bureaucracy” while a grade of 4 indicates “constant need for

government approvals and frequent delays.” Note that our index is negatively related to

domestic corruption, so that a positive coefficient on this variable is expected in the

specification above.

       Remaining data, including foreign direct investment flows, gross fixed capital

formation, the share of private investment in total domestic investment, and the shares of ores

and metals in total exports, were obtained from the World Development Indicators.

Countries were designated as “developed” on the basis of membership in the OECD in

November 1988.

       Summary statistics are shown in Table 1. Our sample includes 97 countries, 76 of

which are designated as developing and 21 of which are designated as developed. It can be


                                                12
seen that the inclusion of the Ores & Metalsi variable reduces our sample size to 71, while

using the FDI / PVTi dependent variable instead of FDI / GCFCi reduces the sample size to

52 countries, only 10 of which are developed. Consequently, we do not report results for the

developed countries alone with this dependent variable.

        Unsurprisingly, the developing nations score poorly relative to the developed nations

in the Corrupti index, with the developing nations’ mean index at 4.67 while the developed

nations’ index has a mean of 8.874. Nevertheless there is a fair amount of disparity within

both samples, with the developing nations ranging from 0 to 8.33 while the developed nations

range from 6.67 to 10.

        One might expect that the developing nations would have a higher share of inward

foreign direct investment. However, the data show that that is not necessarily the case. In

fact, the mean ratio of foreign direct investment to gross fixed capital formation is slightly

larger for the developed nations. In contrast, the mean ratio of FDI to private domestic

investment is larger for the developing nations, as we might expect. Nevertheless, neither

difference is statistically significant.

        The simple correlations between our Corrupti index and levels of investment relative

to gross domestic product for our developing nation sample are shown in Figure 1. It can be

seen that there is a modest positive raw relationship between property rights protection and

both FDI and domestic investment as measured by gross fixed capital formation. This

confirms the results found in Wei (2000).12 We plot the simple correlation between the

Corrupti index and the FDI / GCFCi and FDI / PVTi ratios in Figure 2 for our developing

country sample. We observe a modest positive relationship between protection of property



12
  The full sample also displayed a modest positive relationship. However, as developed countries tend to have
much lower corruption scores, we include a dummy to identify the developed nations in our parametric analysis
with the full sample below.

                                                     13
rights protection and these ratios, as predicted by our theory. We next turn towards testing

these hypotheses formally.



4. Results

        Results with FDI / GCFCi as the dependent variable are shown in Table 2. It can be

seen that the performance of the Corrupti variable is very robust. With the sample weighted

by country size, the variable enters positively and significantly either with or without

controlling for the share of ores and metals exports. The point estimate of slightly over 0.02

implies an economically significant 2 percent increase in the ratio of FDI to gross fixed

capital formation for each point increase in the corruption index.

        With the unweighted sample, the variable enters positively and significantly after

controlling for ores and metals exports, but is insignificant without this control. However, we

focus primarily on the weighted results to avoid results dominated by small outliers. The

very small R-squared results we obtain in all of the unweighted regressions reported suggest

that the weighted samples contain far less noise.

        The control variables enter as would be expected. The Devi variable is negative and

statistically significant for the weighted samples. The Ores & Metalsi variable enters

positively and significantly at least a ten percent confidence level with either the weighted or

un-weighted specifications.

        We then break the sample up into its developed and developing nation sub-samples

and obtain similar results. For both sub-samples, the Corrupti variable enters positively and

significantly for both specifications with a weighted sample, and after controlling for ores and

metal exports with the un-weighted sample. There is a notable difference in the point

estimates between the two sub-samples, although this difference is not statistically

significant.
                                               14
        Table 3 displays the results with FDI / PVTi as the dependent variable. As noted

above, the use of this variable significantly reduces our sample size. Indeed, the data is

available for this reduced sample for only ten of the developed nations, so we do not report

regression results for that sub-sample with this dependent variable.13 Nevertheless, our

results for the Corrupti variable of interest appear to be robust in the full sample. As was the

case for the ratio to gross fixed capital formation, the Corrupti variable enters positively and

significantly in both of the specifications with the weighted sample and with the un-weighted

sample after controlling for the share of ores and metals exports. The coefficient values are

also quite similar to those we obtained in the gross fixed capital formation regressions.

        The results with the developed country sample alone are also similar. The Corrupti

variable enters significantly in the weighted specification without controlling for ores and

metals, and is close to a 10 percent confidence level with the control included. As above, the

Corrupti variable also enters significantly with its expected positive coefficient with the

Ores & Metalsi control included.



5. Conclusion

        This paper introduced a model of foreign direct investment with costly enforcement of

property rights. We demonstrated that when foreign direct investment suffered from a

relative disadvantage in property rights protection, it economized on its physical capital

investment and paid its laborers a higher wage premium. This premium induced a separating

equilibrium where the relatively productive workers refrained from shirking, while the less

productive workers shirked. Finally, we demonstrated that the ratio of multinational

investment to domestic investment would be increasing in the security of property rights.


13
   For completeness, we did run the specification with this sub-sample. Unsurprisingly, everything was very
insignificant, including all of the control variables.

                                                    15
       We then tested this prediction for a cross-section of countries using data on

corruption. Our results demonstrated a robust negative relationship between the level of

corruption and the ratio of FDI flows to domestic investment flows.

       It should be noted that a number of our simplifying assumptions above do not drive

our results. For example, our assumption of a uniform distribution for the productivity shock

resulted in a widening of the tails of the distribution, where monitoring is not required to

identify the worker’s type. Using a more standard distribution, such as a normal, the

probability space where monitoring was required would be likely to increase, and thereby

increase the property rights advantage of the domestic firm in a corrupt environment.

       Another simplification noted earlier was the implicit combination of monitoring and

enforcement activities. While the domestic entrepreneur is likely to enjoy advantages in both

of these activities, as specified above, one could imagine a situation where relative

advantages in monitoring may differ by industry. Holding enforcement costs equal, we may

see multinational investment relatively specialized in industries in which foreign firms enjoy

relative advantages in monitoring costs. For example, multinationals may enjoy managerial

advantages in some industries, which may correspond to reduced monitoring costs, but may

suffer from the enforcement disadvantages alluded to above.

       Finally, the wage premium result above came from the specification of property rights

limitations concerning the enforcement of labor effort. However, one could easily imagine a

scenario where the employment of capital also resulted in enforcement problems. In future

work, we will also allow for property right limitations to arise in this dimension.

                                                    ∂φ

where the last equality follows from the first order condition (A1) determining the threshold

in order to minimize the expected cost of employing a worker. In addition, note that

It is easy to confirm that the second order conditions for maximization hold, and the

determinate of the system is negative.

Hence, higher enforcement costs would increase the expected cost of employing labor,

reducing thereby the optimal investment, hence

Note: Corrupti is corruption index from Mauro (2000). Note that index is decreasing in domestic corruption
level. FDI / GFCFi represents average ratio of inward foreign direct investment to gross fixed capital
formation, while FDI / PVTi represents ratio of inward foreign direct investment to private domestic
investment. Corrupti and Ores & Metalsi values are for 1989. FDI / GFCFi and FDI / PVTi values
are averages from 1990-1999.
