I. Introduction

         It is a notable achievement to develop an economic model that provides a
framework for understanding and analyzing important economic issues of the day. It is an
even more striking achievement to develop an economic model that addresses an issue that
will be of central importance in the future. In the 1950s, a time when cross-border capital
movements were largely stymied by government regulations, Robert Mundell published a
series of papers studying the implications of capital mobility. Today’s central paradigms
for studying events in a world characterized by vast flows of capital across national
boundaries draw on Mundell’s analysis that foresaw such a world. An examination of the
linkages between international capital movements, domestic production and international
trade is especially timely today, given the massive and volatile capital flows to emerging
markets observed through the 1990s.
         Mundell studied capital mobility in a variety of frameworks. He is best known for
the Mundell-Fleming model which analyzes the effect of portfolio capital movements on
the efficacy of monetary and fiscal policy. Monetary authorities today are intimately
aware of the central lessons of this model. Less well-known, but increasingly relevant, are
issues considered in Mundell’s work on the implications of physical capital mobility for
international trade. In a world of significant growth of both international direct investment
and international trade, this work raises important considerations for policy-makers who
are concerned with understanding trade and direct investment linkages among countries.
         In “International Trade and Factor Mobility” (1957), Mundell demonstrates the
substitutability of international trade and factor mobility. In the context of the Heckscher-
Ohlin-Samuelson model, perfect factor mobility across sectors within an economy
provides a tendency for commodity-price equalization, even in the absence of international
trade in goods. This result complements the Stolper-Samuelson theorem, which
demonstrates the tendency for factor-price equalization as a consequence of goods trade,
even in the absence of international trade in factors. International factor mobility also
serves as a substitute for trade in another sense in the Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson (H-O-
S) model, since an increase in the volume of factor movements can decrease the volume of
trade.


                                             1
        Subsequent theoretical work has demonstrated that models which diverge from the
standard H-O-S assumptions can result in complementarity, rather than substitutability,
between factor trade and goods trade (Wong 1986). There are a variety of ways this
subsequent work differs from Mundell’s original contribution, including allowances for
differences in technologies across countries (Kemp 1966, Jones 1967, Purvis 1972,
Svensson 1984, and Markusen and Svensson 1985), introduction of production taxes,
monopoly market structure, external economies of scale or factor market distortions
(Markusen 1983) and permitting foreign capital to promote domestic development
(Schmitz and Helmberger 1970). In all of these cases, an increase in international direct
investment may promote greater international trade.
        Understanding the relationship between trade in goods and trade in factors is
important for obtaining a complete picture of international linkages. For example, it is
often the case that the amount of international trade undertaken by a country serves as a
proxy for its level of “openness” or, in a bilateral context, as a measure of the international
linkages between two countries. Mundell’s analysis implies that focusing on trade as a
proxy for openness may be misleading when international capital flows are significant.
Empirically, it is important to consider whether this bias is significant and systematic in a
particular direction.
        Another key reason for understanding these linkages arises in the aftermath of the
currency and financial crises of the 1990s. If capital inflows to a country are large, but
also can abruptly change course, important real consequences can ensue. In Latin
America, in Asia, or elsewhere, even exogenous reversals in foreign capital availability can
lead to a redistribution of productive factors within a country. The availability of
investment funds and new physical capital can have important consequences for the future
structure of a country’s trade and the welfare of its citizens.
        The broad challenge posed by the theoretical and policy arguments can only be
resolved through careful analytical and empirical studies. Recent empirical research in this
area includes work by Collins, O’Rourke and Williamson (1997), who studied the
historical link between labor mobility and trade, and our own work on the response of
exports and imports of selected Latin American and Southeast Asian countries to direct



                                               2
investment from the United States and Japan (Goldberg and Klein 1998). Collins,
O’Rourke and Williamson found little evidence of substitutability between labor
movement and trade. We found some evidence of complementarity between capital flows
and bilateral trade, especially in the Asian region: direct investment from Japan to
Southeast Asian countries significantly increased the bilateral exports and imports of those
countries with Japan. We found no evidence of significant links between capital flows and
bilateral trade, however, between Latin American countries and either Japan or the United
States, or between the United States and Southeast Asian countries.
       In this paper we provide a motivating theoretical model, followed by a detailed
empirical study of the effects of direct investment flows on levels of international trade.
We present the first empirical analysis, to our knowledge, of this relationship at a sectoral
level. Specifically, we study how the net exports of specific manufacturing sectors of eight
Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru,
and Venezuela) respond to direct investment from the United States into those specific
sectors, as well as into other manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors of their
economies. We demonstrate empirically the varied direction and levels of response of
sectoral trade volumes to direct investment across manufacturing sectors and across
countries.
       Based on this detailed empirical evidence, we conclude that the theoretical debate
is justified. In Argentina, where investments into manufacturing industries have been
concentrated in Food-related industries or Chemical industries, the net exports of these
industries have expanded (despite these industries remaining net importers overall),
without significant detriment to other manufacturing industries. In Brazil and Venezuela,
FDI into particular manufacturing industries – flows that have been concentrated in
Chemicals, Machinery and Transportation Equipment – have been associated with
expanded net import positions by these industries. Foreign investment into Wholesale &
Retail Trade worsened the net export positions of manufacturing industries in Mexico and
Columbia (suggesting that this FDI facilitated Latin imports), but improved the net export
positions in Brazilian manufacturing industries.        Our detailed examination of the




                                             3
experience of individual industries, using cross-country and time-series data, does not
suggest strong or systematic linkages between sectoral trade and FDI in Latin America.


II. Direct Investment in Sector-Specific Capital and Trade
II A. Overview. To set the stage for our empirical analysis, in this section we review the
main distinctions between general equilibrium models that find that factor mobility and
trade are substitutes, versus those models that find that they are complements. We then
present a simple version of the Rybczynski theorem to highlight the role of sector-specific
capital. Our objective is use the theoretical exposition to motivate our empirical tests for
sectoral trade volumes and foreign direct investment linkages, allowing both for direct
effects on trade of foreign capital inflows into a sector and for spillovers effects from
inflows into other sectors.
       In these general equilibrium models, the relative returns to factors and the level of
production and trade are jointly determined. Typically, models differ in their predictions
about the relationship between factor movements and trade volumes because of
differences in assumptions about production, which lead to differences in the relative
returns to factors. Across models, however, the manner in which the change in a factor
endowment affects the production of each good in the economy is similar. The basis of
this relationship is the Rybczynski theorem, which then drives the association between
factor flows and trade volumes.
       We illustrate the Rybczynski-based association between capital flows and trade
volumes in the context of two types of models: in the first, countries differ in their
endowments of factors but have identical production technologies (a Heckscher-Ohlin-
Samuelson style model). In the second, production technologies are different in the two
countries (a Ricardian style model). Basic forms of these models include two goods and
two factors -- labor and capital. In this setting, the Rybczynski theorem states that, given
the prices of goods, an inflow of capital leads to an increase in the level of production of
the good which uses capital relatively intensively, and a decrease in the level of production
of the good which uses labor relatively intensively. These changes in production have
direct implications for trade volumes and, in fact, will be the sole source of changes in



                                             4
trade volumes under the assumption of homothetic and identical preferences in each
country.
        Mundell studied the relationship between factor flows and trade in a H-O-S model.
He considered a situation where a prohibitively-high tariff on imports shuts off trade and
raises the return to capital in the country where it is the relatively scarce factor. This leads
to a capital inflow to that country and, through the Rybczynski effect, an increase in the
production of the capital-intensive good (which had been the imported good before the
tariff was put in place) and a decrease in the production of the labor-intensive good (which
had been the export). Capital inflows continue until relative factor endowments in the two
countries are identical.
        If the tariff were then removed, there would be no trade in goods. The reason is
that the initial basis for trade in this model, autarky differences in relative factor
endowments and the accompanying differences in relative goods prices, has been
eliminated through factor flows. Factor flows can give rise to commodity price
equalization, much as in the standard H-O-S model goods trade gives rise to factor price
equalization. More broadly, in a model of this nature, an increase in the volume of factor
flows causes a decrease in the volume of trade. Factor flows substitute for trade flows.
        An alternative result can arise in a Ricardian model in which countries have
different technologies. For example, suppose each of two countries has the same labor
productivity but one country enjoys higher capital productivity. The country with the
higher capital productivity will export the capital-intensive good. When capital is
internationally mobile, it will seek its highest returns and thus flow to the high capital-
productivity country. Through the Rybczynski effect, these capital inflows increase the
production of the capital intensive good (that country’s export) and decrease the
production of the labor intensive good (that country’s import). In this simple example,
factor flows complement trade flows.


II B. A Basic Specific – Factors Model
A basic model provides a context for our empirical exploration of the way in which
foreign direct investment to a particular sector affects the volume of exports and imports



                                               5
of that sector as well as of other sectors. There are two goods, A and B. The factors of
production include domestic and foreign capital used solely in the production of good A,
KA and FA, respectively, domestic and foreign capital used solely in the production of good
B, KB, and FB, respectively, and labor, L. Labor, unlike capital, costlessly shifts from one
sector to another in response to an incipient wage differential. The amount of labor used in
the production of good A is denoted as LA and the amount used in the production of good
B is denoted as LB.
        There are two other key assumptions in this partial-equilibrium analysis. First,
domestic and foreign capital are completely sector specific. The assumption that foreign
capital is sector-specific reflects the prevalent view that direct investment typically
involves some active management of an asset. (This treatment contrasts with a view of
portfolio investment as only requiring the bearer to passively hold the asset.) The direct
management of foreign investment requires some sector-specific knowledge that makes an
investor focus on a sector within which she has particular expertise.
        The second key assumption is that foreign direct investment is exogenous, an
assumption which makes this a partial-equilibrium exercise. This clearly runs counter to
the standard modeling assumption of perfect capital mobility since it does not allow for
arbitraging rates of return across sectors.1 The implication of this second assumption is
that we do not endogenously determine the equalization of returns to investments across
borders, or the equilibrium volume of international capital flows.2 A general equilibrium
approach could accomplish this goal, but it would likely still give rise to similar qualitative
results as those shown using the simple partial equilibrium setting.
        Assume that production functions take the form

                  A = f ( K A + FA , LA )      B = g (K B + FB , LB )                             (1)




1
  Recent research questions the assumption of the equalization of rates of return for a variety of types of
capital. Most relevant in this context is the work of Froot and Stein (1991) who model foreign direct
investment with imperfect capital markets. Empirical results in their paper, as well as in research by
Klein and Rosengren (1994), suggest that there is a lack of perfect capital mobility for direct investment.
2
  Markusen (1995) argues that there is little evidence that direct foreign investment is related to
differences in factor endowments across countries or to differences in the general return to capital.


                                                    6
where the partial derivatives with respect to labor,               ( f L , g L ) , and capital, ( f K , g K ) , are
positive. The cross-partial derivatives with respect to labor and capital from either foreign
or domestic sources,           ( f LK , g LK ) ,   also are positive. All second partial derivatives,

( f LL , f KK , g LL , g KK ) , are negative.

         With labor perfectly mobile across sectors and the labor market competitive, the
wage paid to labor in Sector A, w, is the same as the wage paid to labor in Sector B. The
first-order conditions for profit maximization require that firms in each sector hire labor to
the point where the product wage equals the marginal product of labor,


                                        w                w
                                           = fL             = gL                                         (2)

Totally differentiating each of these relationships, and dividing through by the product
wage or the marginal product of labor, we obtain

where dLi represents the change in employment in sector i and dFi represents foreign
direct investment to sector i. Setting dKi equal to zero reflects our assumption of sector-
specific domestic capital and our interest in considering the effects of FDI rather than
changes in domestic capital. 3 Full employment of labor ensures that L = L A + LB , where
L is the total amount of labor in the economy. With a constant labor force4, we have


                                        dL A = − dLB                                                     (4)




3
  The structure of production given in equation 1 implies that domestic and foreign capital are perfect
substitutes within a sector.
4
  We could easily assume a growing labor force, an assumption which would not change our results.


                                                         7
Wages are continuously equated across the two sectors, and, therefore, the proportionate
change in wages across sectors is equal. Solving the sets of equations for the change in
labor in each sector yields:


                f g          g f           f g   dp dp 

                                                                                        (5)

                 Z            Z            Z   pB    pA 

where Z = −( f LL g L + g LL f L ) > 0.

        These equations show that foreign direct investment to Sector A (dFA >0) pulls
labor into that sector, reducing the labor employment in Sector B (dFB >0), all else equal.
The implication is that a collapse of (foreign) capital in a sector leads that sector to
contract employment, leaving labor to flow to the other sector. The marginal products of
labor and the degree of complementarities between labor and capital in production
determine the magnitudes of the worker reallocation.
        There are straightforward output implications of these labor and capital
adjustments. From the production functions,


         dA = f K dFA + f L dL A                                                        (6)
         dB = g K dFB + g L dL B


Substituting in the results from above, we obtain

These equations show that sectoral output is stimulated by an increase in its relative price
or by FDI into that sector; its output is decreased by FDI into the other sector. The basic
intuition is that an inflow of foreign capital into a sector increases sectoral output directly,



                                                  8
by providing more capital, and indirectly, by raising the marginal product of its labor and
drawing workers away from the other sector. Overall, investment to one sector increases
production in that sector and decreases production in the other sector, all else equal.
        Returning to the issue originally considered by Mundell and others, the implication
of these results is that the effects of FDI on trade volumes depend upon whether a sector
was initially a net exporter or a net importer. Assuming no demand-side effects (as would
be consistent with the assumption of homothetic demand), and that relative price effects
are second order, an increase in production in Sector A causes international trade by that
sector to increase if that sector was initially a net exporter, or to decrease if that sector
was initially a net importer. The converse also holds. In all these cases, direct investment
into a sector should cause an increase in the net exports of that sector and a decrease in
the net exports of other sectors, all else equal.

III. Capital and Trade Flows with Latin America

A. Data. In this section we explore the relationship between trade and FDI using detailed
sectoral data on FDI inflows and trade between the United States and eight Latin
American countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, and
Venezuela5 (sources: United States Bureau of Economic Analysis Statistics on US Direct
Investment Abroad and the Feenstra NBER Trade Database). The data on FDI span both
manufacturing and non-manufacturing industries; the bilateral trade data spans only the
manufacturing industries. The sample period for which both trade and FDI data are
available is 1972 through 1994. Trade, investment, and US income series are converted
into real dollar values using the United States producer price series. The GDP series for
individual Latin American countries enters in the regressions as millions of real local
currency units.

5
  In order to make the sector definitions consistent across the trade and the FDI series, we use the
manufacturing decomposition delineated by the FDI numbers, i.e. with a breakdown into Food and
Kindred Products, Chemicals and Allied Products, Primary and Fabricated Metals, Industrial Machinery
and Equipment, Electronic and Other Electric Machinery, Transportation, and Other Manufacturing.
Data also are available for FDI into non- manufacturing sectors, which are comprised of Wholesale Trade,
Banking, Finance, Services, and Other Industries. These later series are somewhat less complete, since
observations are sometimes not disclosed if the scale of specific investments can be traced to individual
investors from the United States.

                                           The series on FDI into Latin America from the United States, broken down by
recipient country and by sector, are a construction based on the U.S. Direct Investment
Position Abroad series generated by the BEA. This BEA stock series measures the
yearend value of U.S. parent’s equity (including retained earnings) in, and outstanding
loans to, their foreign affiliates. Our FDI proxy is the change in this stock series, deflated
by an annual dollar producer price index. This proxy combines direct investment capital
flows plus valuation adjustments, so that FDI can be positive or negative in any period. As
described by the BEA, valuation adjustments result from price changes, exchange rate
changes, and other factors. Although our proxy for FDI clearly is not a perfect measure, it
is the closest series we have (and most comparable across countries) for indicating annual
FDI by sector.

                   Latin American countries have been regular recipients of erratic U.S. outward
investment flows over the past decades. As shown in Chart 1, U.S. FDI flows to various
regions, including Latin America, and the Asia-Pacific area have been growing following a
period of decline and stagnation in the early to mid 1980s. In general, FDI flows to Latin
America account for about 13 percent of US FDI to the three major FDI recipient regions
(Europe, Latin America, and Asia-Pacific). Within Latin America, the main recipient
countries have been Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina, respectively accounting for
approximately 45, 30 and 10 percent of the region's inflows from the United States over




                                                                                   11
the two decades we examine. Chart 2 shows the considerable volatility of these flows
across countries and over time.6
           For our purposes, it also is informative to consider the sectoral composition of
these flows. Table 1 shows that, across Latin America, Chemical & Allied Products,
Transportation Equipment, and Other Manufacturing have been regular recipients of
investment capital owned by the United States. Recent years have been marked by an
explosion of funds into Food & Kindred Products and Banking and Finance sectors. This
latter phenomenon is driven by flows into Chile, where Banking and Finance7 sectors are
the entry point for most foreign capital. We do not know the extent to which this capital
is channeled to local manufacturing or non-manufacturing industries.

  Despite the apparent volatility of these flows, Lipsey (1999) still finds that foreign direct investment is
the most stable source of international capital for emerging market economies.

    “Finance” is used here in place of the FIRE acronym, representing Finance, Insurance and Real Estate.

       The pattern of exports, imports and capital flows for the individual sectors of each
country is shown in detail in the panels of Table 2. In Argentina, the favored sectors for
FDI have been Food & Kindred Products, Wholesale Trade, and Banking and Finance. In
Brazil, foreign capital inflows have been directed toward a broad range of industries, a
substantial portion of which fall into Chemicals, Transportation, and the Other
Manufacturing (residual) categories. In Mexico, the Food, Chemicals, and Transportation
sectors have been important attractors of foreign capital. In Chile it is less transparent
which sectors ultimately receive FDI from the United States: capital inflows land in
Finance, Banking and “Other” non-manufacturing industries. These sectors presumably
reinvest some significant resources across manufacturing, but the data do not provide
specifics on the ultimate sectoral beneficiaries of these foreign long-term investments.
       Table 2 also presents evidence on the sectoral pattern of exports and imports of
the manufacturing sectors of each Latin American country. Non-electrical Machinery
shipments make up a significant portion of Latin American exports to the United States,
even though all countries in the sample are net importers in this sector. The Chemical
sectors have been important, and Transportation has grown considerably in importance
over the past decade. In Ecuador and Venezuela, manufacturing products are a small
share of the overall export revenues. Table 2 also makes evident the varied the importance
of manufacturing trade relative to total trade across the Latin American countries.
       Since our theoretical section emphasized that sectoral net trade positions, i.e.
whether a sector is a net importer or net exporter, are relevant for understanding the
implications of FDI, it is useful to consider this directly for the sectors of the Latin
American economies. Table 3 provides a very general overview of sectoral net export
position by country. For Venezuela and for Mexico, the “Other” Non-manufacturing
sector contains a significant fraction of the economy’s exports because of heavy reliance
on the petroleum sector. Most of the remaining manufacturing sectors are net importers.
The remaining Latin American countries are large net exporters of Food & Kindred
Products. All countries in the sample except Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela also are
large net exporters of Primary & Fabricated Metals .

 B. Testing for FDI Effects on Trade: The two-factor-model presented in Section II
 demonstrates that direct investment into a particular sector raises its level of output. The
 overall volume of trade in goods produced by that sector will increase if that sector was
 initially a net exporter and it will decrease if that sector was initially a net importer.
 Conversely, direct investment to one sector is expected to draw labor away from other
 sectors and cause output in those sectors to contract. In this case, the volume of trade in
 goods produced by the contracting sector decreases if that sector initially had a trade
 surplus and increases if that sector initially had a trade deficit. Direct investment to a
 sector is predicted to increase its net export balance, ceteris paribus, and to decrease the
 net export balance of other sectors, by drawing resources away from these other sectors.
 We test these predictions of the theory using sectoral trade and investment data from
 seven Latin American countries.8
          The basic time-series cross-section regression equation for a particular Latin
 American country takes the form


  ∆netX ti = α oi + α 1 ∆USrealGDPt ,t −1 + α 2 ∆OwnrealGDPt ,t −1 + α 3 ∆RERt ,t −1
                                                                                            (8)

where )netXit represents the change in net exports of sector i. )USrealGDP represents
the change in real GDP of the United States; )OwnrealGDP represents the change in the
real GDP of the Latin American country; )RER represents the change in the real exchange
rate of that country (with a positive value representing a dollar appreciation); OwnFDIi
                                                                                                          i
represents the direct investment flow from the United States into sector i; OtherFDI
represents the direct investment flow to all manufacturing sectors other than sector i, α 0i is

a fixed-effects dummy variable on levels of net exports for manufacturing sector i; and
subscripts on these variables refer to time periods.
        The subscript t,t-1 reflects the inclusion in the regressions of both a current and a
lagged term, while the subscript t-1,t-2 reflects the inclusion of both a one-period and a
two-period lag. Thus the coefficients αi represent two coefficients, one on the
contemporaneous variable and one on the lagged variable or, in the case of the FDI
variables, one on the variable lagged one period and one on the variable lagged two
periods. The model presented above suggests that the sum of coefficients represented by
the coefficient "4 is positive while the sum of the coefficients represented by the
coefficient "5 is negative. Standard trade models suggest that the sum of coefficients
represented by each of the coefficient "1, "2 and "3 are positive.9
        The results from the regression analysis can be combined with information on net
trade flows to address the question of whether direct investment promotes or diminishes
trade. A positive and significant coefficient on the change in own-sector direct
investment α 4 indicates that direct investment promotes trade if the country’s bilateral
trade balance with the United States is negative. This case, corresponding to Mundell’s
analysis, is one in which direct investment decreases overall trade by reducing exports
from the United States to the particular country (assuming that the negative overall trade
statistic does not mask a shift from a long-standing negative position to a larger positive
position which has only occurred for a few years in the sample period). Conversely, the

  The change in the real exchange rate, the change in domestic income and the change in United States
income are aggregate regressors in that they have the same value across all sectors in any particular year.
Aggregate regressors of this type preclude the use of time dummy variables and require the adjustment of
the standard errors, as shown by Kloeck (1981).


                                                    15
combination of a positive and significant value of α 4 or with a positive trade balance for a
country indicates that direct investment to that country promotes trade by expanding an
already-existing trade surplus. This corresponds to the situation in the Ricardian model
discussed above. A negative and significant value of the coefficient on other-sector direct
investment, α 5 , combined with a national bilateral trade deficit with the United States

suggests that direct investment promotes the volume of trade, all else equal, by increasing
trade flows from the United States. Conversely, when a country has a bilateral trade
surplus with the United States, direct investment to one sector which diminishes net
exports of other sectors serves to reduce the overall volume of trade, all else equal.
       The error term in the regression equation (8) consists of an error specific to the
particular industry for the particular year, u it , and an error common to all industries in the

country for that year, v t . The presence of the common error term, v t , can typically be

addressed using a fixed-effects dummy variable or, equivalently, subtracting the year-
specific mean value from all the variables in the regression. In this case, however, we have
regressors common to all industries in any particular year, such as the change in the real
exchange rate, the change in domestic income and the change in United States income.
Thus we cannot subtract out the year-specific mean value since these aggregate regressors
are common across all cross-sectional units. Instead, we use an iterative procedure which
estimates the variance of v t and then adjusts the variance-covariance matrix in an

appropriate manner (see Kloeck 1981 for a discussion of this problem and its resolution).

   Appendix Table1 provides estimates of the individual regression coefficients that form the basis of the
 numbers reported in the body of the text and in Table 4, Panel A. Appendix Table 2 feeds in Panel B.

       Panel A results suggest that a significant role is played by own-sector FDI in
promoting net exports in Argentina. Own-sector direct investment promotes net exports
in Mexico with a one-year lag, as shown in the complete results presented in Appendix
Table 1. By summing across the rows for Argentina and Mexico in Table 3, we observe
that both countries have a bilateral trade deficit with the United States with respect to
manufactured goods. Thus for these countries, which represent two of the three largest
United States trading partners in Latin America, there is evidence that own-sector direct
investment has the marginal effect of reducing the volume of bilateral trade in a way
consistent with Mundell’s analysis.
       The results in Panel A also suggest that other-sector direct investment tends to
reduce net exports in Mexico and increase net exports in Columbia. This mitigates, but
does not reverse, the conclusion that direct investment to Mexico tends to reduce the
volume of trade since the sum of the coefficients on own-sector direct investment, 0.358,
is greater, in absolute value, of the sum of the coefficients on other-sector direct
investment, -0.222. For Colombia, the marginal effect of direct investment is to promote
exports and, therefore, reduce the volume of bilateral trade in manufacturing goods since
both the own-sector and other-sector coefficients are positive.
       In Panel B, we allow for direct investment into non-manufacturing sectors to also
affect the output and, therefore, the trade of manufacturing sectors. There are two
possible channels through which these implications may arise. The first channel is that
associated with labor reallocation across sectors, as emphasized in the model presented
above. The second channel recognizes the role of the output of one sector as an input to
the production of other sectors. In this way, direct investment to, for instance, the
financial sector may serve to increase output in manufacturing sectors, as the expanded
finance sector serves the needs of the manufacturing sectors. Likewise, expansion of the
wholesale trade sector may enable manufacturing sectors to expand output for domestic
sales, or it may lead to expanded opportunities for imports. Given the tendency toward
manufacturing sector trade deficits with the United States, a positive coefficient on non-
manufacturing direct investment implies that this type of direct investment causes a decline
in the volume of bilateral trade with the United States while a negative coefficient means



                                            18
that this type of direct investment serves to increase the volume of bilateral trade, all else
equal.
         Table 4, Panel B, presents summed two-year net export effects derived from
regressions which include both own-sector and other-manufacturing-sector direct
investment, plus two other sectoral direct investment measures: direct investment in the
Finance, Banking and Real Estate sectors and direct investment in the Wholesale and
Retail Trade sector. These results show that foreign direct investment into the Banking,
Finance and Real Estate sectors, as well as to the Wholesale and Retail Trade sector, have
a significant effect on cross-sectional sectoral trade in a number of countries although the
direction of this effect differs across countries. Direct investment to the Wholesale and
Retail Trade sector has a positive and significant effect on trade by manufacturing sectors
in Brazil and, with a one-period lag only, in Venezuela. Conversely, direct investment to
this sector has a negative and significant effect on trade by manufacturing sectors in
Colombia and Mexico. The effect of direct investment into the Banking, Finance and Real
Estate sectors on trade by manufacturing sectors is significant for Argentina, Mexico and
Venezuela. In Argentina and Mexico, the initial effect is to promote trade while the effect
after one year is to diminish trade. In Venezuela, direct investment to the Finance,
Banking and Real Estate sectors also significantly increases trade at the ninety- percent
level of confidence, with a significant coefficient on the two-year lag at the ninety-five
percent level of confidence.
         A comparison of the results in Panel A and Panel B shows that the inclusion of
direct investment from these non-manufacturing sectors also affects the pattern of
significance on the own-sector and other-manufacturing sector direct investment variables.
But some of these differences arise due to differences in the samples available when
including the non-manufacturing direct investment measures. The sample sizes for the
results in Panel B are smaller than those in Panel A.         Using the restricted samples
employed in Panel B, but running regressions of the form presented in Panel A,
coefficients on direct investment variables which are reported as significant in Panel A for
Argentina, Mexico (on own-sector direct investment) and Venezuela are no longer
significant.

       Our second and final group of regressions were run on data grouped by industry,
instead of by country. The regression specification employed is analogous to the one used
in the country regressions, and incorporates appropriate modifications. Specifically, since
the industry regressions include as the left-hand-side variable the net export data for one
industry and several countries, the industry dummies are discarded in favor of country
dummies. These regressions do not require the type of correction to the variance-
covariance matrix discussed above since regressors such as the real exchange rate and
income are not common to all cross-sectional units in a particular year.
       Table 5 displays regression results for the cumulative effects of lagged independent
variables. The results for own industry FDI are less illuminating for these regressions than
those obtained in the country runs; own industry FDI affects trade significantly only in the
case of the “Other Manufacturing” (residual) category, where FDI flows stifle net exports
after one year while stimulating them after two, the cumulative effect being a decrease in
net exports.
       Stronger evidence is provided for the role of FDI into other industries in drawing
resources away from Primary and Fabricated Metals. In addition, FDI to industries other
than Electric & Electronic Equipment sector had a significant negative effect on trade in
that industry after one year; the same coefficient was negative but insignificant after two
years, causing the cumulative effect of both coefficients to be insignificant. The regression
results for the Electric & Electronic Equipment sector also provides evidence that banking
and other types of financial FDI inflows stimulate net exports.

4. Concluding Remarks

       The increasing importance of foreign direct investment in the world economy calls
for theoretical and empirical investigations into the manner in which FDI affects the
linkages among countries. A central question concerning FDI is whether it increases or
decreases the volume of trade. Mundell’s early contribution showed a channel through
which investment substitutes for trade, while later theoretical research presents cases
where trade and investment may serve as substitutes or complements.
       Our theoretical model highlights some basic aspects of the different channels
through which foreign direct investment can alter the sectoral composition of capital and
labor in an economy. We provide the results of a detailed examination of the linkages
between FDI into particular sectors of Latin American economies and the net exports of
those and other manufacturing sectors. Our analysis indicates that some FDI tends to
expand manufacturing trade, while other FDI clearly reduces the volumes of
manufacturing trade. In Latin American countries, FDI from the United States can lead to
significant, and varied shifts in the composition of activity in many countries across many
manufacturing sectors.
       Given the mixed pattern linkages, it is reasonable to ask whether the Latin
American results are expected to generalize to other partnering relationships among
countries around the world. We conjecture that bilateral sectoral investment and trade
flows-- other than those between the United States and Latin America-- may reveal
stronger relationships than the mixed picture presented here. For example, in our earlier
work (Goldberg and Klein 1998) we present evidence of relatively strong and significant
effects of overall bilateral direct investment from Japan on the overall bilateral trade of
Southeast Asian countries. The weakest results in that earlier paper were for the effects of
United States direct investment on the trade of Latin American countries. Those results
did not use data disaggregated by sectors and, unfortunately, data availability precluded us
from studying the effects of sectoral direct investment from Japan. While the Latin
American results that we have presented do not provide strong evidence that capital flows
