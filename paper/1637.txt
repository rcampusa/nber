                          Japan and the United States:
                             Some Simulation Results


                                 ABSTRACT



         In this paper we examine the macroeconomic interdependence of Japan and

the U.S. using a medium—scale simulation model of the world economy. Our goal is

to determine how shifts in macroeconomic policies in the U.S. or Japan affect

the other country as well as the rest of the world. In particular we examine

the following three issues: (i) the likely macroeconomic ramifications for the

U.S., Europe and Japan of significant budget cuts in the U.S.; (2) the macroeco-

nomic implications of a protectionist tariff imposed by the U.S.; and (3) the

scope for policy coordination among the U.S., Japan and Europe.

I. ItTRODUCT1OI'

     The macroeconomic linkages between the Japan and the U.S. have become a

focus of attention in the policy discussions in both countries. Largely as the

resLilt of divergent macroeconomic policies in recent years, the bilateral trade

balance between Japan and the U.S. reached an astounding $37 billion surplus for

Japan in 19814. This trade imbalance has fueled protectionist sentiment in the

U.S., with the real possibility that restrictive trade measures will be passed

by Congress this year.

     Against this backdrop, it is timely to examine the macroeconomic

interdependence of the two countries, with a particular goal of determining how

shifts in macroeconomic policies in the U.S. and Japan could contribute to

continued growth, moderate inflation, and a less extreme trade imbalance between

the two countries. What are the likely ramifications for the U.S., Europe, and

Japan, of significant budget cuts in the U.S.? What happens as the U.S. economy

slows, and therefore stops being the engine of growth for the rest of the world

economy? How much would Japan have to compensate via fiscal expansion for a cut

in the U.S. budget stimulus? What would be the macroeconomic implications of a

protectionist tariff imposed by the U.S.? Finally, what is the scope for policy

coordination among the U.S., Japan, and Europe, for optimal adjustments from the

current situation?

     To answer these questions, we employ a medium—scale simulation model of

the world economy, developed earlier by Sachs and McKibbin (1985).   In Section

II, we offer a brief discussion of the structure and parameterization of the

model. In Section III, we explore the macroeconomic effects of various policies

undertaken by the U.S., Japan, and OECD. In Section IV we compare various
                                           —2—


policy scenarios for the next 5   years,    and describe their macroeconomic

implications. Finally, in Section V, we present a formal analysis of the gain

to policy coordination in the current macroeconomic setting.



II. THE SIMULATION MODEL


A.   Theoretical Framework


     The model used in this paper was originally developed in Sachs and McKibbin

(19d5). Since the particular aim in that work was to study the effect of OECD

macroeconomic policies on developing countries, the model divided the world

economy into four regions: the U.S., the rest of the OECD (hereafter

ROECD),OPEC and the Non—oil Developing countries. In order to examine the

interdependence of the U.S. and Japan, we now expand the model to five regions

by extracting Japan from the ROECD region. A detailed description of the

theoretical framework of the model can be found in Sachs and McKibbin (1985)

and further applications can be found in Sachs (1985). The basic structure of

the model is not changed by adding Japan and so we concentrate in our discussion

on the new Japanese module of the model.

     Regions are linked through trade and asset markets. Each region consumes

the outputs of other regions, and the regions accumulate assets of other regions

through current account imbalances and portfolio shifts. These transactions are

summarized in a trade matrix and an asset matrix. Below we show briefly how

these two matrices are derived.

     Each region produces a single output and consumes that output as well as

the outputs of other regions. The trade matrix       linking the five regions is

             Japan is assumed to have essentially the same internal macroeconomic

structure as the U.S. and ROECD. Aggregate demand is the sum of private

domestic absorption (D), exports net of imports, and government spending (Ga).

Note that private absorption expenditure includes both consumption and

investment demand. Henceforth, P, P° are the output prices of Japan and ROECD

in the local currencies (yen and ECU, respectively). E3, and E° are the nominal

exchange rates, in $/yen and $/ECTJ. We define the U.S. real exchange rate

vis—a—vis Japan and ROECD as = (PJEJ/PU) and A° = (P0E0/P'), respectively.

Aggregate demand in Japan is written as:


(i)            =    +    + (c-+-c+C+c)       —
                                                  (c&°cc-iYc)/A

Private   absorption is written as a linear function of GDP net of total taxes T,

the real interest rate r, and the financial wealth, H


(2)             =   (l-S)(Q—T)               -   vr ÷
Note that we will assume that Japan has a relatively high saving rate (sd)

compared with the U.S. and ROECD.

      The import demands are specified as proportional to national absorption

(D÷G), and as a negative function of the relative import price:

      Consumer prices are a geometric weighted average of domestic and foreign

prices, with weights equal to initial expenditure shares.

Let       denote (P_P)/P, and                            denote the CPI inflation (p1_p3)/p.

We assume that the the nominal wage is predetermined in period t (that is,

contemporaneous shocks do not affect the current wage).                       The change in the wage

from period t to period t+l is a function of                       ,       and the change in

Then, by assumption of a fixed price markup over wages, we have:

interest rate.

      Now let us move to another important feature in the structure of this

model, namely the asset holding matrix. We make                   strong       assumptions about

portfolio holdings to simplify the model. Japanese and ROECD residents hold

U.S. assets, while U.S. residents do not hold Japanese and ROECD assets.

Mutual asset holdings between Japan and ROECD are also ignored to avoid more

complexity. Japanese residents hold: U.S. $—denominated claims on U.S. residents

(Ag), Japanese yen—denominated government bonds (Ba), and claims on the LDC's,

which are divided into yen—denominated (A) and U.S. $—denominated claims

(A). The Japanese government holds official claims on the LDC's (B) which

are yendenominated and issued at concessional rates (v). Table 2 shows the

matrix of asset holding. The wealth of Japanese residents is then

The change in Japanese government bonds (Ba) is related to the fiscal deficit

(DEF) as follows:

(ô)       DEF =           ÷   rB —    T — vB
(9)       B1 = (B+DEF)/(l+n)
The term (u-n) arises since B is measured relative to potential GDP, which grows

          Next we use asset market equilibrium conditions to determine the

exchange rate. We assume that $—denominated assets and yen—denominated assets

are imperfect substitutes in the Japanese portfolio, and that Japanese private

wealth (equation (i)) is divided between net yen assets (B+A3_A) and dollar

assets (+pu)/P, based on relative asset returns. The return differential is

tote   that the first expression gives the nominal interest rate differential

adjusted for nominal exchange rate changes, while the second expression shows

the real interest rate differential adjusted for real exchange rate changes (of

course, the two expressions are equivalent). The asset market equation gives

the net dollar asset demand as

Changes        in other asset holding are determined by assuming that initial asset

shares are maintained in the new steady state.

        The remaining part of the model contains the foreign trade and finance of

OPEC    arid    the LDCs.    Japan is assumed to behave in the same way as the U.S.            arid


ROECD v1s—a-vis OPEC and the LDCs in our model. We refer the reader to the

detailed discussion in Sachs and MCKIbbjri (1985).


B.      Numerical Parameterization and Simulation           Methodo1o
        The entire model is set forth ri Appendix i.                In scaling the model,

coefficients for structural equations, trade and expenditure shares, and initial

asset stocks are required.             Japan is treated as having the same basic structure

as the U.S. and OECD in aggregate demand, pricing, and money demand.                      The major

differences between them are in the composition and direction of trade and in

portfolio preferences.           Besides these differences, a few of the key assumed

parameter values (shown          Iri   Appendix i) for Japan are specified differently: the

saving rate for Japan is set higher than those of the U.S. and ROECD; the

parameter for Substitutability of Yen            and.   Dollar assets is set at 1 whereas for

ECU and Dollar assets is set at .O. This implies that ECU and                    Dollar   assets are

closer substitutes than Yen and Dollar assets.

        The direction and composition of trade is shown in Table 3, based on the

1983 trade data of the IMF Direction of Trade Statistics.                  A   detailed

The data on initial asset holding is reQuired when we linearize the model around

an initial equilibrium (based on 1983 data). The assumed asset matrix is shown

in Table 1. The data available for our work is rather limited and the

procedures to derive the matrix are sufficiently complicated that we only

mention key factors here. A detailed explanation about the general procedure is

described in the Sachs and McKibbin (1985) and specific details are also

available from the authors upon request. The data sources are: IMF World

Economic Outlook, World Debt Tables, World Bank; Economic Report of the

President; Japanese Ministry of Finance; the Bank of Japan; and Mattione

III. MODEL SIMULATIONS: POLICY CHANGES AND OIL PRICE SHOCK

     In this section we use the model to examine the effects of fiscal and

monetary policies in the U.S. and Japan on world macroeconomic equilibrium.

We also consider the effects of an increase in tariffs on U.S. imports of

Japanese goods and a retaliatory Japanese tariff on imports of U.S. goods.

Finally, in this section we consider the impact of an oil price shock in our

model.

     Tables 5—il show the various effects of these policies. Note that in

these tables "%"   signifies   percentage deviation from the initial baseline; "d"

signifies the level deviation from the initial baseline; and 'T$bl" signifies

deviation from the initial baseline in 198)4 constant IJ.S. dollars.

A.   Fiscal Expansion (u.s. and Japan)

     The change in fiscal policy we consider is a sustained 1 %   of   GNP increase

in real government expenditure commencing in 198)4, with no initial change in

taxes. Over time taxes are raised in line with the debt service payments in

order to keep the government budget deficit constant at 1% of GNP.

     The results for a U.S. fiscal expansion are shown in Table 5. The fiscal

stimulus increases U.S. GNP by 1.0% in the first year and 1.1% in the second

year. However this expansionary effect is not sustained as rising interest rates,

higher prices, and a strong dollar increasingly crowd out the fiscal stimulus.

Inflation initially falls by .3 percent in the U.S., due to the exchange rate

appreciation (against both yen and ECU) and the initial sluggishness of domestic

prices. However inflation rises in 1985 and after, as rising domestic prices

resulting from increased domestic demand (via the Phillips curve) dominate the

deflationary effects of a strong dollar.

     The Japanese and HOECD economies gain in terms of GNP from the U.S. fiscal

expansion. Trade balances in both regions improve and provide a stimulus to

domestic output although the movement of capital into the U.S. (and away from

Japan and ROECD), which is attracted by rising U.S. interest rates, raises

interest rates in both Japan and ROECD. This tends to limit the output

gains.

     These results may, in fact, underestimate the effects on bilateral trade

between the U.S. and Japan. We have experimented with the price elasticity of

U.S. imports from Japan and found that an increase in this elasticity from 1.5

to 2.5 enlargens the fall in U.S. net exports to Japan from $2.9b1 to *3.8b1.

The stimulus to Japan from the U.S. fiscal expansion is therefore increased.

     The case of a Japanese fiscal expansion is shown in Table 6. The Japanese

fiscal expansion has qualitatively similar effects on the Japanese economy as

the U.S. fiscal expansion has on the U.S. economy. Japanese GNP rise by 0.6% in

the first year. This is less than for the U.S. case because of the assumption

of a larger propensity to save in Japan. An interesting point to note is that

the Yen appreciates in the case of a Japanese fiscal expansion (as does the U.S.

dollar in the case of a U.S. Fiscal expansion). This comes from our assumption

of high (but not infinite) asset substituability between Japanese and U.S.

assets reflecting the recent move towards liberalization of Japanese financial

markets. The importance of this assumption will be discussed further below.

The mechanism of adjustment underlying our results is the familiar

Muridell/Flernming story: The Japanese fiscal expansion stimulates domestic demand

and drives up domestic interest rates. These higher rates attract foreign

capital. This increased demand for Japanese assets tends to appreciate the

currency even as the trade balance worsens.

     Note that the rise in interest rates in the country with the fiscal

expansion is greater than in the foreign countries (i.e. an increase in the

interest diffential) despite our assumption of high asset substitutability.

This is because the fiscal expansion gives rise to expectations of future

depreciation of the currency after an initial appreciation. The interest rate

differential compensates for the anticipated future depreciation.    To a smaller

extent, the higher interest rates also reflect a rising risk premium on the

assets of the country undertaking the fiscal expansion.

     The cross—country effects of U.S. and Japanese fiscal policy differ mainly

because of the relative sizes of the two economies. The sheer size of the U.S.

fiscal expansion relative to the Japanese fiscal expansion (Japanese GNP is

assumed to be 35% of U.S. GNP so a fiscal shock of 1% of Japanese GNP compares

to a fiscal shock of .3% of U.S. GNP) means that the U.S. has a much larger

impact on Japanese GNP than vice versa. Japan gains .6% of GNP in the first

year following a U.S. fiscal expansion and continues to gain over the first four

years. The U.S on the other hand gains only 0.2% of GNP in the first year of a

Japanese expansion, and that effect declines rapidly in the following years.



B.   Monetary Expansion (u.s. and Japan)

     The results for a sustained increase in money of 1% commencing in l98L are

shown in Table I for the U.S. and Table 8 for Japan. A monetary expansion in

either Japan or the U.S. raises GNP in the originating country but has

beggar—thy-neighbour consequences for the foreign country in the first year of

the shock. A U.S. •monetary expansion raises U.S. GNP by 0.9% in the first year

although the stimulus to GNP is dissipated by the fourth year. In Japan the

inital rise in GNP from an increase in the Japanese money supply is .8% in the

first year and, as in the case for the U.S., the stimulus to GNP is eliminated

by the fourth year.

     The exchange rate provides substantial insulation from the consequences of

foreign monetary shocks. In both the U.S. and Japan, the country which initiates

the monetary expansion incurs a currency depreciation. This is again the

familiar result from a simple Mundell/Flemming model where the monetary

expansion reduces domestic interest rates, induces a capital outflow and hence

results in a depreciation of the currency. In our model this leads to an

inflationary impulse in the source country in the first year which is further

exacerbated in the second year when wages and domestic prices adjust to the

higher import prices and the demand stimulus. The trade balance of the country

which initiates the monetary expansion improves initially, but then worsens

after the first year, as the increased demand for imports that results from the

output expansion dominates the effects on imports and exports from the exchange

rate depreciation.


C.   Effect of a General Rise in Tariffs

     In this section we consider the effect of two changes in the level of

tariffs. In the first case, shown in Table 9, the U.S. is assumed to impose an

across—the—board tariff increase on imports from Japan of 30%. The tariff is

assumed to be neutral with respect to total tax revenues (i.e., tariff revenues

are redistributed to the private sector). In the second case, shown in Table

10, we assume the same U.S. policy but with a Japanese response of an

across—the—board tariff increase of 30% on all imports from the U.S.

     In the case where only the U.S. increases tariffs, U.S. GNP rises in the

first three years as domestic residents substitute away from Japanese goods.

The Yen depreciates by 12.1% initially and continues to depreciate as a result

of the shift in demand. The bilateral trade balance between the U.S. and Japan

improves from the U.S. standpoint by $1l-Lbl in 198)4 and the improvement rises to

$l5.lbl by 1987. The GNP gains in the U.S. are eventually reversed. The dollar

appreciates relative to both the Yen and Ecu as demand pressures push up

interest rates in the U.S. This appreciation together with the increase in

import demand implies that the U.S. overall trade balance improves only by

$3.8b1 in l984, with the gain from reduced Japanese imports being substantially

offset by other bilateral deficits. The shift in U.S. demand is reflected in

GNP gains both for the U.S. and ROECD. Note however that by 1987' rising

interest rates and the strong dollar crowd out any further gains.1

     Table 10 shows the case where Japan responds with a similar tariff

increase (with revenues redistributed ).The bilateral trade gains for the U.S.

in relation to Japan are reduced from $l)4bl to 6.8b1 in l984. The gains to U.S.

GNP are also reduced and turn negative by 1986. The rise in U.S. goods prices

in Japan induces Japanese residents to substitute away from the U.S. goods.

This reduces the demand for dollars and hence reduces the depreciation of the

Yen which occurs as a results of U.S. policy. The Japanese trade balance

deterioration is reversed slightly to an overall decline of $IL.Obl in 198)4.



D. Oil Price Shock

     The effects of an oil price shock are shown in Table 11. Inflation rises

in each of the industrialized regions with Japan being hardest hit. The Dollar

depreciates relative to the Ecu but appreciates relative to the Yen. The Yen

depreciates relative to all currencies. The depreciated Yen coritributes to the

inflationary impulse in Japan, while the terms—of—trade loss causes an



    'We also considered the case where the revenue from the tariff is used to
reduce the U.S. budget deficit. In this case U.S. GNP declines in the first
year by $1.8 bl and continues to fall as a result of the tariff. There is some
offset to this decline from gradually falling interest rates but this is
insufficient to counter the effect of the fall in demand. The U.S. trade

increasing output decline, equal to 2% of GNP in 1985 and 3.7% in 1987. The

Japanese trade balance deteriorates due to the higher oil price.



E. Simulation results compared with other Models

     We now briefly describe the multipliers for monetary and fiscal policy in

the MCM (Federal Reserve Board Multicountry Model) and the EPA (Japanese

Economic Planning Agency) models. These provide a useful benchmark for

comparison with the policy multipliers from our own (IMS) model:



        1.   Fiscal Multipliers

     The impact multipliers for GNP in the MCM and EPA models compared to our

own "IMS" model are:

                     EPA                MCM                     IMS
              impact   3 year     impact      3 year     impact 3 year

U.S.           2.0         1.93   1.5             0.83    1.0         1.0
Japan          1.1         1.5    1.2                     0.6         0.7


The multipliers for GNP from these larger models are uniformly greater than we

find. A major explanation of this difference is the importance of portfolio

adjustment (including a high degree of sustitutability between U.S. and Japanese

assets) and the greater flexibility of the exchange rate in our model. The trade




balance improves by $8.3 bi and the bilateral U.S. Japan trade balance improves
by $14.8 bi. Again there is a shift out of consumption of Japanese goods in the
U.S. but the overall trade balance doesn't improve by as much because
consumption of ROECD goods rises.
                                               —25—



balance in the expanding country deteriorates more in our model as the larger

appreciation crowds out net exports, and this crowding out reduces the overall

stimulus from the fiscal expansion. The large difference in exchange rate

behavior is as follows. For the U.S. fiscal expansion we find a dollar

appreciation of )4.0% and for the Japanese fiscal expansion we find a Yen

appreciation of 3.2%. In the EPA and MCM models, the dollar appreciation is

much smaller at .6% and .3%, respectively. In the EPA and MCM models, the Yen

actually depreciates following a Japanese fiscal expansion by 1.5% and .3%.



       2.    Monetary Multipliers

      A monetary expansion in the EPA model has a smaller impact on GNP than in

our model. The multipliers are conveniently summarized as follows:

                                  EPA                        IMS
                         impact      3 year           impact 3 year

      U.S.                O.LL          0.1            0.9         0.6
     Japan                0.Ot          0.09           0.8         0.5

The results from the monetary- simulations differ far more from our model than

do the fiscal policy simulations. (The MCM does not report a directly

comparable experiment).



F.    The Importance of the degree of $/Yen Substitutability

      The move towards a more open financial system in Japan and the

"Internationalization" of the Yen has important implications for monetary and

fiscal policies. In this section we examine some of these implications.

      In the results above we have assumed a high degree of susbstitutability
                                     —26—




between Japanese and U.S. assets. Table 12 illustrates the consequences for

fiscal policy if we reduce the degree of susbstitutability. The results reflect

the effect of fiscal policy in a regime such as that in Japan before 1980. In

this case the yen exchange rate depreciates by 1.7% following a Japanese fiscal

expansion. The output multipliers are also substantially larger with a rise in

GNP of 1.7% on impact. These results are much closer to those discussed above

for the MCM and EPA models.

     If we take these results as the benchmark for pre—1980 and the results

presented earlier as the situation with more flexible capital markets then the

freeing up of capital flows has several important implications for Japan. A

move to a more open financial system has the effect of lowering the effect of

fiscal policy on GNP, but also reduces the inflationary consequences of a fiscal

expansion. Higher substitutability also results in a positive transmission of

the fiscal impulse to the U.S. and ROECD economies, while it means that a given

fiscal stimulus causes a much larger deterioration in the trade balance and

current account.

     We can indirectly compare ours results with recent econometric estimates by

Fukao(1985). He finds that a sterilized foreign exchange intervention by the

Bank of Japan of $18 billion to support the Yen would cause the Yen to

appreciate by 3.8%. In our case of low asset substitutability we find a Yen

appreciation of 3.14% for the same amount of intervention. In contrast we find

only a .5% appreciation in our case of high asset substitutability, implying

near perfect substitutability. There are two main reasons to believe that the

econometric estimates are too low and that our assumptions may be more appropriate.

First there has been continuing liberalization of the Yen in the last five

years, so that econometric estimates of the average substitutability during the

period 1979 to 1983 (as by Fukao)    will   tend to underestimate the substitutabi-

lity as of 1985. Second, movements in the Yen and dollar since 1980 are much

easier to explain under the assumption of very high substitutability. We simu—

lated a U.S. fiscal expansion of 1% of GNP in the case that we call low asset

substitutability. In this case the Yen/$ exchange rate only appreciates by

1.1%. Together with the results presented in table 12 this implies that a shift

in fiscal stance by the U.S. equal to a 4%         of   GNP fiscal expansion, and by Japan

of 2% of GNP fiscal contraction (the approximate magnitudes since 1983), have

the following effects in 1984 ($    billion):

Iv. ALTERNATIVE SCEI\IARLOS FOR TEE NEXT FIVE YEARS

     In   this section we use the model to generate alternative paths for major

variable in the three industrialized regions as a results of different

assumption about monetary and fiscal policy. We examine four cases:

      • A path of continued large U.S. fiscal deficits with small fiscal

           deficits in Japan and surpluses in ROECD;

      O A gradual shift in U.S. policy tociards smaller fiscal deficits and

           less tight monetary policy, with no change in Japanese or ROECD

           policies;

      O    The same U.S. policy path but with Japan responding to offset any

           harmful effects on GNP;

      o    The same U.S. policy path and Japanese response with the ROECD

           responding to offset the decline in GNP.

Case 1. Baseline with no policy change

     In this section we use the model to generate a baseline simulation for the

period from 198k to 1989. Initial conditions are supplied to the model for GNP

gap in the U.S., Japan, and the ROECD as well as initial inflation and. initial

real exchange rates and paths for fiscal policy and monetary policy. We assume

that the money supply is adjusted to maintain a given path for real interest

rates. Our other assumptions are the following:

We make constant term adjustments to the model to improve the 19814 forecasts.

The results from 19814 to 1989 are generated by the model dynamics. Table 13

contains the results for major variables in the three industrialized regions.

Note that exchange rates are measured as percentage deviations from 1980 levels.

The sustained fiscal deficits in the U.S. imply a rising path of real interest

rates, and hence the output gap increases from 3.14% in 19814 to 5.0% in 1987.

This is accompanied by rising inflation to 1985 and a weakening dollar with

inflation rising from 3.8% in 198)4 to 14.5% in 1985, then declining to 1.6% by

1989. There is little improvement in the bilateral U.S./Japan trade position.

Case 2. Gradual Shift in U.S. policy mix

     Table 1)4 contains the results for a change in U.S. fiscal policy towards

smaller fiscal deficits and less tight monetary policy. The results are

presented as deviations from the baseline. The policy followed is a reduction

in the fiscal deficit (as a percent of GNP) and a rise in the level of nominal

money balances of the following:



                               19814    1985   1986     1981   1988    1989

     Fiscal Deficit           —0.5%    —1.0%   —1.5%   —2.0%   —2.5% —3.0%
     Money Supply                  0    0.8%    1.6%    3.0%    5.0%   7.0%

with the deficit at 3.0% of GNP below the baseline from 1990 onwards and money

growing at 2% above base from 1989 onwards. This monetary policy is chosen so

as to prevent output from falling in the initial stages of the policy shift.

Notice that output in the U.S. rises in 198)4 despite the fiscal contraction and

no change in level of nominal money balances that year. This arises partly from

the forward—looking behavior in the asset markets in our model. The expected

future fiscal contraction/monetary expansion and hence expected depreciation of

the exchange rate induces a large current depreciation which stimulates demand

for U.S. goods in 19814. The trade balance improves by $214 bi which accounts for

most of the rise in GNP. The dollar continues to depreciate relative to both

the Yen and the Ecu as U.S. interest rates fall. Inflation rises by 0.5% in

198)4 due to the depreciation and rises further in 1985 as demand pressure feeds

through to prices.

     Japan and the ROECD are both adversely affected by the change in U.S.

policy. The weakening of the dollar worsens the trade position of both regions

and, without any policy actions, the GNP gap increases in both these regions.

The Yen depreciates relative to the Ecu due to the differential impact of the

U.S. policy shift on trade between the regions. The impact of both the

appreciation and the decline in demand for Japanese goods is reflected in the

fall in inflation of .2% in 198)4, and a continuing fall in inflation thereafter.

Case 3. Japanese response to the shift in U.S. policy

     In Table 15 we illustrate the effects of a policy response in Japan to the

change in U.S. policy. We assume that Japan follows a more expansionary fiscal

policy, increasing bond—financed government spending by 1% of GNP. We also

assume a Japanese monetary expansion of 0.5% in the level of nominal money

balances. This policy response keeps Japanese GNP approximately unchanged from

the initial baseline. This response strengthens the Yen further relative to

both the dollar and the Ecu. Inflation remains lower in Japan despite the

fiscal and monetary expansion since the strong Yen offsets the effect of rising

domestic prices on the CPI. The switch in U.S. policy has a favorable impact on

Japanese output and inflation when accompanied by expansionary policies in

Japan. Note that in the planning model used by the Ministry of Finance, the

inflationary consequences of a fiscal expansion would be larger than are reported

here. This is in part because the MOF model would predict a smaller exchange

rate appreciation.

Case )4.   ROECD   response to the shift in U.S. and Japanese policy

     Table 16 contains the results for a change in ROECD policy given the switch

in the U.S. fiscal/monetary mix and the Japanese policy response. We assume

that the ROECD adjusts fiscal policy such that the GNP gap returns to its value

before the U.S. policy shift. In this case we assume an increase in the ROECD

fiscal deficit of .75% of ROECD GNP in l98L and .14%   thereafter.
     The ROECI) fiscal expansion returns the ROECD output gap to its original

level. It also proves to be beneficial (in terms of higher GNP) to both the

U.S. and Japan as both these regions trade positions improve. As a result of

the U.S. policy shift with compensating changes in Japan and the ROECD the

dollar is depreciated by 9.8% in 198)4 and 15.1% by 1987 relative to both Yen and

Ecu. Inflation is reduced in ROECD and Japan although inflation rises in the

U.S. as it reimports some of the inflation that it exported in the years prior

to 19814 when it maintained a strong dollar. Interest rates are also reduced in

ROECD and Japan with initially higher interest rates in the U.S. The trade

imbalances of 198)4 are reduced by the policy; the U.S. trade balance is improved

by $33 bi in 198)4 and the Japanese and ROECD surpluses are reduced. The

bilateral deficit that the U.S. has with the ROECD is reduced by $22.9 bl in

198)4 although the U.S.—Japan trade imbalance only falls by $6.2 bi in 198)4.



V. POLICY COORDINATION AND OPTIMAL POLICY RESPONSE TO THE CURRENT BASELINE

     In this section we use dynamic programming techniques to find the optimal

dynamic policy path for each country, assuming that policy—makers are acting to

stabilize four targets: output, inflation, the current account, and the fiscal

deficit. We compare the path of the world economy that is reached when

policy—makers in each country optimize in a coordinated fashion, with the path

which emerges from no change in current policies (i.e., our baseline path).

The techniques used in this section are more formally developed in

Oudiz and Sachs (l981) and Sachs and McKibbin (1985).

       We assume that each region i (i=U.S, Japan, ROECD) has a welfare function

of the form V1 =               —

               1

        DEF. is the fiscal deficit
                   1

We select a quadratic form for V. Specifically, we assume 13 =                             (1/1.1)   and

     = a .Q 2. +                 c 2

        In the decentralized case (also known                         as   the non—cooperative equilibrium or

Nash equilibrium) we assume that each region selects policies (M, G, and T) to

maximize the welfare function V, given the structure of our model and taking

the actions of other governments as given. This involves complex dynamic

programming techniques and will not be discussed any further here (see Oudiz and

Sachs (l98I-)).

        In this paper we are primarily concerned with the implications of policy

coordination, so we only report the outcome of policy coordination between the

three industrialized regions in response to the conditions assumed in the base-

line. We model the coordination by assuming a central policy authority carrying

out the optimization problem outlined above. In this case the weights on each
                                      —39—



country in the coalition are chosen so that each country in the coalition is at

least as well off under coordination as it is under the non—cooperative regime

(not reported). The weights are the following: U.S. (.34), Japan (.21), ROECD

(.45). The policies followed are (as deviation from the baseline policies):

     It is clear from this table that given our assumed utility functions there

is a generalized expansion in the world money supply. The U.S. has a fiscal

contraction whereas Japan and the ROECD have fiscal expansions relative to base.

Note that although the Japanese fiscal expansion is initially greater than the

ROECD fiscal expansion, the Japanese fiscal expansion declines over time whereas
                                     —40—



the ROECD fiscal expansion continues to increase. The consequences of these

policies are shown in table 17'. The output gap initially rises in the U.S. due

to the contraction in fiscal policy, though it falls relative to base from

1986 onwards. The monetary expansion in the U.S. together with the relatively

depreciated exchange rate has an inflationary consequence in the U.S. with

inflation 0.8% higher than base in 1984. The depreciated dollar means that

Japan and ROECD escape the inflationary consequences of their respective

monetary expansions although the ROECD quickly loses its deflationary gains as

the monetary expansion outweighs the effect of the currency appreciation on

domestic prices. By 1986 inflation is 1.6% higher than base in the ROECD but

this is accompanied by a reduction in the output gap of ).i.3%. The output gap

in both Japan and ROECD declines due to the monetary and fiscal expansions.

The U.S. trade deficit is reduced by $52 bi in 1984, at the expense of the

ROECD trade surplus, which falls by $48 bi in 1984. This shift is the result

of several factors. From the policy multipliers presented above we know that

a U.S. fiscal contraction of 3.1% improves the U.S. trade balance by $48 bi,

and worsens the ROECD trade account by $44 bi. An ROECD fiscal expansion of

0.5% adds a further $6 bl improvement to the U.S. trade account, and a further

$8 bl worsening of the ROECD trade account. The Japanese fiscal expansion of

1.4% also improves the U.S. and ROECD trade balances by $4 bi each. Given the

fact that monetary expansion in our model causes the expanding country's

output to rise, with little effect on the trade balance or on the output of

other countries, our model concludes that fiscal policy redistributes

bilateral trade imbalances while monetary policy expands domestic demand with

little international spillover.

     Policy coordination in the face of the baseline has several attractive

features. Japan has a non—inflationary reduction in the output gap and ROECD

has a large reduction in the output gap with a small rise in inflation due to

the fact that their monetary expansions are occurring in the context of

currency appreciation, with the currency appreciation coming mainly from the

U.S. fiscal contraction. The output gap in the U.S. initially rises, but is

lower during 1986—88. There is also a small rise in inflation coming from the

currency depreciation. World interest rates are lowered and the global trade

imbalances are substantially reduced. The main message of this simulation is

that given the utility functions specified above, all of the countries should

respond with a monetary expansion to the sharp budget cuts in the United States.

Also, Japan and the ROECD may- be well placed now for modest fiscal expansions of

their own.




VI. SUMMARY OF RESULTS

     It is worthwhile to enumerate briefly the major results of the simulation

study. As in the paper, these may be divided into three sections: the effects

of policy changes; the projection for adjustment in the next 5 years; and the

role for policy coordination in the current economic environment.

     Effects of Policy Changes:

1. For both the U.S. and Japan, a fiscal expansion raises output, worsens the

    current account balance and causes an exchange rate appreciation. A shift
                                       —43—



     in fiscal stance by the U.S. equal to )4%   of   GNP   expansion, and by Japan of
     21e of GNP contraction (the approximate magnitudes of change since 1981), are

     calculated to have the following effects in 198)4 (       billion):
                                      U.S.
                                      ____                      Japan
        Current Account              —r.8                       +28.8
        Bilateral Trade Balance      —16.0                      +i6 .0
        Yen/$ (% Change)              20.8                      —20.8

     Thus, the fiscal changes alone can explain the bulk of the worsening U.S.

     current account deficit, the improvement of Japan's current account

     balance, and the appreciation of the dollar relative to the Yen since 1980.

        These calculations may underestimate the bilateral effects. With a

     higher price elasticity (2.5 vs. 1.5) for U.S. imports from Japan we find

                                      U.S.                      Japan

        Current Account              —80.0                      +31.6
        Bilateral Trade Balance      —21.)4
        Yen/$ (% Change)              16.6

2.   The liberalization of the Yen in international financial markets has

     significant ramifications for the operation of fiscal policy. Comparing

     the case of low asset substitutability between the Yen and $          (Table   12),

     with the case of high substitutability (Table 6), we find that high

     substitutability:

          a) reduces the fiscal multiplier on output;

          b) causes the Yen to appreciate rather than depreciate;

          c) causes Japanese fiscal expansion to worsen the external balance

              rather than improve the external balance;

          d) causes fiscal expansion to be positively rather than negatively

              transmitted to U.S. GNP and to the U.S. external balance.

3.   Fiscal policy is positively transmitted to the other country, since it

     causes a currency appreciation in the country undertaking the expansion.

4.   Monetary expansion is effective in raising output in both economies. Per

     unit increase of GNP, monetary policy is more inflationary than fiscal

     policy, and is less adverse for the external balance. These differences

     result primarily from the fact that fiscal expansion causes an exchange

     rate appreciation, while monetary policy causes an exchange rate

     depreciation.

5.   Monetary policy changes are not transmitted significantly into foreign GNP,

     since movements in the exchange rate effectively insulate the foreign

     economy from the policy change.

6.   A discriminatory tariff increase in the U.S. on Japanese goods would cause

     a significant contraction in Japan, a sharp Yen depreciation, and a rise in

     inflation in Japan. In the U.S. the policy would cause a dollar

     appreciation against the Yen and the Ecu; an improvement in the trade

     balance against Japan, but a significant worsening in the trade balance

     against the rest of the OECD. Note that the simulation (Table 9) assumes

     that the tariff change is revenue neutral. The U.S. current account

     surplus would improve more if the tariff revenues were used to raise

     overall taxes.

T.   With retaliation from Japan (shown in Table 10), the improvement in the

     U.S. current account balance from a tariff is almost completely eliminated.

8.   An oil price shock is highly stagflationary throughout the OECD, with the
                                       —45—



     most extreme effects felt in Japan. The Yen depreciates against both the $

     and Ecu after an oil price increase.

     Projections for Adjustment in the Next Five Years:

9.   A gradual policy shift in the U.S. towards fiscal contraction and monetary

     expansion (Table 14) would:

          a) improve the U.S. current account by $50 billion (1984 $)          by   1987;

          b) raise U.S. inflation by about 3/4      of   1 percentage point;

          c) reduce output abroad, in Japan and ROECD.

10. The contractionary effects of the U.S. policy shift could be offset by

     modest fiscal expansion in both Japan and ROECD (shown in Table i5).

     Role For Policy Coordination:

11. In comparing the optimal cooperative path for policy in each country with

     the baseline, optimal policies would call for:

          a) greater U.S. fiscal contraction

          b) greater Japanese and ROECD fiscal expansions

          c) a generalized monetary expansion

LDC DEBT

     Following the same procedures as Sachs and McKibbin (1985), we are

able to derive the breakdown of LDC gross debt into type of lender

(private or official) and into currency composition ($US—denominated or

Ecu, including Japanese yen). We then subtract the loans by Japan and

OPEC to the LDCs from the original values (source: IMF, Ministry of

Finance). Note that we assume that all OPEC loans are $US—denominated

and that Japanese loans are divided into three parts: yen—denominated

official loans, yen—denominated private loans, and $US—denominated pri-

vate loans. The breakdown of net debt (shown in Table Bi) is derived by

subtracting LDC reserves by currency composition from correspondent

loans (source: IMF).


OPEC ASSET HOLDING

     Based on data contained in Mattione (1983), we find the breakdown of OPEC

investment divided into $_denominated in LDC, $—denominated in U.S. and

Ecu—denominated investment. In this work we substract the value of OPEC

investments in Japan (assumed yen—denominated) (source: Japanese Ministry of

Finance and others) from Ecu—denominated investment (given in Table B2).



JAPANESE ASSET HOLDING

     In order to estimate the total amount of Japanese holdings of U.S. assets,

we have to pick up the major items in capital flows and calculate the existing

stock value on each item. Major items between the U.S. and Japan are securities
                                     —56—



investment (in particular, bonds investment) and long—term and short—term

private loans. U.S.—bond investment by Japanese institutional investors

(including pension funds and insurance companies), in particular, are expanding

rapidly. We estimate the total value of Japanese holding of U.S. assets as $35

billion in the end of 1983 (.010 as a share of U.S. GDP).

     In order to find the outstanding stock of Japanese government bonds, we

take the same assumption as in the ROECD case, that the outstanding stock of

Japanese government debt is the same proportion of Japanese GDF as the U.S.

stock is of U.S. GDP.
