                                       ABSTRACT




     The U.S. has significant interests involved in the world debt problem. It

affects the profitability and even the stability of our banking system, but the

debt problem also matters because debt service requires trade surpluses for debt-

ors. Debtor countries have made their goods extra competitive, are selling in

our market and are competing with our exports. The debt problem is therefore a

part, though perhaps a small part, of the U.S. trade crisis. Finally we have a

major foreign policy stake in the debt crisis in that debt collection brings

about social and political instability.

     The paper sets out debt facts, followed with a brief look at the origins of

the debt problem. The "transfer problem" is the general framework in which we

discuss the problem of debt service for the debtor countries. We then discuss

bank exposure and the quality of debts. The paper then addresses the trade

implications of debt service and concludes with an overview of alternative pro-

posals for solving the debt problem.

          This paper deals with the U.S. interest in the world debt problem. We

have a major stake in the debt problem because it affects the profitablity and

even the stability of our banking system. But it also matters because debt

service requires trade surpluses for debtors. We are now experiencing the

reverse side of the coin from collecting debt: debtor countries, having made

their goods extra competitive are selling in our market and are competing with

our exports. The debt problem is therefore a part, though perhaps a small

part, of the US trade crisis. Finally we have a major foreign policy stake in

the debt crisis in that debt collection brings about social and political

instability.                                                              -




          The paper reviews these various aspects of the debt problem. Section 1

sets out debt facts, followed in section 2 with a brief look at the origins

of the debt problem. That issue is important in laying the groundwork for

solutions that involve sharing the adjustment. The "transfer problem" is the

general framework in which we discuss the problem of debt service for the

debtor countries in section 3. Section 4 deals with bank exposure and the

quality of less developed countries' (LDCs) debts. The U.S. trade implications

of the debt crisis are briefly addressed in section 6. The paper concludes

with an overview of alternative proposals for solving the debt problem.

1. DEBT FACTS

        In this section we provide an overview of debt facts: in the aggregate

and in country detail, who owes whom how much, with what maturity, and in

which currency.2



An Overview

        Table 1 shows aggregate debt data for selected years both in current

and constant dollars. There is a problem in finding a suitable deflator for

the world economy. Possible candidates are the U.S. GNP deflator, or either

import or export prices for LDCs. We select instead the price (export unit

value) of industrial countries' exports as a broader price index of trends in

the world economy. World trade prices since 1980 have declined, and even in

1986 are below their 1980 level. Accordingly this index behaves very

differently from, for example, the U.S. deflator which has been steadily

increasing.

        Since 1978 LDC debt has increased by 142 percent in nominal terms and

88 percent in real terms. In these aggregate data we observe the slowdown of

debt growth since 1982 and the effect of changing trends in world prices with

inflation in the early period and deflation since 1980.


2There is a lot of flux in debt data. A good survey of the problems can
be found in Mills (1986). We use here the IMF data, data reported by
Morgan Guaranty World Financial Markets and the US country exposure
survey except where otherwise noted.
3The classification of countries follows the IMF. See World Economic
Outlook, October l986,pp.31—34.

          A second perspective is provided by looking at debt relative to some

scale variable. The most common scale variables are exports of goods and

services and GD?. Table 2 shows debt relative to GD?.

        The most interesting point made by this data is that differences, at

least at this aggregate level, are minor. Latin America is normally singled

out as the problem case. But on a debt—income basis non—oil Middle east

countries stand out as having an even larger burden. The other point to note

is the deterioration in debt ratios since 1982. This is surprising when one

sees banks today rationing credit. The explanation lies primarily in the fact

that GD? in U.s. dollars has declined for most debtor countries as a result of

large real depreciation.4

        There is another interesting presentation of debt—income ratios,

singling out different groupings of countries. Interestingly small, low—income

countries have a higher debt/GD? ratio (64.0 %) than net oil imports (35.3%)

or the grpup of problem debtors (46.6 %). Thus countries in a group with

Afghanistan and Bangladesh have higher debt ratios than the group including

Brazil and Mexico. We shall see below that this does not translate into higher

debt burdens since much of the poor countries' debt is concessional.



Short, Long, Official and Private Debt

        The maturity structure of the debt is primarily medium—term.

Throughout the period 1978-86 the share of short-term debt (less than one year

maturity) in total debt of all capital importing LDCs never exceeded 20

percent. But, of course, there are significant differences between countries.

The larger borrowing from commercial banks the shorter the maturity of debt.

In the period to 1982 there was an increase in the share of short—tern debt,

reflecting the increasing recourse to commercial bank financing. But since


4Note that real GD? and dollar GDP behave very differently. A real
depreciation may raise real GD? but is certain to lower dollar GD?.
                                      S



then, with rescheduling and increased official lending the share of short—tern

debt has declined from 20 percent to only 13 percent. Since most debtors are

not in a position to amortize their debts the distinction between short and

long—term debt is becoming increasingly irrelevant.

        Table 3 shows the share of debt to official creditors in total debt.

The table reports the data for various regions.

         The differences among country groupings in their funding is quite

striking. Latin America stands out as borrowing from private sources a very

much larger share than the remaining countries. But there is also an

interesting difference in the behavior over time. For Latin America and Africa

the absolute and relative increase in official credit since 1982 is much more

substantial than for other regions. In 1985, for example, commercial bank

exposure declined in absolute terms while official exposure, especially of

multilateral agencies, increased.



Debt Service Burdens

        The burden of debt service is made up of interest payments and

amortization. As such it is affected by three factors:
                                      6




        .The maturity profile of debt which dicatates the amount of
amortization in a given year. Any bunching of maturities would translate into
large year—to—year fluctuations in debt service.

        .Interest rates on the debt. This factor depends on the private—
official composition of the debt. Official debt may be concessional and long—
term while private typically involves floating rate interest payments.

         .Debt service measured relative to some benchmark such as exports or
GDP. The benchmark is affected by the country's real exchange rate. Real
depreciation, as already nioted above, will reduce real GDP in dollars and
hence raise the debt income ratio. Measuring debt relative to exports imples
that changes in the value of exports, say as a result of exchange rate policy
or as a consequence of changes in world commodity prices, will affect the debt
export ratio.


        The distinction between long and short—term debt, in an environment of

universal rescheduling, is becoming quite uninteresting. We thus focus only on

interest payments. Table 4 shows debt service measured by interest payments as

a fraction of debt, GD?, and exports. We again focus on the geographical

distribution.

        The first row makes apparent the difference in effective interest

rates paid. Africa and Asia have a significantly larger share of concessional

loans and accordingly interest payments as a fraction of debt are in excess of

2 percentage points less than for Latin America. As a benchmark we can compare

the effective interest rate with the L,ibor rate, which in 1985—86 averaged 7.8

percent. Divergences of the effective rate from Libor reflects concessional

loans and the spreads above Libor on commercial bank loans.

        The interest burden as a fraction of GDP shows Africa and Europe in

the middle range, a low figure for Asiaand high indebtedness for Latin America

and the non—oil middle east with high indebtedness. Differences between the

GD? and export—based comparisons reflect economic structure. Europe is wide

open while Latin America is much more closed. Latin America's export to GD?

ratio is much lower than that for Asia, for example.

        The difference between debtors with commercial and those with

concessional debt becomes particularly apparent when comparing effective

interest payments. While the effective interest rate for small, low—income

countries in 1986 averaged 3.4 percent, for the remaining groups it was

between 6.9 and 8.7 percent.



Currency Denomination

        The currency composition of lending to LDCs is not well documented.

There is little doubt that the major part of loans, perhaps 60 to 70 percent,

is in U.s. dollars. The denomination issue is very important since large

fluctuations of real exchange rates between the U.S., Europe and Japan involve

changing burdens of real debt and changing bank exposure.
                                     8



          Since February 1985 the dollar has declined in world markets by more

than fifty percent relative to key currencies. Over the same period prices of

industrial countries' exports which we might use as an index of prices in

world trade have fallen only 5 percent while prices of commodities exported by

LDCs fell 7 percent over the 1982—86 period. For debtor countries the movement

of the dollar thus did not carry significant conmsequences if they were

entirely denominated in dollars. If, however, a significant part was

denominated in Yen or in European currencies the vast exchange rate movements

would have meant an increase in real debt burdens.5



Major Problem Debtors

          We conclude the review of facts with a listing of major problem

debtors. This group of countries corresponds to the "15 heavily indebted

countries" Table 5 shows their total debts, interest payments and debt per

capita.


5This increase in real debt burdens would have outpaced any advantages
from cumulatively lower interest rates on non—dollar debt. As is well—
known exchange rate movements have far exceeded the depreciation
implicit in international interest differentials.

          In this table Chile, Peru, and Bolivia are shown as having the highest

debt/GD? ratio while Chile, Argentina, and Mexico show the highest per capita

debt figures. Bolivia and Morocco are interesting in that their debts are

predominantly to official creditors. Finally Nigeria is of interest because of

the relatively low per capita debt by comparison with the other countries.



3. THE ORIGINS OF THE DEBT PROBLEM

          In this section we review where the debt problem stems from. Three

facts combined to produce the debt crisis of 1982. The proportions vary from

one case to another, but in almost all instances there is a combination of the

following factors:
                                        10


        • Poor macroeconomic policies of debtor countries. These include
specifically overvaluation of their currencies.

        • The downturn in the world economy, involvingsharply higher interest
rates and lower growth.

          • Initial overlending and subsequent credit denial by commercial
banks.

          We now review these factors in turn.



Domestic Mismanagement

          In the late 1970s debtor countries worldwide, with rare exceptions,

embarked on policies inducing currency overvaluation. The policies were

motivated by a single purpose: to contain and reduce stubborn inflationary

pressure. The popularity of the policy, in the shortterm, stems from the fact

that real wages increase. The increase in real wages translates only gradually

into lower employment. Hence there is a period of euphoria as standards of

living are artificially inflated by the real appreciation while the resulting

external imbalance is financed via reserve depletion and external borrowing.

        Each of the countries in Table 6 showed some real appreciation in

1979—82 as indicated by an increase in the real exchange rate index. For

example in Argentina the rera]. exchange rate moves from a value of 73 in 1976—

78 to 116 in 1980. Not all cases were as extreme and the annual averages

conceal some of the even higher peaks. But the basic point is that most debtor

countries, sometime in 1979—82, experienced real appreciation of some degree.

        The exact timing of real appreciation differs but the story is

invariably the same. There are, however, significant differences in the

magnitude of overvaluation. Argentina, Chile, Mexico and Venezuela have much

more extreme experiences than Brazil or Korea. Brazil is interesting because

its policy of using (normally) a crawling peg geared to the US—Brazil economy—

wide inflation differentials assured that high productivity growth in

tradeab].es translates into a steady real depreciation. Dollar depreciation

reinforces the gain in competitiveness in the late 1970s, but when the dollar

strenghtens in the 1980—2 period competitiveness is lost. In Korea's case the

real appreciation was very shortlived and, in fact quite minor compared to say

Argentina.

        The particular details of mismanagement differ between countries. For

concreteness we look at Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico.



Argentina: Under Finance Minister Martinez de Hoz in the post-Peronist

military government inflation was reduced from more than 600 percent in 1976

to less than 200 percent by 1978. But further inflation reduction was hard to

achieve. A large budget deficit was an obvious reason. Yet the government

preferred to focus on the inflation—depreciation spiral and the role of

expectations.
                                    12


        Appealing to the law of one price, and the critical role of

expectations, the government implemented in December 1978 a policy of

preannouncing the rate of exchange depreciation. The preannounced 'tablita'

showed a steady deceleration of the rate of depreciation, and this was

actually implemented. But inflation reduction was very slow. Hence the real

exchange rate became steadily overvalued.6 Even so the policy was continued

until March 1981 when it ultimately broke down.

        The consequences for debt of overvaluation came primarily from the

side of the capital account. Argentina had liberalized international capital

flows entirely. As a result residents, aware of the growing overvaluation,

could freely shift into foreign assets, ranging from dollar bills to foreign

deposits and securities or real estate. The extreme overvaluation, reaching

more than 40 percent, led to large scale capital flight. The government

borrowed in New York, using the proceeds to sustain the exchange rate along

its preannounced path. The public bought dollars and redeposited them in the

very same banks from which the government had borrowed. And that process

continued, in the fullest knowledge of all concerned until a change in the

military government led to a collapse of the policy.

        My estimate of Argentine capital flight in the period 1978—82 is $23

billion, not counting unrepatriated interest earnings which would raise the

figure to well above $30 billion.



Chile: The Pinochet government instituted free market reforms and fiscal

orthodoxy in Chile. These included elimination of tariffs and quotas and a

balancing of the budget.7 But inflation, while sharply reduced from the near

hyperinflation levels of 1972—74 would not disappear. By 1979, with inflation

the only major economic problem, the government fixed the exchange rate. The

rate was fixed at 39 pesos/S even though inflation was still near 30 percent,

way above world inflation, and wages were indexed in a backward looking

fashion.

           Not surprisingly the exchange rate became increasingly overvalued.

Wage increases far outpaced world inflation and thus the real exchange rate

appreciated steadily. In the short—run the policy was popular since it raised

living standards. But it became increasingly apparent that there was an

unsustainable overvaJ.uation was accumulating. By 1981 the system started to

unravel. The public responded in their accustomed way. Taking advantage of

what was perceived to be a very transitory "sale" of imports the entire

country participated in the flight into imports (in particular durables).

          The real exchange rate appreciated by more than 25 percent between

1978 and 1981. The value of imports increased by 50 percent. Import volume

indices tell an extraordinary story: breeding stock +328 %,    automobiles   +226

%,   electro   domestic equipment +156%. The Chilean example highlights that

especially in the case of producer and consumer durables a transitory exchange

rate overvaluation has major effects on the timing of purchases. The

government was not deterred by these developments. Steadfastedly, the

authoritiers maintained the exchange rate and asserted that the exchange rate

policy was visibly successful as evidenced by the declining rate of inflation.

(1986)

        As in all other cases the policy ultimately broke down. Tariffs are

back today and so are quotas. Inflation is back to the point where the

adventure started. The lasting difference is an extraordinary debt burden and

extremely high unemployment. We return to these issues below.



Mexico: The large increase in oil prices during 1978/79 would lead one to

expect that Mexico should have done well. But even with sharply increased

revenues from oil the currrent account deteriorated in the period 1979—81 from

$5 to $13 billion. At the same time there was a major outflow of capital. B

        An estimate by Morgan Guaranty places the amount of capital flight

during 1976—82 at $36 billion while a World Bank estimate for 1979—82 gives

$26.5 billion.9 The extent of capital flight is associated with a peculiarly

Mexican institution: the 6th and final year of the presidency. 1982 was such a

year and people expected, correctly, that overvaluation and an excess of

spending would ultimately lead to a balance of payments crisis. Under these

circumstances capital flight became extreme.



Brazil: The Brazilian case is special in that the policy mistakes nay well

have been minor. Brazil certainly ran very large budget deficits. Oil price

increases and increased world interest rates were absorbed by the public

sector deficit and the resulting external deficit was financed by increased

borrowing abroad. But it turns out that much of the earlier borrowing by state

enterprises, especially in the 1972—78 period, financed a massive national

investment effort. 10

                                    15



         In Brazil's case tight restrictions on imports, and the near—absence

 of capital flight made for an experience very different frtorn that of

 Argentina, Mexico or Chile. The chief source of debt accumulation was the

public sector. This meant that the damage was much more limited than was the

case in the other countries. Indeed, by early 1985 it seemed that lopwer

interest rates and a sharply reduced oil price helped solve Brazil's debt

problems for the major part. Since then the current acxcount has once again

deteriorated, in part as a result of an overly expansionary policy. But even

so Brazil is among the debtor countries who are more likely to be able to

sustain growth and debt service.



The World Macro—economy

        A major part in the origins of the debt crisis was played by the sharp

downturn in the world economy during 1979—81. In the 1970s, partly as a result

of the oil shocks, but also because of overexpansionary policies, the U.S. had

experienced increasing inflation. In 1979—81, under the pressure of the

collapsing dollar, U.S. policies changed sharply. The full—employment budget

was cut by

nearly 1.5 percentage points of GNP. Nominal interest rates were allowed to

rise from 9 percent in 1978 to 17 percent in 1981 and real interest rates

increased sharply.

        The sharp change in the world economic environment is brought out in

Table 7 which compares the early 1970s and the period preceding the debt

crisis. The early 1970s favored debtors: strong growth, high inflation and low

interest rates. By comparison, in 1980—82 inflation was low, interest rates

were extraordinarily high, and growth was stagnant.

          It is particularly important in this context to see the real interest

rate issue. For debtor LDCs the US real intererst rate is hardly appropriate.

An alternative is provided by the inflation rate in world trade. We note that

manufactures prices were declining by 2.4 while commodity prices fell by 13.3

percent per year. Any realistic estimate of real interest rates cannot fail to

come up with extraordinarily high rates.

          It is worth noting that commodity price developments have different

effects depending whether a particular debtor is a net exporter or a net

importer of commodities. The point is important in a comparison of Korea and

Latin America. Korea (like Japan, for example) is a net importer of

commodities. As a result the collapse of commodity prices in 1979—81 helped

offset in part at least the oil price increase. Brazil, by contrast is a net

exporter of commodities and has a production structure which makes her

vulnerable to oil price increases and commodity price decreases. Table 8

shows terms of trade changes and highlights the very different experience of

various debtor groups.

IMF World Economic Outlook


        These world economic developments meant that most LDCs experienced a

sharp deterioration in their current accounts. Reduced export revenues, on

account of the decline in commodity prices and world recession, were

reinforced by sharply increased nominal debt service burdens. Thus debtors

were made illiquid. To continue on the accustomed course external financiang

needed to increase sharply. The lack of smooth financing in the case of Mexico

then brought on generalized credit rationing.



Overlending and Credit Rationing

        In the period to mid—1982 reckless lending was the rule. It is

possible today to look search the 1980—81 discussion of debt problems for

warnings of the crisis to come. The Bank for International Settlements had

expressed concern at least since 1978. A Group of Thirty enquiry in 1981

sought to uncover whether banks felt debt was a major issue and failed to find

dominant concern.'' In a survey of 100 banks the question was posed "Last time

no serious debt defaults arose. This time do you think that a general debt

problem affecting countries is likely to emerge.. ?"   In   response 72 percent of

the banks questioned expressed the view that a debt crisis was not likely, 13


''See Group of Thirty (1981) and Kraft (1984).
                                   18



percent thought it might possibly happen and only 15 percent replied in the

affirmative.'2

        But if there were perhaps some concerns, they were certainly not

enough to stop a final lending boom. Table 9 shows Latin America's current

account deficit and its financing. Between 1979 and 1981 private lending to

Latin America exactly doubles. It is not clear how these credits were

justified at the time. There were two arguments. One was the need for

recycling which had worked well at the time of the first oil shock. The other

was the lack of information on country exposure. Neither of course is a

reasonable explanation.

        Subsequent to overlending was credit rationing following the Mexican

moratorium of August 1982. As shown in Table 9 private lending fell off

dramatically, and in 1985, even turned negative. The credit rationing


12See Group of Thirty (198Th).
                                   19


phenomenon is not surprising; faced with a country's inability to meet debt

service each individual lender is reluctant to put up money which would only

serve to pay other banks' claims. Hence without a cartel there is no lending.

But if there is no lending then, of course, debt service is impossible and

hence debtors will default.

        The problem in 1982 was therefore to develop a system that would

organize creditors. They would have to provide the part of debt service that

could not be extracted by improvements in debtor country external balances. At

the same time the cartel would serve, much as the occupation of customs houses

in the old days, to extract a maximum of debt service by a lien on the debtor

countries' macroeconomic policies. The IMF, having been ignored in the 1970s,

eagerly (and skillfully) assumed the task of orchestrating debt collection,

fiscal discipline, and forced lending.




3. THE TRANSFER PROBLEM AND DEBT SERVICE FATIGUE'3

        We now ask why debt service appears to be such a major problem. In one

sense the answer is quite straightforward: countries that used to spend,

borrowing the resources from official and private creditors (with little

thought of how to service or even less repay the loans), now no longer command

these resources: they are limited to spending.   The adjustment is complicated

by two facts. The first is the macroeconomics of earning foreign exchange, the

second is the political economy problem of finding extra budget resources for

debt service. These issues are familiar from the discussion of German


'3This section draws on Dornbusch (1985,1986).
                                     20


 reparation payments following World War 1.14 Exactly the same issues arise in

 the context of the involuntary debt service now underway.



 The Reduction in Spending: The first issue is how a country adjusts to a

 reduction in its spendable resources. Before the debt crisis foreign loans

 supplemented domestic income, enlarging the resources that could be spent.

Interest payments on loans were automatically provided in the form of new

money and the principal on debts was automatically rolled over. With managing

the debt so easy, and with ready access to resources beyond what was required

to service the debt, spending ran high. After credit rationing begain in 1982,

spending had to be limited, and absorption fell below the level of output as

interest now had to be paid out of current production. Interest payments now

had to be earned by noninterest surplusses in the current account.

        Table 10 shows the debt service process at work. In the post—1982

period of involuntary lending debtor countries have achieved a shift in their

noninterest external balance of nearly 5 percent of GDP. This external balance

improvement serves to make net transfers of interest to the creditors. It is

matched by a nearly equal reduction in investment in the debtor countries.

'4See especially Fraga (1986) for a comparison between Germany in the
1920s and Brazil in the l980s. See,too, Dornbusch (1985).
                                   21




        This perverse resource transfer, of course, cones at the expense of

living standards in the developing countries. But more importantly the

transfer has as a counterpart a sharp decline in investment. Interest payments

thus are really financed by a mortgage on future standards of living and on

the debtors' growth potential. In countries where population growth is high

and income distribution is appaling such a policy may turn out to be very

shortsighted.

        But there remained the issue of how to distribute the cut in spending

between its various components: government, consumption, and investment. As we

saw above a large part of the cut took the form of reduced investment. But

there was, of course, also a decline in consumption. A fall in investment was

not enough has due to two special features of the adjustment process. First,

cutting total demand has macroeconomic multiplier effects that translate into

a reduction in output, income, and hence private spending. Second, at the same

time as involuntary debt service started there also occurred a deterioration

in the world economy which required an extra downward adjustment in spending.



The Foreign Exchange Problem: The second macroeconomic issue in adjusting to

debt concerns the fact that the country needs to earn dollars, not pesos. In

other words it needs to generate a trade surplus. The cut in spending will, of

course, reduce import demand and also free exportables for sale abroad, but

for two reasons that will not be enough. First, a sizeable fraction of the

expenditure cut will fall on domestic (nontraded) goods, not tradeables. The

spending cut thus creates directly unemployment rather than potential foreign
                                     22


exchange earnings. Even for those goods that are directly tradeable it is not

necessarily the case that increased supplies can be sold. Often there is the

problem of obtaining market access and, if the goods are not homogeneous

commodities like cotton or copper, a cut in their price is required to realize

increased sales. Even then, unless demand is sufficently responsive, total

earnings may not increase.

          To translate the spending cut into foreign exchange earnings, a gain

in competitiveness is required. The gain in competitiveness draws resources

into the tradeable goods sector and in the world market makes it possible to

sell the increased production of tradeable goods. Of course, the only way to

gain competitiveness is by reducing the wage in dollars by a real

depreciation. But the real wage cut also generates, at least in the shortrun,

increased unemployment as the spendable income of workers is cut. The size of

the required cut in real wages deserves further comment. It is larger the

larger the share of trade goods in income and the smaller the share of wages

in GD?.

          The overwhelming difficulty in the adjustment process is that external

adjustment via a gain in competitiveness reduces employment. The dominant

effect on employment is from the reduction in real wages and the resulting

reduction in domestic demand. The positive employment response that would be

expected in the tradeable goods sector from the gain in competitiveness is

often very weak and slow. One of the reasons for this is that expectations of

a sustained change in competitiveness do not take hold immediately. The

traded goods sector thus adopts a wait—and—see attitude, which makes real

depreciation a highly precarious policy tool. The Mexican experience in this

respect is particularly instructive.
                                    23


         A second important difficulty arises from the world—wide adjustment to

 forced debt service. Since most debtor countries were overspending in the

 early 1980's, and are now under a forced debt service regime, they all had to

 resort to real depreciation to enhance their competitiveness. But that means

 they are competitively cutting their wages relative to each other, and not

 only relative to those of the creditor countries. As a result an isolated

 country, cutting its dollar wage say by 50 percent, will gain much less in

 terms of increased dollar revenues because all the competing LDCs are doing

 much the same.



The Budget Problem: The third macroeconomic problem in the adjustment process

 involves the budget. Much of the external debt is public or publicly

guaranteed. Of the part that was not initially, much has wound up in the

public sector in the aftermath of the crises, as a result of bank failures.

The government thus winds up having to service a debt which before was either

in private hands or automatically serviced by new money. The problem, of

course, is where to find the extra three or four percent of budget revenue

that will pay these new interest costs.

        There are basically four avenues: raising taxes and public sector

prices, reducing government outlays, printing money, or issuing domestic debt.

Raising taxes is notoriously difficult since most of the taxes are already

levied in the form of social security taxes on workers. An easier solution is

to raise public sector prices or to eliminate subsidies. The elimination of

subsidies is particularly cheered by creditors and international agencies

since it means moving closer to efficient resource allocation.1 Of course,


'5The fact that it is often food subsidies that are eliminated, without
the proverbial neutral lumpsum tax, to compensate the losers does not
seem to limit the case for the policy recommendation.
                                   24


the imposition of extra taxes or the withdrawal of subsidies is inevitably

inflationary from the price side unless the tax increase or subsidy cut is

offset by a reduction in other prices or wages. Of course, via the revenue

side reduces the growith in money and hence, in combination, it leads to a

recession with inflationary pressure sustained by prevailing inflation.

        Cutting government spending is another option. Attention here focusses

on the often extreme inefficiency of the public sector. The public perceives

that there must be a way to pay the bills out of increased efficiency, rather

than reduced private absorption. The fact is, of course, that there is very

little room for public sector improvements in the shortterm. Large—scale

firing of redundant workers would create an overwhelming political problem.

Plant closings are of the same kind and selling inefficient, overunionized

firms runs into the obvious problem that the potential buyers might need to be

paid to take over the liability. Perhaps the best advice may be that public

sector firms should be simply given away. The problem is that the workers

might oppose even that.

        The most common adjustment is a cut in or freeze of public sector

wages. This has happened in most of the debtor countries, and in some cases on

a very large scale. It does help the budget, but it presents its own problems.

The reduction in relative wages for the public sector promotes an exodus of

the wrong kind. The efficient workers leave and only those with little

alternative stay in the public sector.

        In many of the debtor countries the answer to forced debt service has

almost inevitably been to increase government budget deficits, and to finance

this by issuing debt or printing money. Noney finance brings with it the
                                   25


problem of high and often extreme inflation. It is no accident that Argentina

and Brazil experienced extraordinary inflation rates in the aftermath of the

debt crisis. When deficits are financed by debt, while the imminent inflation

problem may be absent, there is still the issue of excessive debt accumulation

which ultimately poses the risk of an inflationary liquidation or a

repudiation in the manner discussed by Sargent and Wallace (1982).

        There is an interaction between the foreign exchange problem and the

budget problem. The need to devalue, to gain competitiveness implies that the

value of debt service in home currency increases. A given payment of say $1

billion now amounts to more in pesos, produces a larger peso deficit and hence

gives rise to the need for increased inflationary finance. Thus devaluation is

a source of inflation not just directly via the increased prices of traded

goods and any accompanying indexation effects. It works also indirectly by

raising the required inflation tax. In the classical hyperinflations major

movements in the exchange rate were the prelude to the outbreak of

uncontrolled inflation and there is some evidence that exactly the same

process is at work in the debtor countries today.'6

        The budget is also adversely affected by the problem of capital

flight. To stem capital flight, provoked by the inflationary consequences of

debt service or perhaps by an impending tax reform, the country will have to

raise real interest rates to very high levels. These high real interest rates

in turn apply to the domestic debt, causing it to grow more rapidly, and

thereby raising future budget deficits and hence the prospect of instability.

That in turn feeds to more capital flight and yet higher rates. There is thus


'6See Dornbusch and Fischer (1986) and Fischer (1986).
                                   26


an extraordinary vicious circle surrounding the sudden need to service debt

and the inability to do so through ordinary taxation.

        It is worth recognizing an important trade—off in the adjustment

process. To earn foreign exchange the real wage must be cut in terms of

tradeable goods, thus enhancing competitiveness. But to balance the budget it

is often necessary or at least recommended to cut subsidies for such items as

food or transportation and that also means a cut in real wages. There is thus

competition between two targets, a cut in the dollar wage or a cut in the

tortilla wage. A choice must be made because there is only so much one can

cut. Because of the lags with which the trade sector adjusts this suggests

that the competitiveness adjustment should take precedence and that budget

balancing should follow once the economy's resources are reallocated. Since

the real depreciation by itself is already bound to produce slack there is no

risk of overheating in this sequence of adjustment.

        A final point worth noting is the link between budget cutting and the

extraordinary fall in Latin American investment. The reason is that in the

category of government spending the easiest cuts are in investment. Postponing

investment and maintenance is much easier than firing workers. The resulting

impact on aggregate investment is so large because the public sector, in the

form of public sector enterprises, accounts for a large part of total

investment, and because the public sector was in the forefront of adjustment.

It is immediately obvious that this is a very ineffective means of adjustment,

failing to recognize the distinction between the public sector's current and

capital accounts.
                                        27


Case Study: Mexico

           Mexico illustrates in a very striking way many of these issues. The

least noted fact, apparent in Table 11, is the dramatic shift in the budget

over the past three years. The noninterest or primary budget has improved by

more than 7 percent of GD?. From a deficit of nearly four percent of GD? in

1982 the noninterest balance has shifted to an estimated surplus of 3.2

percent in 1986. The improvement is all the more impressive in view of the

large decline in oil revenue in 1986. Note that the whole improvement in the

noninterest budget went to finance increased interest payments on the domestic

and foreign debt.

        The total budget records a deficit of nearly 16 percent of GD? for

1986. The increase in interest payments is largely a reflection of inflation.

Inflation and the accompanying exchange rate depreciation raise the nominal

interest rates required to make Mexicans hold the depreciating asset. These

interest rates in turn translate into a large interest bill in the budget.

There is a budget deficit because there is inflation, not the other way

around.

           Table 12 shows further details on the Mexican macroeconomic situation.

We already saw the cut in public sector investment. The table shows that total

investment shows a sharp decline, leaving little net investment.

          Consider next the current account. There is a striking turn—around,

from the deficits prior to the crisis to surpluses afterwards. In 1983—84 the

surpluses were enough to help finance capital flight and also meet the

interest payments. In 1985 interest was paid out of these surpluses, and by

attracting a reflow of private capital via very high interest rates. But with

the oil price decline the external financing problem returned, forcing a

choice betwen further real depreciation, and an alteration in the terms of

debt service.
                                   29


        The real exchange rate and the real wage both declined sharply in the

past few years. Real wages today are 40 percent below their 1980 levels and

the external competitiveness has improved by 40 percent. These are

extraordinary adjustments for any country to make. Finally there is the

employment story. The labor force is growing at 3.5 percent per year, but

employment after an initial decline has been entirely stagnant over the past

four years. The informal sector and migration to the U.S. were the main shock

absorbers in employment. Thus unemployment is growing and thus so too is

social conflict. The lack of employment growth, even after so extreme a real

depreciation, is an issue of major concern. It suggests that depreciation

reduces employment for quite a while before the substitution takes over.

        Early results for trade were disappointing. More recently Mexico has

started to build up a strong non—oil export growth. But that has turned out to

be a mixed blessing. US trade concerns have spilled over to Mexico in the form

of more than 100 countervailing duty cases!



Case Study: Brazil

        Brazil, just like Mexico, started off her adjustment with a large

decline in per capita income and with a sharp acceleration of inflation. The

inflation acceleration is largely due to the real depreciation required to

generate a noninterest surplus. The presence of indexation translated exchange

depreciation into an increase in inflation. The higher inflation in turn

showed up in a sharply larger budget deficit. (See Table 13)

           The noninterest external balance improved sharply. This is seen in

Table 15 in the shift of the noninterest current account from a deficit of 2

percent of GDP in 1982 to a 3.5—5 percent surplus in 1984—86. In contrast to

Mexico the Brazilian budget has not improved sharply. That meant more stimulus

to growth and to recovery.

           The difference between Mexico and Brazil, in 1986, is both oil and

macroeconomics. Lower oilprices in Brazil's case more than compensate for the

adverse conditions of the boom on the external balance. But the external

balance is certainly also improved by the import substitution and export

capacity expansion made possible by the investments of the early 1970s, which

came on line just in time to help service the debt.



5. BANK EXPOSURE AND THE QUALITY OF DEBTS
                                      31



        In this section we review the debt problem from the side of commercial

bank creditors. We look at the extent of exposure and at the quality of debts.



Exposure:

        Table 14 gives a broad overview of loans by US banks to regions other

than the industrial countries or offshore banking centers. In these categories

Nigeria and Venezuela are included among the Opec countries while Mexico is

part of the Non—Opec countries.

        Between 1977 and 1982 claims on Non-Opec countries more than doubled.

By contrast, since then there has been a complete standstill in lending. The

table shows that loans to Eastern Europe are small and relatively stable in

size. Exposure to Opec countries is more sizeable and has declined since 1982.

        Table 15 looks at lending to non—Opec developing countries, this time

disaggregating by size of bank. We also show how these claims have evolved

relative to equity capital.

        Three conclusions emerge from Table 15. First, debt is a "big bank"

problem. More that 60 percent of total debt is owed to the major money center

banks, and nearly 85 percent to only 25 major banks. Second, small banks have

managed to to reduceng their claims over the past three years by 15 percent.

Third, all banks and in particular the money center banks have been able to

reduce their exposure measured as a percent of capital. The exposure reduction

has occurred primarily via a build—up of capital, in part by issueing equity

commitment notes. But in part the exposure reduction is due to sell—off of

loans, write—downs, and simply due to a slowdown or actual halt in new money

commitments.

        To judge the implications of LDC problem debts for the banking system

we look in Table 16 at the group of most heavily indebted countries. For

simplicity we take all of Latin America (including Venezuela) plus Nigeria,

Phillipines, Morocco and Yugoslavia. The total exposure in 1985 was close to

$100 billion and approximately 90 percent of bank capital. Thus, in the
                                       33



extreme situation of all these debtors repudiating their debts completely bank

stock holders would be largely, though not altogether, wiped out while

depositors are left fully intact. That picture is more favorable than much of

the public discussion of the 'IDC debt bomb' might lead one to believe. Of

course, this point holds only in the aggregate and thus is not very revealing.

The more revealing comparison disaggregates by bank size. In this case it

becomes apparent that their exposure is far in excess of their equity. Brazil,

Argentina and the Phillipines alone (to take the 1987 major confrontation

cases) account already for more than half of the capital of major banks.

        The second point worth noting is that even Latin America's debt is to

a large extent held by non—U.S. banks. The Bank for International Settlements

reports Latin American debt to banks in the reporting countries of $160

billion in 1985. Table 18 shows that only about one half of that debt is owed

to US banks. For the remaining problem debtors the BIS total is $37 billion.

In their case the U.S. loans are thus only one third of the total of exposure

to banks in the U.S. and elsewhere.17

Financial Markets Developments, October 1986.

        There is an important difference, though, between European and US

banks. During the period of dollar appreciation European banks were forced to

increase their reserves against dollar loans. Furthermore these loan

provisions were facilitated by tax advatages. Since 1985 the dollar has

depreciated significantly and this has worked to further increase European

loan loss reserves relative to their claims. As a result European banks are

said to have, in some instances, been able to set aside loan loss reserves to

fully cover problem debts. This, of course, is far from being the case for

U.S. banks.



The Quality of Debts:

        In the 19th century and until World War II, LDC debt mostly took the

form of bonds traded on organized markets and widely held by the public. The

post—war debt, by contrast, is owed to official institutions and commercial

banks. Accordingly there are no good price quotations that might be used as a

measure of the qualtity of debts. Very little of claims on debtor LDCs takes

the form of bonds.18 But for some time bank claims on various LDCs have been

swapped between banks, sold outright between banks, and are now even being

sold to non-banks. The market has become central to discussions of debt—equity

swaps. In these transactions, further discussed below, purchase of discounted

debt is the starting point for a foreign investment in a debtor country.

        Table 17 shows the average of the bid and offer price in the

secondhand market. It would be a mistake to believe that all debts are

actively traded. But even so the prices provide some indication of market

valuation.

          There are quite extraordinary divergences in prices. Bolivia, Peru and

Nigeria have low valuations. But perhaps more interesting is the difference

between Mexico and Brazil. Why is Brazil thought to be a so much better credit

risk than Mexico? The major difference would have to be between being an

exporter and an importer of oil. The average price of problem debts is 67

cents per dollar. Discounts of 25 percent and more, suggests that these are

indeed problem debts, and that the prospect of a return to voluntary lending

might be very remote.
                                    36


         However, story is not that simple. Consider the case of Uruguay. The

country's debt stands at a discount of 23.5 percent, suggesting that the debt

is poor. Yet, in the fall of 1986 Uruguay issued a long-term public sector

bond at the same rate as the U.S. Treasury. This would suggest that the large

discounts reflect above all a market that is too narrow, so that it is

illiquidity of banks which dominates in depressing the prices.



6. US TRADE EFFECTS OF THE DEBT CRISIS

         There is considerable difficulty in allocating the deterioration of

the U.S. external balance between competing causes: the overly strong dollar,

the rapid domestic growth relative to that abroad, the budget deficit, and the

turn around forced on debtors' trade balances by the need to service external

debts.

         Table 18 gives some indication of the shift in our trade with Latin

America. Not all of this can be attributed to the debt crisis since our loss

in competitiveness must certainly account for some part of what happened. It

is also true that the trade figures of the early 1980s are inflated by Latin

America's overvaluation and spending spree. But even so it is quite apparent

that there was a major shift in the bilateral balance amounting to $lO—12

billion from 1979 to 1985.'




19The change in the bilateral trade balance in manufactures is more
significant than the change in the total bilateral trade balance. The
reason is that declining oil and commodity prices reduce our import bill
and hence are reflected in a smaller change of the total balance.

        It is interesting to compare the evolution of Latin American trade

with different countries, to compare what happened with the U.S. This is done

in Table 19. The table shows a substantial shift toward bilateral surpluses

with respect to each of these groups. While the surplus with the US is far

larger in absolute terms, this is not the case when the change is expressed

relative to exports. This is a crude way of illustrating that the dollar

appreciation may not be so dominant in this bilateral trade balance swing.

        If $10 billion is taken as the change in the bilateral trade balance

then, even attributing all of this to the debt crisis, one does not come up

with much damage to the U.S. After all, this is less than a quarter of 1

percent of U.S. GNP! Of course, this does not exhaust the damage and GNP is

not the proper scale variable. Other damage to U.S. trade and investment

interests occur via the depression of demand and profitability in the debtor

countries. U.S. multinationals who produce in in those countries have sharply

reduced sales and profits. Similarly there are declines in US exports of

services (other than interest) to debtors. There are no ready estimates of

losses in service exports.

        In judging whether a $10 billion deterioration in the trade balance is

a large one must bear in mind two points. First, the swing in the trade

deficit helps facilirate a non—inflationary absorption of our budget deficit.

Switching lending from LDCs to the US Treasury helps finance our own deficits

under better (short—term) macroeconomic conditions. But there is clearly a

cost for the affected industries. A large share of the trade deterioration,

for example is in the capital goods sector as Latin Americas decline in

investment reduced our exports. For this sector the trade deterioration with

Latin America is, of course, far above the one quarter of one percent of

income. But even so it would be difficult to make the debt crisis the main

reason for our $150 billion trade problem.

7. SOLUTIONS TO THE DEBT PROBLEM ?20

          The ordinary aftermath of imprudent borrowing and adverse

international conditions, as in the 1920s and 1930s most recently, is to cause

debt default. Debts are normally written down, or simply not serviced for many

years. When sevicing is ultimately resumed this occurs without full payment of

arrears and often at reduced interest rates.

          The major differences in the present debt crisis are two. The first is

that commercial banks and governments, rather than bond holders, are the main

creditors. A more significant difference is the fact that the governments of

the major industrialized countries have insisted on debt service and have

managed a system of debt collection, with the IMF as the chief coordinating

agent. The system avoids illiquidity by making available essential "new money"

at profitable spreads over the cost of funds to banks, and it enforces the

debts by behind—the—scenes political pressure. The creditors are efficiently

organized in this case by case approach while debtors have been unable to put

up a united front.2'

          The debtors' problem, especially in the case of Latin America, is how

to gain debt relief or additional credit, so as to make available resources

for investment and develop speculation in support of the government's ability

to promote growth policies without risking financial instability. Tax reform

and improved tax enforcement is certainly of overriding importance in this.

Improved efficiency in the public sector is important, but measures to attract

unexpectedly large contribution. The settlement has demonstrated that
the debt problem is not dead at all but also that government involvement
might become a boomerang.

capital or secure relief on the external debt seem the most desirable or

practicable alternatives. We review here five possible directions of change:

an improved world macroeconomy, a facility, debt-equity swaps, a reversal of

capital flight, and Bradley—style debt—relief.



The World Macroeconomy

        In 1982 the prospects of strong growth in the industrialized

countries, lower interest rates, a weaker dollar and stronger real commodity

prices were the central scenario which encouraged the "muddling through

process". This favorable scenario implied that by the end of the decade debt—

export ratios would have declined significantly. Some of these developments

have in fact occurred, and for some countries they have even been reinforced

by an unexpectedly large decline in the oil price. But the expected benefits

in terms of enhanced creditworthiness have not in general appeared. It is true

that South Korea is certainly at present not a problem debtor, but Brazil

clearly is and so are many other countries.

        Looking ahead to the next few years, what macroeconomic developments

can be expected and how will they affect the debt situation? The most

important development for the world economy is US budget balancing. There are

basically three scenarios. In one case rapid budget cutting is accommodated by

monetary expansion in the U.S. and in the rest of the world. In this setting

interest rates decline sharply, growth is sustained and the main exchange

rates between industrial countries remain unaltered. This is a highly

favorable scenario for LDCs in that much lower interest rates implicitly

transfer to them resources in amounts far in excess of what can be expected

from creditor country taxpayers.
                                     41



         The second scenario envisages the same budget cutting, perhaps more

spread out in time, but without monetary accommodation. In that case interest

rates decline, somewhat but there will be a world recession. Most debtors

would not benefit, or at least very little, since the lower interest rates are

offset by slack in their export markets.

        A third scenario envisages a hard landing: budget cutting and a flight

from the dollar that forces the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to

stem the inflationary impact of depreciation. Such a development would

certainly bring about systenwide illiquidityy and likely default.

        The world macroeconomy does hold out some promise. A Gramin—Rudman—

Hollings budget cut, soon and with worldwide monetary accommodation, would

make a major advance toward solving the debt problem. But for the time being

there is not much of a sign of either the budget cutting or the monetary

acconmodat ion.




Debt-Equity Swaps:

                  The debt problem has two aspects. The first is that debtors

cannot service their debts as contracted. Moreover, the interest they pay

comes largely at the expense of much needed investment in their economies.

Thus debtors have a resource and investment shortage. On the lenders side

small banks are tired of the acrobatics involved in debt collection. They want

to avoid yet another round of rescheduling. But there is no money in the

debtor countries to pay them off, nor can the large banks do so, given their

already extravagant exposure. These twin problems strain the skills of

regulators, accountants and policy makers world—wide.
                                   42


        The poor quality of LJDC loans can be judged by the discount at which

they trade in the emerging second—hand market. The large discounts suggest

that an imminent return to voluntary lending is highly unlikely. Creditors'

attention is therefore shifting to new ways of liquidating debts without

taking outright and massive losses on the entire portfolio. But if banks are

to get out, who will get in?

         Debt—equity swaps have emerged as a seemingly attractive solution to

the debt problem. Clearly not the solution, but a sound contribution with all

the rings of free enterprise.22 Their apparent merit is in solving two

problems at once: they allow banks to sell off loans without a massive decline

in loan prices, debtors can reduce their external debt and at the same time

pull in foreign investment. All things considered, they appear to be a good

idea. But there are reasons for scepticism. Before turning to these

objections, a qualification is important. There should be no doubt that debt—

equity swaps agreed between private firms and their commercial bank creditors

(without government intervention or subsidies) are entirely appropriate.

Likewise there cannot be any objection to direct foreign investment. On the

contrary, there should have been more in the past, and the more there is in

the future the better. The objections raised here concern exclusively the use

of an already strained debtor budgets to grease the wheels.

        The basic difficulty is that debt—equity swaps amount to a budget

subsidy by debtor countries that will let banks get out and foreign investors

get in. Here are the mechanics: First Regional Bank sells Brazilian government

bonds at a discount to Dreams, Inc., a U.S. firm specializing in services.


22For a strong statement of support for debt-equity swaps see the Morgan
Guaranty World Financial Markets issue of September 1986.
                                   43


Dreams,Inc. presents the debt to the Banco Central do Brasil to be paid off in

cruzados. The proceeds are used for the purchase of a Brazilian firm. It

seems that everybody gains: the bank has found a way of selling some its

illiquid portfolio without depressing the second-hand market the investing

firm gains the advantage of buying cruzados at a discount and Brazil gains

because she can pay the foreign debt in local currency rather than in dollars.

Moreover, much needed investment takes place.

        The debtor government will have to finance the repurchase of debt from

the foreign investor. One cannot simply print local money to pay. In fact the

government will issue domestic debt and use the proceeds tobuy back its

foreign debt as it is presented by the foreign investor. Hence, when

everything is done, the government has a reduced external debt, but a matching

increase in domestic debt. The country owns less of its capital stock, since

the foreign investor will have bought some, and in return has redeemed some of

its external debt.

     Is there any advantage for the budget? In the budget there will now be

reduced interest payments on external debt offset by increased domestic debt

service. There is a net reduction in interest if the debtor country can

appropriate most of the discount at which the external debt is traded and if

the real domestic interest rate (in dollars) is not too high relative to the

cost of servicing the external debt. The net result is likely to be an

increase in debt service, because real interest rates in debtor countries are

exceptionally high.

     On the balance of payments side, however, swaps might seem to be good

news: foreign debt is reduced and as a result burdensome interest payments to
                                       44


 abroad come down. But the reduced external interest payments are matched, at

 least potentially, by increased remittances of dividends or profits by the new

 foreign owners of the national capital stock. Hence, on the payments side

 the trick also does not do much good. In fact, the country becomes less liquid

 since it is much easier to control the service of bank debt than the

 remittances of multinationals. The massive outflow of remittances from Brazil

 in 1986 makes this point.

         Debt-equity swaps are primarily a balance sheet operation, not a net

rersource transfer. One might argue that the government could target deals to

make them less a transaction in existing assets and instead be directed toward

new, extra investment. 1ore likey, financial intermediaries will look for

firms, domestic or foreign, who are already investing. They will approach

them with a new kind of financing package involving debt—equity swap which,

because of an implicit subsidy by the government turns out to be less costly

than alternative sources of finance. Thus debt—equity swaps will finance

investment, but they finance at the budget cost of a subsidy investment that

would have taken place anyway. This explains the reluctance of debtor

countries to plunge into the scheme.

        Debt equity swaps bring together, with the glue of budget pesos, two

entirely separate operations that would arise in a free, unregulated market.

To solve the banks' problem, marking—to-market of LDC debts would occur and

hence debts could be sold to the non-bank public. To cope with the resource

problem debtor countries would set up investment funds in which non-residents

can invest in the private economy with liberal facility for repatriation of

dividends. The two separate steps assure that old, bad debts do not prevent
                                   45


new investment. The bad debts are distributed more widely, though at a

possible loss to all banks' stock holders. The debtor countries gain extra

resources which they nay use to expand investment or to buy back their debt,

whichever appears more profitable. This is the market solution. Debt—equity

swaps, by contrast, are a way of nationalizing the transaction, pushing budget

subsidies to bank stock holders rather than to extra investment.

        Balance sheet trick are not a substitute for gaining extra real

resources for investment. Improved government budgets in the debtor countries,

increased private saving, increased efficiency in their public sector and net

resource transfers from abroad are the only way for investment and growth to

return. Of course, debtor countries should open all doors to foreign direct

investment—— the sooner ans wider, the better. But there is no justification

for subsidizing such investment.



Reversal of Capital Flight:

        Wishful thinking turns to the $100 billion or more of Latin American

assets that have fled from financial instability and taxation to the

industrial countries, especially the U.S. Reversing these capital flights,

primarily in the case of Mexico or Argentina, would make it almost possible to

pay off the external debt. The reason is that much of the debt was incurred in

the first place to finance the exodus of private capital.

        Estimates of the amount of capital fliught in the 1970s and early

1980s differ widely. But whatever the methods by which the magnitudes are

estimated, the fact of at least a $100 billion capital flight from Latin

America is not in question. Estimates are particulary large for Mexico,
                                      4.



Argentina and Venezuela and much smaller for Brazil or for Chile. For both

Argentina and Mexico estimates of $25 to $35 billion dollars are not uncommon.

Hence the suggestion that reversing the mammoth outflow could help pay off the

debt without tears.

          The idea that private capital could be the main solution, or at least

provide an important contribution, is naive. There is little historical

precedent for a major reflow and when it does happen. It is the last wagon of

the train. Einaudi once observed that savers "have the memory of an elephant,

the heart of a lamb, and the legs of a hare". Capital will wait until the

problems have been solved; it will not be part of the solution and is even

less likely to provide a bridge head.23

          It is often argued that if only countries adopted policies

guaranteeing savers a stable positive real rates of interest rthere would be

no   capital   flight problem. But that argument is not very realistic in three

respects. First, in the context of adjustment programs devaluation is often

unavoidable. Compensating savers for the loss they would have avoided by

holding dollar assets would place a fantastic burden on the budget which in

turn would breed financial instability. Second, maintaining high real interest

rates poses a serious risk to public finance. The public debt which carries

these high real rates snowballs, and that in turn is a source of instability.

Third, it is a very bad habit indeed to raise the return on paper assets above

the prospective return on real capital. That is terrible supply side economics

which ultimately erodes the tax base, and deteriorates the financial system by


23The public opinion survey on Mexico reported in the New York Times on
November l6th,1986 makes most amply apparent just how pessimistic
nationals of debtor countries are about the chances of economic
recovery.
                                    47


souring loans. A country in trouble simply cannot make its chief priority

keeping the bondholders in place.

        Capital controls, where feasible, are a better strategy for restoring

order in public finance than papering over extreme difficulties for a while

using extraordinarily high real interest rates. The latter strategy was,

indeed, at the very source of the mess in Argentina under Martinez de Hoz and

explains some of the difficulties in Mexico today.

        It is also worth recognizing that the capital flight problem is

encouraged by the fact that the U.S. Administration no longer witholds taxes

on nonresident assets. For with this tax—free U.S. return, anyone investing

in Mexico (and actually paying taxes there) would need a yield differential,

not counting exchange depreciation and other risks, of several extra

percentage points.

        There is much talk about the problems of banks putting in new money

only to see it used by debtors like Mexico to finance capital flight. Of an

extra dollar of new money conceded by creditors 70 cents are said to leave in

extra capital flight. That indicates the need for a cooperative approach where

debtor country governments, the tax authorities in creditor countries and the

commercial banks cooperate in stopping capital flight and tax evasion. Of

course, none of the three parties can succeed alone.



The Facility:

        A number of proposals have been made over the past four years by

academics, business leaders and politicians in an attempt to drive a wedge

between old, bad debts and the recognized need for new investment in debtor
                                    48


countries. Old debts are seen in this context as oversized mortgages on the

debtor countries that impede the free and voluntary flow of new funds. The

means to achieve such a flow is a facility that buys up LDC debts from banks,

and reduces debt service costs for debtors.24 Lightening the burden of old

debts and using an international fund with its diversification possibilities

and possible credit standing provides important opportunities for passing on

benefits to the debtors, without destructive effects on the solvency of banks

or the asset position of their stock holders.

        The details of such facility schemes vary. Invariably they are

adninistered by the World Bank and involve allusions to the Marshall Plan,

recycling, and the sharing of international burdens by strong currency

countries or countries with significant external surpluses. On the basis of a

capital subscription to be made by an as yet undesignated donor, leveraged by

significant borrowing in the world capital market, the facility would take L,DC

debts over from banks, or buy these in the secondhand market. Benefits to the

LDCs occur because the facility will have a lower cost of capital than the

individual LDC, both because of diversification and guarantees. The benefit of

the reduced cost of capital, and of the facility's purchases at discounts of

debts from banks would be passed on to debtors in the form of more favorable

interest rates or debt reduction.

         The concept of a facility draws attention to an important practical

problem in credit markets. The higher the interest rate charged on credit the

less likely that it can and will be paid. Hence a policy of risk premia is


24The most recent proposals are the editorial by David Obey and Paul
Sarbanes in the New York Times, Nov. 9,1986 and the suggestion for a
Japan Fund made in various speeches by Jim Robinson of American Express.
                                    49


exactly that, it makes loans risky. Thus the facility would avoid this problem

by charging a common interest rate, but it would reward countries for

performance by writing—down outstanding debt.

         Such a facility would introduce a new party into debt negotiations.

Concerned with the solvency and productivity of the facility the management

could take positions on rescheduling agreements to assure that the value of

the assets it carries is not impaired by extortionary settlements or

unreasonable adjustment programs. One might imagine that the facility makes

available a longterm reconstruction loan to a particular country, say Mexico,

and in exchange secures from the banks extraordinary reductions in spreads or

maturities. Of course, to perform this function agressively would require that

the manager of the facility have stature and independence to be beyond the

immediate reach of the U.S. Treasury.

        The main question about the facility, the issue of the donor aside, is

who should be the beneficiaries? The facility must, ultimately, involve

taxpayers money although this may occur in a highly remote, off—budget and

leveraged fashion. The use of taxpayers' money makes it reasonable to ask

whether the facility should benefit starving African debtors, middle—income

Latin America or winners such as Korea. Assigning the use of the fund

primarily to Latin America rather than to Africa whose debt is mainly to

governments and international organizations, might suggest that the facility

has overtones of a bank bailout.



Debt Relief:
                                      50


          Debtor countries have failed to form an effective cartel that could

impose debt relief in the form of a write—down, sharply reduced interest

rates, generous grace periods, or the consolidation of debt into perpetuities.

On the contrary, debtor countries have competed with each other and, as a

result, have wound up with poor terms and a short leash.

         There have been only two attempts so far to turn debt service into a

major political issue. One is the case of Peru, where the government

unilaterally limited its debt service to a specified fraction of export

revenue. The other is the Mexican case of 1986. In each case the large

domestic costs of debt service and the destructive effects on investment,

inflation and growth potential led the governments to try and limit the

damage. It is hard to believe that Peru got very far. But it is certain that

Mexico initiated an important change in policies and procedures. The Mexican

success suggests to some observers that with enough determination (and a

favorable geographic location) debtors can in fact secure reduced spreads,

contingency funds and even an underwriting of growth.

         At the sane time the debt problem is starting to become a political

issue. Henry Kissenger, Lord Lever, Senator Bradley and an increasing number

of policy—makers and policy economists are advocating a more political

approach to the debt problem. This is the case in part for reasons of foreign

policy. But poor U.S. trade performance is also starting to seen as a

reflection of debtor countries' need to earn foreign exchange for debt

service. This point has been emphasized especially by Senator Bradley

(1986a,b) .   The Bradley debt plan accordingly emphasizes the need to create a

vehicle for trade—debt discussions. Focussing explicitly on the link between
                                   51


trade concessions by debtor countries and targeted, limited debt relief this

approach consciously makes debt a political issue. Besides adapting the

regulatory system to facilitate write—downs agreed between debtors and

creditors the proposal also calls for reduced interest payments, extra money

and debt write—downs.

        Several negative responses to the Bradley proposal have been voiced,

suggesting that the plan is impractical or undesirable. One argument is that

the particular details—— for example the annual debt summit—— are implausible,

complicated or undesirable. The trade issue, viewed from the perspective of

the U.S. external sector and growth is small,——there has been only a S12—15

billion swing in the bilateral balance with South America. Moreover, the

write—downs are felt to be insufficiently conditioned on performance of the

debtor countries and hence not worth making. Another criticism is more basic.

It amounts to the assertion that any and all kind of debt relief reduces or

even destroys the beneficiaries ultimate chances of renewed access to the

international capital market. Countries who accept debt relief, it is argued,

will be tainted. Only those who service humbly will see the day of voluntary

lending. Historical precedent for all of Latin America would suggest the

opposite.

        Political solutions to the debt problem are likely to be close to the

arrangement Mexico secured and far away from the ambitious Bradley Plan.

Resistance to write—downs might soften, even if there is no indication of this

at present, and terms might become more flexible. But even so the debt problem

will remain an overwhelming burden on the growth prospects of Latin Anerica.

Tax payers are unwilling to underwrite Latin American growth and politicians
                                      52


are unwilling to underwrite the banks. Growth in Latin America will therefore

depend in equal parts on a solution to the U.S. deficit problem with generous

monetary accommodation, and on the introduction of reasonable public finance

in the debtor countries. With these two conditions met, and excepting extreme

episodes such as the 1986 Mexican oil decline, growth can start again,

although the losses of the 1980s will not be made up.

        Debt relief can come from a direct government intervention. But it can

also come if governments withdraw from organizing the debt collection process.

}leltzer (1984) has advocated this course and Milton Friedman (1984,p.38) has

observed:


      "So I think the way you solve the LDC "debt bomb" problem is to require
      the people who make the loans to collect them. If they can, fine, and if
      they can't, that's their problem."


There is little doubt that a withdrawal of governments (and the IMF) from the

debt collection process would lead to a rapid disintegration of the creditors'

cartel and a reduction of debts to levels more congenial to debtors.



Moral Hazard

            Solutions to the debt crisis involving debt relief encounter one

apparently overwhelming objection: Latin America's debt reflects to a large

extent mismanagement and capital flight. Granting debt relief to Latin

debtors, but not to countries where management was more careful, amounts to

rewarding poor policy performance and thus invites repetition.

        But a moral hazard argument can also be made in two other ways. First,

not giving debt relief means that the governments of creditor countries
                                    53



enforce bad loans. They thus encourage poor lending policies on the part of

commercial banks who now expect their governments to herlp collect even the

poorest sovereign loans.

         Second, in the context of capital flight it is frequently argued that

amnesty for tax fraud and illegal capital transfers is an effective and

desirable policy for encouraging a reflow. Of course, the same moral hazard

argument applies as future tax morality would be undermined.2

          The major weakness of the moral hazard argument in cases such as

Mexico and Argentina results capital flight: those who pay are primarily

workers whose real wages are cut. Owners of external assets are rewarded by

capital gains and thus turn out to be net beneficiaries of the debt crisis.

The moral hazard argument thus can be turned around to support the case for

debt relief.
