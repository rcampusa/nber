This paper unveils a new resource for macroeconomic research: a long-run dataset covering disaggregated
bank credit for 17 advanced economies since 1870. The new data show that the share of mortgages
on banks’ balance sheets doubled in the course of the 20th century, driven by a sharp rise of mortgage
lending to households. Household debt to asset ratios have risen substantially in many countries. Financial
stability risks have been increasingly linked to real estate lending booms which are typically followed
by deeper recessions and slower recoveries. Housing finance has come to play a central role in the
modern macroeconomy.

                                  1.   Introduction

The past three decades have seen an unprecedented surge in the scale and scope of
financial activities in advanced economies—a process that is sometimes referred to as
financialization. Its effects continue to be contentiously debated.
   Financialization shows up in the rising income share of finance (Greenwood and
Scharfstein 2013; Philippon and Resheff 2013), the ascent of household debt (Mian and
Sufi 2014), as well as the growth of the volume of financial claims on the balance sheets
of financial intermediaries (Schularick and Taylor 2012; Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor
2013). The increasing size and leverage of the financial sector has been interpreted as
an indicator of excessive risk taking (Admati and Hellwig 2013; Aikman, Haldane, and
Nelson 2014) and has been linked to the increase in income inequality in advanced
economies (Piketty 2013; Godechot 2012), as well as to the growing political influence of
the financial industry (Johnson and Kwak 2010). Clearly, understanding the causes and
consequences of the growth of finance is a first order concern for macroeconomists and
policymakers. Yet surprisingly little is known about the driving forces of these important
new trends in modern financial history.
   This paper studies these issues through the lens of long-run macroeconomic history.
Our first contribution is to unveil a new resource for macroeconomic research: a long-run
dataset on disaggregated bank credit for 17 advanced economies since 1870. The dataset
is the result of a large-scale investigative process and an extensive standardization effort
to produce consistent time series. In addition to our new credit variables the dataset also
contains a rich set of macroeconomic controls. The new data allow us to delve much
deeper into the driving forces of financialization than has been possible until now.
   The database that we provide covers disaggregated bank balance sheet data at annual
frequency for the near universe of industrial countries since 1870. In particular, we study
the development of various subcomponents of loans on banks’ balance sheets—secured


                                              1
and unsecured lending as well as lending to businesses and households—over a span of
140 years. We document the rising share of real estate lending (i.e., bank loans secured
against real estate) in total bank credit and the declining share of unsecured credit to
businesses and households. We also document long-run sectoral trends in lending to
companies and households (albeit for a somewhat shorter time span), which suggest that
the growth of finance has been closely linked to an explosion of mortgage lending to
households in the last quarter of the 20th century. The key facts that the new data allow
us to establish can be summarized as follows.
   First, we demonstrate that the sharp increase of credit-to-GDP ratios in advanced
economies in the 20th century has been first and foremost a result of the rapid growth of
loans secured on real estate, i.e., mortgage and hypothecary lending.1 The share of mortgage
loans in banks’ total lending portfolios has roughly doubled over the course of the past
century—from about 30% in 1900 to about 60% today. To a large extent the core business
model of banks in advanced economies today resembles that of real estate funds: banks
are borrowing (short) from the public and capital markets to invest (long) into assets
linked to real estate.
   Second, looking more deeply at the composition of bank credit, it becomes clear that
the rapid growth of mortgage lending to households has been the driving force behind
this remarkable change in the composition of banks’ balance sheets. The intermediation
of household savings for productive investment in the business sector—the standard
textbook role of the financial sector—constitutes only a minor share of the business of
banking today, even though it was a central part of that business in the 19th and early
20th centuries. We also find that household mortgage debt has risen faster than asset
values in many countries resulting in record-high leverage ratios that potentially increase
the fragility of household balance sheets and the financial system itself. Complementing
the recent influential work of Mian and Sufi (2014) for the United States, our work takes a
  1 We   will use the terms “mortgage lending” and “real estate lending” interchangeably in this paper.



                                                    2
longer and wider view to show that the blowing up and bursting of private credit booms
centered on aggressive mortgage expansion reflects deep processes at work across all of
the advanced countries, and building up persistently across the entire post-WWII period.
    Third, we demonstrate that the shifts in the composition of banks’ balance sheets
have important consequences for our understanding of the source of financial instability.
Mortgage lending booms were only loosely associated with financial crisis risks before
WWII, but real estate credit has become a more important predictor of impeding financial
fragility in the postwar era. From the perspective of policymakers aiming to design new
macro-prudential policies today, our work confirms the crucial role of mortgage credit in
the buildup of financial fragility.
    Fourth, by using our new disaggregated credit data we can robustly demonstrate
that the magnitude and structure of credit booms have important consequences for
business-cycle dynamics. Reinhart and Rogoff (2009, 215–20) argued that financial crisis
recessions may have a tendency to be long and painful, a conjecture based on simple path
averages for a sample of 18 postwar bank-centered financial cases in advanced economies.
Here, with our granular historical dataset, we perform more formal benchmarking and
statistical analysis for the near-universe of advanced-country macroeconomic performance
since 1870, covering over 90% of advanced economy output, and encompassing up to 200
recession episodes, with 1⁄4 of them linked to a financial crisis and 3⁄4 being normal cycles.2
    With sample size comes statistical power, and our hypothesis tests show that the typical
output path during recession and recovery in financial-crisis recessions is significantly
worse than in normal recessions, amounting to a cumulative loss of 20% of annual output
   2 Note that we focus on advanced economies only, as in Reinhart and Rogoff (2009, Chapter 13). In their
next chapter (p. 223) they explain that they exclude emerging economies from the sample so as “not to
appear to engage in hyperbole.” Their analysis including emerging economies shows similar but stronger
patterns of deeper recessions. This echoes previous studies, e.g., Cerra and Saxena (2008), and several
papers from the BIS, IMF, and other organizations. Our view is that given the institutional and other
differences between advanced and emerging economies which may create greater output volatility in the
latter group (Acemoglu et al. 2003) it is preferable to conduct analysis on a long-narrow panel of advanced
economies rather than a short-wide panel which pools together both advanced and emerging economies
which may be structurally different. With a smaller N, we need larger T in order to have statistical power,
leading to the historical approach which we have followed here.


                                                    3
over 5 years. But why is there such a negative effect due to a financial crisis? We use
modern methods based on inverse propensity score weighting to argue that it is an effect
and that cannot be fully explained away by other (observable) characteristics. Still, one key
covariate, credit, is particularly influential in shaping business cycle dynamics. Recessions
that follow larger credit booms tend to be significantly worse, all else equal. Furthermore,
we can show that contemporary business cycles are predominantly influenced by trends
in the mortgage component of credit. Since WWII, it is only the aftermaths of mortgage
booms that are marked by deeper recessions and slower recoveries. This is true both in
normal cycles and those associated with financial crises.
   Our findings echo the developments witnessed in the aftermath of the global financial
crisis and also underline the need for additional nuance in monitoring the build-up of
financial instability: it is not just a matter of how loose credit is in the aggregate, but also
for what kind of purpose it is used.


                    2.   A New Historical Credit Database

The data unveiled in this paper are the result of an extensive data collection effort over
several years. It covers bank credit to the domestic nonfinancial private sector (business
and households) on an annual basis from 1870 to 2011 for the near-universe of advanced
economies. The dataset builds on and extends the long-run credit data compiled by
Schularick and Taylor (2012), and the updated series in Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor
(2013), in three important ways:


  1. Disaggregated credit data: The new dataset tracks the development of various types
      of bank lending. For the first time we can construct the share of mortgage lending
      in total bank lending for most countries back to the 19th century. In addition, we
      calculate the share of bank credit to business and households for most of countries
      for the decades after WWII and back to the 19th century for a handful of countries.


                                               4
  2. Broader coverage of financial institutions: In addition to commercial banks’ balance
     sheets, our data now include credit extended by savings banks, credit unions,
     and building societies yielding a more accurate picture of total credit creation by
     financial intermediaries. Accordingly, we have calculated a new series of total bank
     lending to the private sector that replaces the older series from Schularick and
     Taylor (2012). Data constraints prevent us from including direct borrowing in capital
     markets and private credit contracts between individuals which have been sizable
     in some countries in the early 19th century (see, e.g. Hoffman, Postel-Vinay, and
     Rosenthal 2000 for France). However, comparing our annual data to Goldsmith’s
     (1969) decadal benchmark estimates for total credit indicates that our series capture
     the largest part of total credit for all countries across the sample period.

  3. Larger and longer sample: We added bank credit as well macroeconomic control data
     for Belgium, Finland, and Portugal bringing the total number of countries covered
     by our database to 17. The dataset also now extends to the year 2011.

   Where do these new data come from? We consulted a broad range of sources, from
economic and financial history books and journal articles, publications of statistical offices
and central banks, and archival sources at central and private banks. The scale of this
data collection effort would not have been possible without the generous support of many
colleagues at various research institutions, archives, central banks, and statistical offices
who shared their data or directed us to potential sources. We are also heavily indebted
to a group of dedicated research assistants in various places who successfully chased
often imprecise references through libraries and archives in various countries. Details of
the data construction appear in an extensive (100+ pages) online appendix which also
acknowledges the support we received from many colleagues.
   For some countries we extended existing data series from previous statistical work of
financial historians or statistical offices. Such was the case for Australia, Canada, Japan,
and the United States. For other countries we relied on recent data collection efforts

                                              5
at central banks, such as for Denmark, Italy, and Norway. Sometimes we combined
information from a wide range sources and spliced series to create long-run datasets
for the first time. Belgium provides a good illustration of the challenges involved. Data
on mortgage lending by financial institutions before World War I come from a German-
language dissertation published in 1918; data for the interwar credit market are taken
from a recent (2005) reconstruction of Belgian national income accounts undertaken by a
group of economic historians at the University of Leuven. Disaggregated data for bank
credit in the two decades following WWII come from the Monthly Bulletin of the Belgian
National Bank and a statistical publication of the Ministry of Economics respectively.
Finally, we relied on unpublished data on mortgage credit for the years 1960–2011 that
the Statistics Department of the Belgian National Bank shared with us.
   Data on macroeconomic control variables come from our previous dataset, where we
relied on the work of economic and financial historians and secondary data collections
by Maddison (2005), Barro and Ursúa (2008), and Mitchell (2008abc). As noted, we have
now added macroeconomic data for three additional countries, bringing our total to 17
countries, covering most advanced economies.
   Table 1 summarizes the coverage of our database by country and type of credit.
Overall, we have found long-run data for most countries for total bank lending and
mortgage lending. Disaggregated data for bank credit to companies and households
are available for some countries over the entire sample period, and are available in the
post-WWII period for the majority of countries.
   Figure 1 provides a first comparison of our new bank credit series with the older series
taken from our previous dataset which covered predominantly credit by commercial
banks. As a consistency check, we also plot alternative post-WWII data that have been
recently made available by the Bank for International Settlements (2013). Reassuringly,
our new series and the BIS series track each other closely where they overlap. This is true
both in aggregate and at the country level.

    The new data confirm the long-run patterns that we uncovered in earlier work: after
an initial period of financial deepening in the late 19th century the average level of the
credit-to-GDP ratio in advanced economies reached a plateau of about 50%–60% around
1900. Subsequently, with the notable exception of the deep contraction seen in bank
lending in the Great Depression and World War II, the ratio broadly remained in this
range until the 1970s. The trend then broke: the three decades that followed were marked
by a sharp increase in the volume of bank credit relative to GDP. Bank lending on average
roughly doubled relative to GDP between 1980 and 2009 as average bank credit to GDP
increased from 62% in 1980 to 118% in 2010.

financial private sector by commercial banks compiled by Schularick and Taylor (2012); Total loans (BIS data)
refers to data on total loans by the banking sector compiled by the BIS (2013). All three series reported as a
fraction to GDP and then averaged across all 17 countries in the sample. See text.


            The data dramatically underscore the size of the credit boom prior to the global
financial crisis of 2008. A substantial part of that boom occurred in a very short time
span of little more than 10 years between the mid-1990s and 2008/9. For our 17 country
sample, the average bank credit to GDP ratio rose from 79% of GDP in 1995 to 112% of
GDP in 2007—an unprecedented increase of more than 30 percentage points (p.p.) as a
ratio to GDP in just 12 years, implying a rapid pace of change of around 2.5 percentage
points per year (p.p.y.). Moreover, this is only a lower bound estimate as it excludes credit
creation by the shadow banking system, which was significant in some countries, such as
in the U.S. and the U.K.

             The next two sections explore the composition of this remarkable long-run leveraging
of the advanced economies in more detail. We study the role of mortgage lending as well
as changes in the sectoral composition of bank credit.


                                                                 3.      The Great Mortgaging

Figure 2 shows the long-run trends of mortgage credit and unsecured lending to business
and household sectors since 1870. The visual impression is striking. Over a period of 140
years the level of non-mortgage lending to GDP has risen by a factor of about 3, while
mortgage lending to GDP has risen by a factor of 8, with a big surge in the last 40 years.
             Virtually the entire increase in the bank lending to GDP ratios in our sample of 17
advanced economies has been driven by the rapid rise in mortgage lending relative to
output since the 1970s. Non-mortgage lending to business and consumers for purposes

                                                                                        9
other than purchase of real estate has grown much more slowly and actually remained
remarkably stable in the long run relative to output. On the eve of World War I, non-
mortgage bank lending in the advanced economies was 41% as a ratio to GDP on average.
In 2010 the corresponding ratio was 46%, only marginally higher. Bank lending to GDP
ratios have risen so strongly on average because of a parallel increase in mortgage credit:
from an average of about 20% as a ratio to GDP at the beginning of the 20th century to
69% of GDP by 2010.
   It is important to stress that a substantial share of mortgage debt was held privately
outside the banking system in the 19th century. Exact numbers are hard to estimate. In
France and the U.K. privately held mortgage debt likely accounted for up to 10 percent
of GDP around the year 1900; in the U.S. and Germany an even higher share of farm
and non-farm mortgages was probably held outside banks (Hoffman, Postel-Vinay, and
Rosenthal 2000). To some extent, the strong rise in mortgage lending relative to GDP
evident in our data represents the integration of these earlier forms of ”informal” private
lending into the financial system in the course of the 20th century.
   Figure 3 gives a country-by-country snapshot of the composition of the loan books
of the banking sector at three points in time: 1928, 1970, and 2007. This allows us to
compare the business of banking on the eve of the Great Depression, right before the
Bretton Woods System collapsed, and just before the global financial crisis of 2008. These
three snapshots tell a consistent story. In most advanced countries, the share of mortgage
lending relative to other lending has increased dramatically over the past century. With
very few exceptions, the banks’ primary business consisted of non-mortgage lending to
companies both in 1928 and 1970. In 2007 banks in most countries had turned primarily
into real estate lenders. On average, non-mortgage lending accounted for 73% of the total
in 1928 and 65% in 1970. The share had fallen to less than 40% of total bank lending by
2007. In the U.S. and Norway, 68% of loans on bank balance sheets were mortgages in
2007, in the U.K. the corresponding figure was 63%.

                  Figure 4 shows the time profile of this astonishing change in the business of banking,
and tracks the share of real estate loans on banks’ balance sheets since 1870. We can
clearly see the instability of credit in the interwar period when banks in many countries
were forced to finance the war efforts of governments and cut back sharply on business
lending in the 1930s. After WWII real estate credit increased as a share of total lending,
driven in part by the reconstruction efforts in Europe and the boom in suburban housing
in many countries, notably the United States. However, the overall share of real estate
credit on banks’ balance sheets remained around 40% until the mid-1980s, whereupon we
see the start of a global real estate lending boom for the past 30 years leading to a large
jump in the ratio. As a result, the shares of mortgage and non-mortgage lending are now
approximately the inverse of what they were at the beginning of the 20th century.

                          4.    The Leveraging of Households

In this section we examine sectoral trends in bank lending. Table 2 dissects the increase of
total bank lending to GDP ratios over the past 50 years into growth of household debt and
business debt. In the 50 years since 1960 we see that the increase in total lending to the
private sector amounted to about 80 percentage points (p.p.) of GDP on average in the 17
advanced economies. At the country level, Spain tops the list with overall growth of the
bank credit to GDP ratio of 135 p.p. followed closely by the Netherlands and Denmark.

At the bottom of the list we find Japan, Switzerland, and Germany. With regard to the
sectoral composition, the picture could not be clearer. The increase in lending has been
driven primarily by increased lending to the household sector. Household borrowing
accounts for about 2⁄3 of the total increase in bank credit since 1960, predominantly driven
by real estate lending. But there are important differences between individual countries:
Belgian, German, and Japanese households have increased their debt levels by 30 p.p.
(or less) of GDP, while their Australian, Spanish, British, and Dutch counterparts have
ramped up debt levels by about 75 p.p. of GDP over the same period.
    A natural question to ask is whether this surge in household borrowing reflects rising
asset values without substantial shifts in household leverage ratios (defined as the ratio
of household mortgage debt to the value of residential real estate) or, on the contrary,
whether households increased debt levels relative to asset values. The latter would
potentially raise greater concerns about the macroeconomic stability risks stemming from
more highly leveraged household portfolios.
    We therefore gathered historical data for the total value of the residential housing stock
(structures and land) for a number of benchmark years to relate household mortgage
debt to asset values. We combine information from Goldsmith’s (1985) seminal study
of national balance sheets with the more recent and more precise estimates of historical
wealth to income ratios by Piketty and Zucman (2013). There are considerable difficulties
involved in the calculations so we restrict the analysis to a small sub-sample of countries
for which we have long-run data. Yet even here the margins of error are likely to be big
and the numbers should be interpreted with caution.3
    Figure 5 shows that the ratio of household mortgage debt to the value of real estate has
risen strongly in the United States and the United Kingdom in the past three decades—
despite the boom in house prices. In the United States mortgage debt to housing value
   3 Inparticular, it was not always possible to clearly separate the value of residential land from overall
land for the earlier years and therefore we made assumptions on the basis of available data for certain
benchmark years.

climbed from 28% in 1980 to over 40% in 2010, and in the United Kingdom from slightly

The boom in mortgage lending and borrowing in the post-WWII era is a major trend
that emerges from our data. Table 3 demonstrates that this rise in mortgage credit has
financed a substantial expansion of home ownership in the advanced economies.
                             Home ownership rates were on average slightly above 40% around 1950 in the
countries for which we have long-run data. In the 2000s about 60% of households
owned the house that they lived in—an increase of 20 percentage points in the course
of the past half century. Put differently, while the notion that home ownership is a

constitutive part of the national identity may be a widely accepted idea in many countries,
on closer inspection what is often described as a fundamental trait of national culture
turns out to be a relatively recent phenomenon. In the U.K. for instance, home ownership
rates were as low as 23% in the first quarter of the 20th century. In the U.S. too, the
majority of households did not own their homes until about 1960.
    The rise of credit-financed home ownership in the second half of the 20th century has
clearly been aided by the growth in scale and scope of housing policy, albeit the exact
contribution remains hard to quantify. Large scale interventions into housing markets
were largely a product of the Great Depression, but remained an important part of the
post-WWII policy landscape in many countries.
    In the United States the National Housing Act of 1934 led to the creation of the Federal
Housing Authority (FHA), whose primary purpose was to insure banks and other private
lenders for home loans and to create a liquid secondary mortgage market. Two years


                                                  16
before, in 1932, the Federal Home Loan Bank System had been established. Through
its government backing, the System could borrow at favorable interest rates and pass
them on to mortgage borrowers, an arrangement that became an enduring feature of
the American housing finance system (Gaertner 2012). President Roosevelt created the
Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) in 1938 which quickly became known
by its nickname Fannie Mae. The agency issued bonds in capital markets with implicit
backing from the federal government and invested in FHA insured mortgage loans,
thereby creating a more liquid secondary market for insured mortgages. As time went
by the standardization of loans using FHA criteria enabled nationwide banks and other
financial institutions to move into geographically remote mortgage markets, and this
translated into a rising share of mortgages on banks’ balance sheets.
   Government interventions in the U.S. housing markets intensified after WWII mainly
due to the activities of the Veterans Administration (VA) which was established as part
of the G.I. Bill in 1944. VA guaranteed loans had median loan-to-value ratios of 91%,
and a substantial proportion even passed the 100% bar (Fetter 2013). The VA and FHA
programs insured more than 6.5 million mortgages in the first fifteen years after the
war and the associated rise of suburbia transformed the American landscape. The share
of federally subsidized mortgage credit relative to all mortgages reached 40% in the
1950s. On its own, the G.I. Bill likely accounted for up to 25% of the increase in home
ownership for the cohorts affected by the VA programs (Fetter 2013). Moreover, while
the tax deduction of interest expenses had formed part of the U.S. tax code since the
introduction of the federal income tax in 1913, the sharp rise in mortgage debt and highly
progressive income tax rates turned the mortgage interest deduction into a much more
important subsidy for home buyers in the postwar decades. Aided by such policies,
American home ownership increased from 40% in the 1930s to nearly 70% by 2005 before
declining to 65% in the wake of the global financial crisis.
   While the U.K. shares a similar experience, with home ownership rates rivaling those


                                            17
of the U.S., not all countries implemented changes in policies to boost private home
ownership and mortgages. Germany and Switzerland provide good counterexamples.
In Germany, loan-to-value ratios at savings and mortgage banks (the main providers of
home loans) were often capped at 60%. At the same time, the comparatively high levels
of rent protection that were put in place in the immediate postwar years were upheld
in the following decades and the German tax code provided only limited incentives to
take on debt. Switzerland even levied taxes on the imputed rents of house owners. As a
consequence, the home ownership rate in Germany stood at 43% in 2013 and was hence
only marginally higher than the 39% ratio reached in 1950. In a similar fashion, home
ownership in Switzerland stagnated around 35% in the past half century.
   In addition to country-specific housing policies, international banking regulation also
contributed to the growing attractiveness of mortgage lending from the perspective of the
banks. The Basel Committee on Bank Supervision (BCBS) was founded in 1974 in reaction
to the collapse of Herstatt Bank in Germany. The Committee served as a forum to discuss
international harmonization of international banking regulation. Its work led to the 1988
Basle Accord (Basel I) that introduced minimum capital requirements and, importantly,
different risk weights for assets on banks’ balance sheets. Loans secured by mortgages
on residential properties only carried half the risk weight of loans to companies. This
provided another incentive for banks to expand their mortgage business which could be
run with higher leverage. As Figure 1 shows, a significant share of the global growth of
mortgage lending occurred in recent years following the first Basel Accord.


             6.   Mortgage Credit and Financial Instability

We now turn from data description to formal statistical analysis, and our first hypothesis
addresses a crucial question as to why one should care about the disaggregated credit
measures that we have so laboriously collected. Namely, have changes in the structure of
financial intermediation, highlighted by the growing importance of mortgages in total

                                           18
bank credit, made advanced economies more financially fragile?
    In this section, we look at the classification ability of various credit-based measures
in predictive models of financial stability. In particular, we are interested if and how the
disaggregated credit data help improve the classification ability of crisis forecast models
and whether housing credit today has become more closely associated with financial
crisis risks as its share in total credit has grown.
    Following Schularick and Taylor (2012) we start from a probabilistic model that
specifies the log-odds ratio of a financial crisis occurring in country i in year t, denoted
with the binary variable Sit , as a linear function of lagged credit ratios in year t,


                                       P[Sit = 1| Xit ]
                                 log                    = ψ0i + ψ1 Xit + eit ,                               (1)
                                       P[Sit = 0| Xit ]

where Xit refers to a vector of lagged changes of the credit ratios of interest. Here we use
5-year moving averages as a parsimonious way to summarize medium-term fluctuations.
Notice that the model includes country fixed-effects. We report estimates based on a
variety of specifications detailed below, essentially a horse-race among the various credit
aggregates using the full sample, the pre-WWII era, and the post-WWII period. The error
term eit is assumed to be well behaved.
    Dates of systemic financial crises are taken from Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor (2013)
with updates, which in turn builds on Bordo et al. (2001) and Reinhart and Rogoff (2009).
The Laeven and Valencia (2008, 2012) dataset of systemic banking crises is the main source
for post-1970 crisis events.4 Section A in the appendix provides the country-specific dates
of financial crises that we use.
   4 Following   the definition of Laeven and Valencia (2012), a financial crisis is characterized as a situation
in which there are significant signs of financial distress and losses in wide parts of the financial system
that lead to widespread insolvencies or significant policy interventions. The important distinction here is
between isolated bank failures, such as the collapse of the Herstatt Bank in Germany in 1975 or the demise
of Baring Brothers in the U.K. in 1995, and system-wide distress as it occurred, for instance, in the crises of
the 1890s and the 1930s, in the Japanese banking crises in the 1990s, or during the global financial crisis of
2008. It is clear that the lines are not always easy to draw, but the overall results appear robust to variations
in the crisis definitions.




                                                       19
    The key results are shown in Table 4. Column (1) reports the null model with country-
fixed effects only. This serves as a benchmark or null to judge whether a more elaborate
model is any better at explaining the data. Next we consider the models based on
mortgage loans in column (2) and non-mortgage loans in column (3), as well as the
combination of both (4). Panel (a) reports the results for the full sample from 1870 to
2011 (excluding world wars), panel (b) is based on a pre-WWII sample from 1870 to 1939
(excluding WWI) with corresponding results reported in columns (5) to (8), and panel (c)
is based on a post-WWII sample from 1946 to 2011 with corresponding results reported
in columns (9) to (12).
    Earlier work by Schularick and Taylor (2012) showed that, in aggregate, credit helps
predict financial crises. But with our new dataset we can ask a sharper question: does
the type of credit that drives the expansion make a difference? We confirm that a high
rate of credit extension over the previous five years is indicative of an increasing risk
of a financial crisis. This is true for both mortgage lending and non-mortgage lending
(columns 2–4). All forms of credit growth over GDP have highly significant coefficient
estimates. Over the long-run, there does not appear to be only one type of credit-boom
driven financial instability. Financial fragility seems to have a variety of sources.
    However, the type of credit does seem to matter, and we find evidence that the
changing nature of financial intermediation has shifted the locus of crisis risks increasingly
toward real estate lending cycles. Whereas in the pre-WWII period mortgage lending is
not statistically significant, either individually or when used jointly with unsecured credit
(columns 6 and 8), it becomes highly significant as a crisis predictor in the post-WWII
period (see columns 10 and 12). Nevertheless, both types of credit appear to play an
independent role as column (12) shows.
    A different way to see this changing relationship is through the AUC statistic.5 The
   5 AUC stands for Area Under the Curve The curve is usually the receiver operating characteristic curve or
ROC. In Jordà and Taylor (2011) it refers to the Correct Classification Frontier or CCF. Jordà and Taylor (2011)
provide an overview of this literature and the AUC, ROC, and CCF.

AUC is a summary statistic of classification ability whose asymptotic distribution is
Gaussian in large samples, making inference straightforward (see Jordà and Taylor 2011).
In the simplest models the AUC takes on the value of 1 for perfect classification ability
and 0.5 for an uninformative classifier or “coin toss.” In our application we replace the
0.5 null with the AUC from the model with fixed-effects only.6 With the AUC we can
then compare the classification ability of models using different sub-categories of credit.
   The AUC tests for predictive ability for the different models lend support to the
view that over time mortgage credit has come to play a larger role in the genesis of
financial instability. In panel (b) the predictive ability of the mortgage based model is
far inferior to the non-mortgage or combined model before 1940: compare column (6)
with columns (7) and (8). But in panel (c) for the post-WWII period the AUC is a solid
0.72, considerably higher than before and as good as the AUC of the non-mortgage based
model: see columns (10) and (11). Here the mortgage credit based crisis prediction model
outperforms the null model by a good margin: the fixed effects null AUC is 0.62, as
reported in column (9). Moreover, it is almost on par with the combined model in column
(12) and performs similarly in terms of overall classification ability to the model using
non-mortgage loans only as reported in column (11), with these results contrasting with
the findings for the pre-WWII era.


    7.      Mortgage Booms, Financial Crises, and Their Aftermath

The second half of the twentieth century saw an unprecedented increase in aggregate
credit volumes. As we saw in Figure 1, total bank lending as a ratio to GDP more than
doubled relative to the first half of the 20th century. Using our new dataset we were
able to show that this striking trend was in large part driven by the tripling of real estate
lending, in particular mortgage lending to households, as shown in Figure 2. On the eve
   6 Somecountries have been more prone to financial crises than others historically. We want to examine
the marginal contribution of the credit variables beyond differences in country-average crisis incidence.



                                                   22
of the 2008 global financial crisis real estate loans represented about two thirds of all bank
lending in the U.S. and most other advanced economies. As a close correlate of this trend
we saw that mortgage credit became a specific source of financial instability in advanced
economies in the post-WWII era, as discussed in the previous section.
   We now turn to the aftermath of lending booms and study their consequences for the
real economy. The objective is to see if and how the important shifts in the structure of
financial intermediation have implications for the role of credit over the business cycle: is
there historical evidence that recessions are more severe if they are preceded by lending
booms? Is the much-debated debt overhang phenomenon a regular feature of the modern
business cycle? Our analysis will be based on the near-universe of business cycles in
advanced economies since 1870.
   Debt overhang and the consequences of deleveraging have been a central focus of
recent work on macrofinancial linkages. Many studies have pointed to debt overhang
as a potential cause for slow recoveries from financial crises (see for example Cerra and
Saxena 2008; Reinhart and Rogoff 2009; Mian and Sufi 2010, 2014; Jordà, Schularick, and
Taylor 2011, 2013). Our analysis goes beyond previous attempts at measuring the effects
of debt overhang in two important ways. First, we use the new disaggregated credit
dataset to study potentially unknown linkages between specific forms of bank credit
and the real economy as well as potential shifts in these relationships over time. Second,
we apply novel econometric techniques that allow us to address concerns often raised
about the endogeneity of financial crises, and hence quantify more precisely the effects of
debt overhang using a potential outcomes approach based on the Neyman-Rubin causal
model.
   We begin with as brief an exposition of the novel econometric approach we use as is
possible and then move quickly on to the analysis. The following section characterizes
the typical path of economies through recessions and recoveries in the near-universe of
business cycles in advanced economies since 1870 using the Bry-Boschan algorithm to

demarcate peaks and troughs of economic activity. Having established the typical path of
economies over the cycle, we ask if and how financial factors modulate this trajectory. We
will look both at the (new) aggregate and the disaggregated credit series, thereby both
corroborating and extending previous studies of debt overhang and deleveraging.
    Table 5 synthesizes the salient features of the underlying data. Column (1) reports
summary statistics for all cycles between 1870 and 2010, 199 in total; column (2) for cycles
between 1870 and 1939, 108 in total; and column (3) for cycles between 1948 to 2010, 91 in
total. Moreover, we differentiate between normal business cycles and those associated
with financial crises. Recessions are hence sorted into normal recessions and financial crisis
recessions. A financial crisis recession occurs when a financial crisis is observed within
±2 years of the business cycle peak. Section B in the appendix contains a table detailing
the breakdown into these two cases for our dataset.
    We will now use this classification of the types of recessions to study if and how debt
overhang worsens the path of economies through recession and recovery in normal times
and after financial crises. We will also pay due attention to the possible endogeneity of


                                                       24
financial crisis cycles using propensity score weights in the following section.


7.1.       Statistical Design

The question that we ultimately want to answer is if and how financial factors influence
the severity of normal and financial recessions. In this section we describe in greater
detail our statistical approach. Compared to previous literature the key methodological
innovation will be to account for the possibility that financial crises are endogenous to
the credit cycle. We will first establish that financial crisis recessions are indeed more
severe than normal recessions and then move on to study if prior credit booms make
either type of recession worse.
    We are interested in the cumulative change in log real GDP per capita, y, from today to
some future period h measured in percentage points. We denote this cumulative change
as ∆h yτ +h . The notation τ = t( p) indicates the calendar period t associated with the pth
peak (or start of the recession).7 In addition, let dτ be an indicator variable that takes the
value of one if the pth recession is associated with a financial crisis, and is zero otherwise.
    The average path of normal versus financial crisis recessions can then be characterized
as follows:


                     1                                   1
             θnh =
                     Nn    ∑       ∆h yτ +h ;   θ hf =
                                                         Nf    ∑       ∆h yτ +h   for h = 0, 1, ..., H,   (2)
                          d τ =0                              d τ =1

where Nn and N f refer to the appropriate number of observations in each case (n is
for normal recessions, f is for financial crisis recessions). A plot of {θ̂nh }hH=0 represents
the average path of the economy in normal recessions whereas the plot of the {θ̂ hf }hH=0
represents the average path of the economy in financial crisis recessions instead. This
is the type of plot that often appears in the literature, for example in Cerra and Saxena
(2008) and Reinhart and Rogoff (2009). Any differences between the two paths, θ̂nh and
   7 The country index is omitted to facilitate the exposition although in the applications below we include
fixed effects and use cluster robust standard errors. These are among the main considerations given to the
panel-data structure of our problem.


                                                          25
θ̂ hf , could be due to differences in observable characteristics between the two types, not
necessarily because financial crises make the recession worse through an independent
channel. The next step is therefore to ask whether financial crisis recessions are different
from normal recessions, all else equal.
   This is where synthetic control methods come in. Building on a large literature in
biostatistics and more recently in econometrics, Angrist, Jordà, and Kuersteiner (2013)
propose an inverse probability weighted (IPW) estimator of expression (2). The estimator
consists of two stages. In the first stage, a model is constructed to determine the
probability that the recession is of a financial crisis type p(dτ = 1|{Yτ −l }lL=0 ). Here Yτ
denotes a vector of lagged observable macroeconomic controls observed up to L periods
before the recession starts. This probability will be called the propensity score and we
denote its estimate as p̂τ . The propensity score model can be estimated using a logit or a
probit estimator, for example.
   The second stage consists of recalculating expression (2) using weights given by the
inverse of the propensity score in each bin. Weighting by the inverse of the propensity
score puts more weight on those observations that were difficult to predict. These
observations come closest to the random allocation ideal and hence receive more weight
than those instances in which the type of recession was endogenous due to the other
factors. Because it compensates for unknown nonlinearities, the inverse probability
weighting can be seen as a more flexible mechanism to control for the role of observables
compared to controlling only through the conditional mean. The difference between the
path of the economy in financial crisis versus normal recessions then provides a measure
of the average effect of the financial crisis on the path of the economy. It is calculated as


                                            ∆h yτ +h       ∆ y
                             Λh =   ∑          p̂τ
                                                     − ∑ h τ +h .
                                                           1 − p̂τ
                                                                                          (3)
                                    dτ   =1           d =0
                                                      τ




                                                26
Alternatively, we know that expression (2) can be recast as a simple regression estimate


                                      ∆h yτ +h = θnh + Λh dτ + eτ +h .                    (4)

Hence the counterparts to θ̂nh and θ̂ hf in expression (2) can be directly obtained by noting
that θ̂ hf = θ̂nh + Λ̂h . In order to implement IPW in expression (3) all that is needed is
to estimate expression (4) using weighted least-squares (WLS) with weights defined by
wτ = dτ / p̂τ + (1 − dτ )/(1 − p̂τ ).
   A natural extension to expression (4) is to include controls {Yτ −l }lL=0 directly in the
regression estimator as well, such as in Jordà and Taylor (2013). We call this estimator
IPWRA for “IPW regression adjusted” to follow the nomenclature used in this literature.
The WLS estimation of this extended regression is an example of a “doubly robust”
method (e.g. Lunceford and Davidian 2004; Wooldridge 2010; Glynn and Quinn 2010).
The doubly robust moniker refers to the control for observables via two channels: directly
in the regression mean and through the propensity score. Hence, only one of these two
channels need be properly specified to produce consistent estimates.
   Yet our key objective is to determine how aggregate credit and its disaggregated
components affect the path of the recession. The doubly robust version of expression (4)
estimated by WLS provides a natural springboard from which to do this. For example,
let ( xτ − x̄ ) denote a measure of credit accumulated in the expansion measured at annual
rate in percentage points per year (p.p.y.) and in deviations from its historical mean (in
the applications below, the mean is country specific). The effect of this variable on the
path of the recovery can be measured using the following specification:

                                                                 L
                   ∆h yτ +h =   θnh   + Λ dτ + β ( xτ − x̄ ) + ∑ Yτ −l Γlh + eτ +h .
                                          h       h
                                                                                          (5)
                                                                l =0

   Expression (5) is the standard specification of a local projection (Jordà 2005) with the
{ β̂h × δ}hH=0 as the estimate of the response of ∆h yτ +h due to a perturbation in xτ away


                                                      27
from its mean x̄ by an amount δ. When expression (5) is estimated by WLS using the
propensity score model for p̂τ and the associated weights wτ we have a doubly robust
estimate (given observable controls).
   It is important to be clear about what the propensity score achieves in the calculation of
this impulse response. The IPWRA ensures that endogeneity of financial crisis recessions
is addressed as best as possible given the data that we have. Otherwise, estimates of the
effects of experiments concerning ( xτ − x̄ ) could be polluted by this endogeneity. In the
analysis that follows ( xτ − x̄ ) will refer to different measures of credit buildup during
the expansion.


7.2.   Normal and Financial Recessions

This section provides baseline estimates of the simple average paths in normal and
financial recessions using WLS in expression (4) using IPW. In the subsequent sections we
gradually incorporate the effect of alternative definitions of credit accumulation during
the expansion and its components based on expression (5) using IPWRA, that is, estimated
by WLS using the propensity score weights wτ . At each stage we provide the details of
how these expressions are specifically implemented.
   The set of controls Yτ −l includes several important macroeconomic indicators: (1) the
growth rate of real GDP per capita; (2) the growth rate of real loans per capita; (3) the CPI
inflation rate; (4) the growth rate of real investment per capita; (5) short-term interest rates
on government securities (usually 3 months or less in maturity); (6) long-term interest
rates on government securities (usually 5 years or more in maturity); and (7) the current
account to GDP ratio.
   The propensity score model is estimated over the sample of recession-year events
where we predict the normal versus financial-crisis type of the recession dτ using two lags
of this set of controls Yτ −l , country fixed effects, and the credit buildup indicator ( xτ − x̄ ).
This variable measures the annual change of total lending in the previous expansion as

a ratio to GDP (in percentage points per year, or p.p.y.) to normalize differences in the
duration of expansions. We estimate the propensity score using a logit model across the
separate pre-WWII and post-WWII samples. WWII is a natural breakpoint given the
trends in mortgage lending and overall credit discussed in previous sections.
    Figure 6 displays the empirical density function of the predicted probabilities from
the logit model of the propensity score. The figure shows that the logit model does not
perfectly predict these binary outcomes and as a result there is a substantial region of
overlap. Identification of the effects we seek comes from this overlap region.
    Table 6 reports the results. Our initial estimates focused on three samples: all
recessions (excluding world wars); recessions in the pre-WWII era; and recessions post-
WWII. Since we found no qualitative differences across these regimes only the full sample

results are reported (the subperiod results are shown in the appendix). For each horizon
denoted Year 1 through Year 5, we report the estimates of the coefficients θnh and θ hf using
expression (4) along with a test of the null that, at each horizon, the coefficients are
statistically equal to each other. In addition to the p-value of this test we also report
robust standard errors (clustered by country). The results show that the null is easily
rejected except in Year 1. The effects are quantitatively large. Conditional on controls, the
gap between normal and financial crisis recession paths is about 1 percent of per capita
real GDP (relative to the start of the recession) in Year 1, which then rises to 3.5 percent
in Year 2, and persists at about 5 to 6 percent in Years 3, 4, and 5. The cumulated gap
therefore amount to about 20 percent of annual output over the 5 years. The typical paths
of economies in normal versus financial crisis recessions are clearly not the same.


7.3.    The Aftermath of Credit Booms

Financial crises are different from normal recessions and this difference cannot be ex-
plained by a large set of observable macroeconomic aggregates. The IPW estimates
reported in the previous section ensure that the conditioning set is entered in as flexible



                                                      30
yet parsimonious a manner as possible. The question we ask in this section is whether
the differences documented in the previous section are due to credit buildups in the prior
expansion phase of the business cycle. Because we have shown that credit buildups are
predictive of financial crises, we want to avoid the problem of having our measures of
the response to credit reflect simply an endogenous response to the selection of recession
events into the normal or financial type. We employ the IPWRA estimator introduced
earlier for this reason.
   Using the IPWRA estimator in expression (5) we build on Table 6 and extend the
specification to include credit dynamics. Recall the credit variable ( xτ − x̄ ) in expression
(5) measures the annual change of total lending in the previous expansion as a ratio to
GDP (in percentage points per year, or p.p.y.). We remove country-specific means to
normalize differences across countries.
   As an illustration, the scatter plot of Figure 7 shows the effect of the inverse probability
weighting in the calculation of the βh that we report in Table 7. Figure 7 plots a partial
scatter of the accumulated change in real GDP per capita in year 5 after the recession
starts, against the credit variable ( xτ − x̄ ) that we just described and which is observed at
the start of the recession.
   The inverse probability weighting, shown by the differences in the size of the points
in the scatter plot, is an attempt to re-randomize the allocation of economies into the
normal versus financial crisis recession bins. The largest weights of the subpopulation of
economies that experienced a Financial crisis recession (shown in solid red) are associated
with smaller credit booms. These are the financial crisis recessions that look more similar
to the normal recessions. Conversely, economies that experienced a normal recession and
a large credit buildup also receive larger weights because the are the closest counterpoint
to economies that experienced a financial crisis. The weighting is somewhat more
sophisticated than this simple explanation would indicate since there are cases in which
macroeconomic fundamentals clearly predict that a financial crisis is likely even when

credit buildups are relatively small (e.g., the two observations at the bottom of the figure).
    The negative slope coefficients for the weighted subsamples imply that the larger the
credit buildup in the expansion the weaker is the subsequent recovery after the recession.
The large and statistically significant intercept difference between the two regression lines
for the subsamples measures the average difference between the aftermath of financial
crisis and normal recessions, controlling for all measurable economic factors. This
summary effect is consistent with the annual paths in Tables 6 and 7, and qualitatively
large: it again adds up to about 20 percent for the sum of log real GDP per capita
deviations over 5 years, i.e., a loss of 4 percent of output per year in that window.

    Table 7 builds on the intuition in Figure 7 and shows that debt overhang is a regular
phenomenon of the modern business cycle. Estimates of the credit buildup indicator
are sometimes estimated inaccurately even though the economic effects are quite sizable.
The coefficient estimates on the credit buildup indicator are statistically significant at
conventional levels in Years 3, 4 and 5. At its peak effect in Year 4 every additional
1 percentage point per year of credit accumulation above the country specific mean
is associated with about 0.7 percent lower real per capita GDP relative to the start of
the recession.8 Moreover, the summary statistics reported in Table 5 suggest that the
experiment based on 1 percentage point per year of credit buildup is rather conservative
since the sample standard deviation of this variable is about 2 percentage points.
    These results confirm the findings in Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor (2013) using
new data and more sophisticated techniques. On an aggregate level credit booms are
associated with deeper recessions and slower recoveries. Put differently, credit bites back.
   8 Thateffect is larger in the pre-WWII sample at over one percent (although with more volatile across-
horizon dynamics), and about the same post-WWII. See the appendix for the analysis in Table 7 broken
down by pre- and post-WWII samples.

However, even controlling for these effects financial crisis recessions are still dramatically
more costly then normal recessions, with losses mounting to 1⁄5 of annual real GDP over 5
years. In the next section we turn to a more granular analysis and examine if and how
the composition of credit has an effect on the dynamics of the business cycle.


7.4.   The Aftermath of Mortgage Booms

Up to now we have estimated recession paths based on total credit—but is all credit the
same? Are overhangs from mortgage booms particularly severe?
   In this section we maintain the baseline IPWRA specification in expression (5) but
split the credit variable into two components: mortgage lending versus non-mortgage
lending. Mortgage lending includes residential and commercial real estate lending. Non-
mortgage lending is a less homogeneous category that includes business lending and
other unsecured lending such as consumer finance. As before, both enter the regressions
as the rate of change of each type of lending in the previous expansion (as a ratio to GDP
and in percentage points per year) to normalize differences in the duration of expansions.
Each variable is measured in deviation from country-specific means.
   Table 8 extends the analysis in Table 7 using each credit component separately. In
addition, it reports how in this case we find somewhat differentiated results when the
full sample is broken down by two subsamples separated by WWII.
   First, as in Tables 6 and 7, the null hypothesis that the average paths conditional on
controls and country-fixed effects in normal and financial crisis recessions are the same is
comfortably rejected, except as before in Year 1. Over the five-year window the output
gap between the two paths cumulates to about 1⁄5 of annual output which still cannot
be explained by the observable macroeconomic controls. Second, and in contrast with
the results above, the regressions show that the dynamics of credit changed substantially
after WWII so we report results for the full sample and two subperiods. The results from
the full sample reported in panel (a) of Table 8 show scant evidence of a role for mortgage


                                             34
or non-mortgage credit. The reason why can be found in the sub-sample analysis.
    Mortgage lending has economically important but imprecisely estimated effects
whereas non-mortgage lending has are more precisely estimated effects in the pre-
WWII sample. Still, the effect goes in the same direction for both types of lending. The
faster the pace of lending during the expansion, the worse the subsequent recession.
However, mirroring the long-run structural shift towards mortgage lending, a different
picture emerges for the post-WWII sample: mortgage lending effects are now estimated
precisely whereas the effects of non-mortgage lending are economically and statistically
insignificant (and often have a perverse positive sign). We now comfortably reject the
null that the marginal effects of mortgage and non-mortgage lending are the same. After
WWII the overhang from mortgage booms is severe and long-lasting, in line with the
growing importance of mortgage lending in overall credit discussed above.
    Based on the results in Table 8, in Figure 8 we present cumulated responses for real
GDP per capita, the ratio of investment to GDP, and the ratio of total lending to GDP.

the path in a financial crisis recession. In addition, it considers the effect of mortgage and non-mortgage
credit buildups during the expansion as separate controls. The table provides two formal tests. First, it
tests the equality of the conditional mean in normal and financial crisis recessions. Second, it tests that
excess mortgage and non-mortgage credit have the same effect. The local projections are weighted by the
inverse propensity score for the probability of observing a financial crisis recession instead of a normal
recession. See text.

The solid lines in the figure refer to the average conditional path in normal recessions
(displayed in solid blue along with a grey shaded 95% confidence region) and in financial
crisis recessions (displayed in solid red). For each type of recession we also modify the
average path by considering model predictions under an alternative (above average) level
of the credit buildup in the preceding expansion. The dotted lines correspond to the
responses associated with a +1 s.d. acceleration of non-mortgage credit growth whereas
the dashed line corresponds to a +1 s.d. boom of mortgage credit.
   The first row of Figure 8 corresponds to the full 1870 to 2010 sample, the second
row to the pre-WWII sample, and the third row to the post-WWII sample. Notice that
the pre-WWII sample includes the Great Depression which helps explain the slower
trends in general and the particularly severe paths of GDP and investment. Overall,
the responses for each type of recession and for each variable are nicely aligned with
economic intuition. It is evident that in financial crisis recessions output, investment, and
credit are much more strongly affected than in normal recessions. It typically takes five
years for economies to regain their previous peak output after a systemic financial crisis
and even longer for investment.
   Importantly, the figures also underscore the main lesson from Table 8: mortgage debt
plays a key role in explaining the drag from debt overhang in the post-WWII decades.
Comparing the responses for the post-WWII sample (bottom row) with either the full
sample (top row) or the pre-WWII sample (middle row) reveals that mortgage booms lead
to greater post-crisis drag on growth. These negative effects on the pace of the recovery
are present both in normal recessions and in financial crisis recessions. Since WWII both
normal and financial recessions tend to be considerably deeper and the recovery much
slower when the preceding boom saw a strong expansion of mortgage debt.
   Non-mortgage credit booms, by contrast, have virtually no effect on the path of the
recession nowadays as shown in the bottom row of Figure 8. The dotted lines almost
always lie on top of the solid lines. Yet matters are strikingly different for real estate credit

region refers to financial crisis recessions. The shaded region is a 95% confidence interval. The dotted lines
refer to the path in a normal/financial crisis recession when non-mortgage credit during the expansion
grew at the mean plus one standard deviation. The dashed lines refer to the path in a normal/financial

booms. By Year 5, real GDP is about 4% lower than it would otherwise be—regardless of
the type of recession. The effects are even more dramatic when considering investment.
The difference between the average path and the post-mortgage credit boom path are
close to 10% after Year 5, potentially driven by a collapse in housing investment.
   The estimates reported in Figure 8 are based on our IPWRA estimates and are the
closest we can come to showing how the accumulation of credit (mortgage and otherwise)
affects the path of the recession and recovery, even after controlling for crisis endogeneity.
Although a financial crisis still makes the recession worse beyond other observable
factors, comparing the results reported across Tables 6–8 we note that this effect becomes
increasingly more attenuated even if it never completely disappears.
   Summing up, the local projections demonstrate that the aftermath of credit booms is
characterized by recessions that are deeper and recoveries that are slower than normal.
However, our new disaggregated credit data adds important nuances to the debt overhang
story. Since WWII, it was in particular the overhang from mortgage booms that was
associated with more painful recessions and protracted recoveries.


                                   8.   Conclusions

This paper presented three new important insights into long-run credit dynamics in
advanced economies. These insights are the result of combining modern methods of
statistical analysis with the painstaking construction of a new dataset. We expect that
the value of this dataset will transcend the present paper and that it will become an
important resource for macroeconomic research going forward. The new insights also
have important implications for macroeconomics researchers and policymakers alike and
they can be summarized as follows.
   First, we found that in the second half of the 20th century, banks and households have
been heavily leveraging up through mortgages. Mortgage credit on the balance sheets
of banks has been the driving force behind the increasing financialization of advanced

has remained stable, with virtually all of the increase in the size of the financial sector
stemming from a boom in mortgage lending to households. Household leverage ratios
(mortgage debt divided by the value of the housing stock) have increased substantially
in many economies over the 20th century. About two thirds of the business of banking
today consists of the intermediation of savings to the household sector for the purchase
of real estate. At the beginning of the 20th century mortgage lending accounted for less
than a third of the typical bank’s loan book.
   Second, we showed that the growth of mortgage credit has important implications for
the sources of financial fragility in advanced economies, and hence for macroeconomic
policies. Mortgage booms are an important source of financial instability in the post-WWII
era, and mortgages have growing weight in total financial sector activity. We present
evidence that the changing nature of financial intermediation has shifted the locus of crisis
risk towards mortgage lending booms. This is an important new fact to be considered in
the design of macro-prudential policies.
   Third, we demonstrated that mortgage credit has also increasingly left its mark on
business cycle dynamics. In the post-WWII period the aftermath of mortgage booms
gone bust is marked by considerably slower growth rates, irrespective of whether a
financial crisis occured or not. Non-mortgage credit no longer appears to have such an
effect. Contemporary business cycles seem to be increasingly shaped by the dynamics of
mortgage credit, with non-mortgage lending playing only a minor role.
   Overall, the findings of this paper call for a differentiated perspective on credit growth
and on the implications that this differentiation has for financial stability, macroeconomic
policies, and financial regulation. Important insights into the sources of financial fragility
and the role of credit in the business cycle would be missed without a disaggregated
perspective on the various types of credit and their development over the course of
modern macroeconomic history.

                                            1870–2006
The local projection analysis in the paper employs business cycle peaks from 1870 to 2006, excludes
windows around the two world wars, reports projections out to 5 years ahead, and uses the annual
panel sample data where the last year’s projections from 2006 end in 2011. As a result, peaks
from the 2007–2011 period are not used in the sample, meaning that the empirical work does
not include the global financial crisis as an in-sample event. The peak dates which we use are as
shown in the table below where “N” denotes a normal business cycle peak and “F” denotes a
peak associated with a systemic financial crisis, that is, a crisis within ±2 years of the peak. The
peak-trough dating method follows Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor (2011) and uses the Bry and
Boschan (1971) algorithm.

C.     Appendix: Subsample Results for Regressions in Tables 6 and 7
We report results when the regressions in Tables 6 and 7 are estimated separately for Pre-WWII
and Post-WWII Recessions. The subsample regressions in Table 8 appear in the main text since
there are significant differences in the impact of different credit measures across periods. In these
two tables, however, such differences are not present.
     Appendix Table 3 reports the simple normal versus financial path differences with no other
control variables as in Table 6. The only qualitative difference between the Pre-WWII and Post-
WWII Recessions arises from the lower average trend growth (plus the incidence of The Great
Depression) in the earlier Pre-WWII sample, which lowers each intercept by about 0.9 percentage
points per year on average. But with respect to the Normal versus Financial coefficient differences,
the findings from the full sample remain intact.
     Appendix Table 4 reports the normal versus financial path differences and the effect of the
total credit control variable as in Table 7. The same normal versus financial differences remain, but
the small sample size leads to imprecise estimates of the total credit coefficient. With no significant
differences here in the total credit coefficient for the the Pre-WWII and Post-WWII Recessions, the
findings of Table 7 are not overturned, and the tighter confidence intervals obtained from the full
sample estimates are to be preferred.
