                                            ABSTRACT

In this paper we examine temporal properties of eleven natural resource real price series from 1870-
1990 by employing a Lagrangian Multiplier unit root test that allows for two endogenously
determined structural breaks with and without a quadratic trend. Contrary to previous research, we
find evidence against the unit root hypothesis for all price series. Our findings support characterizing
natural resource prices as stationary around deterministic trends with structural breaks. This result
is important in both a positive and normative sense. For example, without an appropriate
understanding of the dynamics of a time series, empirical verification of theories, forecasting, and
proper inference are potentially fruitless. More generally, we show that both pre-testing for unit
roots with breaks and allowing for breaks in the forecast model can improve forecast accuracy.

I. Introduction

       An important literature has developed recently that empirically examines

nonrenewable natural resource price paths and investigates whether they are trend- or

difference-stationary. For example, Ahrens and Sharma (1997) use annual data on eleven

commodity price series ranging from 1870-1990 and conclude that six of these series are

stationary around a deterministic trend, while the remaining five display stochastic trends

implying a unit root. In a related paper, Berck and Roberts (1996) use a subset of the

same data and find overwhelming support for non-stationary unit roots. Slade (1988) and

Abgeyegbe (1993), among others, find similar overwhelming support for non-stationary

natural resource prices. A consistent theme across much of this literature is that most

natural resource prices are non-stationary.

       Our motivation in this paper is to further the boundaries of econometric

methodologies and provide new insights into natural resource price time paths. Previous

empirical work on natural resource prices typically neglects possible structural change in

the time series. Since the seminal work of Perron (1989), it is well known that ignoring

structural change in unit root tests will lead to a bias against rejecting the unit root null

hypothesis when it should in fact be rejected (e.g., see also Amsler and Lee, 1995). In

this study, we advance the literature on time paths of natural resource prices by

endogenously determining structural breaks and extending the two-break Lagrangian

Multiplier (LM) unit root test of Lee and Strazicich (2003) to include a quadratic trend.

Given that a quadratic trend might exist in some natural resource price series we believe

that allowing for a quadratic trend in conjunction with structural breaks may provide

additional insights.




                                              1
       Understanding the nature of resource price time paths is important for several

reasons. Theoretically speaking, Ahrens and Sharma (1997, page 61), for example, note

that in regards to both a simple and more general Hotelling (1931) model as described in

Slade (1988), “price movement is still systematic and may be modeled appropriately as a

deterministic trend.” In contrast, in a world with uncertainty “in which speculative

motives drive the behavior of extracting firms or unanticipated events largely

characterize the market, resource prices may be generated by a random walk process”

(Ahrens and Sharma, 1997, pages 61-62). Thus, knowing the correct time series behavior

of natural resource prices can be vital to distinguish among theories that most accurately

describe observed behavior.

       Knowledge of the time series properties of natural resource prices is also

important for proper econometric estimation. For example, Ahrens and Sharma (1997)

and Labson and Crompton (1993) note that conventional regression analysis and

hypothesis testing cannot be correctly undertaken without first understanding

characteristics of the time series. Otherwise, results from estimating regression models

may be rendered invalid. Several additional examples can be found in the literature (see,

e.g., Hamilton, 1996).

       Finally, given that good policymaking typically depends on sound economic

forecasts, appropriately modeling the nature of the time series can be invaluable to

forecasters (Diebold and Senhadji, 1996). This task recently came to hand in Berck and

Roberts (1996), who did not consider structural breaks. They found that each commodity

price series had a unit root and hence initially paid more credence to their ARIMA

forecasts.   Berck and Roberts (1996), however, found that their ARMA forecasts




                                            2
outperformed their ARIMA counterparts. In the later part of our paper, we investigate

whether pre-testing for unit roots with structural change can help to identify the most

accurate forecasting model. This question has not been previously examined in the

literature.

        Our investigation begins by examining annual data comprised of eleven fuel and

metal real price series ranging from 1870-1990.1 After including structural breaks, we

find evidence against a unit root in each of the eleven series. We then estimate different

forecasting models and find that ARMA models with breaks generally outperform

ARIMA models with breaks, which is consistent with our pre-test expectations. These

results help to solve the puzzling results noted by Berck and Roberts (1996), and

demonstrate the importance of considering structural breaks in economic forecasting. A

second major finding is that our unit root test results are robust-with or without quadratic

trends natural resource prices are stationary around deterministic trends with two

structural breaks in intercept and trend slope. Thus, while nonlinear time trends are

important in certain price series, rejection of the underlying unit root hypothesis and

support for trend-break stationary price series does not depend on inclusion of such

trends. Finally, we find that both pre-testing for unit roots and including structural breaks

can improve the accuracy of forecasting natural resource prices.

        The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section II provides a brief

background on unit root tests and further describes the importance of understanding the

time-series properties of exhaustible resource prices. Section III describes our empirical

methodologies. Section IV presents our empirical results. In Section V, we examine

how structural breaks affect the accuracy of forecasts. Section VI concludes.


II. Background

       Recent years have witnessed an explosion of research that examines the time-

series properties of economic data. An important stimulant in this time-series renaissance

was Nelson and Plosser’s (1982) study, which applied unit root analysis to test for the

stationarity of macroeconomic and financial time series. Since this seminal study, many

authors have analyzed data ranging from stock prices to air pollutant emissions, with the

bulk of research having clear implications theoretically as well as from a policy

perspective (see, e.g., List, 1999). Certainly, the empirical results from many of these

studies have broad implications in numerous areas of research.

       Within the natural resource literature, Slade (1988), Berck and Roberts (1996),

and Ahrens and Sharma (1997), among others, discuss the notion that exogenous shocks

can affect the time path of natural resource prices. These studies use a variety of unit root

tests to examine time paths of commodity prices. Rejection of the unit root null supports

the alternative hypothesis of a mean or trend reverting stationary series, implying that

shock effects are transitory. Alternatively, failure to reject the unit root null implies a

non-stationary series in which shocks have permanent effects; following a shock there is

no tendency for commodity prices to revert to a stable mean or trend. The most recent of

these studies—Ahrens and Sharma (1997)—assumes one known or exogenously given

structural break common to all commodity price series in 1929, 1939, or 1945; the other

studies mentioned do not consider structural breaks.




                                             4
       Natural resource theory has stark predictions on the time pattern of resource

prices. In fact, in his treatise on the economics of exhaustible resources, Hotelling (1931)

predicts that, under certain assumptions, the price of an exhaustible resource will rise at

the rate of interest. But a quick glance at the majority of mineral commodity price series

suggests that relative commodity prices have declined, rather than increased, for long

periods of time. Barnett and Morse (1963), who observed this seemingly anomalous

pattern, concluded that scarcity was not a real problem. Although these particular results

are crucial evidence against the original premise of Hotelling, modifications of the simple

Hotelling model can produce predictions of falling or stagnant prices over time. For

example, environmental constraints and natural resource abundance may induce price

declinations (Berck and Roberts, 1996). Resource prices may also decrease when a

backstop technology is introduced, causing an inward shift in the demand for natural

resources (e.g., Heal, 1976). Technical change and an endogenous change also could

produce decreasing, or U-shaped paths for relative prices (e.g., Slade, 1982). Finally,

modifications of initial informational assumptions, such as knowledge of the original

resource stock, can induce the model to predict price decreases (see Pindyck, 1980, for

one scenario).


III. A New Modeling Approach

       In this paper we begin our testing approach by employing the recently developed

two-break LM unit root test of Lee and Strazicich (2003). One important advantage of

the LM unit root test is that it is free of spurious rejections. Nunes, Newbold, and Kuan

(1997) and Lee and Strazicich (2001) showed that the endogenous break ADF-type unit




                                             5
root tests are subject to spurious rejections in the presence of a unit root with break.2

Because these tests assume no breaks under the null and derive their critical values under

this assumption, rejection of the null need not imply rejection of a unit root per se, but

may imply rejection of a unit root without break. As such, researchers may incorrectly

conclude that a time series is (trend) stationary with break(s) when in fact the series is

non-stationary with break(s). In contrast, rejection of the null using the LM test is

unaffected by breaks. Thus, rejection of the null using the LM test unambiguously

indicates a trend-stationary series with break(s). 3

        To illustrate the underlying model and LM testing procedure, we consider the

following data-generating process (DGP):

        yt = δ' Zt + et                                                                      (1)

        et = β et-1 + ut,                                                                    (2)

where yt is the commodity price in period t, δ is a vector of coefficients, Zt is a matrix of

exogenous variables, and ut is an error term. We define Zt = [1, t, D1t, D2t, DT1t, DT2t] to

allow for a constant term, linear time trend, and two structural breaks in level and trend,

where TBj denotes the time period of the breaks.              Under the trend-break stationary

alternative, the Djt terms describe an intercept shift in the deterministic trend, where Djt =




2
  The endogenous break ADF-type unit root tests include the one-break minimum test of Zivot
and Andrews (1992) and two-break minimum test of Lumsdaine and Papell (1997). These tests
have been popular in the literature. However, as shown in Lee and Strazicich (2001, 2003), these
tests tend to estimate the break point incorrectly at one period prior to the true break(s) where bias
in estimating the unit root test coefficient is greatest. The outcome is a size distortion that
increases with the magnitude of the break. Due to a different detrending procedure in the
endogenous break LM test, this type of size distortion does not occur.
3
  As is common practice in the literature, we refer to a time series that is stationary around a
breaking trend as “trend-break stationary.”


                                                  6
1 for t ≥ TBj + 1, j = 1, 2, and zero otherwise; DTjt describes a change in slope of the

deterministic trend, where DTjt = t for t ≥ TBj + 1, j = 1, 2, and zero otherwise.

        While Berck and Roberts (1996) considered an LM unit root test with quadratic

trend, they did not consider structural breaks. Ahrens and Sharma (1997) advance the

literature by considering one structural break that is given a priori. To further advance

the literature, we consider two structural breaks that are endogenously determined by the

data. In addition, we extend the two-break LM unit root test to allow for a quadratic

trend. Defining Zt appropriately, the DGP in (1) with quadratic trend and two breaks in

intercept and trend slope can be described by Zt = [1, t, t2, D1t, D2t, DT1t, DT2t]. To the

best of our knowledge, this is the first paper in any field of research to consider a

quadratic time trend in an endogenous break unit root test. 4

        Test statistics for the LM unit root test are obtained from the following regression:
                         ∼
        ∆yt = δ '∆Zt + φ St-1 + ut ,                                                      (3)
       ∼        ∼      ∼                 ∼           ∼ ∼
where S t = yt - ψx - Ztδ , t=2,..,T, and ψx = y1 - Z1δ . St is a detrended series of yt using the
                ∼
coefficients in δ , which are estimated from the regression in first differences of ∆yt on

∆Zt = [1, ∆D1t, ∆D2t, ∆DT1t, ∆DT2t]. This procedure follows from the LM (score)
                                                                 ∼

begin at zero so that S1 = 0. This detrending method based on δ differs from that adopted

in the DF type tests, where the parameter δ is estimated from the regression of yt on Zt in




4
  There are technical difficulties in obtaining relevant asymptotic distributions and corresponding
critical values of endogenous break unit root tests with three or more breaks. However, for our
purposes, including three or more breaks does not appear necessary. First, visual inspection of
the data reveals that more than two breaks are unlikely. Second, the two-break test is found to
have sufficient ability to reject the unit root in all cases.

levels. Vougas (2003) has shown that the LM type test using the above detrending

method is more powerful than the DF type test.

        Under the null hypothesis of a unit root φ = 0, and under the alternative φ < 0.

The LM unit root test statistic is denoted as:
        ∼
        τ = t-statistic testing the null hypothesis φ = 0.                                 (4)
                                                                   ∼
The search for two breaks (λj = TBj/T, j=1,2) that minimize τ can be described by a grid

search as follows: 5
                  ∼
        LMτ = Inf τ (λ).                                                                   (5)

Correction for autocorrelated errors in (3) is accomplished by including augmentation
        ∼
terms ∆St-j, j=1,..,k, as in the standard ADF test. To determine k we follow the “general

to specific” procedure described in Perron (1989). Beginning with a maximum number
    ∼                                                                  ∼
of ∆St-i terms, maxk = 8, we examine the last augmented term ∆St-8 for significance at the

10% level (asymptotic normal critical value is 1.645). If insignificant, the last augmented

term is dropped from the regression and the model is re-estimated using k = 7 terms, etc.,

until the maximum lagged term is found or k = 0, at which point the procedure ends. We

repeat this procedure at each combination of two break points λ = (λ1, λ2)′ over the time

interval [.1T, .9T] (to eliminate end points).6


IV. Empirical Results




5
  Note that the break locations and unit root test statistic are jointly estimated in the minimum LM
unit root test. Critical values were derived given this joint estimation (Lee and Strazicich, 2003).
6
  This “general to specific” procedure has been shown to perform well as compared to other data-
dependent procedures in selecting the optimal number of augmented terms (see, e.g., Ng and
Perron, 1995).


                                                  8
       Our data, generously provided by W. Ashley Ahrens and Vijaya Sharma, are

annual real price series for eleven fuels and metals. The series are typically available

from 1870-1990 and include aluminum, bituminous coal, copper, iron, lead, nickel,

petroleum, natural gas, silver, tin, and zinc.7 To allow a direct comparison with previous

research, we use commodity price series similar to those examined in Slade (1988) and

Berck and Roberts (1996), and, of course, identical to the data used in Ahrens and

Sharma (1997).8 Visual inspection of each time series in Figure 1 suggests that most are

stationary with one or two structural breaks. In a few series, there is evidence suggesting

a possible nonlinear (quadratic) trend. Curvature of trend would be consistent with

Hotelling’s basic premise. Yet, in Figure 1, the trends are not typically convex with a

positive first derivative—a majority of the figures show that relative commodity prices

have declined rather than increased. This finding matches results in previous studies and

casts doubt on some predictions of the simple Hotelling (1931) model.

       Although casual inspection of Figure 1 provides some insights, formal

econometric tests are necessary to determine the properties of each time series. In our

analysis, we strive for the most general results possible. Accordingly, we employ five

different unit root tests to analyze each price series. Our first test, also employed by

Berck and Roberts (1996), is the no-break LM unit root test of Schmidt and Phillips

(1992, SP hereafter) with an added quadratic time trend. Our second test is the two-break

LM unit root test developed in Lee and Strazicich (2003). To check the robustness of our

 These data were previously converted to real prices by deflating with the producer price index
(1967 = 100). Most of the data comes originally from Manthy (1978) and Schurr (1960).

findings, and more clearly examine the effect of including two breaks instead of one, in

our third test we utilize the one-break minimum LM unit root test of Lee and Strazicich

(2004). In our most general empirical model we extend the two-break LM unit root test

to include a quadratic time trend. Finally, we extend the one-break LM test to include a

quadratic trend.   Our combination of testing procedures permits us to compare our

findings with previous studies, while simultaneously allowing us to isolate effects of

allowing for breaks.

Quadratic Trend with No Break

       Results using the no-break SP LM unit root test with linear and quadratic time

trends are presented in Table 1. The second column provides sample sizes; the third

column notes the starting year; the fourth column presents the number of lagged

augmentation terms included in each regression. The resulting t-statistics testing the unit

root null hypothesis are presented in the fifth column. The rightmost column contains

summary estimation results of equation (3)—estimated coefficients of the augmented

terms are omitted to save space. Critical values are contained in the Table notes.

       The test results in Table 1 suggest that five of the eleven real price series reject

the unit root null at the p < .05 level (coal, iron, lead, gas, and zinc). Interestingly, four

of these five series (all except lead) have a quadratic time trend that is significantly

different from zero at conventional levels, whereas the six series that do not reject the

unit root have insignificant quadratic time trend terms. Thus, non-rejection of a unit root

hypothesis for these six series may be due to lower power caused by including an

insignificant quadratic time trend, or to bias from omitting breaks. Consistent with

Ahrens and Sharma (1997; their Table IV), our results reject the unit root in nearly half




                                             10
the series; but our rejections do not overlap completely. One explanation for this finding

is our inclusion of a quadratic time trend—Ahrens and Sharma (1997) do not include a

quadratic trend in their ADF tests. Ahrens and Sharma (1997) also employ the test

suggested by Ouliaris et al. (1989, OPP hereafter), which includes a quadratic time trend

but no structural break. Our results still do not exactly replicate their findings. One

possible explanation, which is noted by Ahrens and Sharma (1997), is that the OPP test is

plagued by size distortions. Fortunately, similar size distortions do not occur in the no-

break SP LM test and may help to explain the difference in results.

          Comparing our results with those in Berck and Roberts (1996), which use the

same no-break SP LM test with quadratic trend, we find that inferences across the two

sets of empirical results differ significantly. Whereas we reject the unit root in five price

series, they cannot reject the unit root in any of their nine series at the 5% level. This

difference in results is most likely due to the longer time series in our tests, leading to

greater power to reject the null—whereas we make use of the entire data set, Berck and

Roberts (1996) use two smaller subsets of the data (i.e., 1940-76 and 1940-91). Using

these shorter time series, we were able to replicate the results in Berck and Roberts

(1996).     We should note that replication was achieved even though they used a

transformed test based on estimating the long-run variance, whereas we employed an

augmented version of the no-break SP LM unit root test. This provides evidence that the

difference in results is not due to different methods of correcting for autocorrelated

errors.

Two Endogenous Breaks with a Linear Trend




                                             11
        Moving to our more flexible models, we present empirical results from the two-

break LM unit root test in Table 2. Critical values are provided in the Table notes.

Empirical results may well reflect the reduction in bias from including variables to model

structural change. Compared to the no-break SP LM test results in Table 1, we find

significantly more rejections of the unit root null. Whereas the no-break model in Table

1 rejects the unit root null for five of eleven series at the p < .05 level, the two-break

model in Table 2 rejects the unit root null in eight of eleven series at p < .05. If one

considers a slightly less stringent p < .10 test, the two-break model rejects the unit root

null in all eleven series. These findings provide the strongest evidence to date against the

unit root process as a description of natural resource prices.

        Our test results in Table 2 strengthen the findings of Ahrens and Sharma (1997),

and differ from the conclusions of Agbeyegbe (1993), Berck and Roberts (1996), and

Slade (1988), among others. Whereas Ahrens and Sharma (1997) allow for one known

break in 1929, 1939, or 1945 and reject the unit root in five of eight price series, after

allowing for two endogenously determined breaks we reject the unit root in all eleven

series. By including one (known) structural break Ahrens and Sharma (1997) can be seen

as an extension of Berck and Roberts (1996), while our tests can be seen as a further

extension to a more general model. 9

  An anonymous referee notes that the shorter time span (1940-1991) examined in Berck and
Roberts (1996) can be viewed as allowing for a structural break in 1940. However, as our results
will demonstrate, while World War II is one of the major structural breaks identified by our tests,
there are other breaks that we identify. By considering a longer time span of data, our testing
procedure should benefit from greater power and a reduction in bias from including additional
breaks. It is also possible that failure to reject the unit root null in Berck and Roberts (1996)
might be due to their inclusion of a quadratic trend. If a quadratic trend does not occur, especially
in the post-1940 time period, then inclusion would lower power. We thank an anonymous referee
for noting this possibility.


                                                 12
        To further examine the effect of allowing for two breaks instead of one, we

additionally test all price series using the endogenous one-break LM test. The results are

displayed in Table 3. Compared to the two-break results, we find fewer rejections of the

unit root using the one-break test (seven of eleven series reject the null at p < .05 and p <

.10). This difference in results is likely due to bias from omitting the second break

variable, and demonstrates the impact of allowing for two breaks instead of one. 10

        Comparing the breaks identified by our two-break LM tests in Table 2 with those

in Ahrens and Sharma (1997), only one of our estimated break years (1945, lead)

coincides exactly with an assumed break year selected by Ahrens and Sharma (1997).

However, five additional breaks identified by our two-break tests (1928, 1932, 1942,

1943, and 1944) are close to one of their assumed breaks (1929, 1939, and 1945).

Overall, our identified break years in Table 2 are intuitively appealing as they broadly

correspond to years associated with World War I, the Great Depression, World War II,

and the energy crisis of the early 1970s.            Fifteen of the twenty-two breaks (68%)

correspond to these time periods, with the most common time period for breaks in the

early 1970s.      Besides these obvious break years, other estimated breaks occur

concurrently with important events. For example, the model shows that a structural break

occurred in 1902 for coal prices. This year coincides with the 100,000 United Mine

Worker strike that crippled coal production in the U.S. for five months.

Two Endogenous Breaks with a Quadratic Trend



10
   For comparison purposes, we also performed unit root tests using the ADF-type one-break
Zivot and Andrews (1992) test and two-break Lumsdaine and Papell (1997) test. While these
tests tend to over-reject the null, their results are similar to ours. The two-break LP test rejects
the null at the 10% level for all series except for gas and petroleum. Details of these results are
available upon request.


                                                13
        In Table 4 we present results from our most general model, the two-break LM

unit root test with a quadratic time trend. Since this test is new to the literature, we

follow the procedure of Lee and Strazicich (2003) and simulate critical values, which are

presented in the Table notes.11 Compared to the two-break test results in Table 2, which

include only a linear trend, we report a few significant differences. Whereas exclusion of

the quadratic time trend in Table 2 leads to rejection of the unit root at the 10% level for

all eleven series (8 of 11 at p < .05), after including quadratic time trends, unit roots are

not rejected (at the 10% level) for aluminum and petroleum. However, the results for

aluminum should be interpreted with care, as the coefficient on the quadratic time trend is

not significantly different from zero at conventional levels, suggesting the linear time

trend specification is more appropriate. Although we find that the quadratic time trend is

significant at the 10% level in five of the eleven price series, other results are

qualitatively unchanged. Overall, at the 5% level, the results in Table 4 suggest that we

should reject the unit root in nine of the eleven series, providing additional evidence that

commodity prices are stationary around a breaking deterministic trend.

        To further examine the effect of allowing for two breaks instead of one, we

additionally test all price series using an endogenous one-break LM test with quadratic


11
   Since the two-break LM unit root test with quadratic trend is a new test, we derive critical
values by generating pseudo-iid N(0,1) random numbers using the Gauss (version 6.0.5) RNDNS
procedure. Critical values are derived using 5,000 replications involving a grid search of all
combinations of the endogenous break points for minimum statistics in samples of T = 100. The
asymptotic distribution of the two-break minimum LM test with quadratic trend can be shown by
a simple modification of the expression for that of the two-break minimum LM test with linear
trend. The expression of the demeaned and de-breaked Brownian bridge V        _ (r, λ) in Lee and
Strazicich (2003, equations 6c, Appendix A.6) must be changed to incorporate a detrended p-
level Brownian bridge as given in SP (1992, equation 40). This expression is described as a
residual process projected onto the subspace generated by dz(λ,r) = [1, r, d1(λ1,r), d2(λ2,r)]. The
trend function is given as r = {rj, j=0,1,..,p-1}, where dj(λj,r) = 1 if r > λj, for j=1,2, and 0
otherwise.


                                                14
trend.12 The results are displayed in Table 5. Compared to the two-break with quadratic

trend results in Table 4, we find the same number of rejections of the unit root null (nine

of eleven series reject the null at p < .05 and p < .10). The only notable difference in

results is with regards to the two series that do not reject the unit root. In Table 4

aluminum and petroleum did not reject the unit root, but in the one-break test results of

Table 5 petroleum rejects the unit root (at p < .05) while silver does not. The difference

in results for silver is likely due to bias from omitting the second break variable. The

difference for petroleum may be due to including an unnecessary break in the two-break

quadratic trend model, which would be expected to reduce power.

          Again, the majority of identified break years correspond primarily to the two

World Wars, the Great Depression, and the 1970s energy crisis: fifteen of the twenty-two

breaks (68%) correspond to these time periods, with the most common time period for

breaks in the early 1970s. In addition, other important events, such as the Lead and Zinc

Stabilization Program in 1961, seem to also coincide with an identified break.

          The most appropriate model in the literature to compare our results is, again,

Ahrens and Sharma’s (1997) OPP test, which allows for a quadratic trend but no

structural break(s). Using the OPP test, Ahrens and Sharma (1997) reject the unit root

null in five of eight series at p < .05. Using the two-break LM test with quadratic trend,

we reject the unit root in nine of eleven series at the 5% level. This difference is likely

due to allowing for structural breaks.

          To examine further the effects of allowing for breaks, we present plots showing

each commodity price series in Figure 1. Each panel shows the actual commodity price



12
     We thank an anonymous referee who suggested this robustness check.


                                               15
series as well as fitted values from a linear time trend regression connecting the two

breaks in intercept and trend slope identified in Table 2. The plots suggest that most

price series are trend-stationary around a small number of breaks. More importantly, a

visual inspection indicates that it may be more appropriate to specify the model with

discrete shifts in a deterministic linear trend rather than a quadratic trend. Even in some

series for which a quadratic trend appears to fit, the linear trend model with two structural

breaks also appears to fit the data well.         Overall, seven of the eleven series have

downward trends in the most recent period.

       In sum, the above results provide the strongest evidence to date against the unit

root hypothesis and suggest that natural resource price series are stationary around

deterministic trends with occasional changes in intercept and trend slope. Our findings

are at odds with those in previous studies. In addition, our findings strengthen those of

Ahrens and Sharma (1997), who concluded that the majority (six of eleven) of natural

resource price series reject the unit root hypothesis. In certain respects, our unit root test

results are consistent with the scores of theoretical models that suggest resource price

paths are deterministic, but downward or U-shaped. In the next section, we examine how

structural change affects forecasting.


V. Forecasting Issues

       As aforementioned, we view one contribution of the above analysis as informing

the forecaster. Whether, and to what extent, structural change in natural resource prices

influences the selection and performance of forecasting models is largely unknown,

however. In this section we fill this void by exploring whether pre-testing for a unit root

with structural change and inclusion of breaks in the forecast model can lead to more



                                             16
accurate forecasts. Diebold and Kilian (2000) previously examined whether pre-testing

for unit roots matters for forecasting, given that a priori information on the properties of a

time series is not available. The issue that we examine is similar in spirit, yet we

consider structural breaks. One may argue that allowing for breaks when pre-testing for

unit roots can give potentially different results, since a unit root process with breaks can

sometimes be viewed as observationally equivalent to, or hardly distinguishable from, a

trend stationary process with breaks. Intuitively speaking, this can be the case because

structural change implies persistent effects similar to those in a unit root process (see

Phillips, 1988). Since the pioneering work of Perron (1989), however, it is well known

that inference in unit root tests will be adversely affected by ignoring structural change.

Under the alternative hypothesis of a trend-break stationary series, structural change

would be described by occasional predetermined large shocks that permanently alter the

level and slope of the deterministic trend. This is the common view in the literature as

consistently advocated in numerous theoretical and empirical papers. Following this

view, the existence of structural change is not considered to be sufficient support for the

unit root hypothesis.

       In this section, we seek to determine how structural change will affect the

selection and accuracy of forecasting models when we do not know a priori if a time

series is (trend) stationary (with breaks) or nonstationary (with breaks). Several authors

have noted the deleterious effects of ignoring structural breaks in forecasting models (see,

e.g., Pesaran and Timmermann, 2002, 2004, and Clark and McCracken, 2003). However,

these previous papers deal with mostly stationary data and do not address the question of




                                             17
whether forecasts in levels perform better than forecasts in differences in the presence of

breaks.

          We begin our investigation by conducting Monte Carlo simulations to study the

role of structural breaks in selecting and estimating the most accurate forecasting model.

To do so, we compare the unconditional prediction mean squared error (PMSE) of the

following five strategies:

     (M1) Difference the data and include two breaks in intercept and trend slope.

     (M2) Analyze the data in levels and include two breaks in intercept and trend slope.

     (M3) Pre-test with unit root tests that allow for two breaks in intercept and trend

            slope and proceed as follows: if the unit root null is rejected, then select M2; if

            we cannot reject the unit root, then select M1.

     (M4) Difference the data and do not allow for breaks.

     (M5) Analyze the data in levels and do not allow for breaks.

Note that models M1-M3 are conditional on the existing breaks, while M4 and M5 are

not. Thus, we can compare the performance of pre-testing for a unit root in addition to

the effect of including known breaks in the forecasting model.               In general, when

comparing the accuracy of forecasts with different models the common approach is to

compare out-of-sample forecasts. We follow this approach.13




13
  There does not appear to be a unanimous consensus on this issue, however. Inoue and Kilian
(2004) suggest that comparing in-sample tests of forecast accuracy are more reliable than out-of-
sample tests. The underlying issue is potential data mining or un-modeled structural change.
Also, the accuracy of out-of-sample forecasts can depend on the selection of the holdout period.



                                               18
       For simplicity, we restrict our simulations to AR(1) or ARI(1,1) models as in

Diebold and Kilian (2000). Thus, M1 is an ARI(1, 1) model with two breaks and can be

described as follows:

   ∆yt = µ + b∆yt-1 + d1B1t + d2B 2t + d3D1t + d4D2t + vt ,                             (6)

where Bjt = 1 for t = TBj + 1, j = 1, 2, and zero otherwise. M2 is an AR(1) model with

two breaks as follows:

   yt = c + byt-1 + d1D1t + d2D 2t + γt+ d3DT1t + d4DT2t + wt .                         (7)

M3 would be either the model in (6) or (7) depending on the results from pre-testing for a

unit root (with two breaks). M4 and M5 can be described by (6) and (7), respectively,

without the dummy variables describing the breaks. We can rewrite the DGP in (1) to be

as follows:

       (yt – c – γt – d1D1t – d2D2t – d3DT1t – d4DT2t) = β(yt-1 – c – γ(t-1) – d1D1,t-1 –

               d2D2,t-1 – d3DT1,t-1 – d4DT2,t-1) + ut ,                                 (8)

where we let c = 0, γ = 0.1, and σu2 = 1. Then, we vary the values of the persistent

parameter β as follows. To generate nonstationary data we let β = 1.0; to generate

stationary data we let β = 0.95 and β = 0.5. Another interesting question is how big

should structural breaks be to be recognized as such? We address this question by

varying the magnitude of the breaks as follows: d = (d1, d2, d3, d4) = (0, 0, 0, 0), (2, 2, 0.2,

0.2), (6, 6, 0.6, 0.6), and (10, 10, 1.0, 1.0), where d1 and d2 denote intercept shifts, and d3

and d4 denote trend slope changes, respectively. To abbreviate, we denote these different

magnitudes as d = 0, d = 2, d = 6, and d = 10, respectively, where d = 0 indicates the

model without breaks. All break sizes are described using standardized units. We

consider different break locations at ΤB1/T = 0.3 and ΤB2/T = 0.6.



                                                19
       To undertake our comparisons we examine the recursive one-step ahead

predictions of yT+h at forecast horizons h ranging from 1 to 100 periods, and employ

sample sizes T = 100 and T = 500. Pre-testing is performed using the two-break LM unit

root test and critical values at the 5% level of significance. To compare the forecast

accuracy of each model, we calculate the ratio of the prediction mean squared error

(PMSE) for each h in each model relative to the PMSE of the reference pre-test strategy

M3. The calculated ratios are denoted as M1/M3, M2/M3, M4/M3, and M5/M3. For the

models estimated in first-differences, the forecasted values are converted to levels prior

to calculating their mean squared error. The forecast error is calculated as the difference
                                                                             ^
between the (simulated) data and the predicted values (in levels), or yT+h - yT+h , h =

                             h
1,…,100. Thus, PMSE(h) = h-1 ∑ (yT+j - y^T+j)2 using forecast errors through t = h. When
                                j=1


the selected forecasting model is more accurate than the model suggested by pre-testing,

then the ratio will be less than one and vice versa. For parsimony, we report only the

summary results for selected values of h.

       We first examine the simulation results using nonstationary data (β = 1.0) in

Table 6. When the DGP is nonstationary, the differencing strategy of M1 (ARI with

breaks) has the lowest PMSE in nearly all cases. There are only very small differences in

some cases. In nearly all cases the best model (M1) is also the model that is selected by

the pre-testing. Any differences are approximately zero, and the results are unaffected by

the size of the breaks or the sample size. Overall, these results clearly support the use of

pre-testing for a unit root and including structural breaks. For the case of no breaks there

is a small gain from omitting the breaks in the (differenced) forecasting model (M4). For

the case of small breaks (d = 2), the results demonstrate little difference between


                                            20
including breaks (M1) and omitting breaks (M4). Thus, as one might expect, small

breaks have only minimal effects on the PMSE and can be hardly considered as structural

breaks. However, as the size of the breaks increases the benefit of including breaks

increases especially at longer forecast horizons.

       We next examine the simulation results using stationary data in Table 6. When

the DGP is clearly stationary (β = 0.5), the model in levels with breaks (M2) is superior

in virtually all cases. Any differences are so small that they are approximately zero and

can be ignored. In addition, M2 is the model that is selected with pre-testing in nearly

every case. Again, any differences are quite small, and the results are unaffected by the

break size, forecast horizon, and sample size. When β = 0.95 and the unit root null is

more difficult to reject, the most accurate forecasting model is in differences (M1) instead

of levels (M2). However, the difference model is also the model most frequently selected

by pre-testing. Thus, pre-testing for a unit root (with breaks) is again the preferred

method to select the most accurate forecasting model. As in the nonstationary case,

including breaks when they exist is always beneficial. Figures 2 and 3 summarize the

simulation results by displaying spectrum with varying sample sizes of T = 20n, n =

1,..,50, over the continuum of forecasting horizons h = 1,..,100. These figures generalize

the results in Table 6 and are consistent with the above discussion.

       To further our investigation, we next examine and compare the accuracy of the

different forecasting strategies by using actual data on natural resource prices.        To

perform our investigation, we utilize more recent data on eight natural resource real

prices (aluminum, copper, iron, lead, nickel, silver, tin, and zinc). These data come from




                                            21
the U.S. Geological Survey (Kelly et al., 2005), and are available annually from 1900-

2002 in real (1998) dollars per ton.14

        Our testing procedure is as follows. We first perform pre-testing for each real

price series as before using the two-break LM unit root test with linear trend. In nearly

all cases (except for nickel), the unit root null is rejected at the 10% level of significance.

We also perform pre-testing using the two-break LM unit root test with quadratic trend

and reject the unit root in all cases at the 10% level of significance. 15 Next, we estimate

four forecasting models for each series with a linear trend as in (6) and (7) (M1, M2, M4,

and M5), and then with a quadratic trend (M1Q, M2Q, M4Q, and M5Q).

        Instead of the AR(1) and ARI(1, 1) models (with and without breaks) considered

in the simulations of Table 6, we consider more general ARMA(p,q) models and

ARIMA(p,1,q) models that might be more realistically considered in applications. To

determine the order p and q of each ARMA and ARIMA model, and the location of two

breaks, we utilize the SBC statistic. We consider all combinations of p and q over the

range 0 to 5 at each combination of two breaks to find the model with the lowest SBC.

As such, our estimation procedure allows for the location of breaks to be jointly

determined with the best fitting model. In each case, we estimate the forecasting model

using data from 1900-1990 and generate out-of-sample forecasts in levels for 1991-




14
   We would have preferred to update our data, but the new data uses a different PPI to deflate the
data and different units of measurement. And, the new data is only available for eight of our
previous eleven natural resource price series. However, besides using more recent data (past
1990), the new data has the advantage that each series is available for the same time period
(1990-2002).
15
   These results are available upon request.


                                                22
2002.16 Then, the out-of-sample forecasts are compared to the actual data to calculate the

relevant PMSE. To test the statistical significance of the break variables in the models

that include breaks, F-tests were performed to test for the significance of the breaks. In

each case, the null hypothesis that break coefficients are jointly equal to zero was rejected

at the 1% level of significance. These results provide additional evidence that structural

breaks are important.

         The PMSE are displayed in Table 7 for each model type at forecast horizons h = 1,

3, 5, 8, and 12. The number in bold denotes the model with the most accurate forecasts

(smallest PMSE), which is shown separately for the models with linear and quadratic

trends. At each forecast horizon (h), the best overall model is denoted with an asterisk

(*). Given that pre-testing implied that price series are trend-break stationary, we expect

that M2 (ARMA model in levels with breaks) will have the lowest PMSE in nearly all

cases.

         We now examine the results in Table 7. Except for tin, and to a lesser extent iron,

we see little evidence that including a quadratic trend improves the accuracy of the

forecast, as the best model has a linear trend in all other cases. For aluminum, copper,

and lead our pre-test expectations are realized as the most accurate model in every case

but one (lead, h =1) is the ARMA model in levels with breaks (M2). While iron selects

the quadratic trend model at three of the five forecast horizons, three of its five best

models are in levels with breaks (M2, M2Q) as suggested by the pre-test. For the other

four price series the results are mixed. In all cases but one (h = 1), the best forecasting



16
  As noted in footnote 14, the out-of-sample PMSE results might vary depending on how we
define the out-of-sample period. We also considered 1996 as a starting period for the out-of-
sample forecasts, but the main conclusions did not vary.


                                             23
model for nickel is the ARMA model in levels without breaks (M5). For silver, the

results are unexpected as four of the five best models are in differences (M1, M4), and

three of these are without breaks (M4). Tin is the series where the quadratic trend model

is most often selected (four of five best models). Although including a quadratic trend

provides better forecasting accuracy for tin, the best model chosen in all cases is in

differences and without breaks (M4, M4Q). Finally, zinc selects an ARMA model in

levels in all cases as predicted by pre-testing, but the best model is without breaks (M5).

       Overall, the results in Table 7 using actual natural resource data present a less

clear picture than our simulation results in Table 6. However, as expected, the most

consistently selected model is the same as selected in the pre-test; in four of the eight

series the ARMA model with breaks (M2 or M2Q) is the most accurate in nearly all cases.

For the other four series the results are less clear. In some of these cases, the best model

is in levels as expected, but without breaks. In other cases the superior model is in

differences. Thus, while the model selected by pre-testing is not always the best model it

appears that pre-testing for a unit root and considering breaks are important. The gain

from considering breaks is most obvious when comparing the PMSE of those superior

models that include breaks to the other models.

        In general, as is well known, forecasting future values out-of-sample is a difficult

task. Therefore, it may not be desirable to draw any generalized conclusions regarding

forecasting strategies from a particular data application to a particular out-of-sample

period. Choosing different data and different out-of-sample periods may lead to different

conclusions. Thus, we give stronger credence to our simulation results as a guide to more




                                             24
accurate forecasting. We conclude that it is better to follow a forecasting strategy of pre-

testing for a unit root with breaks and including existing breaks in the forecast model.


VI. Concluding Remarks

       Without an appropriate understanding of the dynamics of a time series, empirical

verification of theories, forecasting, and proper inference are potentially misleading. In

this paper we examine temporal properties of eleven nonrenewable natural resource real

price series from 1870-1990.      Previous efforts largely suggest that these series are

difference-stationary with stochastic trends. We re-examine these data and advance the

literature by considering unit root tests with two structural breaks that are endogenously

determined by the data. In addition, we consider models with linear and quadratic trends.

       Overall, we find evidence to indicate that natural resource prices are stationary

around deterministic trends with structural breaks in intercept and trend slope.            In

particular, after controlling for breaks, the previous empirical findings of Agbeyegbe

(1993), Berck and Roberts (1996), and Slade (1988) are essentially reversed.               Our

findings strengthen those of Ahrens and Sharma (1997), who allowed for one known

break and concluded that the majority of natural resource price series (six of eleven)

reject the unit root. Following our unit root tests, we examined forecasting models with

breaks by employing both simulations and actual natural resource price data. From our

simulations, we conclude that it is better to pre-test for a unit root (with breaks) prior to

selecting the best forecast model, and to include breaks, if they exist, in all cases. While

our forecasting results with actual data are less clear than our simulations, the most

consistently selected model is the same as selected in the pre-test.




                                             25
       Given that accurate forecasting and empirical verification of theories can depend

critically on understanding the appropriate nature of time-series, our results should have

important implications for academics and policymakers alike. With the proliferation of

environmental and natural resource data having a temporal dimension, researchers

interested in dynamic issues as broad as environmental quality expenditures,

environmental degradation, species extinction rates, and land-use patterns should have a

firm grounding in time-series analysis.      We hope that our paper will further the

development of this literature.

Notes: Critical values of the two-break minimum LM test with quadratic trend vary depending on the location of breaks (λ). Critical values are shown at the 1%, 5%, and 10%
levels, respectively, for samples of size T = 100. Critical values are –6.80, –6.24, and –5.92 for λ = (.2,.4); –6.79, –6.19, and –5.89 for λ = (.2,.6); –6.68, –6.19, and –5.91 for λ
= (.2,.8); –6.91, –6.27, and –5.89 for λ = (.4,.6); –7.01, –6.24, and –5.88 for λ = (.4,.8); –6.81, –6.19, and –5.88 for λ = (.6,.8), where λ indicates the relative location of the
breaks. Other critical values can be interpolated. The critical values are symmetric around λ1 and λ2. B1t, B2t and D1t, D2t correspond to changes in intercept and trend slope
under the alternative, respectively. B1t and B2t denote one-period jumps in level and D1t and D2t correspond to changes in drift under the null hypothesis,
                                                                                                                                                        ^      respectively. Note that
the coefficient of t corresponds to a quadratic trend, and the constant term corresponds to a linear trend in Zt, respectively, under the alternative. k denotes the estimated optimal
number of first-differenced lagged terms included to correct for serial correlation. t-statistics are shown in parentheses. a: see notes in Table 1. * and ** denote significant at
the 10% and 5% levels, respectively. + and ++ denote significance of the quadratic trend term at the 10% and 5% levels, respectively.

Notes: Critical values of the one-break LM test with a structural break in level and trend vary depending on the location of the break (λ). Critical values are shown at the 1%,
5%, and 10% levels, respectively, for samples of size T = 100. Critical values are –5.39, –4.86, and –4.57 for λ = .1; –5.31, –4.74, and –4.46 for λ = .2; –5.29, –4.78, and –4.50
for λ = .3; –5.35, –4.80, and –4.51 for λ = .4; –5.31, –4.77, and –4.49 for λ = .5, where λ indicates the relative location of the breaks. Other critical values can be interpolated.
The critical values are symmetric around λ. B1t and D1t correspond to changes in intercept and trend slope under the alternative, respectively. B1t denotes a one-period jump in   ^
level, and D1t corresponds to a change in drift under the null hypothesis, respectively. Note that the constant term corresponds to a linear trend in Zt under the alternative. k
denotes the estimated optimal number of first-differenced lagged terms included to correct for serial correlation. t-statistics are shown in parentheses. a: See notes in Table 1. *
and ** denote significant at the 10% and 5% levels, respectively. + and ++ denote significance of the quadratic trend term at the 10% and 5% levels, respectively.

Notes: PMSE is the predicted mean squared error of the post-1990 out-of-sample forecast period (h). M1 =
differences with breaks, M2 = levels with breaks, M4 = differences without breaks, M5 = levels without
breaks, and Q denotes that the model includes a quadratic trend instead of linear trend. Structural breaks
were jointly significant in all models that included breaks at p < 0.01. * denotes the model with the lowest
PMSE.
