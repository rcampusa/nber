                                         ABSTRACT


Studying the recent experience of Brazil the paper explains how default risk is at the centre of the

mechanism through which an emerging market central bank that targets inflation might lose control

of inflation--in other words of the mechanism through which the economy might move from a

regime of "monetary dominance" to one of "fiscal dominance". The literature, from Sargent and

Wallace (1981) to the modern fiscal theory of the price level has discussed how an unsustainable

fiscal policy may hinder the effectiveness of monetary policy, to the point that an increase in interest

rates can have a perverse effect on inflation. We show that the presence of default risk reinforces

the possibility that a vicious circle might arise, making the fiscal constraint on monetary policy more

stringent.

1     Introduction
A single variable describes, day by day, what investors think about the state
Brazil’s economy: the Brazilian component of the Emerging Market Bond Index,
the Embi spread 1 . This spread is the diﬀerence between the yield on a dollar-
denominated bond issued by the Brazilian government and a corresponding one
issued by the U.S. Treasury: it is thus a measure of the markets’ assessment of
the probability that Brazil might default on its debt obligations. The Brazilian
Embi spread was 700 basis points (b.p.) in February 2002 and reached a peak
of 2,400 b.p. in July; after the October 2002 elections the spread has gradually
fallen: it was 450 b.p. in December 2003, after Brazil’s rating was raised from B
to B+. (For a comparison, throughout this period the Mexican spread hovered
around 300-400 b.p.).2
    All financial variables in Brazil fluctuate in parallel with the Embi spread,
most notably the exchange rate. The channel through which fluctuations in the
Embi spread are transmitted to the exchange rate are capital flows: an increase
in the country risk premium leads to a sudden stop of capital flows and to a
(real) depreciation which is needed to generate the trade surplus required to
oﬀset the decrease in net capital inflows. In turn, fluctuations in the exchange
rate induce corresponding fluctuations in the ratio of public debt to gdp, since
one half of Brazil’s debt (See Table 1) is either denominated in dollars or indexed
to the dollar, though payable in the domestic currency: the net public debt, as
a share of gdp, was 0.54 January 2002, reached 0.62 in July and was back to
0.55 in October.

    Domestic interest rates at all maturities are also aﬀected by fluctuations in
the Embi spread. In the case of the policy rate, the Selic, the mechanism works
via the exchange rate: exchange rate fluctuations move inflation expectations,
and the central bank, as we shall document in this paper, looks at inflation
expectations when deciding on the level of the Selic. An increase in the Embi
spread can also aﬀect inflation expectations directly, if it is accompanied by
concerns about the possibility of future monetization of part of the public debt.
    Domestic interest rates at longer maturities (where ”longer” in Brazil today
means one to 18 months) are aﬀected by the Embi spread in two ways: indirectly,
through the Selic, because fluctuations in the Selic move the term structure,
and directly because long term interest rates reflect term premia which are
aﬀected by default risk even at relatively short maturities.
    The bottom line is that the cost of servicing the public debt fluctuates very
closely with the Embi spread. Understanding what determines this spread, how
it responds to domestic monetary and fiscal policies and to international factors,
how it interacts with the exchange rate and domestic interest rates, is thus
the necessary first step in order to understand macroeconomic developments in
Brazil.
    In a number of papers Guillermo Calvo (Calvo et al., 1993, Calvo 2002) has
observed that emerging market risk premia are correlated with international
factors, in particular with worldwide measures of investors’ ”appetite” for risk,
such as, for instance, the spread between the yield on U.S. corporate bonds and
that on U.S. Treasuries. In fact, Calvo goes as far as suggesting that once one
accounts for international financial shocks, domestic factors in emerging markets
have a limited role in explaining variables such as Embi spreads: "Volatility
could partly be explained by financial vulnerability in the EMs themselves, but
the global nature of the phenomenon raises the suspicion that there are systemic
problems largely independent of each individual country. [ ... ] Contagion could
stem from the way the capital market operates, e.g., crises generated by margin
calls." (Calvo, 2002, p. 1) 3
   3 While the empirical evidence consistently shows that one of the main determinants of

emerging market spreads are international factors, there are diﬀerent views as to what such
factors might be. Kamin and von Kleist (1999) and Eichengreen and Mody (2000) report a
negative relationship between the level of long term U.S. interest rates and spreads. Arora
and Cerisola (2001) find that the stance and predictability of U.S. monetary policy are also



                                             2
    The experience of Brazil supports Calvo’s observation. The Brazilian Embi
spread is indeed correlated with the U.S. corporate spread, but this correlation
is not constant over time. Figure 1 shows the two variables in the top panel,
and, in the lower panel, the time profile of their correlation: the coeﬃcients
of recursive regressions of the Embi spread on the U.S. corporate spread. One
of the findings of this paper is that this non-linearity depends on the state of
domestic fiscal policy: when the level of the primary budget surplus is large
enough to keep the debt-to-gdp ratio stable, the response of the Embi spread
to the U.S. corporate spread is muted; when instead fiscal fundamentals are
weaker the response is amplified. .

                                  [Insert here Figure 1]

    The role of domestic fiscal policy in determining the response of the Embi
spread to international shocks suggests that the eﬀectiveness of inflation tar-
geting may depend on the fiscal policy regime.4 Consider the eﬀects of a shock
to the risk premium which depreciates the exchange rate and raises inflation
expectations. When the primary surplus is constantly adjusted so that its level
is always large enough to keep the debt ratio stable, inflation targeting works:
an increase in the Selic oﬀsetts the initial exchange rate depreciation, at least
partially. With one half of the debt denominated in dollars, the partial stabi-
lization of the exchange rate limits the impact of higher short rates on the cost
of debt service: the increase in the primary surplus needed to stabilize the debt
is thus correspondingly small.
    Instead, in a fiscal policy regime that keeps constant the level of the primary
surplus, an international financial shock may put the debt ratio along an un-
stable path: in such a situation the economy may fall in a "bad equilibrium"
where monetary policy has perverse eﬀects.
    The dynamics in the bad equilibrium can be described as follows. With a
short duration of the public debt an increase in the Selic raises the cost of debt
service: if the primary surplus remains unchanged, the debt level rises, and so
does the Embi spread. The increase in the spread adds to the initial increase
in debt, especially since it is accompanied by a depreciation of the exchange
rate, which raises the value of dollar-denominated bonds in terms of domestic
gdp. The exchange rate depreciation also aﬀects inflation expectations and,
eventually, inflation itself. This induces the central bank to increase the Selic
further, which further raises the cost of debt service, and so on.
    The diﬃculties of running monetary policy in an environment where financial
markets think that fiscal policy is unsustainable–in the sense that it violates
the conditions for the sustainability of the public debt—are well known. Sargent
significant in determining capital market conditions in emerging markets. Herrera and Perry
(2002) consider jointly the importance of US monetary policy and of US corporate bond
spreads and allow for diﬀerent long and short run eﬀects: their results strengthen the evidence
on the importance of international factors.
   4 Sims (2003) argues that fiscal policy may render an inflation trageting regime ineﬀective.




                                              3
and Wallace (1981) were among the first to point out that a reduction in the
growth rate of money can result in higher, rather than lower inflation if the
government relies on seigniorage as a source of revenue and the budget surplus
is not adjusted after the fall in seigniorage revenue. Sometimes, and often with
specific reference to Latin America, this situation has been referred to as a
regime of “fiscal dominance” 5 . More recently, but in the same vein, the "fiscal
theory" of the price level (as first discussed in Woodford, 1994) has argued that,
if the primary budget surplus is exogenous, the price level is the only variable
that can balance the government’s intertemporal budget constraint: given an
exogenous sequence of budget surpluses, there is only one price level which
makes the stock of nominal bonds inherited from the past consistent with the
present value of those primary surpluses. Thus, following a shock that raises the
cost of debt service, if the sequence of primary surpluses does not change, the
price level will have to rise for the government’s intertemporal budget constraint
to keep being balanced: this may result in an inconsistency between inflation
targeting and fiscal policy (a point shown in Uribe, 2003).6 7
    While pointing in the right direction, the fiscal theory of the price level runs
into a problem in countries, such as Brazil, where a significant fraction of the
public debt is either denominated in a foreign currency, or indexed to a foreign
currency. In such a situation a jump in the price level may not be suﬃcient to
balance the government’s intertemporal budget constraint if the primary surplus
is exogenous. When debt is dollar-denominated and risk premia are volatile, the
channel through which—if the primary budget surplus is exogenous—international
financial shocks can destabilize the economy is credit risk.8 This is what our
paper shows with specific reference to the experience of Brazil in 2002-03.
    The paper proceeds in three steps. We first document the non-linearity in the
response of the Embi spread to international financial shocks. Then we study
how the Embi spread aﬀects the cost of debt service and thus the dynamics of
the public debt: we estimate risk premia on various financial instruments and
on the exchange rate, and we show that they all move in parallel with the Embi
spread. Finally, we analyze a small short run model of the Brazilian economy
to show how the eﬀectiveness of monetary policy depends on the fiscal policy
regime.
   5 See Tanner and Ramos (2002) for a discussion of fiscal dominance in the context of Brazil.
   6 Inthe context of Brazil a model with these features is analyzed by Loyo (1999). In Loyo’s
model higher interest rates cause the outside financial wealth of private agents to grow faster
in nominal terms: this raises inflation. If the central bank responds by raising nominal rates,
so that real interest rates increase as well, then a vicious circle might arise. In Loyo’s model
there are only one-period bonds. As we show in this paper, term premia and credit risk
reinforce the possibility that such a vicious circle might arise, making the fiscal constraint on
monetary policy more stringent.
   7 Niepelt (2004) shows, however, that in a rational expectations equilibrium the fiscal theory

of the price level does not introduce fiscal eﬀects beyond those suggested by Sargent and
Wallace.
   8 Extensions of the fiscal theory to allow for the presence of credit risk are studied in Uribe

(2003).

2     Fiscal fundamentals and Brazilian risk
Since 1999, Brazilian public debt, as a fraction of gdp, has steadily increased—in
part because the primary surplus, though rising, has never been suﬃcient to
stabilize the debt, in part because, over time, the government has recognized
previously hidden liabilities—"skeletons" in Brazilian jargon, particularly in the
balance sheets of state-owned banks (see Figure 2) 9 .

                                   [Insert here Figure 2]

    Looking for domestic factors that might explain Brazilian risk—beyond its
correlation with international factors, it is thus natural to start from the level
of the debt and of the primary surplus that would be required to keep the debt
ratio stable. We have analyzed the possibility that the response of the Brazilian
Embi spread to the U.S. corporate bond spread is non-linear, and depends on
the state of fiscal policy, by estimating the following model which relates the
Embi spread to fiscal variables 10 :

                                         0
    Embit = γ 0 + γ 1 Embit−1 + γ 2,t SpreadtU.S. + γ 3 ∆Spread               U.S.
                                                                              t      +   1,t   (1)


    where Embi is the Brazil component of the Embi spread, Spread U.S. is the
spread between the yield on U.S. corporate bonds rated BAA with a maturity
between 10 and 20 years, and a 10-year U.S. Treasury bond, and ∆SpreadU.S de-
notes the first diﬀerence of the corporate bond spread. All spreads are measured
in basis points. We also include ∆Spread U.S to capture the eﬀect of jumps in
the Embi spread, independently of the non-lineraity. The time-varying response
                                            0
of the Embi spread to the U.S. spread, γ 2,t , is non-linear and depends on the
state of fiscal policy11 .

    9 For an analysis of the recent dynamics of the public debt in Brazil see Favero and Giavazzi

(2002).
  10 The idea of a non-linear response builds on the intuition of Kamin and von Kleist (1999)

who find that spreads respond to the interaction between the U.S. term spread and the coun-
try’s rating.
  11 The non-linearity makes our estimated equation a specific case of the LSTAR (Logistic

Smooth Transition Autoregressive) model discussed for instance in Tong (1983). The LSTAR
specification is more flexible than a simple interaction term: in our case, for instance, since it
allows for the response of term premia to international factors to vary depending on the level
of the debt ratio relative to an estimated threshold.

that keeps the debt-to-gdp ratio constant.12 For xt = x∗t , γ 2,t = γ 2 /2; γ 2,t rises
                   ∗
as xt falls below xt .
   We estimate (1) using lagged variables as instruments to take care of the
endogeneity of x∗t : the debt-stabilizing primary surplus is influenced by the
exchange rate, which in turn, as we discussed in the introduction, is correlated
with the Embi spread. The results are reported in Table 2.
      We have also considered an alternative measure of fiscal fundamentals, the
deviation of the debt-gdp ratio from an endogenously estimated threshold γ 4 :
           0         ¡               ¢−1
that is γ 2,t = γ 2 1 + e−(bt −γ 4 )     . For debt levels above γ 4 the response of
Embi to Spread U.S. increases (non-linearly) above γ 2 . Since the debt ratio is
also correlated with the exchange rate, we instrument b with its trend, estimated
using a Hodrick-Prescott filter: the filtered variable is no longer correlated with
fluctuations in the exchange rate. The value of γ 4 we estimate is about 54
per cent, the level of the net public debt, as a percent of gdp, in April 2002.
(see Table 2.) The estimate is rather stable: when we restrict the sample and
only use data from August 1999, it remains virtually unchanged; in the shorter
sample, however, the elasticity of the Embi spread with respect to the U.S.
corporate spread is significantly higher. Figure 3 shows the estimated values of
  0
γ 2, for the specification that makes this coeﬃcient a function of xt − x∗t .13
    In the econometric model of the Banco Central do Brazil 14 the equation
for the Embi spread includes foreign reserves, the current account and debt,
all as a fraction of gdp, but not the U.S. corporate spread. The debt variable
is significant at the 10 percent level. When we add to our specification foreign
exchange reserves and the current account, we find that they are not significant.
We also tried including in this regression the Selic rate, to test whether mone-
tary policy aﬀects the risk premium directly: it is not significant. This finding
suggests that monetary policy aﬀects the risk premium only indirectly, through
its eﬀects on the debt level.
    We have investigated the robustness of our specification by replacing the
U.S. corporate spread with alternative measures of international factors used
in the empirical literature: the level of U.S. long term interest rates and the
Federal Funds rate. The main result, that is the non-linearity, is preserved.

3     The Embi spread and other risk premia
In economies like the U.S., expected future interest rates account for the bulk
of the spread between long-term rates and policy rates: this is because the
volatility of future expected policy rates is low and credit risk is not an issue. In
emerging markets, on the contrary, the volatility of policy rates is much higher
and default risk generates sizeable risk premia. The technique we show in this
section allows to identify the role of credit risk in determining the slope of the
yield curve.
    We start by estimating a monetary policy rule, which we then use to predict
the path of future Selic rates: comparing these forecasts with observed long
term yields (from swap contracts), and assuming no expetational errors, we can
build an estimate of the credit risk component of the slope of the yield curve.
We shall close the section showing that our estimates of credit risk premia at
various maturities are highly correlated with the Embi spread.

3.1    The monetary policy rule
The best way to describe Brazilian monetary policy since the adoption of a float-
ing exchange rate regime, in February 1999, is through a simple monetary policy
rule where the Selic rate responds to one-year ahead inflation expectations:



                                         7
          Selict = ρSelict−1 + (1 − ρ) (β o + β 1 (Et πt,t+12 − π∗t )) +    2,t       (2)

Et π t,t+12 is the one-year ahead expected inflation rate, measured from the daily
survey conducted by the central bank and π ∗t is the central bank inflation target.
We estimate this rule over a sample that starts in January 2000. 15 The results
are:

                                                            0.59
                        (0.02)       (1.66)       (1.36)

   β 1 , the response of the Selic rate to a deviation of inflation expectations
from the target, is greater than unity: this indicates that monetary policy does
not accommodate inflation, and that real interest rates are raised when inflation
expectations increase. The Selic rate also appear to be rather persistent, with
an autocorrelation coeﬃcient of 0.92.16 .

3.2     Term premia on"long-term" interest rates
Since the market for long-dated bonds is very thin, we study domestic long term
interest rates using data on swap contracts. These are contracts where one party
receives the Selic and pays a fixed rate for maturities up to 18 months. What
gets exchanged in a swap contract are two flows of interest payments on a
notional principal: the principal itself is never exchanged. ”Default”, in a swap
  15 Both the monetary and the fiscal policy regimes changed sharply after the 1999 deval-

uation: monetary policy shifted from an exchange rate peg to an inflation target, and the
primary budget moved in a few years from balance to a sizable surplus. These policy shifts
make the data up to 1999 of limited use for our purposes.
  16 In Favero and Giavazzi (2002) we experimented adding to this monetary policy rule

more arguments, such as the output gap and the realized change in the exchange rate.
The coeﬀcients on such variables were not significant and the dynamic simulations of
the extended version of the rule did not provide any substantial improvement on the
baseline with expectations only. We also experimented estimating the rule with daily data:
even at this very high frequency the results are virtually identical. The following Table
shows the results using daily data and also adding the survey-based measure of exchange
rate expectations and the Embi spread on the right-hand side of the monetary policy rule.

contract, happens when one of the two parties stops paying: if this happens, the
other side will do the same, with no loss of principal. There is a loss, but this is
limited to the present discounted value of the contract which was interrupted.
In other words, there is a loss, but only because investors lose the protection
they thought they had bought by entering the swap contract. The default risk
on swaps is therefore much smaller than that on bonds, as measured by the
Embi spread, though both may be aﬀected by the same factors.
   To construct a measure of term premia on swaps we start from a no-arbitrage
condition. Consider, for simplicity, zero-coupon bonds and define a term pre-
mium per period, rather than over the entire life of the bond: then the diﬀerence
between the one-period expected return of a multi-period bond and the risk-free
rate can be written as:

                           Et (pt+1,T − pt,T ) = it,t+1 + φt,T
where pt,T is the (log of) the price at time t of a bond maturing at T ; it,t+1 is
the one-period return on the safe asset, the Selic 17 ; φt,T is the term premium,
defined over a one-period horizon, on the bond maturing at T . As the relation
between pt,T and the continuously compounded yield to maturity of a bond with
maturity T , it,T , is
                               pt,T = − (T − t) it,T
we have
                 it,T − (T − t − 1) Et (it+1,T − it,T ) = it,t+1 + φt,T
By recursive substitution, we can write:
                                           T
                                      1 X
                        it,T   =              Et it+j−1,t+j + T Pt,T
                                    T − t j=1
                                          T −1
                                      1 X
                     T Pt,T    =              Et φt+j−1,T
                                    T − t j=1

We apply this decomposition to fixed interest rates on swaps. The term pre-
mium on a T -month Brazilian fixed rate swap reflects, as discussed above, two
components: the risk associated with the volatility of policy rates over the life of
the swap and some credit risk. We shall proceed as follows. We assume that the
central bank inflation target remains unchanged and we use the survey-based
expectations to construct a path for expected one-year-ahead inflation. Sim-
ulating the estimated monetary policy rule forward we then construct future
Selic rates, iF
              t+h , as:

                      ∧ F
                               ³    ∧
                                     ´ µ∧     ∧ ¡                 ¢
                                                                   ¶
               F                                     e          ∗
              it+h = ρit+h−1 + 1 − ρ β o + β 1 πt+h+12 − πt

  17 We assume that the policy rate is a safe asset: the period-return of such an asset thus

coincides with its yield to maturity.



                                             9
where the parameters are those estimated in (2) and h can extend up to 12
months, the longest horizon over which we observe 12-month ahead inflation
expectations.
    The diﬀerence between the yield on a T -period swap, iSW
                                                          t,T , and the appro-
priate average of future Selic rates thus includes two components: the pure
term premium and a term which measures how the stream of our interest rate
forecasts compares with market expectations, iEt+j :

                        T
                                                Ã T          T

                 T − t i=1 t+j            T − t i=1 t+j i=1 t+j

    Assuming no expectational errors, we can use (3) to build an observable
proxy of the term premium on T-period swaps.
    To consider a concrete example of how swap rates decompose between ex-
pected future Selic rates and term premia, we compare the data for two dates:
October 15, 2002, at the peak of the latest Brazilian crisis, and May 19, 2003,
after the resolution of political uncertainty and a remarkable tightening of mon-
etary policy. On October 15 the Selic rate was 20.90 per cent, while the yield on
a 12-month fixed interest rate swap was 32.69 per cent. The total spread, 1.179
b.p., decomposed in a decreasing pattern of expected policy rates coupled with
a risk premium as high as 1.315 points. On May the Selic was 26.32 while the
yield on a 12-month fixed interest rate swap was 23.19 per cent. The inverted
yield curve is explained by a decreasing pattern of expected Selic rates coupled
with a value of the risk premium which had fallen to 275 b.p.
    Having constructed a measure of the term premium on swaps, we can now
study how it correlates with the Embi spread. Before doing that, however, we
complete the analysis of term premia studying the exchange rate risk premium.

3.3    The exchange rate risk premium
Using the uncovered interest rate parity condition and survey data on exchange
rate expectations, we construct a measure of the exchange rate risk premium.
For both Brazilian and U.S. interest rates we use swap rates since, as discussed
above, the market for Brazilian bonds is too thin to be significant.

                 SW,US
         iSW
          t,T − it,T   = (Et st+T − st ) + exchange rate risk premium           (4)

                     SW,US
   where iSWt,T and it,T    are, respectively, the interest rates on Brazilian swaps
of maturity T and on similar dollar-denominated swaps, and (Et st+T − st ) de-
notes the survey-based expectations of the percent change in the exchange rate
over the life of these swaps. The Brazilian central bank collects, as for inflation
expectations, a daily survey of one-year ahead exchange rate expectations: using
such surveys, and 12—month U.S. and Brazilian swaps, we are able to measure
the exchange rate risk premium.

                                        10
3.4     Term premia and the Embi spread
Table 4 shows the correlation between the Embi spread, the one-year ahead
exchange rate risk premium and the term premia on domestic swaps at three
diﬀerent maturities, 3, 6 and 12 months. For comparison we report an alter-
native measure of Brazilian default risk derived from credit default swaps. A
credit default swap (CDS) is a derivative contract in which a bondholder buys
a guarantee that covers him in the event of default: if the underlying bond
defaults the buyer of the insurance receives an amount equal to the diﬀerence
between the face value of the defaulted bond and a conventional recovery rate18 .
From such contracts it is possible to compute the risk premium. The main ad-
vantage of CDS’s over Embi spreads is that CDS’s also exist for relatively short
maturities and are thus more directly comparable with swaps.
    There is a remarkable degree of correlation among the four series. Risk pre-
mia measured by CDS’s and the Embi spread are larger than the term premium
implicit in 12-month fixed interest rates swap, consistently with the smaller ex-
posure of swaps to default risk discussed above. The correlation between the
risk premium on swaps and the Embi spread rises as the maturity of the swaps
increases: this is because the longer the life of a swap, the higher the proba-
bility that a default event might hit it. On 12-month swaps the correlation is
surprisingly high (0.70) especially since the Embi spread is computed on 10-year
bonds, while swaps have a maturity of just 12 months. The correlation is high
also with the one-year ahead exchange rate risk premium indicating that default
risk is an important determinant of exchange rate fluctuations

based on past experience.

4     Inflation targeting, country risk and fiscal pol-
      icy
The analysis carried out so far helps us understand the way in which domes-
tic fiscal policy and international financial shocks contribute to determine the
Embi spread and thus the cost of servicing the debt. The next step consists
in analyzing the channel through which country risk determines the interaction
between monetary and fiscal policy, and how it may prevent the central bank
from eﬀectively targeting inflation.
    We shall do this by means of a small short run model of the Brazilian econ-
omy which focuses on risk, debt, the exchange rate and two policy rules, one for
the central bank, the other for the fiscal authorities. Because our focus is on the
short run, we take output as given—not an innocuous assumption, since output
growth is a critical factor in determining debt dynamics, but unavoidable to
keep the analysis simple.19

4.1     The exchange rate, the risk premium and the mone-
        tary policy rule
We start by showing the eﬀects of the interaction between the exchange rate,
the risk premium and the monetary policy rule assuming, for the moment, that
the risk premium is exogenous. The result—a negative correlation between the
change in the exchange rate and the interest rate diﬀerential—has been shown by
McCallum (1994) and discussed in the context of inflation targeting by Alexius
(2002). The model consists of three equations:

                    it = ρ it−1 + (1 − ρ) (β o + β 1 (Et πt+12 − π∗ ))                        (5)


                               Et st+1 − st = (it − i∗t ) + ξ t                               (6)
  Et πt+12 − π∗ = δ 1 (Et−1 πt+11 − π∗ ) + (1 − δ 1 ) [δ 2 (st − st−1 ) − π∗ ] +        3,t   (7)

    • (5) is the monetary policy rule estimated in section 3.1;
    • (6) is the uncovered interest rate parity condition (UIRP) where ξ t repre-
      sents the exchange rate risk premium;
    • (7) describes the inflation expectations that enter (5). In the case of
      Brazil these expectations are observed: we can analyze their statistical
      properties. When we do this, we find that they are autocorrelated and
      respond to the observed deviation of the rate of exchange rate depreciation
      from π ∗ . This motivates (7)
   19 The evidence on the eﬀect of interest rates on output is weak in Brazil. The central bank

model finds a (negative) eﬀect of real 12-month swap rates, but the significance of this variable
is rather weak. This does not mean that one is allowed to assume the eﬀect away, but the
evidence does not suggest a very strong impact, at least in the short run.


                                               12
   Assume, to save notation, β o = δ 1 =         3,t   = i∗t = π∗ = 0, and substitute (5)
and (7) in the UIRP condition to get:

                Et st+1 − st = ρ it−1 + (1 − ρ) β 1 δ 2 (st − st−1 ) + ξ t             (8)



   Defining ∆st ≡ st − st−1 we can re-write (8) as:

                            Et ∆st+1 = λ∆st + ρit−1 + ξ t



    where λ ≡ (1 − ρ)β 1 δ 2 . Assuming rational expectations, the reduced form
solution of this equation is:

                                      ρ        1
                               ∆st = − it−1 +    ξ                                     (9)
                                      λ       λ+ρ t


   As discussed in McCallum (1994), the co-movement between chnages in the
exchange rate and the interest rate diﬀerential described in (9), which is the
result of the central bank following a rule such as (5), is one of the ways to
explain the UIRP puzzle.

4.2     Inflation targets, country risk and fiscal policy
We now extend the model of the previous section by adding the determinants
of the exchange rate risk premium, ξ t , which, based on our analysis, we assume
to coincide with the Embi spread and thus to be determined as in (1). We also
add a fiscal policy rule, which is needed to determine (xt − x∗t ) and thus the
response of the Embi spread to international shocks:

                            xt = ϕxt−1 + (1 − ϕ)x∗t +        4,t                      (10)


    for ϕ = 0 the primary budget surplus keeps the debt ratio constant at all
times; for ϕ = 1 the primary surplus is exogenous.20 .
    When we add to the model of equations (5) through (7) equation (1), the non-
linear equation for the Embi spread, we are no longer able to derive analytically
a reduced form solution such as (9): we have thus estimated (9) using the
Embi spread as an explanatory variable and allowing for an error term reflecting
  20 Following the terminology used by Woodford (1994), the two rules can be labeled Ricar-

dian and Non Ricardian, respectively.

deviations from UIRP other than the risk premium.21 Using lagged variables
as instruments we obtain the following estimates:

    The coeﬃcient on the interest rate diﬀerantial is negative: for a given U.S.
Fed Fund rate, a one percent increase in the Selic appreciates the exchange rate
by 0.16 percent. The Embi spread enters with a positive coeﬃcient: a higher
risk premium induces a depreciation. Note, however, that these are partial
equilibrium eﬀects. Both the Selic and the Embi spread are endogenous: it is
impossible, from this equation, to conclude what is the overall eﬀect of monetary
policy on the exchange rate. In the bad equilibrium, following an increase in
the Selic, the additional cost of debt service could induce a large increase in the
default risk—large enough so that the net eﬀect is a depreciation of the exchange
rate. This eﬀect is crucial for determining how monetary policy works.
    Consider now the eﬀect of an increase in Spread³ U.S. . The      ´ direct eﬀect
                                                               0
of the shock is an exchange rate is a depreciation: γ 2 + γ 3 (α2 + α3 ) The
extent to which monetary policy responds to the shock depends on its eﬀect on
expectations. The increase in the Embi spread, and the accompanying exchange
rate depreciation, raise inflation expectations: the reaction of the central bank
dampens the initial depreciation, so that the overall eﬀect on the exchange rate
                                                                      −1
remains ambiguous—it is (α2 + α3 ) [1 − α1 δ 2 (1 − δ 1 ) β 1 (1 − ρ)] with α1 < 0.
    This, however, is not the end of the story. The shock raises x∗t , both be-
cause the exchange rate depreciation raises the debt stock, measured in units of
domestic goods, and because domestic interest rates also increase. If ϕ = 0, xt
will adjust one to one to match the increase in x∗t : the burden of adjusting to
the financial shock falls entirely on the fiscal authorities, while the central bank
maintains the control of inflation. For ϕ = 1, xt remains constant and (x∗t − xt )
                          0
increases. This raises γ 2 and amplifies the eﬀect of the financial shock on the
risk premium. The result is further exchange rate depreciation, a further rise in
   21 An alternative consists in estimating (8) directly. This is the route followed by Blanchard

(2004): he also finds a violation of UIRP.
   A simple example helps understanding why we may observe a negative correlation between
the expected depreciation and the interest rate diﬀerential. Assume Et st+1 − st = it + ξt , and
it = −αξ t , that is monetary policy responds directly to the exchange rate risk premium: an
increase in,ξ t leads to lower domestic interest rates. Then Et st+1 − st = − [(1 − α) /α] it : in
other words, the reason for the negative correlation is the deviation from UIRP (ξ t ), coupled
with a monetary policy rule that responds to ξt .


                                               14
the debt ratio, a further increase in x∗t , and so on. The economy settles along
an unstable path, where debt increases and the central bank is unable to control
inflation.

4.3     The experience of Brazil
In this section we use the model just described to understand the interaction
between country risk and monetary and fiscal policies in Brazil. We do this
by simulating the model under two alternative fiscal rules: one that keeps the
primary surplus constant 22 , and an "almost Ricardian" rule, such as (10) for
ϕ = 0.75 23 . We take as starting conditions those prevailing in June 2002. We
choose this date because this is when the Embi spread jumps above 1,000 b.p.—a
level the spread had never reached after the 1999 devaluation—,the exchange rate
starts depreciating and, most importantly, inflation expectations start rising.
Since, as we have seen, monetary policy reacts to inflation expectations, this is
when the action starts.
    The model is composed of four equations: (5), (7), (11) plus the fiscal policy
rule. To³run the simulation
                      ´           under the "Ricardian" rule we also need estimates
           t −nt −π t
of x∗t ≡ i1+n  t +π t
                        bt−1 . This requires that we specify the dynamics of inflation
and output growth. One way would be to calibrate these two equations using, for
example, the demand and supply equations estimated in the small econometric
model of the Banco do Brazil. We choose the alternative route of fitting a very
simple autoregressive process for real GDP growth 24 , and for inflation a model
that is consistent with (7), the statistical properties of the observed inflation
expectations.
    We run the two dynamic simulations proceeding as follows:

    • As already mentioned, we take as initial conditions those prevailing in
      June 2002: b = 0.55, x = 0.035, πe = 0.0049, π∗ = 0.055, i = 0.184,
      iUS
       F edF und = 0.018, Spread
                                 US
                                    = 350 bp;
    • In the simulation we keep all exogenous variables constant, except for π∗
      which we allow to follow the path announced, in January 2003, by the
      central bank: 0.085 in 2003 and 0.05 in 2004 25 .
   22 This is essentially the fiscal rule followed by the Brazilian authorities since the 1999

devaluation and up to the 2002 election. When we estimate such a rule we find: xt =
3, 86(1 − 0, 75) + 0, 75xt−1 . There is no evidence of a reaction of xt to x∗t : the primary surplus
is very persistent and the estimated long run level (3.86 per cent of gdp) is below the sample
average for x∗t .
   23 This exercize clearly defies the Lucas critique.
   24 The evidence on the eﬀect of interest rates on output is weak in Brazil. The central bank

model finds a (negative) eﬀect of real 12-months interest rates, but the significance of this
variable is rather weak. This does not mean that one is allowed to assume the eﬀect away,
but the evidence does not suggest a very strong impact, at least in the short run. The output
growth equation we estimate is nt = γ 1 + γ 2 nt−1 + ut .
   25 We keep the target constant at 0.085 throughout 2003; in 2004 we allow it to fall gradually,

   reaching 0.05 in December.




                                                15
   The results of the dynamic simulations under the two fiscal rules are shown
in Figure 4.
   In June 2003 12-months ahead inflation expectations rise above the target
and the central bank raises interest rates. Under the "Non Ricardian" fiscal rule
(the dotted line in each of the six panels) the Selic eventually rises above 30
percent, and the Embi spread increases: the sharp monetary tightening cannot
prevent the depreciation of the exchange rate and inflation expectations stabilize
around 12 percent. The debt ratio explodes. 26
   When fiscal policy reacts (with ϕ = 0.75 < 1) to fluctuations in x∗ , monetary
policy is eﬀective at stabilizing inflation expectations: this happens because the
Embi spread, after the initial shock stabilizes. The fiscal rule tightens the
primary surplus, but eventually, as the economy stabilizes, the budget can be
gradually relaxed. The fiscal tightening is particularly severe because the rule is
not fully Ricardian: for ϕ = 1.0 the primary surplus would not need to increase
so much. 27

5     Conclusions
Studying the recent experience of Brazil we have understood how default risk
is at the centre of the mechanism through which a central bank that targets
inflation might lose control of inflation—in other words of the mechanism through
which the economy might move from a regime of "monetary dominance" to one
of "fiscal dominance". The literature, from Sargent and Wallace (1981) to the
modern fiscal theory of the price level has discussed how an unsustainable fiscal
policy may hinder the eﬀectiveness of monetary policy, to the point that an
increase in interest rates can have a perverse eﬀect on inflation. We have shown
(consistently with the findings of Blancahrd in this volume) that the presence
of default risk reinforces the possibility that a vicious circle might arise, making
the fiscal constraint on monetary policy more stringent.
    In the experience of Brazil we believe we have identified an interesting
episode where this might have happened, at least for a short period during
2002. But the episode also shows how critical the behavior of fiscal policy is.
Brazil, during 2002, had probably fallen into a bad equilibrium, where fiscal
policy was hindering the eﬀectiveness of monetary policy. But the economy was
just over the edge: a small change in the fiscal rule, such as that announced by
  26 In this exercise inflation does not display the explosive behavior described in Loyo (1999)

and Sims (2003) in the case of a "non-Ricardian" fiscal regime. This is because the nonlinearity
in the response of the Embi spread to the corporate bond spread eventually dies out in our
specification.
  27 We also computed the impulse responses to a shock to the corporate bond spread, starting

from the same initial conditions. This exercise, however, is not very informative, since it is
the non linearity of the model (which impulse responses fail to capture) that is responsible for
the sharp diﬀerence in results between the Ricardian and non Ricardian case.

the Lula government in January 2003, was enough to bring the economy back to
normal conditions, and rapidly reduce the Embi spread, stabilize the exchange
rate and, through these two variables, inflation expectations, inflation and the
dynamics of the public debt.
