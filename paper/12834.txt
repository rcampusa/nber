Demographic change can have an important effect on the stock of assets held in defined benefit pension
plans. This paper projects the impact of changes in the age structure of the U.S. population between
2005 and 2040 on the stock of assets held by these plans. It projects the contributions to and withdrawals
from these plans. These projections are combined with estimates of the future evolution of assets in
401(k)-like plans to describe the prospective impact of demographic change on the stock of assets
in retirement plans. Information on demography-linked changes in asset demand is a critical input
to evaluating the potential impact of population aging on asset returns.

       Many analysts have suggested that population aging will adversely affect
the assets of baby boomers when they retire. They argue that when a large
population cohort is working and accumulating resources for retirement, their
demand for wealth is high, and this raises the price of financial assets and other
stores of wealth. Conversely, when a large cohort retires, the argument suggests
that cohort members are likely to sell their assets to finance consumption and
thereby to drive down asset prices. This argument suggests that the rapidly
increasing population of older people in the United States and around the world
might lead to lower returns in financial markets in the decades ahead.

       This paper examines the effect of population aging on the demand for
financial assets in retirement saving plans, particularly defined benefit plans, in
the United States. It is part of a larger project that aims to evaluate the potential
empirical importance of demographic trends on financial market returns in the
United States. Our analysis focuses on retirement saving programs because the
future effect of demographic trends on financial asset demand is likely to be most
pronounced in asset holdings in retirement saving plans. The inflows and
outflows from these plans, particularly defined benefit plans, are sensitive to
demographic trends. Thus a key stepping stone in understanding the effect of
population age structure on asset returns is forecasting the effect of demographic
trends on the net cash flows to retirement saving plans and the stock of assets in
these plans.

        Over the past two and a half decades there has been a fundamental
change in saving for retirement in the United States. There has been a rapid
shift from saving through employer-managed defined benefit (DB) pensions to
defined contribution (DC) retirement saving plans that are largely controlled by
employees. Just two or three decades ago, employer-provided DB plans were
the primary means of saving for retirement in the United States. But since that
time, 401(k) and other personal retirement accounts have become the principal
form of retirement saving in the private sector. DB plans have remained an
important form of retirement saving for federal employees and for state and local
employees, although even for these employees personal retirement accounts are
becoming increasingly important. More than 80 percent of private retirement
plan contributions in 2000 and 2001 were to 401(k) and other personal accounts.
Contributions to personal retirement plans accounted for only 12 percent of total
contributions to Federal pension plans in 2000, but had increased to 17 percent
by 2004. Thus to understand the effect of demographic trends on the demand
for retirement assets in the coming decades it is important to evaluate the likely
flows into and out of both 401(k) and DB plans.

       In Poterba, Venti, and Wise (2006), we described the rise of 401(k) plans
and the implications of this rise for the flow of assets into and out of 401(k) plans
over the next four decades. In this paper we describe the decline in DB plans
and assess its implications for the flow of assets into and out of DB plans over
the next four decades. We then bring together projections of net pension flows to


`                                        1
both DB and DC plans. Schieber and Shoven (1997) consider the implications of
population aging for private pension fund saving and project saving as a percent
of payrolls. Their projection method differs from ours, and it does not consider the
rising importance of self-directed defined contribution plans.

        There is a substantial and growing literature on the link between
population age structure and returns in financial markets. The U.S. Government
Accountability Office (2006) provides a recent review of related research.
Several studies have used an overlapping-generations framework to explore the
theoretical effects of a transitory increase in the population growth rate, a “baby
boom,” on the equilibrium rate of return. These studies, while based on stylized
models, offer valuable insight on the direction of asset market effects. Other
research has taken a more empirical approach and explored the reduced form
relationship between summary measures of demographic structure and the
returns to investors holding bonds and stocks. The existing findings, illustrated
for example in Brooks (2002), Geanakoplos, Magill, and Quinzii (2004), and
Poterba (2005), span a range of different potential outcomes. Most of the
existing work adopts a closed-economy approach, either studying how a baby
boom in a single economy will affect returns in that economy, or examining the
correlation between a nation’s population structure and financial market returns
in that nation. Recent analyses, however, such as Boersch-Supan, Ludwig, and
Winter (2005) and Krueger and Ludwig (2006), move beyond this setting and
examine how demographic trends affect international capital flows as well as
domestic asset markets.

       Very few studies have used household-level data on asset accumulation
to project future asset demand. This paper on DB plans and our companion
paper on 401(k) plans begin with a disaggregated analysis of current asset flows
in and out of the pension system and use these flows as a base to project
pension assets in future years. These projections are a critical input to assessing
the effect of demographically-induced asset flows on market rates of return.

       This paper is divided into ten sections. In the first, we present a cohort
description of the decline in the participation rate of employed persons in DB
plans over the past two decades. Then we describe a series of analyses that
provide the basis for projections of future assets in DB plans. We begin section
two with a cohort description of the dollar amount of pension benefits received by
persons over age 55, and we develop projections of DB benefits in the future. In
section three, we present a parallel cohort description of the probability of receipt
of DB benefits by persons over the age of 55. In section four we return to the
estimation of DB participation during the working years. While in the first section
we considered DB participation profiles for employed persons, here we consider
analogous profiles for all persons in the population. The estimates obtained in
this section are used to supplement the estimates obtained in section three to
project benefits after retirement for all persons in the population. In section five,
we combine the information described in the previous three sections to develop



`                                         2
projections of the total value of DB benefits in future years. Section six presents
projections of DB pension wealth for cohorts retiring between 1982 and 2040
and, for each cohort, compares DB wealth to projected 401(k) assets from
Poterba, Venti, and Wise (2006). In section seven, we consider projections of
the total value of assets in DB trust funds. Section eight brings together
projections for both DB and 401(k) plans to explore the flow in and out of the
pension system as a whole. It is the change in the assets in DB trust funds
combined with the change in the assets in personal retirement accounts that may
affect the rate of return on the investments of future generations of retirees. In
section nine we discuss what our projections imply for the relative change in
asset demand in the future. Section ten summarizes our findings.

1. Participation of Employees in DB Plans

       DB participation data were obtained form the several waves of the Survey
of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) for the years 1984, 1987, 1991,
1993, 1995, 1998, and 2003. Our analysis here and in subsequent sections is
based on organization of the data by cohort. We sometimes define cohorts by
the age of the cohort in 1984 and sometimes by the year in which the cohort
attains age 65. When referring to the cohort age in 1984, the age is proceeded
by “C.” When referring to the year the cohort attains age 65, the year is
proceeded by “A.” Thus, C65 and A1984 identify the same cohort.

        To project DB participation in the future, or to predict DB participation in
earlier years, we must make projections beyond the range of the observed SIPP
data. The cohorts for which data are observed, and the ages for which data are
observed, are shown in Table 1-1 below. The table also shows the cohorts, and
ages, for which projections are made. Data for all years spanned by the SIPP
surveys are available for cohorts C25 through C45. Data for some of the survey
years are available for cohorts C9 to C24 and for cohorts C46 to C64. The
cohorts for which some SIPP data are available are noted in bold in the table.

        Figure 1-1 shows the data for selected cohorts. It is clear that the DB
participation rate of employed persons declined consistently with successively
younger cohorts. For example, at age 45, the participation rate of those who
attained age 45 in 1984, the C45 cohort, was about 43 percent. But the
participation rate of the C27 cohort, which attained age 45 in 2002, was about 29
percent. Comparisons at other ages show similar differences.

        Not only is there a cohort effect, with younger cohorts having a
successively lower participation rate at all ages, but there is also a within-cohort
decline in the participation rate with age. The within-cohort decline with age for
older cohorts is likely explained in part by retirement. DB plans typically provide
incentives to retire early and DB participants on average retire earlier than
persons without these plans; some participants may retire as early as age 55.
But even for younger cohorts there is typically a within-cohort decline in DB
participation rates with age.

       For, comparison, similar cohort data for 401(k) plans and other personal
retirement plans are shown in Figure 1-2. At age 45, the 401(k) participation rate

of the cohort that attained age 45 in 1984 was only 8 percent. But the
participation rate of the cohort that attained age 45 in 2002 was about 47
percent.

       Figure 1-3 shows DB participation rates for every other cohort. Again, it is
clear that with few exceptions, the data show consistently lower participation
rates with successively younger cohorts.

        Because we rely on the SIPP data, we have compared the SIPP
participation rates by age with rates by age from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The comparisons are shown in Table 2 below. The SIPP data pertain to all
employees age 25 to 64, including persons employed in private sector firms, self-
employed persons, and persons in federal, state, or local government
employment. The BLS data pertain to employees of all ages, but exclude the
self-employed and federal employees. Thus the comparison is imperfect. For the
four years that a direct comparison can be made the data show that the SIPP
estimates are below the BLS estimates as might be expected given the
differences in the coverage of the two series. All three series show the same
downward trend over time.

        The cohort data shown in Figures 1-1 and 1-2 allow comparisons between
the participation rates of some cohorts at a given age—say 45—but these data
alone do not allow comparisons that include very young or very old cohorts who
were not represented in the SIPP data. For example, we can not compare the
participation rates at age 45 of cohorts C55 and C13—marked in Figure 1-1. To
do this we need to project forward the future participation rates of younger
cohorts at older ages and project backwards the participation rates of older
cohorts at younger ages.

       We have made these projections by fitting the cohort data and then using
the estimated parameters to predict outside range of the observed data, while
relying on estimated cohort effects. The detailed estimates are not shown in the
paper but are available on request. The data represented in Figures 1-1 to 1-3
above are based on employed persons. As explained below, we need to develop



`                                      7
estimated based on the percent of all persons who are covered by a DB plan.
These projections are explained in section four.


2. DB Pension Benefits of Recipients and Projections

       We now begin a series of analyses that provide the basis for projections of
future assets in DB plans. We begin in this section with a cohort description of
the dollar amount of DB benefits received by all persons over 55 and then
describe how we project benefit amounts in the future. In section three, we
present a parallel description of the percent of older persons that receives DB
benefits.

        Data on DB benefits received by retirees, like the participation data for
employed persons shown above, are obtained from SIPP waves for the years
1984, 1987, 1991, 1993, 1995, 1998, and 2003. And, as with the participation
data, we first present a cohort description of the observed data. We then fit the
observed data and use the fitted model to project benefits outside the range of
the observed data. Table 2-1 describes the observed data and the cohorts for
which data must be projected. We obtain data on benefits received for persons
aged 55 to 85. Some SIPP data are available for cohorts C36 to C67. Benefits
received for younger cohorts—C-47 to C35—and for older cohorts—C68 to
C102—must be projected. The numerical amounts Table 2-1 show monthly
pension benefits observed in the SIPP. An “X” indicates that a pension benefit
amount is not observed in the SIPP and that the amount must be estimated.
Partial data are available for cohorts C36 to C48. Cohort C36 was age 55 in
2003 and thus SIPP data are available for only one year (2003) for this cohort.
For successively older cohorts through C48, data are available for more years.
Beginning with cohort C55—that was age 55 in 1984—data are available for all
seven years that the SIPP data are available. Complete data are available for all
cohorts through C66, that was age 85 in 2003, the last year of SIPP data. For
cohorts C67 through C85, successively fewer years of data are observed in the
SIPP. Cohort C85 was age 85 in 1984 and thus SIPP data for this cohort are
only available in that year.

       By fitting the observed data on the receipt of benefits, we can interpolate
values for years between the years for which data are available. In addition, the
model used to fit the data can be used to project benefits for cohorts outside of
the range of the observed data. The cohorts and ages for which such projections
must be made are indicated by “X” in Table 2-1. We project benefits received
back to A1947 because members of this cohort attain age 100 in 1982 and may
thus be receiving benefits in the initial year (1982) of our DB asset projections.
We project benefits received forward as far out as 2096 to allow calculation of
employer DB pension liabilities, described below.

       Figure 2-1 shows the actual data for the monthly level of benefits for
selected cohorts. The data are for all persons age 55 to 85 and include persons
who are receiving benefits from federal or state and local retirement programs,
as well as from private sector pensions plans.1 Two features of the data stand
out. One is that benefits of younger cohorts are much greater than benefits of
older cohorts. For example, the benefit at age 60 for the cohort that attained that
age in 1984 was about $600 per month; the benefit for the cohort that attained
age 60 in 2003 was about $1,600 per month (circled in the figure). The other
feature of the data is that within-cohort benefits increase with age. In part this
results from the indexing of benefits from some DB plans, especially federal and
state and local plans. In addition, private employer plans, which are typically not
indexed, sometimes grant cost-of-living increases on an ad hoc basis after
retirement.

  The level of DB benefits received is derived from SIPP data on receipt of
income from the following sources: pension from company or union; Federal
Civil Service or other federal civilian employee pension; U.S. Military retirement
pay; National Guard or reserve Forces retirement; state government pension;
local government pension; U.S. government railroad retirement; veterans
compensation or pension. We have assumed that all monthly income received
from these sources is DB income although it is possible that withdrawals DC
assets may be included.

                           We fit the cohort data on benefits with the following specification:

                           Bac = α a ≤60 A1 + α 60< a ≤65 A2 + α 65< a≤70 A3 + α 70< a≤75 A4 +

                                              c   c



Here, B is the dollar amount of monthly pension benefits and cohorts are defined
by the year the cohort attains age 65--the Cc indicator variable--and the variables
A1 through A5 specify age as piecewise linear with break points at 60, 65, 70 and
75.

        The parameter estimates are presented in Appendix Table 1. We use the
estimated parameters from this specification to project benefits forward for the
younger cohorts and to project benefits backward for the older cohorts. There
are at least two years of observed SIPP data for cohorts as old as A1970
(observed at age 79 in 1984 and age 82 in 1987). There are not enough SIPP
observations to reliably estimate cohort effects for cohorts younger than A2012.
We obtain benefit estimates for cohorts attaining age 65 prior to 1970 by shifting
the A1970 benefit profile by according to the Social Security Administration’s
average wage index. That is, we assume that the pension benefit growth
paralleled wage growth between 1949 and 1970. We only use benefits received
in calendar years 1982 and later. For cohort A1970, for example, we use


`                                                                     11
estimates beginning at age 77, in 1982. We use the wage index to estimate
cohort effects for cohorts that retired before 1970, but we only project for older
ages (after 1982) for each cohort.

       The more important projections are for cohorts younger than the A2012
cohort. Which specific extrapolation to use, however, is open to question. The
following figures show some of the relevant data. Figure 2-2 shows the
estimated cohort effects for cohorts A1982 to A2012. An exponential fit over all
of the cohort effects—with an R2 value of 0.99--suggests that on average
benefits increase by 4.5 percent with each successively younger cohort. But the
figure also shows that the rate of change in the cohort effects may have declined
over time. The estimated rate of change was only 2.94 percent for the A2003 to
A2012 cohorts. (The cohort effects for these years are circled in Figure 2-2.)

       Figure 2-3 shows a different view of the data, beginning with the change in
the estimated cohort effects from one cohort to the next younger cohort. It is
clear that the percent changes vary substantially from one cohort to the next.
The figure also shows the four-year moving average of these changes. It is clear
from the moving average that the average change from one cohort to the next
younger cohort was close to 5 percent over most of the period but declined to
close to 1 percent around 2006. The figure also shows the Social Security
average wage index over the years 1982 to 2003. These data suggest a
noticeable correspondence between the four-year moving average of the change
in the estimated cohort effects and the wage index. After 2003, the SSA
assumes a wage increase of 3.9 percent annually. On average the change in the
cohort effects was only about 2.9 percent over these years.

benefit profiles for selected cohorts, including projected profiles for cohorts
A2013 to A2050 (dashed lines in the figure) and the fitted cohort profiles for
cohorts A1974 to A2012 (solid lines). Profiles for cohorts older than A1974 are
not shown (these cohorts are relatively unimportant because our projection of DB
assets begins in 1982). All profiles are in year 2000 dollars. The benefit model
parameter estimates show that cohort age profiles in current dollars are slightly
upward sloping, perhaps due to the indexing of government pensions and ad hoc
cost of living increases for other pension benefits. The age profiles in 2000
dollars in the figure slope downward, however.

3. Receipt of DB Pension Benefits

       In the previous section, we discussed the dollar amount of the DB benefits
of persons who received DB benefits at each age. To obtain an estimate of the
total dollar amount of DB benefits, we need also to determine the proportion of
persons who receive benefits at each age. We now consider the probability of
benefit receipt.

       We begin with cohort data on the percentage of persons receiving DB
benefits at each age. Figure 3-1 shows data for selected cohorts (essentially
every other cohort). Two features of the data are evident. First, the cohort
effects are rather small, with the exception of the older cohorts. In other words,
the profile of benefit receipt by age is about the same for all the cohorts


`                                                                                          14
represented in the SIPP data (with the exception of the oldest cohorts). For
example, among cohorts observed at age 70, the probability of receipt of benefits
ranges from about 45 percent for the youngest cohort to 49 percent for the oldest
cohort. Second, the age at which the maximum percent of persons receive
benefits is about 70.

       To project benefit receipt for future (younger) cohorts that are not
observed in the SIPP data we assume the age-benefit-receipt profile shown in
Figure 3-1 continues to apply. However, we allow this profile to shift (downward)
for younger cohorts. We first estimate age and cohort effects for cohorts
observed in the SIPP. Then we predict benefits for younger cohorts, assuming
that--except for the cohort effects--the age-benefit-receipt profile is the same for
younger cohorts as it has been for older cohorts observed in the SIPP.

       We fit the benefit receipt data using a probit model and a piecewise linear
specification for age like the one presented above. The sample consists of the
same persons age 55 to 85 used in the previous section to estimate the level of
benefits. The specification is

               Rac = α a ≤60 A1 + α 60< a ≤65 A2 + α 65< a ≤70 A3 + α 70< a ≤75 A4 +
                     α 75< a A5 +

where R is the receipt of benefits and cohorts are defined by the age the cohort
attains age 65. The estimated cohort effects are shown in Appendix Table 2.
Figure 3-2 shows that the estimated cohort effects are essentially unchanged for
cohorts that attained age 65 between 1982 and 2003. The cohort effects were
smaller but increasing for cohorts that attained age 65 between 1969 and 1981.
The larger cohort effects for cohorts that attained age 65 in 2004 and later years
are based on very few SIPP observations and pertain only to persons who were
receiving benefits at young ages. For example, data for the A2004 cohort are
only observed through age 64 and for the A2012 cohort only for age 56.

        Because we cannot reliably estimate cohort effects for cohorts younger
that A2003, we assume that the benefit receipt rates of successively younger
cohorts follow the same pattern as the DB participation rates of these same
cohorts when they were in the labor force. The assumption is that if fewer
persons in a particular cohort participated when young, then fewer persons will
receive benefits after retirement. We do this by first calculating the maximum
DB participation rate over ages 25-64 for each cohort. We use this maximum
rate to predict benefit receipt when the cohort is retired. We use cohort-to-cohort
changes in the maximum DB participation rate, and the 2003 fitted age-benefit
receipt profile, to project benefit receipt for cohorts A2004 through A2060.
Before presenting these projections, we describe the population-based DB
participation rates that are required to make the calculations.

4. Population-Based DB Participation Rates

        The previous two sections have developed projections for the level of
benefits (conditional on receipt) and for the probability of receiving DB benefits
after retirement. As noted above, the probability of receiving benefits cannot
reliably be estimated for cohorts retiring after 2003 using the SIPP data. These
cohorts are not observed after age 55 in the data. However, these same cohorts
are observed at younger ages when they are in the labor force. We infer the
probability of benefit receipt after retirement from the DB participation rates of
these cohorts when they were in the labor force. This section develops
estimates of DB participation that are closely related to those presented in
section one for employed persons. Here we consider the participation rate of all
persons in the population because we will use our estimates to infer benefit
receipt for all retirees (not just those who were employed).

        The employment-based participation rates and the population-based rates
can differ substantially. To see this, note that the percent of population that
participates in a DB plan at age a is given by

        DB   E 
            =   Pr[ DBa | Ea ]
        P a  P a

where E is employment and P is population and a denotes age. Table 4-1
shows the probability that a person has a DB plan given that the person is
employed and the employment to population ratio for each year of SIPP data
availabile between 1984 and 2003. These data show that the last
term, Pr [ DBa | Ea ] , has declined between 1984 and 2003, but the fraction of the
                     E
population employed   increased between 1984 and 1998 but fell in 2003.2
                      P a
The percentage of employed persons participating in a DB plan declined from
39.4 percent to 29.7 percent over this period.

 The employment to population ratio for persons 16 and over reported by the
BLS shows an increase from 59.5% in 1984 to 64.1% in 1998 and then a drop to
62.3% in 2003. The SIPP data we use are for ages 25 to 64.

The overall effect of these trends is that cohort effects are smaller when all
persons are used as the base than when employed persons are used as the
base. This can be seen by comparing Figure 1-1 with Figure 4-1, which are
shown together just below. For example, at age 45 the difference in the
participation rates of cohorts 27 and 45 is about 13 percentage points based on
those employed but only about 10 percentage points based on all persons.

      As with the participation based on employed persons, we fit the
population-based participation data using a probit model with this specification:

       DB( Pop ) ac = α a ≤30 A1 + α 30< a ≤35 A2 + α 35< a ≤ 40 A3 + α 40< a ≤ 45 A4 +
                        α 45<a ≤50 A5 + α 50< a ≤55 A6 + α 55< a≤60 A7 + α 60< a A8 +
                         c = 65

                         ∑c C
                         c =9
                                  c   c




The estimated cohort effects from this specification (defined here by age in 1984)
are shown in Figure 4-2, while the complete estimation results are shown in
Appendix Table 3.

        Selected fitted cohort profiles together with the corresponding cohort data
are shown in Figure 4-3. We judge that the fitted profiles represent the data quite
well. We then use the model estimates to predict population-based participation
rates at all ages (25 to 64) for each of the cohorts for which we are able to
estimate cohort effects. These predictions are shown (as solid lines) in Figure 4-4
for selected cohorts. We predict at all ages for each cohort because we want to
determine the age at which the participation rate is at a maximum for each of the
cohorts. The use of this calculation is explained below. Predicting at older ages
for the younger cohorts suggests that by the time these cohorts reach retirement
age, their participation in DB plans will be very low. For example, based on


`                                                       18
these predictions the DB participation rate of persons in the C11 cohort will be
only 8.8 percent when that cohort attains age 55 (cohort C11 attains age 65 in
2038).

       The youngest cohort in the SIPP data is A2040. For later use we will need
cohorts as young as A2050. Figure 4-2 shows that the decline in the estimated
cohort effects, with successively younger cohorts, is close to linear—at -0.017
per cohort. Thus, we extrapolate the estimated cohort effects linearly to project
the effects for younger cohorts. This extrapolation yields profiles for the younger
cohorts shown as dashed lines in Figure 4-4.

       All of the projections we make are subject to substantial uncertainty.
These projection in particular raise the prospect that the past trend may not be a
good predictor of the future trend. For example, several large companies have
recently announced that traditional DB pension plans would be phased out.
Other companies could follow this lead more rapidly than our projections
suggest. This would lead to a faster-than-projected decline in DB assets.

5. Projected Benefits Paid

        To develop projections of the total value of benefits paid by DB plans, we
combine estimates of the level of benefits in section two with estimates of the
probability of benefit receipt in section three. To help to forecast benefit receipt
for younger cohorts (retiring after 2003), we use estimates of DB participation of
these younger cohorts during their working ages. In particular, we use the
population-based estimates of DB participation by cohort discussed in section
four to predict pension receipt after retirement. The necessary data is set out in
Table 5-1. We first use the estimates of probability of benefit receipt for cohorts
A1982 to A2003 to predict the percent of each of these cohorts that receives


`                                                                             21
benefits at age 70 (recall from Figure 3-1 that age 70 is the age at which the
maximum percent of persons receive benefits) . As discussed in section three,
for these cohorts there are a sufficient number of SIPP observations to obtain
reasonably reliable estimates of benefit receipt. These probabilities are shown in
column (3) of Table 5-1. The probabilities are also graphed in Figure 5-1 for the
years 1982 through 2003.

        We next need to project benefits at age 70 for younger cohorts (A2004 to
A2040). To make these projections, we use the population-based DB
participation rates, discussed in section four. From these data, we have
calculated the maximum participation rates, over ages 25 to 64, for each cohort.
These estimates are shown in column (5) of Table 5-1. We use the maximum
participation rate during working years to predict the probability of benefit receipt
at age 70 for cohorts A2004 and younger. We assume that the year-to-year
percent change in the probability of receipt of benefits at age 70 is the same as
the year-to-year percent change in the maximum DB participation rate. Thus, for
example, the last cohort for which the receipt probability is observed is A2003
(47.3%). We project the 2004 receipt probability by assuming it declines by the
same percentage amount as the maximum participation probability (from 38.6%
for A2003 to 37.7% in 2004). The prediction for 2004, 46.2% (shown in column
4) is 47.3% x (37.7%/38.6%). The same calculations are continued to project the
probability of receiving benefits at age 70 for cohorts A2004 through A2040. For
cohorts younger than A2040 (not shown in the table) a two percent decline is
assumed. This is an extrapolation of the decline for the cohorts A2031 to A2040.

6. Present Value of DB benefits at 65

        We have projected the average level of the DB benefits of recipients, by
age and cohort, Bac , for cohorts attaining age 65 in the years 1982 through 2050.
We have also projected the probability of benefit receipt for each age and cohort.
First, we obtain for each cohort the average present value of benefits at age 65
for persons who receive DB benefits, given by:

                                              100
                                                  a      
(1)             PV (recipients )c ,65   = ∑ ∏ St ,c   Ba ,c /(1 + r )( a −65) 
                                          a = 65  t = 65 

where St ,c is the cohort-specific probability of survival to age t conditional on
being alive at t-1, and r is the discount rate. Second, we calculate the present
value of DB benefits at age 65 for all cohort members, both those with and those
without a DB plan. The expected average benefit received by all persons of age
a in cohort c is Bac = Pr[benefit receipt ] [benefitsac | benefit receipt ] = Bac Pac . Thus the
present value of benefits averaged over all persons is given by:

(2)
                                        100
                                              a      
        PV (all persons )c ,65      = ∑ ∏ St ,c   Ba ,c ⋅ Pac /(1 + r )( a −65) 
                                      a = 65  t = 65 
       Figure 6-1 graphs both of these present value calculations. The present
value amounts have been converted to constant year 2000 dollars. A real
discount rate of 3 percent and average SSA age-specific survival probabilities
are assumed. For these calculations pension benefits received prior to age 65
have been ignored. The top profile shows that the average present value of DB
benefits for persons that receive DB benefits will be greater for cohorts retiring in
the future than for cohorts retiring today. This is because we assume that
nominal benefits increase by 3.9 percent annually and the inflation rate is 2.8
percent. However, the lower profile shows that the PV of DB wealth, averaged
across all persons, will decline in the future as fewer persons participate. Indeed,
these projections show DB wealth peaking in 2003 at about $73,000 and falling
to about $50,000 by 2020.3

 These estimates indicate that in 2000 the average of DB benefits over all
persons was $67,386. Based on HRS data, Johnson, Burman and Kobes
(2004), estimate that the mean present value of employer sponsored pension
income for persons 65 to 69 in 2000 was $50,203. Our estimate should be larger
than theirs because we include persons of all ages. In particular, average
benefits increase with age because death rates selectively leave in the sample

       For comparison, we show the average present value of 401(k) assets at
age 65, reported in Poterba, Venti and Wise (2006).4 The comparison between
the average present value of DB benefits at age 65 and average 401(k) assets at
age 65 is graphed in Figures 6-2a and 6-2b for all persons. The comparisons in
Figures 6-3a and 6-3b pertain to persons with plans. Figures 6-2a and 6-3a
show 401(k) assets at retirement assuming that the return on equities in the
future will be equal to the historical average. Figures 6-2b and 6-3b show 401(k)
assets assuming that the return on equities in the future will be 300 basis points
less than historical average return.



persons with higher benefits, and because of ad hoc cost of living increases and
indexed benefits in many government plans.

  These projections use actual annual pre-tax returns through 2005. Beginning in
2006 we assume that the average annual nominal return on equities is 12
percent and that the average nominal return on corporate bonds is 6 percent.
Ibbotson Associates (2006) reports that the historical arithmetic mean of pretax
returns on long-term corporate bonds has been 6.2 percent per year, while large-
capitalization stocks have returned an average of 12.3 percent over the period
1926-2005. These returns are the pretax total return available on a portfolio with
no management fees. We have not as yet accounted for asset management
fees.

        Assuming historical rates of return, Figure 6-2a shows that average 401(k)
assets of all persons reach the average PV of DB benefits of all persons in 2010
when both are about $67,000. Thereafter assets in 401(k) accounts continue to
grow, reaching about $137,000 in 2020, $226,000 in 2030, and $452,000 in
2040. Assuming historical rates of return less 300 basis points, average 401(k)
assets reach the average PV of DB benefits of all persons in 2011 when both are
about $66,000. Thereafter assets in 401(k) accounts continue to grow, reaching
about $104,000 in 2020, $149,000 in 2030, and $269,000 in 2040. The lower
rate of return on equities substantially reduces the accumulation of assets in
401(k) plans. Even with the lower rate of return on equities, however, by 2040
the accumulation of assets in 401(k) plans would be 3.7 times as large as the
historical maximum level of assets (“fully funded”) in DB plans, which was
realized in 2003.

       Figure 6-3a shows the present value of DB benefits for persons who have
a DB plan and the 401(k) assets for persons who have a 401(k) plan, assuming
the average historical equity return. For these persons, balances in 401(k)
accounts reach the PV of DB benefits in 2011, when both are about $148,000.
Thereafter the 401(k) assets continue to grow, reaching about $243, 000 in 2020,
$363,000 in 2030, and $580,000 in 2040. For persons with DB plans the
average present value of benefits also continues to grow, reaching $187,000 by
2040. By 2040, the accumulation of 401(k) assets is about 3 times the PV of DB
assets. Figure 6-3b shows 401(k) assets assuming that the rate of return on
equities is 300 basis points lower than the historical average. Here the assets of
persons with 401(k) accounts reach the level of the PV of DB benefits for
persons who receive benefits in 2014, when both are about $145,000.
Thereafter the 401(k) assets continue to grow, reaching about $185, 000 in 2020,
$241,000 in 2030, and $345,000 in 2040. For persons with DB plans the
average present value of benefits also continues to grow, reaching $187,000 by
2040. Thus for persons with plans, by 2040 the accumulation in 401(k) plans is
about 1.8 times the PV of DB assets at 65.

        Our 401(k) asset projections do not account for legislated increases in the
contribution limits between 2003 and 2007. The limit increases are large for all
income groups, with the largest increases for persons with incomes between
$15,000 and $20,000. Only a small proportion of persons are currently
contributing at the maximum. However, as incomes increase a larger and larger
fraction of employees are likely to be contributing at the new limits. For this
reason, it is likely that future contributions to 401(k) plans will be greater than our
assumptions (projections) suggest. In addition, we have not accounted for the
effects of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, which gives employers latitude to
set more "saving friendly" defaults in 401(k) plans. Beshears, Choi, Laibson, and
Madrian (2006) survey some of the recent evidence on how changing defaults for
enrollment, contribution rates, and asset allocations can significantly increase
retirement saving.

7. Assets in DB Trust Funds and Total DB Benefits Paid

       Finally, we want to estimate the level of total assets in DB trust funds.
These estimates are likely to be particularly important for assessing future
changes in the demand for financial assets. We made similar calculations with
respect to 401(k) and other personal retirement account assets in Poterba, Venti,
and Wise (2006). We believe the DB component, together with the “401(k)”
component, represent a substantial fraction of the demography-induced change
in asset demand.

         There are at least two general ways to predict future assets in DB plans.
One way is to predict total benefits paid in future years and then to suppose that
assets in a year are sufficient to pay the present value of these future obligations.
We take this approach here. We believe, however, that this approach should
yield “fully-funded” current assets that are greater than actual assets. A second
way is to predict future assets based on an extrapolation of current assets
compared to “fully-funded” liabilities. A possible extrapolation procedure, for
example, is to assume that assets will continue to be a given percent below the
“fully-funded” level. We have not pursued this approach here.

        To obtain the present value of future obligations we must first calculate
total DB benefits paid each year. As described above, we have projected the
average level of DB benefits of recipients by age and cohort (or, alternatively, by
age and calendar year). We have also projected the conditional probability of
receiving benefits for each age and year. We now combine these projections
with demographic projections obtained from the Social Security Administration to
obtain total DB benefits paid in each year. More precisely, we calculate the total
dollar value of DB benefits paid to all persons in year t as:




`                                         30
                                                                  100

(3)                                                    DBt =      ∑N
                                                                  a =55
                                                                             P Ba ,t
                                                                          a ,t a ,t



Where N a ,t is the number of persons age a in year t, Pa ,t is the probability that
benefits are received by a person age a in year t, and Ba ,t is the average benefit
received (conditional on benefit receipt) by a person of age a in year t.

        Figure 7-1, shows these totals for the years 1982 to 2004, together with a
constructed series that sums together private sector DB benefits, benefits paid to
federal employees, and benefits paid to state and local employees. The private
sector data are from the form 5500 data and exclude benefits paid directly by
insurance carriers. Federal DB benefits include payments made by the Civil
Service Retirement System, the Federal Employees Retirement System, and the
Military Service Retirement System. DB and DC benefits are not reported
separately for state and local plan. The data used here include DC as well as DB
benefits. Thus our projected DB benefits should be somewhat greater than sum
of these reported government and private sector benefits.

       The projected totals are close to the constructed totals in the early years
but are smaller than the constructed totals in the later years. The discrepancy is
due in part at least to the growing importance of 401(k)-like accounts in the state
and local government plans. Thus we believe that the comparison lends

credence to our estimates, based on SIPP data, for these years. Our forward
projections depend on the assumptions we have made to project benefit levels
and benefit receipt for future cohorts not represented in the SIPP data.

       Our projected estimates of total DB benefits in future years are shown in
Figure 7-2 below, in year 2000 dollars. Total benefits paid from DB plans
continue to increase until 2027. The profile turns down eventually because the
probability that benefits are received (at age 70) reaches a maximum with the
cohort that attains age 65 in 2007, although this cohort continues to receive
benefits after 2007. From a peak of $435,000 in 2027, the real value of total
benefits paid declines modestly to $392,000 by 2040. As noted in Figures 6-2
and 6-3, the real level of benefits increases through the end of the projection
period, so the decline in total benefits in Figure 7-2 is driven by the decline in the
probability of benefit receipt.

       For comparison, projected benefits paid from DB plans are graphed

equities is assumed to be the average historical rate less 300 basis points, the
benefits from DB plans exceed withdrawals of 401(k) assets until 2034.

          We use our projections of benefits to be paid from DB plans to help to
project future assets in DB trust funds. Suppose that in each year assets held by
DB plan sponsors were equal to the present value of future obligations. If future
liabilities are discounted at 3 percent and firms have a twenty year planning
horizon, the present value of liabilities each year is shown in Figure 7-4. The
figure also shows two series representing reported total assets in DB plans. The
first is from the Flow of Funds accounts that include private sector DB plans and
the value of assets in DB and DC plans for government sponsors. The second
series is composed of private sector DB assets from Form 5500 reports, federal
DB assets from various federal agency annual reports, and the sum of DB and
DC assets for state and local governments from the Census Bureau's series on
State and local Government Retirement Systems. Actual assets, for the years
they are available, are substantially below our calculation of the present value of
liabilities in all years, with the possible exception of 1999. But the gap between
actual assets and “fully-funded” assets declined between 1985 and 1999. During
this period, contributions to DB plans sometimes exceeded and sometimes fell
short of the change in the present value of liabilities, as shown in Figure 7-5.

       It is perhaps not surprising that actual assets are less than our estimates
of the assets employers would have to hold to fully fund projected liabilities.

Private sector plan sponsors have substantial latitude in the assumption of
interest rates, investment returns, when benefits will be paid, and other features
that determine funding levels.6 The former Director of the PBGC, Bradley Belt
(2005), estimated that private DB plans were under-funded by $450 billion in
2004. There are even fewer restrictions on the funding of federal, state, and
local plans and many are thought to be substantially under-funded.

        Our “fully-funded” method yields assets that are well above actual assets
in DB plans, at least in recent years. We know of no way to confidently predict
future funding levels, however. Thus we have projected future assets levels
according to the “fully-funded” method described above.

8. DB and “401(k)” Assets Combined

        What will be the change in asset levels for all pension plans--DB and
401(k) plans combined--in future years? The evolution of total assets depends
on three components: contributions, withdrawals, and the internal build-up. In
our prior work we projected assets held in 401(k) plans. These 401(k) assets,
DB plan liabilities (“fully-funded” DB assets) and the sum of both series are
shown in Figure 8-1a and 8-1b, assuming historical equity returns and historical
returns minus 300 basis points respectively. If equities in 401(k) plans earn the
historical return, then 401(k) asset balances overtake DB balances in 2009. If
equities earn 300 basis points less than the historical average then 401(k) assets
first exceed DB assets in 2010.

        We also consider total “contributions” to DB and 401(k) plans and total
withdrawals from DB and 401(k) plans. Figure 8-2 shows contributions to 401(k)
plans, the annual change in DB liabilities (a rough measure of contributions to a
fully funded DB plan) and the sum of these “contributions.” The sum is relatively
flat between 2000 and 2040. In contrast, the sum of benefits paid grows rapidly
through 2040, especially if historical equity rates of return are assumed.
Withdrawals from 401(k) plans, DB benefits paid, and the sum of the two are
shown in Figure 8-3a using historical equity returns and Figure 8-3b using the
historical return less 300 basis points.

       Figure 8-4 shows the total projected contributions to and withdrawals from
DB and 401(k) plans combined. Withdrawals assuming historical equity rates of
return and withdrawals assuming the historical return minus 300 basis points are
shown in the figure. Withdrawals exceed contributions after 2020 and 2021 for
these two withdrawal series respectively. Figure 8-5 shows the combined
withdrawals minus contributions. Again, withdrawals exceed contributions after
2020 if historical equity rates of return are assumed and after 2022 if historical
rates minus 300 basis points are assumed. The excess of withdrawals over

contributions reaches about $872 billion by 2040 (in year 2000 dollars) when
historical rates of return are assumed but only about $353 billion if historical rates
minus 300 basis points are assumed. Because of internal buildup however,
under either equity return scenario total assets in pension plans continue to grow
through 2040. This is shown in Figures 8-1a and 8-1b.7

 Schieber and Shoven ( 1997) consider the implications of population aging for
private pension fund saving and project saving as a percent of payrolls. Their
projection method is very different from ours and it does not focus on the rising
importance of self-directed defined contribution plans in the way that ours does.
Nevertheless, their results are qualitatively similar to ours. They project that total
private pension withdrawals will exceed contributions beginning in 2024,
reversing the pattern of earlier years.

9. Demographically-Sensitive Assets and Rates of Return

       Whether demographically-induced changes in DB and DC assets will have
an appreciable effect on the rates of return on equities and other financial assets
depends on the magnitude of these changes relative to the other components of
asset demand. Other changes in asset demand may reinforce or counterbalance
them. Since asset markets are global, domestic demand for financial assets is
not the only force determining the returns on stocks and bonds in the United
States. Several recent studies have explored how demographic change in the
currently developed world will affect global asset demand. Our estimates of the
future demand for pension assets in the United States, if replicated in other
countries, could be an important input to such studies. Whether international
capital flows will reinforce or moderate the demographic pressures on asset
returns that may arise from changes in the population age structure in the United
States depends critically on the future rate of development of currently-young
economies and on the age structure of other developed nations.

        When evaluating how demographic change affects the demand for
financial assets in general, and specifically corporate equities, one must
remember that a large fraction of financial assets are owned by a small fraction
of the population. This group of high net worth investors is likely to be less
sensitive to age-related changes in asset demand than other investors who have
lifecycle motives for saving. Kennickel (2006) reports that in the 2004 Survey of
Consumer Finances, the wealthiest 5 percent of households owned 65.6 percent


`                                                                            40
of equities, including mutual funds, and 79.1 percent of equities excluding mutual
funds. Pension assets represent a smaller share of the assets of this group than
of other less-affluent sectors of the population.

        Retirement plan assets are one of the most, if not the most,
demographically-sensitive components of the household financial balance sheet.
There are clear demographic effects on assets in DB plans, which are typically
paid out as benefit annuities at the time of retirement. The link between
demographic structure and 401(k) plan assets is less mechanical, since older
households have discretion over the rate at which they draw down assets in
retirement. There is uncertainty both about the date at which withdrawals will
begin and the rate of such withdrawals once they start. At present many 401(k)
participants do not begin to make withdrawals until they are required to do so at
age 70½. In the future, the average age of first withdrawal is likely to increase
even for those who do not wait until 70½ to begin withdrawals, since the average
age of retirement is likely to rise. This is likely to result both from the increase in
the normal Social Security retirement age from 65 to 67 by 2027, and from the
conversion from DB plans, with strong incentives to leave the labor force early, to
personal retirement accounts without these incentives. Longer working lives will
probably delay withdrawals from personal retirement accounts and increase the
accumulation of retirement assets.

        For households that are constrained by the mandatory withdrawal
requirements from personal retirement accounts, withdrawals of DC plan assets
are likely to overstate the decline in asset demand at older ages. There is no
requirement that households consume their minimum distributions, and
households that would prefer not to make any withdrawals from their 401(k)
plans or IRAs may simply reinvest the mandatory payouts in other investment
options. It is possible that such households will bequeath a substantial portion of
their tax-deferred assets to their heirs, who may continue to accumulate assets in
a tax-deferred setting for many years. Recent legislation has facilitated such
transfers of personal retirement account assets. While this consideration
suggests that 401(k) assets may remain substantial even for households at very
advanced ages, it is also possible that the financial burden of health care in
retirement will be greater for future retirees than for past cohorts, and that this will
necessitate greater expenditures during retirement. If the cost of health care
continues to increase, future retirees are likely to spend more on health care than
current retirees. This could affect not only the accumulation of retirement assets,
but could accelerate withdrawals from retirement accounts as well.

       The many uncertainties that arise in trying to link one source of asset
demand to equilibrium rates of return make us reluctant to attempt to quantify the
impact of demographically-induced changes in retirement asset accumulation on
prospective stock or bond returns. There is also a fundamental circularity in this
question. Our projections of future DC assets are based on assumptions about
the rate of return that plan assets will earn in the next few decades. This

underscores the importance of considering the sensitivity of future retirement
asset projections to rate of return assumptions. This concern notwithstanding,


`                                                 42
we have developed one metric to provide some indication of the quantitative
importance of the demographically-induced changes in retirement asset demand.
        Figure 9-1 shows our projected demand for all pension plan assets,
including both bonds and equities, as a percentage of the Social Security
Administration intermediate GDP projection. The figure shows that pension
assets grow from 50 percent of GDP in 1985 to 100 percent in 2010 to 179
percent in 2040. If the return on equity is 300 basis points lower than the
historical return then total pension assets grow to about 120 percent of GDP by
2040. Both of these projections suggest a very substantial increase retirement
saving over the coming decades.

       Figure 9-2 shows the projected demand for corporate equity in both DB
and DC plans as a percentage of the Social Security Administration intermediate
GDP projection: one based on the historical equity rate of return and the other
based on the historical return less 300 basis points.8 Historically, pension
equities grew from about 30 percent of GDP in 1985 to about 55 percent in 2005.
Our projections suggest continued growth between now and 2040, to 142
percent of GDP when the projection is based on the historical equity return and
84 percent of GDP when the assumed rate of return is the historical value minus
300 basis points. The shape of the projected growth path is also affected by the
different rate of return assumptions. For example, the one year growth rate of
pension assets between 2039 and 2040 is 1.0 percent in the former case and -
0.2 percent when we assume the lower equity return. The figure shows that
even when we make the lower rate of return assumption, the stock of pension
assets continues to increase for the next three decades, even relative to the
aggregate economy. The projections do not suggest a sharp decline in pension
assets, either in absolute dollars or relative to GDP, when the baby boom cohort
reaches retirement age. If low returns depress the growth of 401(k) assets,
however, there may be some years in which total retirement assets as a share of
GDP are stable or decline slightly.


10. Summary

        A key component to any effort to analyze how demographic trends may
affect future returns on financial assets is a careful analysis of how these trends
will affect assets in defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans. This
paper on DB pension plan assets and our earlier companion paper on 401(k)
assets explore this issue. The dramatic decline in DB participation in the past
three decades stands in contrast to the rapid expansion of 401(k)-like plans. We
develop projections of the DB benefits of cohorts retiring between now and 2040
and use them to project the total assets held in DB plans through 2040. The

  The equity share is based on projected accumulated equity assets, which
depends on the assumed rate of return on equities. We assume no rebalancing
in 401(k) plans.


`                                       43
projections are based on extrapolation of cohort data from many waves of the
SIPP along with demographic projections from the Social Security Administration.

        We project the present value of DB benefits at age 65 for cohorts who
reach age 65 in each year from 1982 to 2040, and we compare these projections
to projections of 401(k) assets. Our projections suggest that the average (over
all persons) of the present value of real DB benefits at age 65 attained an
historical maximum in 2003, when the value was $72,637. Our projections also
suggest that the average value of 401(k) assets at age 65 surpasses the average
present value of DB benefits at age 65 in about 2010. Thereafter the value of
401(k) assets grows rapidly, attaining levels much greater than the maximum
present value of DB benefits. If equity returns between 2006 and 2040 are
comparable to those observed historically, by 2040 average projected 401(k)
assets will be over six times larger than the historical maximum level of DB
benefits at age 65, attained in 2003. Even if equity returns average 300 basis
points below their historical value, we project that average 401(k) assets in 2040
would be 3.7 times as large as the value of DB benefits in 2003.

       The projected growth of real 401(k) assets more then offsets the projected
decline in real DB plan assets during the next three decades. Focusing on DB
assets alone suggests that an aging population, in conjunction with a shift away
from DB plans, will lead to a decline in the real value of pension assets averaged
across all retirees in future cohorts. When we combine projected 401(k) assets
with projected DB assets, however, we find that real pension assets not only
increase, but increase substantially, in future decades.

        Our findings underscore the need for further analysis of the factors that
determine the diffusion of 401(k) plans across corporations, especially small
companies with low-wage workers, as well as the contribution behavior and
withdrawal behavior of 401(k) participants. The growing role of 401(k)-type plans
in the retirement landscape suggests that understanding asset accumulation and
draw-down in these plans is a critical component of any analysis of the effect of
demographic change on financial markets.
