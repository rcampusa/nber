We look at the supply side of the credit card market to analyze the pricing and marketing
strategies of credit card offers. First, we show that card issuers target less-educated customers
with more steeply back-loaded fees (e.g., lower introductory APRs but higher late and over-limit
fees) compared offers made to educated customers. Second, issuers use rewards programs to
screen for unobservable borrower types. Conditional on the same borrower type, cards with
rewards, such as low introductory APR programs, also have more steeply backloaded fees. In
contrast, cards with mileage programs, which are offered mainly to the most-educated consumers,
rely much less on back-loaded fees. Finally, using shocks to the credit risk of customers via
increases in state-level unemployment insurance, we show that card issuers rely more heavily on
back-loaded and hidden fees when customers are less exposed to negative cash flow shocks.
These findings are in line with the recent behavioral contract theory literature.

      Over the last three decades, the US has experienced a rapid expansion of retail financial

products, especially among middle- and lower-income households. At the same time, the

heterogeneity and complexity of the products and the terms that are offered to consumers

increased dramatically; see, for example, Merton (1992), Miller (1993), or Tufano (2003).

Recent papers by Phillipon (2012) and Greenwood and Scharfstein (2013) suggest that

these emerging trends were accompanied by increased rents for intermediaries in the

financial industry. Many policy makers are concerned that these rents come at the expense

of consumers, particularly if less financially sophisticated consumers are targeted with

especially onerous or hidden fees. For a summary of the policy implications of consumers

that are not fully rational, see Thaler and Sunstein (2008) or Campbell et al (2011).

      In this paper, we aim to establish whether and how financial institutions take the

sophistication of their customers into account by examining the US credit card industry.

We document three main findings: First, credit card terms that are offered to more

financially sophisticated consumers differ significantly from those offered to

unsophisticated customers, where sophistication is measured as educational attainment,
                                                                                 1
holding other observable household characteristics constant.                         Less-sophisticated

households are much more likely to be offered back-loaded or hidden fee structures, such

as low introductory (or teaser) rates. However, after the introductory period, these cards

have higher rates, late fees and over-limit fees. In contrast, cards that are offered to



!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1 !We will discuss these findings in the context of behavioral contract theory models in which a lack of
financial literacy is often modeled as the inability to understand contract terms, e.g., Gabaix and Laibson
(2007), or to forecast one’s own demand for credit, e.g., Heidhues and Koszegi (2010) or Grubb (2010). !
sophisticated customers rely much less on back-loaded fees and instead have higher upfront

fees, such as annual fees. We also show that the worse the credit terms, the more likely

they are to appear either in small font or on the last pages of the offer letter. Similarly, offer

letters with back-loaded terms contain more photos and less text.

    Second, we find that even when holding constant the observable characteristics of

customers, card issuers attempt to screen households based on unobservable characteristics

by offering a menu of cards with varying degrees of back-loaded fees and different rewards

programs. Cards with rewards programs that appeal to less-sophisticated consumers also

have more back-loaded terms. While cards with miles programs that appeal mainly to

sophisticated consumers have more front-loaded fees.

    This explicit targeting of less-sophisticated households with more back-loaded or

shrouded credit terms is concerning because a number of prior studies on the demand side

of the credit card industry have shown that credit card users suffer when they choose these

contracts. For example, Agarwal et al (2008) and (2015) show that, on average, households

that choose cards with back-loaded terms are subject to higher fees and carry higher

balances. In light of this evidence, our results suggest that less-sophisticated consumers are

more likely to bear the costs of increased credit term complexity.

    Third, we document an important trade-off between borrower sophistication and credit

risk that has not been previously explored in the literature. A lending strategy that selects

for less-sophisticated customers via back-loaded or shrouded attributes might increase

rents from these consumers over the short run, but it might also expose the lender to higher

credit risk over the long run if these customers do not understand the true cost of credit.

We find that banks proactively increase their reliance on back-loaded terms when the credit
risk of consumers decreases. Using a difference-in-difference estimator, we show that

when states increase unemployment insurance (UI), which protects and stabilizes

households’ cash flows on the downside, banks increase their use of back-loaded fees and

introductory APR (teaser) offers.

      The credit card industry is an ideal environment in which to analyze how financial

institutions target more (or less) sophisticated consumer groups because the majority of

credit cards are sold via pre-approved credit card solicitations sent by mail.2 This means

that the same information that customers receive is observable to the researcher once we

obtain the card solicitations . 3 We use detailed information from Compremedia on the

almost one million individual credit card offers that were sent to a set of representative

households in the US between 1999 and 2011. 4 Compremedia selects the sample of

households to mirror the information credit card issuers observe when targeting customers.

These data allows us to observe the supply side of the credit card market, i.e., the types of

offers that customers receive. Using complete PDF versions of the actual offer letters, we

created algorithms to extract the card information and features of the offer. We classify the

“hard” information in the offers such as the APRs, fees, and reward programs. However,

we also observe what we call the “soft” features of the offers, for example, the use of




!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2
  During our sample period, the majority of applications were solicited via mailers. Only in the last five years
have online applications become predominant. Therefore, we focus on the period before 2008. We repeated
the analyses using data up to Jan 2016, and the results are qualitatively unchanged.
3
  For almost all other retail financial products, the customer’s choice is intermediated by sales agents or
advisors, for example, insurance brokers and financial advisors. This process makes it difficult to observe the
actual information consumers receive, as these agents might alter the information or even product features in
a way that is unobservable to the researcher.
4
  Compremedia collects monthly information on all credit card mailers sent to a set of approximately 4000
representative households that work with Compremedia across the US. These households provide a
representative sample of US credit card owners. The goal of the data collection is to help card issuers monitor
each other’s offers and product innovations.
photos, color, font size, and whether information about an offer is provided at the beginning

or the end of the letter.5

      A typical credit card in the US combines a broad set of complex features that constitute

a three-part tariff: a regular APR (annual percentage rate) is often combined with a low

introductory APR (that is, a lower rate for a limited time), very high late and over-limit

fees, and (low) annual fees. Approximately 50% of cards also include a rewards program,

such as cash back, points, or airline miles.

      We first provide evidence that credit card issuers target unsophisticated customers with

more back-loaded or hidden card features than sophisticated ones, holding all other

observable characteristics constant. Our measure of sophistication is the educational

attainment of a household. The education levels are some high school, high school, some

college, college education, and more than college.6 We regress different card features on

dummies for educational attainment while controlling for income level, age, gender, and

marital status, as well as for the monthly fed funds rate and state-level fixed effects. Lower

educational attainment is correlated with higher late fees, higher over-limit fees and higher

default APRs, but these customers are more likely to receive low introductory APR offers

and no annual fees. The reverse is true for sophisticated consumers. We show that these

results hold even if we control for bank fixed effects in the regressions. This means that

these differences in targeting strategies are not a cross-bank phenomenon where different

banks target different customer groups, as the pattern holds even within a given bank.



!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5
  As financial institutions in the US have to follow TILA (Truth in Lending Act) rules, all the information
concerning the card must be included in the pre-approved mailer. In addition, the mandatory Schumer box
discloses most of the main card features included in the letter. However, issuers can choose how they display
the information that they highlight in the main text.!
6!For a subset of observations, we can also control for FICO scores.!
   Since credit card terms are not offered to customers one by one but as a bundle, we

carefully explore the correlation structure of terms across cards. We find strong positive

correlations among all back-loaded card features (late fees, over-limit fees, default APRs

and low introductory APRs), and these features are negatively correlated with front-loaded

card features (annual fees and regular APR). A principal component analysis allows us to

sort cards into more forward- or back-loaded fee structures. We find that the first principal

component loads positively on all the back-loaded terms and negatively on front-loaded

ones, again suggesting that banks consistently sort cards into front- versus back-loaded

categories. We then regress the loading of each card on the first principal component on

our sophistication measure, controlling for personal characteristics. We find that consistent

with prior results, less-sophisticated households are more likely to receive card offers that

offer a bundle of back-loaded characteristics.

   To explore the relationships between individual card features, we also regress front-

loaded features, such as the regular APR or the annual fee, on the back-loaded fees, e.g.,

late fees, and an interaction between late fees and a dummy for the sophistication level of

the household. The results show that the trade-off between back- and front-loaded card

features is much steeper for less-sophisticated households. In other words, the less

sophisticated the household, the more back-loaded are the credit terms that are offered to

them. We repeat this analysis for the remaining back- and front-loaded card features.

   To understand whether these different card features actually affect the pricing of the

cards, we follow the approach in Ausubel (1991) and use changes in the federal funds rate

as shocks to the banks’ cost of funding. This allows us to analyze which card features banks

use to pass these costs on to consumers. If issuers never expected to collect late fees or
over-limit fees from (unsophisticated) customers, we would not expect them to change

these card features. However, we see that when the FFR increases, credit cards that target

less-sophisticated consumers, respond strongly in their late fees and over-limit fees but not

in their upfront fees (regular APR and annual fees). In contrast, the regular APRs and

annual fees of cards offered to sophisticated consumers are more sensitive to a FFR

increase than are the back-loaded terms. This pattern supports our prior finding that the

pricing of the first set of cards is conducted via back-loaded fees, while cards offered to

sophisticated consumers are priced via the regular APR.

   A second important dimension of the credit card market is that even conditional on

borrowers’ observable characteristics, they might differ in their sophistication along ex

ante unobservable dimensions. Our data allows us to observe the menu of card offers that

issuers send to the same household in order to screen for unobservable borrower types.

This means we can compare the pricing of different cards while holding constant the

borrower fixed effect. It appears that issuers use rewards programs to screen for

unobservable differences between borrowers. We show that cards that have rewards

programs, such as low introductory APRs, cash back or points, rely more on back-loaded

pricing terms such as lower regular APR and higher late and over limit fees. In contrast,

cards with airline miles programs, which are mainly offered to the most educated groups

in the population (less than 9% of cards offer airline miles), have significantly higher

regular APRs and often carry an annual fee, but they have low late fees and over-limit fees.

The results of these screening regressions hold even if we control for bank fixed effects,

which means that two credit cards offered by the same issuer show these differences in

pricing strategy. These findings suggest that card issuers try to use different rewards
programs to separate more-sophisticated from less-sophisticated borrowers. As more-

sophisticated borrowers might be able to avoid back-loaded fees, it is not in the interest of

the card issuers to offer them features such as low introductory teaser rates.

      Finally, we show that banks seem to understand that reliance on back-loaded or

shrouded features can affect the credit risk of their borrower pool because it changes which

customers take up these credit cards. If borrowers do not understand all the credit terms or

mistakenly believe that they will never incur the back-loaded fees, these pricing strategies

could attract customers who cannot afford the credit cards that are offered and who then

default when the fees come due. This risk creates an endogenous limit to how heavily

lenders can rely on these strategies.

      To test whether banks proactively take this effect into account, we look at exogenous

shocks to customer creditworthiness, in particular, changes in state-level unemployment

insurance (UI) in the US over the last decade.7 UI has increased in a staggered fashion

across several US states over the last decade. These changes provide higher levels of

unemployment insurance and longer UI benefits periods. By reducing the impact on

consumer cash flows in the event of negative shocks, increases in UI also reduce a lender’s

exposure to one of the largest negative economic shocks that customers can experience.

This policy change allows us to use a standard difference-in-difference estimator to regress

changes in card features on UI changes across states. Our results show that these shocks to

borrowers indeed affect the willingness of card issuers to rely on back-loaded and shrouded

features. We find that increases in UI levels lead to an increase in the fraction of offers

with low intro APRs and other reward programs. However, we also see a significant

 We follow Agrawal and Matsa (2013) in using changes in the state-level unemployment insurance limits
as a source of variation in employee risk exposure.
increase in late fees and default APRs. Interestingly, we also find that when the UI level

increases, offer letters use more colors and move back-loaded features to the back of the

letter. Taken together, these results suggest that credit card companies realize that there is

an inherent trade-off in the use of back-loaded features in credit card offers: They might

induce customers to take on more (expensive) credit, but at the same time, they expose the

lender to greater risk, if those consumers do not anticipate the true cost of credit.

      Our results are in line with the predictions of several recent behavioral models of the

credit card market.8 These models suggest that the three-part tariff we see in the credit card

market might be optimal if customers do not understand their actual cost of credit. These

consumers will demand credit as if they were facing the low APRs but not the back-loaded

fees. A rational consumer who understands the full cost of credit would instead reduce

borrowing to avoid late fees, but this practice is not optimal for card issuers because it

reduces the infra-marginal rents they can extract. 9 The mistakes consumers make in

estimating their costs of credit can be due to misunderstandings about either the contract

(myopia) or their own demand (self-control). A prominent example of the former is the

model by Gabaix and Laibson (2006) on shrouded attributes. It suggests that companies

can attract myopic consumers by offering low base prices or other enticing features but

break even by charging high prices for hidden, add-on features.10 Heidhues and Koszegi

(2010, 2015) provide a micro foundation for these contracts if borrowers have self-control

  Standard adverse selection models with nonlinear pricing a la Mussa and Rosen (1978) or Maskin and Riley
(1984) predict that the last unit of consumption should be priced at marginal cost so that the highest demand
consumer will pay the lowest marginal price. For a discussion of these points, see Grubb (2015).
10
   Carlin (2013) suggests a related model where heightened product complexity increases the market power
of financial institutions because it prevents some consumers from becoming knowledgeable about prices.
Here, complexity works as a negative externality on all customers rather than being targeted at particular
subsets of the population.
issues but naively underestimate the likelihood of being tempted in the future.11 Grubb

(2010) derives very similar results for consumers with overoptimistic evaluations of how

well they can forecast the variance of their future demand.

      Our results are also consistent with recent papers on salience, see for example Bordalo

et al (2013, 2016), which suggest that consumers overweigh the most salient features of a

product and try to maximize the quality-price ratio of the goods they purchase. This can

lead to “quality salient equilibria” where firms compete by differentiating themselves along

a quality dimension rather than price. In our context of the credit card market, this could

be interpreted as customers viewing reward programs as the perceived quality dimension

of a credit card choice.

      Independent of the specific form of mistake, these models provide a number of

common predictions that are confirmed by our findings. First, when consumers are naïve,

the prices of front-loaded or salient card features are driven down, while the prices of

features that consumers do not focus on are very high (e.g., late fees and over-limit fees).

This leads to participation distortion because consumers take on more credit than they

rationally should. Conversely, in markets with predominantly sophisticated consumers, we

do not expect to find pricing below marginal cost because these consumers can see through

add-on pricing and can avoid costly back-loaded features. Second, in a competitive market

with both naïve and sophisticated agents where firms cannot ex ante separate consumers,

there is cross-subsidy from naïve to more-sophisticated agents. Ideally, firms would find it

optimal to reduce this subsidy to capture these rents themselves.


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
11
   We do not aim to differentiate myopia from present bias, as the two traits can be intimately linked for the
purpose of credit card issuers. Borrowers who have present bias might be happy to not be confronted with
late fees, even if they are not naïve about the contract features. Alternatively, hiding certain features of the
card might aggravate a consumer’s time inconsistency.
      We do not want to rule out that it might not be possible to write dynamic adverse

selection models with rational agents that can explain our set of results. However, there are

a number of findings that seem challenging to explain in a purely rational framework. First,

one could imagine consumers who value a back-loaded fee structure if they are very credit

constrained today but expect to be much less constrained in the future. As a result, these

borrowers would be willing to trade a very low interest today for a high interest in the

future.12 However, several findings in our data do not support this interpretation: On the

one hand, the steep non-linearity of late fees seems to run counter to the idea that the late

fees are an interest rate because they do not take into account the actual balance that the

borrower carries. On the other hand, in a world where rational consumers are looking for

cards that allow them to shift their interest payments to the future, late fees and back-loaded

fees should be very prominent in contracts because they represent a service that consumers

are selecting.13 This is not what we find: fees are always in printed in small fonts on the

last page of the offer letter.

      Second, an alternative rational model could be one where very price-sensitive and low-

risk borrowers signal their (high) type to the bank by selecting contracts with low APRs

but very high back-loaded penalty rates. The expectation on both sides would be that the

borrower will never incur any late fees and always pay on time, on the equilibrium path.

However, this interpretation is also difficult to reconcile with our findings. First, as before,

we would expect penalty rates in such a situation to be prominently displayed in the



!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
12
   One caveat for such a model would be that banks have to get their timing just right, as highly credit
constrained borrowers typically have high default propensities such that the back-loaded fees coincide with
the borrower’s ability to pay.
13
   One could argue that even a rational agent would not look at the future fees because they intend to default
if fees are too high. This is not an equilibrium because banks would not be able to break even.
contract because they would be desirable features of the card. Second, we show that credit

cards with rewards that have particularly steep back-loaded fees react very strongly in the

size of the late fees (but not the regular APRs) when there is a shock to the bank's cost of

capital. If banks were never expecting to be paid via late fees, funding shocks should not

affect them. Finally, we draw on several papers that have looked at the usage behavior of

credit cards; see, for example, Agrawal et al (2008), which finds that borrowers who take

up credit cards with high late fees indeed often pay them.14 Thus, this rational signaling

model is difficult to reconcile with our difference-in-difference results using UI changes.

If consumers use high late fees to signal their price sensitivity and ability to manage credit,

this should not change when their credit risk is reduced.15

      The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a detailed literature

review. In section 3, we present the data used in the study, the variables we constructed for

the paper and the design of the sample. Section 4 summarizes the results for how credit

card companies target consumers, while section 5 focuses on credit card screening. In

section 6, we describe our difference-in-difference analysis using unemployment insurance

shocks to borrower credit risk. Section 7 concludes.



2. Literature Review

             By focusing on the supply side of credit, our paper complements a growing

literature in household finance on the demand side of the credit card market and credit card

usage. Agarwal et al (2008) analyze more than 4 million credit card transactions to show


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
14
   A related behavioral version of this argument suggests that borrowers demand high late fees to prevent
themselves from over-spending or falling behind on card payments; see, for example, DelaVigna and
Malmendier (2004). In this case, we would also expect late fees to be prominently featured in the offer letter.
15
   We thank Michael Grubb for alerting us to this argument.
that customers, on average, pay significant fees (late payment fees and penalties) of

approximately $14 per month, which does not include interest payments. These results

confirm that fees indeed have a significant bite and that customers are not able to optimally

avoid all the negative features of their cards. That paper also shows that customers seem to

learn to reduce fees over time. However, this learning is relatively slow, as payments fall

by approximately 75 percent after four years. Using a similar data set, Gross and Souleles

(2000) show that consumers respond strongly to increases in their credit limits, especially

to interest rate changes such as low introductory teaser rates. The long-run debt to interest

rate elasticity is approximately -1.3, where more than one-half reflects net increases in total

borrowing (rather than balance transfers). In related work, Agarwal et al (2010) document

that consumers who respond to inferior lender offers have poorer credit characteristics ex

ante and default more often ex post. Similarly, Agarwal et al (2009) show that over the

lifecycle, middle-aged households obtain the best credit terms, while older customers select

worse credit terms. The authors conjecture that deterioration in cognitive ability could

explain why older people choose worse terms. 16 These papers provide important

confirmation that credit cards with disadvantageous features are being taken up and have a

significant impact on the borrower’s cost of capital. Similarly, in the context of health club

memberships, DellaVigna and Malmendier (2004) provide convincing evidence that

consumers systematically choose contracts that lead them to overpay per gym visit because

they are overconfident about their actual health club attendance.

   Hastings and Mitchell (2011) use a large-scale, nationally representative field survey from Chile to directly
relate impatience and financial literacy to poor financial decisions in a savings context. The results show that
impatience is a strong predictor of wealth. Financial literacy is also correlated with wealth, although it appears
to be a weaker predictor of sensitivity to framing in investment decisions. Agarwal et al (2016) show similar
demand responses to credit card contracts.
       Our study is related to a number of papers documenting considerable heterogeneity

in the pricing of retail financial products, even in the face of increasing competition. For

example, the seminal paper by Ausubel (1991) documents that credit card companies have

very low pass-through rates for changes in their cost of capital. Hortacu and Syverson

(2004) and Bergstresser et al (2009) show that wide dispersion in fees in the mutual fund

industry is related to changes in the heterogeneity of the customer base. More recently, Sun

(2014) and Celerier and Vallee (2014) show that even with the introduction of increased

competition, price dispersion does not decrease and product complexity might increase.

Similarly, Hastings, Hortacsu and Syverson (2012) look at the introduction of individual

savings accounts in Mexico and show that firms that invested more heavily in advertising

had both high prices and larger market shares because customers seem to be insufficiently

price sensitive. Similarly, Gurun, Matvos and Seru (2016) show that areas with large house

price increases and expanding mortgage origination saw increases in marketing expenses

and marketing solicitations. Similarly, a recent paper by Agarwal et al (2016) follows our

methodology and analyzes the back-ward loading of mortgage contracts in areas with

increased banking competition. These results suggest that firms compete on nonfinancial

dimensions, such as advertising, to substitute for price competition.

       Finally, a large literature in economics and marketing has looked at how individuals

respond to how product features are displayed when choosing complex contracts, such as

retail financial products, medical insurance contracts or even cell phone plans. For

example, Lohse (1997) demonstrates in an eye-tracking study that color Yellow Pages ads

are viewed longer and more often than black-and-white ads. Similarly, Lohse and Rosen

(2001) suggest that the use of colors, photos or graphics increases the perceived quality of
the products being advertised and enhances the credibility of the claims made about the

products compared with non-color advertisements. Heitman et al (2014) document that

how prices and add-on features are displayed significantly affects how well people choose

among products. Besheres, Choi, Laibson and Madrian (2010) show that even when

subjects are presented with information about mutual funds that is very transparent and

easy to digest, they select dominated savings vehicles. Bertrand et al (2010) show that the

advertising content can indeed have a significant impact on product take-up and even

willingness to pay. They set up a field experiment as part of a consumer lender’s direct

mailing campaign in South Africa and found that advertising content that appeals to

emotions (such as a woman’s face versus a man’s) or more simply displayed choices leads

people to accept much more expensive credit products. We build on this earlier literature

by analyzing whether firms deliberately incorporate these behavioral biases when

designing credit card offers.

       Han, Keys and Li (2013) use a very similar data set but focus on a complementary

topic. The authors use Compremedia data between 2007 and 2011 to document the large

expansion in the supply of credit card debt in the period leading up to the financial crisis

and after the crisis. The results show that the expansion prior to crisis was particularly large

for consumers with medium credit scores rather than sub-prime customers. In addition,

they show that even customers who have previously declared bankruptcy have a high

likelihood of receiving offers, but these offers are more restrictive.



3. Data and Summary Statistics

3.1. Data Description
       We use a comprehensive dataset from Mintel (also known as Compremedia) that

contains information on the types of credit card offers that customer with different

characteristics receive in the US. These data are based on a monthly consumer panel of

more than 4000 households, which are paid to collect all direct credit card mailers and send

the originals to Mintel. For this data collection effort, Mintel selects households based on

their demographic and economic characteristics in order to create a representative sample

of the population of US credit card holders. For each household, Mintel collects detailed

demographic information, including the age and education of the head of the household,

household income, household composition, family status, and zip code. Each month,

Mintel collects all credit solicitation mailers received by the household, such as credit

cards, home equity loans and mortgage offers. We only observe offers to the entire

household, usually to the head of the household.

       After gathering the physical credit card offers from the households, Mintel

manually scans the mailers to produce PDF versions and electronically enters some key

information, which is usually contained in the Schumer box: regular purchase APRs,

balance transfer APRs, cash advance APRs, default APRs, credit limits, annual fees, late

fees (penalties), over-limit fees, etc. We manually check the quality of the dataset and find

that all the variables are adequately collected, except default APRs, which have many

missing values.

       Our data covers the period from March 1999 to February 2011. However, we also

repeated our analysis excluding the post-2007 data to abstract from the impact of the

financial crisis and the CARD Act. The results are unchanged. For each month, there are

approximately 4,000 households and 7,000 credit card mail campaigns, on average. In total,
there are 1,014,768 mail campaigns, which consist of 168,312 different credit card offers.

Credit card companies usually issue the same offer to many households at the same time.

We use OCR (optical character recognition) software and our own extraction algorithms

to confirm the quality of the Mintel data. We find that most variables are coded accurately.

One exception is the default APR, which seems to have many missing entries.

       We also create a second data set based on the Mintel information by using all the

scanned pages of the credit card offers. These allow us to analyze the actual structure and

design of the offer, e.g., where information about the card is located on the mailers.

However, Mintel only keeps scanned images of approximately 80% of the credit card offers

(approximately 803,285 out of the 1,014,768 scanned credit card offers are complete).

Mailers are more likely to be missing in the first two years of the sample, and there are also

later offers with randomly missing images. However, we verify that, with the exception of

the time trend, the missing observations do not seem to have any observables biases.

       We extract information on reward programs and soft information on the design of

the mailer itself from these scanned images. First, we use OCR (Optical character

recognition) software to transfer all the images into Word documents. The OCR software

we use is OmniPage Professional version 18.0, a leading document imaging software that

is accurate and fast. The OCR software separates the characters and graphics/background

patterns from the original documents (i.e., the scanned credit card offers), recombines them

based on original digital documents’ design and turns them into editable Word documents.

Then, we use a keyword searching algorithm to search for the reward programs in each

offer. We are able to identify 8 commonly used reward programs: cash back, points, airline
mileage, car rental insurance, purchase protection, warranty protection, travel insurance,

and zero introductory APRs.

       Moreover, because we keep the formatting information for each character in the

offer, we can also record the format design of these reward programs. Using Word in VBA,

we are able to identify the fonts. We collect the size and color of each reward program

when they were mentioned in the offer letter, as well as whether they were highlighted with

bold or italic text. Additionally, we count the number and size of the pictures on each page.

To check the quality of the OCR and keyword searching algorithm, we randomly select

some offers and manually check the accuracy, which is over 90%. As we previously

mentioned, there are some values for default APRs missing from Mintel’s hand-collected

database. To address this missing data, we use the keyword searching algorithm to search

for the default APRs stated in the offers. Usually, the Schumer box contains the default

APRs, which is sometimes called the penalty APR. We extract default APRs from the

scanned images of all credit card offers using our algorithm and compare them to the rates

collected by Mintel. The accuracy of our algorithm is approximately 98%. In this way, we

are nearly able to complete the default APRs data. Because only 80% of the sample

includes the scanned offers, our variables for reward programs and format are limited to

this 80% sample.



3.2. Descriptive Statistics

       Table 1 describes the summary statistics of the main variables used in the paper. In

Table 1, the first twelve variables are based on our full sample of 1,014,768 mail offers

from Mintel. APR is the regular purchase APR listed in the credit card offer. If the regular
APR is a range, we pick the midpoint as the APR. The mean APR of the 982,767 total

mailings received by consumers is 12.65%. The APRs for balance transfer has a mean of

11.33% and standard deviation of 3.34%. The cash advance APR has a mean of 19.89%

and the standard deviation is 4.28%. For the default APR, the mean is much higher at

26.51%, which is higher than all other APRs. The high default APRs is not surprising

because it is conditional on the borrower being more than 60 days late. The default APR

may be applied to all outstanding balances of a credit card if a consumer pays the monthly

bill late. All these APRs are compounded monthly.



Intro_APR_regular, Intro_APR_balance and Intro_APR_cash are dummies indicating

whether the offer has 0% introductory APR (or very low introductory APR) for regular

purchases, balance transfers and cash advances, respectively. Max Card limit is the natural

log of the maximum credit card limit stated in the offers. We only have 526,949

observations for Max Card limit because many credit card offers do not specify a limit,

especially after 2008.

       Credit cards also have a number of different fee types; the dimensions that we

observe in the data are the annual, late, and over-limit fees. Annual fees on average are

$12.29 with a standard deviation of 31.99. The distribution of annual fees in our sample is

quite skewed: 81.5% of the mailed offers have no annual fee, and the maximum annual fee

is $500. Typically, cards that have annual fees offer mileage programs and other expensive

value-added services. A late fee is the onetime charge incurred when the consumer does

not pay at least the minimum monthly payment by the due date. This is a dollar value rather

than a rate. In our sample, late fee has a mean of $33.83, a standard deviation of 6.17, and
a max of $85. Its distribution is much less skewed than that of the annual fee.

Approximately 90% of credit card offers have late fees ranging from $29 to $39. This fixed

monthly fee comes due if the minimum payment has not been made, independent of the

size of the balance. Thus, this fee can be especially high for small balances.

       Finally, an over-limit fee is charged when the consumers’ credit card balance goes

over the card limit. The mean of over-limit fee is $29.74 with a standard deviation of

$10.16. The distribution of the over-limit fee is also concentrated: approximately 87% of

the cards have over-limit fees ranging from $29 to $39. Although credit card companies

usually charge no annual fee, they charge much more for late payments and over

borrowing.

       The remaining variables in Table 1 are based on the 80% sample of mail campaigns

for which we have scanned images of the credit card offers. “Size” is the maximum size of

the reward programs minus the average size of all characters on every page of each credit

card offer. For example, if “cash back” appears in the offer 3 times, we pick the largest

one. “Size” equals this largest number minus the average size of all characters on the same

page. The size is drawn directly from Word document. The variable “Size” has a mean of

4.71 mean and a standard deviation of 5.49. The maximum value of Size is 143.63 because

some offers use very large characters to highlight reward programs. The 90th percentile of

variable Size is 10.99.    We use this relative size measurement because credit card

companies tend to use larger characters to emphasize the paragraphs that describe the

reward programs compared to the nearby paragraphs. The size differences between them

should be the measure highlighted. Moreover, “Color” is a dummy indicating whether the

reward programs in the offer highlighted in color rather than in black and white. We focus
on the characters describing the reward programs rather than on the entire offer because

most credit card offers use some color, especially later in the study period.17 “Bold” is a

dummy indicating whether the offer used bold to highlight its reward programs.

             “Picture” is the file size of each page of the offer, which measures how many or

how “fancy” the pictures in the offer are. We do not use an actual count of the pictures or

the size of the pictures because our algorithm considers the background of the page as a

big picture (usually it is just a large, plain color picture). Using the storage size of each

Word document, we can approximate the complexity of the page design. Other features,

such as characters, also increase file size. However, pictures in Word documents usually

take most of the file storage. Thus, we think that file size is a good measure of pictures in

the credit card offers. The variable “Picture” is the file size, and the unit is megabytes

(MB). The mean of “Picture” is 0.23 MB with a 0.26 MB standard deviation.

             Finally, we are able to code the reward programs based on the PDF images. We

define “Reward” as the number of reward programs, CASH, POINT and Car rental

insurance, included in each offer. We choose these three reward programs because they are

similar and most commonly used. CASH, POINT, MILE, Carrental, Purchaseprct are

dummies indicating whether the offer includes these reward programs. Finally, FFR is the

monthly average federal fund rate from January 1999 to December 2011. We merge FFR

into our credit card dataset for each month.



3.3 Credit Card Design


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
17
  To construct formatting variables, such as Size, Color, and Bold, we focus on the reward programs fonts,
which include cash back, points, mileage, car rental insurance, purchase protection, and low intro APR
programs.
       Table 2 summarizes the physical design of the credit card offers to document how

and where certain features of the card are displayed in the letter. All credit card offers state

late fees, default APRs, over-limit fees, and annual fees because their disclosure in the

Schumer box is mandated. However, only 5.8% of the credit card offers mention late fees

on the first page; 4.97% mention default APRs on the first page, and 6.96% mention over-

limit fees on the first page. Not surprisingly, credit card offers usually do not mention fees,

especially those that typically are back-loaded on the first page. On the other hand, 79.28%

of the credit card offers include annual fee information on the first page. However, as we

will document below, annual fees are usually associated with cards that are offered to more-

educated, higher-income customers. Similarly, reward programs are usually mentioned in

the first page of the offers; 100% of cash back and mileage programs are mentioned in the

first page. For point reward, car rental insurance, and zero introductory APRs, the

likelihood of appearing on the first page is 93.51%, 80.48%, and 91.04%, respectively.

       Panel B of Table 2 compares the font size of the credit card terms conditional on

whether they are mentioned on the first page. Late, over-limit, and annual fees are lower if

they are mentioned on the first page of the offer than if they are mentioned on the back of

the offer. Again, it is not surprising that issuers would highlight the features they perceive

as very competitive.

       Table 3 provides a correlation matrix for the different reward programs, as indicated

along the vertical and horizontal axes. The numbers are the percentage of credit card offers

with both reward programs. For example, 6.30% of the credit card offers have both cash

back and point reward programs. We see that there is little overlap among reward

programs. Mileage programs, for instance, are not usually offered with cash back or points
programs. Only 1.15% of cards have for example both mileage and cash back programs.

Similarly, mileage programs are rarely offered with other reward programs or zero APRs.

However, more than 50% of cards with airline miles carry an annual fee. In contrast, cards

with cash back, points or zero APRs are almost never combined with annual fees.



4. Customer Characteristics and Credit Card Features

        We start by analyzing how the offer features vary with the observable

characteristics of the customers. In other words, how do credit card companies target their

offers to customer types. The characteristics we observe in Mintel for people receiving

these offers parallels the information that banks obtain by buying mailing lists from

gatekeepers or other firms that sell consumer data. Each observation in our data set is an

offer sent to a specific consumer, where consumers stand for a bundle of characteristics.

Because clients stay in the data set for only a limited time (they usually do not work for

Mintel over many years) we follow not individuals but “cells” that can be thought of as

bundles of characteristics. For example, we can observe the types of offers that a typical

household in a middle-income group or a certain educational level receives over time or

from different issuers. For each cell, we have several people with the same characteristics

in the sample who provide their information, and we are thus able to estimate their typical

offer structure.

        In Table 4, we run a simple hedonic regression model of card features, such as

APRs, late fee, or reward program, on customer characteristics. The characteristics of

interest to us are the education levels of customers, which are measured as six distinct

educational achievement dummies ranging from some high school to completed graduate
school. We also consider nine income groups (annual household income) ranging from less

than $15,000 to over $200,000. In these regressions, we also control for age group fixed

effects of the customer, state fixed effect, dummies for household composition and credit

card company fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at the demographic cell, which is

constructed by state, age, income, education and household composition.

       In Column (1) of Table 4, we start with the regular purchase APR as the dependent

variable and report the coefficients on the education and income bins. The results show

that the regular APR decreases significantly for higher-income groups, and the results are

relatively monotonically increasing with income. The magnitude of the effect is quite large.

Between the lowest and the fourth-highest income groups, the difference in mean APR is

almost 0.607 percentage points, which is a significant difference. The relationship between

APR and income drop off a little for the three highest income groups, but we show that

these groups also have different product features. In contrast, there is no significant

relationship between the regular APR and education. The estimated coefficients are all

close to zero and insignificant. We re-estimate the regression for the APRs on balance

transfers and cash withdrawals and obtain very similar results; these regressions are not

reported but can be obtained from the authors. These results intuitively suggest that higher-

income customers have lower credit risk and thus enjoy lower costs of capital.

Interestingly, this is not true for more-educated customers, suggesting that people of similar

educational achievement might vary considerably in their income and, thus, in their credit

worthiness.

       Interestingly, we find that late fees and default APRs increase significantly with

customer income but drop with higher educational attainment. For example, the difference
in the default APRs of the lowest and highest income groups is approximately 0.543

percentage points. Thus, customers with higher incomes actually face higher default

interest rates than those with lower incomes. The same pattern holds for late fees. In

contrast, customers with more education receive card offers that have smaller late fees,

lower default APRs, and lower over-limit fees. On the other hand, in Column (5), front-

loaded annual fees are significantly higher for households with more education. These

results are a first indication that interest rates and fees are set not just with an eye toward

credit risk but also toward the sophistication of the customer.

       In a next step, we look at how reward programs are offered to customers. In Column

(6), the dependent variable is a dummy that equals one if the credit card offer contains a

cash back program. We see that there is a strong positive correlation with income; between

the highest and lowest income groups, there is a 4 percent difference in the presence of a

cash back program. This difference is economically substantive because only 21 percent

of card offers contain a cash back program. In contrast, we do not see any relationship

between education and the likelihood of receiving a credit card offer with a cash back

program. In Column (7), we see a very similar result for points programs. Again, there is a

statistically and economically significant increase in the likelihood of receiving an offer

with a points program for households at higher income levels. However, there is weak

relationship with education.

       We observe a very different relationship when looking at miles programs. In

Column (8), we show that the likelihood of receiving a card offer with a miles program

increases significantly with the education level of the household. Households in the second

to last highest income group are more than six percent more likely to receive an offer with
a miles program compared to a household in a the lowest educational bin. Because only

eight percent of credit card offers include a miles program, education seems to be a very

important dimension in receiving miles programs. We also see that miles programs increase

with the income level of the customer. Finally, we look at low introductory APR offers.

These usually expire after a few months (customarily after 6 to 12 months), and a higher

interest rate then applies. In Column (9), we see that introductory APR programs are

predominantly offered to less-educated or lower-income customers. A similar relationship

holds for introductory APR rates on balance transfers.

       In Table 4, Column (10), Format is the first principal component of reward

programs' font size, colors used, bold text and picture size in the credit card offers. We

show that more-educated households or high-income households can obtain more

elaborately designed credit card offers, which usually use larger fonts, more colors, more

bold text, and more pictures to emphasize the reward programs.

       Finally, we create a combined measure of how back-loaded a card is overall by

calculating the first principal component of the card terms, including regular APR, over-

limit fees, late fees, zero introductory APR dummy, and annual fee. The results are

presented in Appendix Table A2. The first principal component loads very positively on

front-loaded features, such as annual fees and APR, and negatively on back-loaded fees,

such as late fees and over-limit fees. When we estimate a hedonic regression on this

combined measure that we called Backward. In column (11), we see the same very

significant pattern: back-loadedness decreases significantly with the education level.

Interestingly, the same is not true for income. In fact, richer people tend to receive more

back-loaded card terms (controlling for education).
             Taken together, these results suggest that different reward programs are used to

target different customers groups. Introductory APR offers are primarily offered to less-

educated and poor clients. In contrast, points and cash back programs are offered to richer

customers independent of their educational level. Finally, miles is the only reward program

that is predominately targeted to richer and, importantly, more-educated customers. We

plot the coefficients from Table 4 in Figures 1 and 2 to clarify the patterns. Figure 1 plots

the estimated coefficients of education on credit card terms and reward programs. Figure

2 plots the estimated coefficients of income on credit card terms and reward programs.

             Robustness Check: One dimension that we do not have in our data is the FICO score

for individual borrower, since Mintel is not allowed to provide credit card information to

individuals. To analyze the role of FICO scores for out analysis, we obtained Mintel data

via the CFPB. 18. While the data set available at the CFPB covers a shorter time period than

ours (starting in 2007), they have the advantage of including FICO scores. The idea it to

see whether the pricing relationships documented in our paper differ significantly when

including FICO score. For this purpose, we repeat our waterfall regressions of card features

on customer characteristics, adding FICO scores as an additional explanatory variable.

Adding the FICO scores does not add additional explanatory power to the regression. The

adjusted R-squared of the regressions are unchanged, and none of the coefficients on other

RHS variables change when including the FICO scores. Overall, it appears that the

dimensions spanned by the FICO scores are orthogonal to the other observable

characteristics used in the paper. These results alleviate concerns that we are missing an

important, and un-spanned dimension of customer characteristics.

5. Screening with Different Credit Card Offers

5.1. Trade-offs between card features

       We now explore the menu of credit card contracts that a consumer with a given set

of characteristics is offered. In particular, we want to understand how issuers trade-off

front-loaded terms, such as regular APR and annual fees, with back-loaded terms, such as

late fees. In Table 5, we regress regular APRs on late fees; we also control for the fed fund

rate (FFR) in the month the offer was made. One should understand this estimated

coefficient purely as the correlation between late fees and regular APR rather than as a

causal estimate in any sense. However, we prefer this specification because it allows us to

easily control for household demographic cell fixed effects and bank fixed effects. In

Column (1), we first report the cross-sectional correlation between late fees and APRs.

Therefore, we only control for state and year fixed effects. We find that a $1 increase in

the late fee is associated with a 0.6 percentage point decrease in the regular APR. We then

add controls for bank fixed effects in Column (2). The specification holds the borrower

type and bank constant. This variation exists in the data because banks experiment with

sending credit card holders different contracts to screen for their types. This means we can

identify the menu of contract structures that a given bank sends the same customer. We

find that the negative correlation between regular APRs and late fees also holds at the

individual level. Customers have to trade-off between lower upfront fees and high late fees,

or vice versa.

       In the next two columns, (3) and (4), we analyze whether this trade-off is steeper

for less-educated consumers, as suggested in the hedonic regressions in Table 4. Therefore,

we interact late fees with a dummy indicating whether a customer is in the top half of the
education distribution (some college and above) or in the bottom half of the education

distribution. We see that the trade-off between late fees and APR indeed becomes more

negative, i.e., steeper, for less-educated borrowers.

       In the next step, we analyze whether this trade-off changes with other card features,

specifically the reward programs. If reward programs that are aimed at less-sophisticated

consumers screen for more myopic or present-biased consumers, we would expect the

terms of the credit card to become more back-loaded. However, rewards that are sent

predominantly to sophisticated consumers should not show the same structure. As

suggested in Gabaix and Laibson (2006), these consumers can see through and avoid add-

on pricing. To test these ideas, in Columns (5) and (6), we add the number of reward

programs, cash back, point, and car rental insurance (which we saw are targeted at all

income and education levels) in each offer and interact it with late fees. Again, in Column

(5), we control for cell fixed effects, and in (6), for both cell and bank fixed effects. We

find a significant, negative coefficient on this interaction term, which means that the trade-

off between upfront fees (APR) and late fees becomes steeper for cards with these rewards.

In unreported regressions, we reestimate the regressions using an indicator variable for

whether the card has a low introductory APR program. The results are qualitatively similar

but larger in magnitude.

       Then, in Columns (7) and (8) of Table 5, we look at the use of mileage programs

and find a distinct pattern. Interestingly, we see that the interaction term between mileage

programs and late fees is strongly positive and significant, which suggests that these cards

have a much flatter trade-offs between late fees and regular APRs. In other words, these

cards have a much less back-loaded fee structure, which is in line with the idea that cards
that are offered to more-sophisticated people cannot be back-loaded because they can

overcome back-loaded features. In Table 5B, we reestimate the regressions in Table 5 using

annual fees as our dependent variable. We confirm that the results are parallel to the

findings for regular APRs.

       Finally, in the last two columns of Table 5, we explore the role of the marketing

material itself. The algorithm we use to process the offer letters allows us to rank offer

letter by how much they rely on pictures rather than text. This variable, Picture, indicates

the size of the file and of the images in each credit card offer. To test whether offer letters

that have more pictures and flashier advertising material also rely more on back-loaded fee

structures, we reestimate our trade-off regressions but interact late fees with the Picture

variable. The results in Columns (9) and (10) show a very significant and negative

coefficient on the interaction term. This suggests that offer letters that employ flashier

communications also have more back-loaded fees.

       In sum, these results are consistent with a model in which credit card companies

offer a menu of contracts to potential customers (conditional on their observable

characteristics) to screen between naïve and sophisticated customers along unobservable

dimensions. To separate myopic or present-biased consumers from more-sophisticated

ones, issuers seem to offer terms such as low APRs and annual rates but very high late fees.

These cards are usually combined with rewards programs, such as low introductory APRs,

cash back and points. Interestingly, we see that credit cards with rewards programs that

are only offered to more-sophisticated borrowers (i.e., miles) do not have the same back-

loaded fee structure because these customers would be able to overcome add-on pricing.
5.2. Pricing of credit cards

       In a next step, we want to understand how the pricing of credit card offers changes

when the cost of capital for the issuers changes. Specifically, we analyze which terms of

the card are more sensitive to the issuer’s cost of capital. We draw on the idea pioneered

in Ausubel (1991), assuming that APRs should be very sensitive to the Federal Fund Rate

(FFR) because this is the rate at which the banks can raise capital. This approach will allow

us to understand which parts of the credit card contract are important for the issuer to

receive rents from the borrower and to break even on the loan pool in expectation. If cards

that are offered to less-educated consumers are more reliant on back-loaded features, we

should see that for these cards, back-loaded terms respond more strongly to shocks in the

FFR than front-loaded features. The opposite should hold for cards offered to more-

sophisticated consumers.

       Similarly, we should find that if cards with rewards programs, such as points, cash

back or low introductory APRs, are indeed used to screen for naïve consumers who pay

via late fees, then we should see late fees respond particularly strongly when the FFR

changes. The reverse should be true for miles cards, which we have shown are mainly

offered to sophisticated consumers.

       To test this relationship, in Table 6, our regression specification is:

                  !",$,% = '( ×**+, + '. ×/01234",$,% + *2",$,% + 5",$,%

Yi , j ,t indexes the dependent variables we are interested in, such as regular purchase APRs,

default APRs, late fees and over-limit fees. For example, APRi , j ,t is the regular purchase

APR offered by company i to consumer j at time t. FFRM indexes the federal fund rate at

month M. /01234",$,% indexes the dummies indicating whether the education level of the
household head is below college. We also control for fixed effects such state fixed effects,

bank fixed effects, and household demographic cell fixed effects, 19 and t is at a daily

frequency.

             Additionally, we explore the sensitivity of APRs to the FFR by adding interaction

terms between FFR and a dummy for less-educated borrowers:



       !",$,% = '( ×**+, + '. ×/01234",$,% + '6 ×/01234",$,% ×**+, + *2",$,% + 5",$,%

We cluster the standard errors at the cell level. In Table 7, we then re-estimate the

regression and interact FFR with dummies for different reward programs, such as miles

and zero introductory APR programs. We also report the cash back and points reward

program results in Appendix Table A3.

             Education levels: In Table 6, we differentiate between cards that are issued to less-

and more-educated borrowers. Again, the low education dummy is equal to one for

customers who have no college education. In Column (1), we regress the regular APR on

the FFR and an indicator for low education. In this first column, we control for cell fixed

effects but not bank fixed effects. We see that the coefficient on FFR is positive (0.813).

While the coefficient is highly significant, it indicates that there is less than perfect pass-

through of the cost of capital to customers. We also see that cards that are offered to less-

educated people have higher regular APRs, which confirms our findings in Table 4. In

Column (2), we add bank fixed effects to the regression. This allows us to control for the

differences in pricing strategies between banks. We see that with bank fixed effects, the

coefficient on Low education drops significantly. This result suggests that banks differ

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
19!We      construct the household demographic cells by age, education, income, household composition, and
state. !
significantly in their targeting of less-educated consumers, and issuers that target less-

educated consumers extensively also charge lower APRs. In Column (3), we add the

interaction term between FFR and the Low Education dummy. As discussed above, this

approach follows Ausubel (1991) to test how different contract terms change with the FFR.

We find a negative and significant coefficient on the interaction term, which means that

the APRs offered to less-educated people are less sensitive to the FFR than those offered

to more-educated consumers.

       In Columns (4) and (5), we repeat the analysis using the annual fee of the card as

our dependent variable. We find, as expected from our prior results, that annual fees are

significantly lower for cards offered to less-educated people. This relationship holds when

holding constant person and bank fixed effects. Parallel to the results in Column (3) for the

APR, we find that the interaction term between the Fed fund rate and the Low education

dummy is negative.

       In contrast, when looking at late fees and over-limit fees in columns (7) and (9),

respectively, we see that the interaction term is positive. This means that credit cards

offered to less-educated people are more sensitive in the late fees and over-limit fees to

changes in the Fed fund rate.

       These results support our hypothesis that back-loaded fees, such as late fees and

over-limit fees, are the important pricing dimensions of cards offered to less-educated

people. Therefore, these back-loaded terms react to a change in the bank’s cost of capital.

In contrast, the regular purchase APRs and annual fees of cards offered to more educated

people are much more sensitive to changes in the FFR. If more-educated people do not fall
prey to back-loaded terms, a change in the cost of capital affects the regular purchase APR

and annual fee.

        Mileage Programs and Introductory APRs: In Table 7, Panels A and B, we focus

on the pricing of cards with different rewards programs. The idea is to test whether cards

with rewards program that are primarily offered to educated people, such as miles

programs, show greater reliance on front-loaded terms, such as APRs and annual fees,

while rewards programs offered mainly to less-educated people, such as low introductory

APRs, rely on back-loaded pricing. These regressions parallel those in Table 6. We follow

the same set of specifications as in Table 6 but interact FFR with the reward programs. In

Table 7, Panel A, we find that cards that have miles programs have significantly higher

regular APRs, much higher annual fees and much lower late fees or over-limit fees than

cards without these programs. Again, it is important to note that these results hold even

when we control for cell and bank fixed effects. Thus, we are identifying the variation in

two different card offers sent to the same borrower type. Consistent with the results in

Table 6, when we add an the FFR*MILES interaction term, we find that APR and annual

fees are very sensitive to changes in FFR if the card has a mileage program, but late fees

and over-limit fees are less sensitive. When we repeat these specifications in Panel B for

cards with low introductory APR programs, we obtain the opposite results. For these cards,

back-loaded terms (late fees and over-limit fees) are more sensitive to the FFR.20 This

confirms that mileage programs are not priced via back-loaded features but via regular

APRs and annual fees because sophisticated consumers see through add-on pricing.

similar to those with introductory APR programs.

6. Shocks to borrower credit risk: Unemployment insurance

       Finally, we analyze the effect of an exogenous shock to the credit worthiness of

customers, in particular, their risk of default, on credit card terms and reward programs.

We suggest that there is a countervailing force to how much card issues can rely on naiveté-

based price discrimination. If back-loaded or shrouded card features attract not only

myopic or present-biased but also lower credit quality customers, these can have an adverse

effect on the card issuers. For example, if customers who are drawn in by zero APR

introductory programs truly do not expect that they ever have to pay interest on the credit,

they might have to default once the introductory period expires. However, this

endogenously limits the extent to which banks should rely on this strategy.

       To test whether banks take this dynamic into account, we use changes in the (state)

unemployment insurance (UI) programs as exogenous shocks to the credit risk of

customers. UI has increased in a staggered fashion across several US states over the last

two decades. These changes provided higher levels of unemployment insurance and longer

benefits periods. By providing households with a cash flow stream in cases of negative

shocks, UI also reduces a lender’s exposure to one of the largest negative economic

outcomes that customers might suffer. We obtain data on the level of unemployment

insurance (UI) from the US Department of Labor for each state. Based on this information,

we calculate annual changes in UI at the beginning of each year from 1999 to 2012 and

match them to our credit card dataset. Following Hsu, Matsa and Melzer (2012), we use

maximum UI benefits as the measure of unemployment protection. We define maximum

UI benefits as the product of the maximum weekly benefit amount (WBA) and the
maximum number of weeks allowed. For example, in January 2000, Alabama allowed a

maximum of 26 weeks of unemployment insurance over a 52-week period, and the

maximum weekly benefit amount (WBA) was $190. We use $4,940 (26 weeks times $190

WBA) as the level of UI. For each state, we then calculate the annual percentage increase

of UI. We use 10% annual growth as the cut-off and define a UI “jump” as an increase

equal to or greater than 10% within a year.

       This allows us to use a standard difference-in-difference estimator to regress

changes in card features on UI changes across states and over time. We use a window of

one year before and after the UI increase to estimate the effect. The reason to use this short

cut-off is that some states have a large increase in UI in one year and small changes in a

following year; we did not want to confound the impact of the UI change with small

subsequent changes. In addition, we see in the data that credit card companies, on average,

react very quickly to changes in the market. For example, if one issuer introduces a new

product feature in the market, other firms adopt this change within a few months. We also

include dummies to control for a possible pre-trend three or six months before the UI

change. All regressions control for time fixed effects, cell fixed effects, and bank fixed

effects. We reestimated these regressions using other time windows, e.g., two-year

windows, around the change, and the results are qualitatively and quantitatively very

similar.

       Table 8, Panel A presents the one-year difference-in-difference regression results

between 1999 and 2007. We drop the years following the financial crisis of 2008. Because

economic conditions worsened significantly in the years following the crisis, changes in

UI after 2008 are likely to be endogenous to the economic distress of a state, and there may
be concerns that other hidden variables drive our results. Overall, we find that card issuers

rely more heavily on back-loaded and shrouded terms when UI is increased and thus the

riskiness of the borrowers is reduced. In Column (1), the dependent variable is the regular

APR. The coefficient on the UI dummy is negative but not significant. However, in Column

(2), we see that an increase in UI leads to a large and significant increase in late fees. In

contrast, Column (3) shows that annual fees do not change significantly around UI changes,

while in Column (4), look at whether credit card issuers use more intro APR programs

when UI increases. For that purpose, we build a dummy variable, Intro_APR_All, to

indicate whether the credit card offer has zero intro APRs for regular purchases, balance

transfers, or cash advances. We find that card issuers indeed use more intro APR programs

after UI increases have been implemented. In Column (5), we again use the first principal

component as a summary of all the front- and back-loaded features as the dependent

variable. Overall, these results strongly support the idea that with the increase in UI issuers

use a greater reliance on back-loaded payment features. Finally, in the last four columns of

Table 7, Panel A, we look at the “softer” dimensions of the credit card offer. We see that

after a UI increase, issuers are more likely to use colorful mailers. At the same time, the

offers are more likely to move information about late fees and default APRs from the front

of the offer letter to the end. In addition, when we repeat all the regressions without the

bank fixed effects, the results are quite similar to those in Table 7, and the estimated

coefficients barely change. This means that the results are not driven by banks differentially

selecting to offer credit cards in states with UI changes. Our results are driven by within

bank variation in decisions to change pricing policies based on UI changes. We then repeat
the analysis in Table 8, Panel B across our entire sample period (1999 to 2011). The

regression results in Panel B are very similar to Panel A.

        Taken together, these results suggest that credit card companies realize that there is

an inherent trade-off in the use of back-loaded or shrouded features of credit card offers:

They might induce customers to take on more (expensive) credit, but at the same time, they

expose the lender to people who pose greater risk. Therefore, we observe greater reliance

on these features when the customer pool experiences an (exogenous) improvement in

credit quality.



7. Conclusions

        The results in this paper suggest that credit card companies target and screen

sophisticated and naïve creditors differently by offering these groups different reward

programs and pricing structures. In line with the behavioral contract theory literature, the

results suggest that cards offered to less-sophisticated customers rely more on back-loaded

and shrouded terms. In contrast, more-sophisticated customers who would be able to avoid

back-loaded terms while benefitting from lower introductory fees are offered more front-

loaded terms in order for the lender to break even. These results support the insights of

behavioral contract theory models, in particular, Gabaix and Laibson (2006), Heidhues and

Kozsegi (2010) and Grubb (2010), which suggest that card issuers will not offer shrouded

terms on products that are demanded mainly by sophisticated consumers because they can

undo these terms and thus reduce the rents that accrue to the firm. We find that issuers use

reward programs to effectively segregate these groups. Cards with miles programs, which

appeal to educated consumers, are predominantly offered to sophisticated consumers and
have front-loaded pricing. In contrast, cards with introductory APR programs are mainly

issued to less-sophisticated consumers and carry more back-loaded pricing.

       Finally, our analysis highlights an important dimension of the use of naiveté-based

discrimination that has not been previously explored in the literature. The interaction

between behavioral screening and classic adverse selection is more complex than noted in

the prior theoretical literature. There appears to be a built-in trade-off between the

immediate benefits of using naiveté-based price discrimination and the impact on the credit

risk of the customer pool. By attracting customers who do not understand the credit terms

that they are offered, the issuer might ultimately end up with a borrower pool that has a

higher chance of not being able to afford the credit and thus of defaulting. Using changes

in state-level unemployment insurance, which reduces the credit risk of borrowers, we

show that card issuers rely more heavily on back-loaded terms when borrowers’ credit risk

is reduced. These findings suggest that card issuers are aware of the above trade-off.

Note: Panel A shows OLS regressions to estimate relationship between Cashback reward programs and credit card APRs and fees. Panel B shows OLS regressions to
estimate relationship between Points reward programs reward programs and credit card APRs and fees. Data period is from 1999 to 2011. Data is restricted to offers we
have scanned pictures in Panel A. Panel B includes the entire credit card offer sample with and without scanned pictures. Regressions in column 1 to 9 are controlled by
household demographic cell fixed effects based on states, age, income, education, and household composition. Regressions in column 2 to 9 are controlled by bank fixed
effects. MILE is the dummy of whether the credit card offer has mileage reward program or not. Intro_APR is the dummy of whether the credit card offer has 0 intro APR
for regular purchase or not. Standard errors in parentheses are clustered by cells.

Note: FFR is the federal fund rate at monthly frequency. Other variables are based on Mintel's credit card's
direct mail campaigns from March 1999 to February 2011. Variables from "Size" to "Purchaseprct" are from
80% of 1,014,768 total mail campaigns which have scanned images of credit card offers. Size is the maximum
size of the reward programs minus the average size of the whole page in credit card offer. Color is the dummy
of whether reward programs in the offer use color other than black/white in the offer. Bold is the dummy of
whether the offer use bold to highlight reward programs. If there is no reward program in the offer, we put
missing value to Size, Color, and Bold. Picture is the file storage size of the credit card offer images. The
unit is megabyte (MB). We drop the year before 2003 due to a lot of missing scanned images of credit card
offers. Reward is the number of reward programs of CASH POINT and Car rental insurance in each offer.
CASH, POINT, MILE, Carrental, Purchaseprct are dummies of whether the offer has these reward programs
respectively. Intro_APR_regular, Intro_APR_balance and Intro_APR_cash are the dummies of whether the
offer has 0% introductory APR for regular purchase, balance transfer and cash advance respectively. APR is
the regular purchase APR of the credit card offer which is the middle point if APR is a range in the offer.
Card Limit is the log of maximum credit card limit stated in the offer. Annual fee, late fee and over limit fee
are fees charged by credit card company which usually are in shumerbox.

the first principal component of reward programs' size, color, bold and the picture sizes on the credit card offers. Backward is the first principal component of regular APR, annual fee, late fee, over
limite fee, and intro_APR after taking out the bank and monthly fixed effects. Income_2 is the dummy for households whose annual income is from 15k to 25K. Income_3 is for 25k to 35k.
Income.Income_4 is for 35k to 50k. Income_5 is for 50k to 75k. Income_6 is for 75k to 100k. Income_7 is for 100k to 150k. Inocme_8 is for 150k to 200k. Income_9 is for over 200k. The missing
category is the income less than 15k. Education_2 is dummy for household head whose highest education is high school. Education_3 is for some college. Education_4 is for graduated college.
Education_5 is for post college graduate. The missing category is education below high school. Standard errors in parentheses are clustered by demographic cells, which are based on states, age,
income, education and household composition. Regressions are controlled by age fixed effects, household composition fixed effects, state fixed effects and bank fixed effects.

Note: Panel A shows OLS regressions to estimate relationship between mileage reward programs and credit card APRs and fees. Panel B shows OLS regressions to estimate
relationship between zero intro APR reward programs reward programs and credit card APRs and fees. Data period is from 1999 to 2007. Data is restricted to offers we
have scanned pictures in Panel A. Panel B includes the entire credit card offer sample with and without scanned pictures. Regressions in column 1 to 9 are controlled by
household demographic cell fixed effects based on states, age, income, education, and household composition. Regressions in column 2 to 9 are controlled by bank fixed
effects. MILE is the dummy of whether the credit card offer has mileage reward program or not. Intro_APR is the dummy of whether the credit card offer has 0 intro APR
for regular purchase or not. Standard errors in parentheses are clustered by cells.

Note: OLS regressions to estimate unemployment insurance effects on credit card features at 6-month frequency. Panel A includes the
credit card offers from 1999 to 2007. Panel B is from 1999 to 2011. All columns are controlled by 6 month fixed effects, bank fixed
effects, and cell fixed effects based on states, age, income, education and household composition. UI is the dummy which equals 1 if
unemployment insurances increase by more than 10% in this year and equals 0 in the year before the increase. UI_Pre_3M is the dummy
for 3 month pre-trend of the UI jumps. UI_Pre_6M is the dummy for 6 month pre-trend of the UI jumps. UI_Small is the dummy of the
UI increases below 10% which are mainly due to inflation adjustments. Column 7 and 6 are OLS regression on whether default APR/late
fees are mentioned on the main page of the credit card offers. Column 9 is for the default APR level when it's on the main pages.
Standard errors are clustered at the state level.
