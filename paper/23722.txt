This study contributes to the literature on supply-side adjustments to insurance expansions by
examining the effect of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) on ambulance response times. Exploiting
temporal and geographic variation in the implementation of the ACA as well as pre-treatment
differences in uninsured rates, we estimate that the expansions of private and Medicaid coverage
under the ACA combined to slow ambulance response times by an average of 19%. We conclude
that, through extending coverage to individuals who, in its absence, would not have availed
themselves of emergency medical services, the ACA added strain to emergency response
systems.

                                       1. INTRODUCTION

       Ever since the publication of Arrow’s (1963) seminal article, economists have explored

and deliberated the appropriate role of government in health insurance markets. With the

passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010 and subsequent, high-

profile repeal efforts, this question has also risen to the forefront of public policy debates. While

the effects of health insurance expansions on utilization and other patient outcomes have been

studied extensively, less attention has been paid to the supply-side of the market and whether

provider capacity constraints create challenges as the demand for medical care increases. The

current study explores one of the potential supply-side challenges caused by expanding insurance

coverage. Specifically, our interest is in estimating the effect of the ACA on ambulance

response time, defined as the time elapsed between notification and when the first ambulance

arrived on the scene of a motor vehicle accident.

       The ACA was intended to achieve nearly universal health insurance coverage through a

combination of insurance market reforms, mandates, and government subsidies. In an effort to

provide access to affordable coverage for patients with pre-existing conditions, insurers

operating in the non-group insurance market were prohibited from denying or dropping

coverage, pricing based on health (aside for limited adjustments for age and smoking status),

setting lifetime caps, and offering sub-standard benefits. Because these regulations on their own

would likely have led to adverse selection, the ACA required that individuals obtain insurance

coverage or pay a tax penalty. The ACA also expanded Medicaid to 138% of the Federal

Poverty Line (FPL), while providing subsidies for purchasing coverage through private insurance




                                                  1
“Marketplaces” (Gruber, 2011). 1 A 2012 Supreme Court decision made the Medicaid expansion

component of the ACA optional, and, as of May 2017, 19 states had opted out.

        A number of studies have documented a sharp increase in health insurance coverage in

2014, the year in which the major components of the ACA took effect (Long et al., 2014; Smith

and Medalia, 2015; Barnett and Vornovitsky, 2016; Courtemanche et al., 2016; McMorrow et

al., 2016). Using American Community Survey (ACS) data through 2014, Courtemanche et al.

(2017a) found that the ACA increased health insurance coverage by 6 percentage points in states

that expanded Medicaid and by 3 percentage points in the 19 non-expansion states. Using an

additional year of ACS data (i.e., 2015), Frean et al. (2017) concluded that the expansion of state

Medicaid programs accounted for 60% of the coverage gains under the ACA, while the

remaining 40% could be attributed to the subsidies offered through the private insurance

exchanges. 2

        Expanding health insurance coverage should, in theory, increase the amount of medical

care demanded by reducing its out-of-pocket price. The extent to which this increase actually

translates into health care utilization depends, however, on the supply-side response, which could

be limited by barriers to entry such as licensing requirements, the capital costs of medical

facilities and equipment, and the extensive regulations governing the construction of new

medical facilities. A substantial body of research has shown that the United States is currently

experiencing acute shortages of health care providers, particularly in the primary care sector (Ku

et al., 2009; Bodenheimer and Pham, 2010; Juraschek et al., 2012; Dall et al., 2017), and

1
  The ACA also included many other components such as mandates for employers to provide coverage and for
insurers to allow dependents to remain on parents’ plans until age 26, changes to Medicare financing, and tax
increases on high-income individuals and medical devices. The Kaiser Foundation has published a useful guide to
the ACA (Kaiser Family Foundation 2017a).
2
 Other studies that have investigated the effects of the ACA on coverage include Kaestner et al. (2015) and Wherry
and Miller (2016), both of which focused on the effect of expanding state Medicaid programs.


                                                        2
projections indicate that these shortages will be exacerbated as a result of the ACA (Ku et al.,

2009; Sargen et al., 2011; Huang and Finegold, 2013). If health care providers cannot meet the

additional demand for their services generated by expanding insurance coverage, both newly

insured patients and patients who were previously covered might experience difficulty in

accessing care, undermining the case for expansion (Hofer et al., 2011; Kirch et al., 2013; Miller

and Wherry, 2017).

           Considerable evidence – dating back to the RAND Health Insurance Experiment of the

1970s and 1980s (Manning et al., 1987) – suggests that expanding health insurance coverage

encourages utilization, consistent with the fact that coverage lowers the effective price of

medical care. This literature has explored the effects of several important policy interventions.

In the United States alone, these interventions include Medicaid (Currie and Gruber, 1996a;

Dafny and Gruber, 2005; Baicker et al., 2013; Finkelstein et al., 2012; Taubman et al., 2014;

Tello-Trillo, 2016), Medicare (Lichtenberg, 2002; Card et al., 2008), the Massachusetts universal

coverage initiative (Miller, 2012a; Kolstad and Kowalski, 2012; Van der Wees et al., 2013), the

2010 expansion of coverage to young adults under the ACA (Sommers et al., 2013; Antwi et al.,

2015; Barbaresco et al., 2015) and the various ACA provisions that took effect in 2014

(Sommers et al., 2015; Courtemanche et al., 2017b; Simon et al., 2017; Miller and Wherry

2017). 3

           Whether increased utilization actually results in better health outcomes of patients is,

however, still an open question. There is strong evidence that the expansion of private insurance

coverage under the Massachusetts reform led to sizeable improvements in self-assessed health

and reductions in emergency room use (Kolstad and Kowalski, 2012; Miller, 2012b; Van der

3
  In a related study, Brot-Goldberg et al. (2017) documented an decrease in several aspects of health care utilization,
including emergency services, among employees of a large self-insured firm after a transition from free health care
to a high-deductible plan.

                                                           3
Wees et al., 2013; Courtemanche and Zapata, 2014). By contrast, despite improving self-

assessed health, the randomized Oregon Medicaid expansion had little to no impact on clinically

measured health outcomes, and actually led to an increase in emergency room utilization

(Baicker et al., 2013; Finkelstein et al., 2012; Taubman et al., 2014). The private insurance

portion of the ACA seems to have improved access to care, but the evidence with regard to its

effect on self-assessed health is decidedly mixed (Sommers et al., 2015; Courtemanche et al.,

2017b). Several studies have found that the Medicaid expansion under the ACA led to modest

access gains for patients, but had no discernable effect on self-assessed health (Sommers et al.,

2015; Courtemanche et al., 2017b; Simon et al., 2017).

         Despite the potential importance of capacity constraints in explaining the heterogeneous

effects of insurance coverage expansions described in the paragraph above, only a handful of

previous studies have focused on the supply-side of the market. 4 Garthwaite (2012) concluded

that physicians responded to the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) by

shortening office visits, while Kolstad and Kowalski’s results suggest that the 2006

Massachusetts reform led to shorter hospital stays. Kondo and Shigeoka (2013) found that

hospitals increased their capacity (as measured by number of beds) after the introduction of

universal health insurance in Japan, but there were no noteworthy changes in the numbers of

medical institutions, physicians, or nurses. Buchmueller et al. (2014) examined provider

behavior and patient wait times before and after several states expanded their Medicaid programs

to include dental benefits. These authors found that the use of hygienists increased when



4
 If providers are unable to fully meet new demand, they may give priority to more lucrative privately insured
patients, potentially explaining the heterogeneous effects of insurance expansions. Moreover, if capacity constraints
are less binding in wealthy states, this could explain why the expansion of private insurance coverage under the
Massachusetts reform led to sizeable improvements in self-assessed health and reductions in emergency room use,
while the Oregon Medicaid expansion led to an increase in emergency room use (Courtemanche et al., 2017b).


                                                          4
coverage was expanded, but dentists also responded by increasing their own work effort.

Nonetheless, wait times for patients rose “modestly” (Buchmueller et al., 2014, p. 3). 5

         We contribute to the small but growing literature on supply-side adjustments to insurance

expansions by investigating the effect of the ACA on ambulance response times. Our work

provides the first estimates of the effect of coverage expansion under the ACA on wait times for

any type of medical service. 6 Moreover, although a literature exists on emergency room wait

times and the practice of diverting ambulances to other hospitals in an effort to avoid

overcrowding (e.g. Schull et al., 2003; Wilper et al., 2008), only one previous study, by David

and Harrington (2010), has explored the determinants of ambulance response times, and these

authors did not examine the effects of expanding insurance coverage. 7

         Both Medicaid and Marketplace plans cover emergency medical services (Folger, 2015), 8

and enrollment in a public insurance program was a strong predictor of using ambulance

transport to the emergency room prior to the passage of the ACA (Rucker et al.,1997; Larkin et




5
  See also Friedson and Marier (2017), who described an influx of out-of-state physicians during the implementation
of the Massachusetts reform, a solution to capacity limitations that is clearly less viable in the case of a nationwide
reform such as the ACA. Using data from National Health Interview Survey, Miller and Wherry (2017) examined
the effect of Medicaid expansions under the ACA on various measures of access to care. These authors found that
low-income individuals living in expansion states were less likely to be shut out of care due to cost concerns, but
were more likely to delay care because they could not make an appointment with a physician.

6
 Polsky et al. (2015) found evidence that the temporary increase in the Medicaid reimbursement rate to primary care
providers under the ACA shortened wait times for enrollees, but these authors did not study the effect of coverage
expansions under the ACA.

7
 David and Harrington (2010) examined the influence of county demographics on ambulance response times. See
also David and Brachet (2011, p. 107), who examined the effect of “human capital accumulation” among EMS
workers on out-of-hospital time, which is defined as the time between ambulance dispatch and the return to the
hospital.

8
  Under the ACA, all health insurance plans offered to individuals both through exchanges and employers are
required to provide coverage for an Essential Health Benefits (EHB) package, which includes emergency ambulance
services (Folger, 2015). Emergency ambulance services are also covered by every state’s Medicaid program.


                                                          5
al., 2006). 9 If demand for ambulance services increased as a result of the ACA, there are several

reasons to suspect that the supply-side response may have been muted, particularly in the short

run. First, EMS personnel require considerable education and training, as well as certification,

and there is evidence that shortages of these personnel existed even before the ACA took effect

(Halpern, 2010). 10 Second, new ambulances can cost between $100,000 and $200,000,

representing a major investment for emergency medical service providers (Lindberg,

2011). Finally, relative to, for instance, primary care physicians or dentists, the capital-intensive

nature of ambulance services makes meeting new demand through working longer hours more

difficult, and shortening visits in an effort to accommodate more patients is not an option

available to EMS providers. Because the ACA was fully implemented only recently, we cannot

explore its long-run impact on ambulance response times.

           We begin by revisiting the effect of the ACA on insurance coverage, which can be

thought of as our first stage. Following Courtemanche et al. (2017a), we draw upon ACS data

and adopt an identification strategy that exploits temporal and geographic variation in the

implementation of the ACA as well as pre-treatment differences in uninsured rates. There are,

however, two key differences between our analysis and that of Courtemanche et al. (2017a).

First, we use pre-ACA insured rates at the county level rather than the core-based statistical area

(CBSA) level. Second, we add a second year (2015) of post-treatment data. Not surprisingly,

our results are quite similar to those of Courtemanche et al. (2017a). We find that the ACA

increased health insurance coverage by 5 percentage points in states that expanded Medicaid and


9
  Also see Ellis, Martins and Zhu (2017). Using data on 171 million person-months from MarketScan, the authors
found a price elasticity of demand for ambulance services of -1 among “forward-looking” individuals, suggesting
that extending insurance coverage under the ACA would increase utilization of ambulance services. Accordingly,
based on data from the National 911 Program (2014; 2015; 2016), we compute that 911 calls rose by 9% in the first
two years after full ACA implementation.
10
     Below, we test directly for changes in levels of EMS personnel in response to the implementation of the ACA.

by three percentage points in non-expansion states. The effect of the ACA on insurance

coverage appears to have been stronger in 2015 than it was in 2014.

        Next, we turn our attention to the impact of the ACA on ambulance response times using

data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) for the period 2010-2015 and the same

research design as was used to estimate the effects of the ACA on health insurance coverage.

We find that the ambulance response times increased substantially with the implementation of

the ACA. Specifically, our preferred estimates suggest that the expansions of private and

Medicaid coverage under the ACA combined to slow ambulance response times by almost two

minutes, or approximately 19 percent at the average uninsured rate. Because we find no

evidence that this increase can be explained by traffic congestion or local economic conditions,

we conclude that, through extending coverage to individuals who would have otherwise not

availed themselves of emergency medical services, the ACA led to a substantial increase in

ambulance response times.



                           2. THE ACA AND INSURANCE COVERAGE

        As noted in the introduction, several recent studies have examined the effect of the ACA

on health insurance coverage (Courtemanche et al., 2017a; Courtemanche et al., 2017b; Frean et

al., 2017). 11 Our interest in re-visiting this effect is twofold. First, we want to update the

Courtemanche et al. (2017a) estimates using information from the 2015 wave of the ACS, to

which these authors did not have access. Second, and more importantly, we want to exploit pre-

ACA differences in uninsured rates at the county, as opposed to the PUMA or CBSA, level

11
   Courtemanche et al.’s (2017b) focus was on estimating the effects of the ACA on access, risky health behaviors
such as drinking and smoking, and self-reported health. Frean et al. (2017) examined the effect of the various ACA
provisions (exchange premium subsidies, expanding Medicaid, and the individual mandate) on insurance coverage
using ACS data for the period 2012-2015.


                                                        7
because there are typically multiple ambulance response zones within a particular PUMA or

CBSA (Emergency Medical Services Authority of California, 2013; North Dakota Department of

Health, 2009; Central Region EMS and Trauma Care Council 2017) and the county is the finest

geographic unit available to researchers using the publicly available SAHIE data. 12 The first-

stage estimates, therefore, both motivate our subsequent analyses and add to the literature on the

ACA and coverage.

         Specifically, we use county-level data on insurance coverage rates from 2010-2015 from

the Small Area Health Insurance Estimates (SAHIE) program to estimate the following

difference-in-difference (DD) regression equation using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS):



(1) Insuredcst = α0 + α1Postt + α2 (Postt x Medicaid Expansions) + θc + εcst,



where the dependent variable, Insuredcst, is equal to the proportion of residents living in county c

and state s who were covered by health insurance in year t, and Postt is an indicator equal to 1 in

the years 2014 and 2015 (and equal to 0 otherwise). 13 Although a few components of the ACA


12
   Frean et al. (2017) used pre-ACA Medicaid eligibility rates at the Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) level. The
United States contains 2,071 PUMAs, each of which has at least 100,000 people. Courtemanche et al. (2017a)
calculated pre-ACA uninsured rates at the core-based statistical area (CBSA) level, while Courtemanche et al.
(2017b) divided states into 4 areas (urban, suburban, non-MSA, and unknown). Eighty percent of PUMAs, “map
into precisely one CBSA”, while the remainder map into two or more CBSAs (Courtemanche et al., 2017a, p. 183).
State or local governments typically work with ambulance operators to create semi-exclusive response zones. The
size of these zones can vary, but are typically much smaller than a PUMA. For example, the county of Los Angeles
has over 30 ambulance response zones and the city of Los Angeles has 7 response zones, while nearby (and largely
rural) Kern county has 11 ambulance response zones.

13
  The SAHIE insurance coverage estimates are based on ACS, which uses the 1% sample of Census respondents.
Our sample is restricted to counties with a population of more than 10,000, ensuring that the estimated pre-treatment
uninsured rate is based on at least 100 individuals in each county. ACS respondents are asked if they are currently
covered by “any of the following types of health insurance or health coverage plans”, where the choices include
“insurance though a current or former employer or union,” “insurance purchased directly from an insurance
company,” “Medicare,” “Medicaid, Medical Assistance, or any kind of government-assistance plan for those with
low incomes or a disability,” “TRICARE or other military health care,” “VA (including those who have ever used or
enrolled for VA health care),” “Indian Health Service,” and “any other type of health insurance or health coverage
plan.” Only those respondents who answered “no” to every type of insurance listed above are considered by the

                                                         8
took effect in 2010 (most notably, the requirement that dependents be allowed to stay on their

parents’ private insurance plans until the age of 26), the major components of the ACA came

into effect on January 1, 2014. Medicaid Expansions is an indicator equal to 1 if state s expanded

its Medicaid program under the ACA, and equal to 0 if it did not. 14 Because county fixed

effects, θc, are included, the Medicaid expansion indicator does not appear on the right-hand side

of equation (1) except when interacted with Postt. Standard errors are corrected for clustering at

the state level and all county-year level regressions are weighted by county population in the

2010 census.

        Estimates of equation (1) are reported in the first column of Table 1. Taken at face value,

they suggest that full implementation of the ACA led to a 5.7 percentage point increase in

coverage, while coverage went up by 4.3 percentage points in non-expansion states. However,

as noted by Courtemanche et al. (2017a, p. 187), estimates of α1 and α2 are suspect both because

insurance rates tend to fluctuate over time and because the decision to expand Medicaid

expansion could have been correlated with the unobserved determinants of these fluctuations.

        Given these issues, we report estimates of the following equation in the second column of

Table 1:



(2) Insuredcst = β0 + β1 (Postt x Uninsured2013c) + β2 (Postt x Uninsured2013c x Medicaid

Expansions) + θc + γst + εcst,

SAHIE program to have been uninsured. For more information on how the SAHIE are calculated see Bauder, Luery
and Szelepka (2017).
14
  Twenty-four states and Washington D.C. expanded their Medicaid programs on January 1, 2014. Seven states
expanded their Medicaid programs after this date. When interacted with Medicaid Expansions, the
variable Postt was coded as 1 if a state expanded their Medicaid program at any point during year t. We
experimented with coding Postt as fraction of the expansion year (for example coding Michigan, which expanded on
April 1, 2014 as .75 in 2014 and 1 in 2015). The results were essentially unchanged from those reported in Tables
1-9.


                                                       9
where Uninsured2013c is equal to the proportion of residents living in county c who had

coverage in 2013 and state-by-year fixed effects, 𝛾𝛾𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 , account for shocks to coverage at the state-

year level. 15 Equation (2) is analogous to a standard difference-in-differences-in differences

(DDD) equation, but instead of using an untreated control group, the effect of treatment (i.e.,

Medicaid expansion and the opening of the private insurance exchanges) depends upon the pre-

ACA uninsured rate in county c. 16 Specifically, the effect of the ACA in non-expansion states is

given by 𝛽𝛽1 x Uninsured2013c, while the effect of the ACA in expansion states is given by (𝛽𝛽1 +

𝛽𝛽2)Uninsured2013c. These effects are calculated at the mean of the pre-ACA uninsured rate,

𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈2013𝑐𝑐 , or 0.179.

         Estimates of equation (2) confirm that the ACA had a strong positive effect on coverage:

the estimates of β1 and β2 are positive and significant at conventional levels. At the mean of

Uninsured2013c, we calculate that non-expansion states experienced an increase of three

percentage points in their rate of coverage, while expansion states experienced an increase of 5

percentage points; expanding Medicaid without implementing the other major components of the

ACA is associated with a 2.1 percentage point increase in coverage.

         In Table 2, we explore whether the effect of the ACA on insurance coverage rates

changed between 2014 and 2015. Specifically, we report estimates of a modified equation (2), in

which the variable Postt is split into two separate indicators, one for 2014 and the other for 2015.

Consistent with the results of Frean et al. (2017), we find evidence that the effect of ACA on


15
  Because state-by-year and county fixed effects are included, the variables Postt and Uninsured2013c do not appear
on the right-hand side of equation (2) except when interacted with each other.

16
  Several previous studies have used a similar estimation strategy to examine the effects insurance expansions and
contractions. A non-exhaustive list of examples includes: Finklestein and McKnight (2008), Miller (2012b),
Mazumder and Miller (forthcoming), Tello-Trillo (2017), and Courtemanche et al. (2017a).

                                                        10
insurance coverage grew over time. We calculate that, at the mean of Uninsured2013c, non-

expansion states experienced a 3.7 percentage point increase in their rate of coverage by 2015,

while states that did expand their Medicaid program under the ACA experienced a 6.3

percentage point increase. These estimates are significantly larger than the estimates for 2014,

the year in which the ACA took effect.



                      3. THE ACA AND AMBULANCE RESPONSE TIMES

        Having established the effect of the ACA on coverage, we now turn our attention to the

effect of the ACA on ambulance response times. Our data come from FARS and cover the

period 2010-2015. Collected by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the FARS

data represent an annual census of fatal injuries suffered in motor vehicle crashes (MVCs) in the

United States. 17 Although insurance coverage clearly increased during the period under study,

EMS providers may not have had enough time or money to increase capacity. Thus, the

estimates discussed below should be thought of as short-run. In the long-run, providers could, in

theory, respond to increased demand by employing more EMS workers and ambulances.

        Detailed accident-level information is available in FARS, including the hour and minute

an accident occurred, the hour and minute EMS was notified, the hour and minute the first

ambulance arrived at the scene, and the hour and minute the first ambulance arrived at the

hospital. 18 However, notification and/or arrival times are missing for approximately 45% of the


17
  An accident is included in the FARS data if someone involved died within 30 days for reasons attributed to the
accident (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 2016).

18
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration obtains information on fatal vehicular accidents from a
variety of sources, including police crash reports, vehicle registration files, state highway department data,
emergency medical services records, police reports, toxicology reports, and death certificates. Ambulance response
times are measured as the difference between when an EMS provider was notified and the time of arrival at the
scene of the accident. FARS also includes information on when the ambulance returned to the hospital after the
accident.

                                                        11
MVCs in FARS during the period under study. In Appendix Table A1, we test for whether the

implementation of the ACA was associated with the probability that these times were missing

using a DDD-style strategy similar to equation (2). This exercise produced estimated

coefficients that are, without exception, small and statistically insignificant at conventional

levels, suggesting that selection is not an issue.

         If the implementation of the ACA did in fact lead to longer ambulance response times,

the results of several medical studies provide evidence that this phenomenon would have

decreased the odds of survival for MVC victims. For instance, Gonzalez et al. (2009) analyzed

data on MVCs and patient outcomes in Alabama for the period 2001-2002. These authors found

little evidence of a relationship between ambulance response times and the likelihood of survival

in urban areas, but in rural areas this relationship was negative and significant. 19 Durkin et al.

(2005), Zwerling et al. (2005), and Li et al. (2008), and Sánchez-Mangas et al. (2010) provide

additional evidence of a negative relationship between ambulance response times and the odds of

surviving a MVC, especially in rural settings where ambulance response times tend to be longer.

         To explore the effect of the ACA on ambulance response times, we begin by estimating a

DD equation of the following form:



(3) Response Timeacst = α0 + α1Postt + α2 (Postt x Medicaid Expansions) + 𝜶𝜶′3 Xacst+ θc + εacst,



where the dependent variable is the time (in minutes) that elapsed between when the EMS

provider was notified and when the ambulance first arrived on the scene of fatal accident a, in



19
  Gonzalez et al. (2009, p. 34) concluded that “protracted scene times” in rural, but not urban, areas may “contribute
to increased mortality.”


                                                         12
county c, state s, and year t. 20 Because the unit of observation is now the fatal accident, we are

able to add a vector of accident-specific controls. This vector, 𝑿𝑿𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 , includes indicators for

weather conditions at the time of the accident, an indicator for whether the accident occurred at

night, and an indicator for whether the accident occurred on a weekend. 21

         Estimates of equation (3) are reported in the first column of Table 3. Full implementation

of the ACA is associated with an increase in ambulance response times of 0.28 minutes, or

approximately 17 seconds, which is arguably too small to warrant the attention of policymakers.

However, a DD estimation strategy is, obviously, far from ideal (Courtemanche et al., 2017a, p.

186). In an effort to account for national- and state-level shocks to response times, we estimate a

DDD-style regression of the form:



(4) Response Timeacst = β0 + β1(Postt x Uninsured2013c) + β2(Postt x Uninsured2013c x

Medicaid Expansions) + 𝜷𝜷′3 Xacst+ θc + γst + εacst,



Estimates of β1 and β2, which are reported in the remaining columns of Table 3, can be thought

of as causal under the assumption that county-level uninsured rates in 2013 would have been

uncorrelated with the change in ambulance response times had the ACA not been implemented.

Our focus is on the estimated effect of the full ACA, which is calculated, as earlier, at the mean

of the pre-ACA uninsured rates, 𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈2013𝑐𝑐 . Specifically, the effect of the ACA in non-




20
  The response time is top-coded at 180 minutes, but the results discussed below are robust to the including the 15
accidents with response times above this threshold.

21
   The weather conditions indicators are for rain, sleet, snow, fog, wind, blowing dirt, cloud cover, blowing snow,
freezing rain, and other hazardous conditions. Means and standard deviations of all the variables used in the
accident-level regressions are shown in Appendix Table A2.


                                                         13
expansion states is given by β1 x 𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈2013𝑐𝑐 , while the effect of the ACA in expansion

states is given by (β1 + β2) 𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈2013𝑐𝑐 .

        Without controlling for the variables in the vector 𝑿𝑿𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 , full implementation of the ACA

is associated with an increase in ambulance response times of 1.8 minutes (i.e., one minute and

48 seconds), which represents an almost 18 percent increase relative to the mean of 10.08.

Controlling for the variables in the vector 𝑿𝑿𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 , full implementation of the ACA is associated

with an increase in ambulance response times of 1.89 minutes, or almost 19 percent relative to

the mean.



3.1. Adopting response-time cutoffs from the medical literature

        Medical researchers interested in the determinants of trauma survival have often focused

on whether EMS workers arrived within a specified period of time. For instance, Pons et al.

(2005) found that the odds of survival were reduced by 30% if an ambulance failed to arrive on

scene within 4 minutes. 22 By contrast, these authors found that failure to arrive within 8 minutes

was not associated with the odds of survival (Pons et al., 2005). 23 The National Fire Protection

Association (NFPA), which publishes guidelines for the operation of all emergency services,

recommends a 4 minute response time for basic life support and an 8 minute response time for

advanced life support (NFPA 2010).




22
   See also Blackwell and Kaufman (2002), who found that the risk of patient death increased threefold if EMS
workers failed to arrive on scene within 5 minutes of receiving an emergency call. Newgard et al. (2010) examined
whether the time elapsed from when EMS workers arrived on scene and when the patient was admitted to the
hospital. These authors concluded that reducing this time had no effect on the odds of patient survival.

23
  The 8-minute cutoff was chosen by Pons et al. (2005) because it is “commonly accepted” that EMS personnel
should arrive on scene within 8 minutes of notification (Shah, 2006, p. 420). In fact, many EMS contracts stipulate
response times of less than 8 minutes for 90% of emergency calls (Pons and Markovchick, 2002).


                                                          14
       In Table 4, we re-estimate equation (4), replacing Response Time, which is measured in

minutes, with an indicator for whether the ambulance failed to arrive within a particular window.

Specifically, we consider 4 cutoffs: failure to arrive within 4 minutes, 8 minutes, 13 minutes,

and 20 minutes. The 4-minute cutoff is based on Pons et al. (2005) and has been used by other

medical researchers (Eisenberg et al., 1984; Callaham and Madsen, 1996). The 8-minute cutoff

can be thought of as the EMS industry standard (Pons and Markovchick, 2002; Shah, 2006;

NFPA, 2010) and corresponds to the median ambulance response time observed in FARS. The

13- and 20-minute cutoffs correspond to the 75th and 90th pre-ACA percentiles of ambulance

response times in the FARS data.

       The results suggest that implementation of the ACA had little impact on whether

ambulances arrived within 4 minutes, the cutoff proposed by Pons et al. (2005). Not only are the

estimated coefficients reported in column (1) of Table 4 statistically insignificant, they are also

extremely small relative to the mean of the dependent variable. 0.79. By contrast, there is strong

evidence that the ACA resulted in fewer ambulances arriving within 8 minutes, the EMS

industry standard: at the mean of the pre-ACA uninsured rate, full implementation is associated

with an increase of 0.096 in the probability of not arriving within 8 minutes, a 21% increase

relative to the mean of 0.45. Full implementation is also associated with an increase of 0.093 in

the probability of not arriving within 13 minutes, a 43% increase relative to the mean

(0.093/0.216 = 0.431). The estimated effect of full implementation on the probability of not

arriving within 20 minutes is 0.049, which represents an almost 60% increase relative to the

mean (0.049/0.084 = 0.583).




                                                 15
3.2. The effects of the ACA on other outcomes

        Up to this point in the analysis, we have focused on ambulance response times, but FARS

also contains information on hospital arrival times. In the first column of Table 5, we report

estimates of equation (4) in which response time is replaced with the time (in minutes) that

elapsed between when the ambulance arrived at the scene of the accident and when it arrived at

the hospital. If the closest emergency department is too congested, ambulances are routinely

diverted to less busy, but more distant, emergency departments (Schull et al., 2003). Therefore,

implementation of the ACA could have affected this alternative outcome through emergency

room congestion (Schull et al., 2003; Wilper et al., 2008; Garthwaite et al., 2017). Full

implementation is, in fact, associated with an increase in time to hospital of 1.27 minutes.

However, this estimate is not significant at conventional levels. Moreover, it is quite modest in

terms of magnitude, representing a 3% increase relative to the mean (1.27/42.86 = 0.030).

        Next, we explore whether the ACA affected fatal accident totals in FARS. If ambulances

were indeed slower to arrive on scene, this could have reduced the likelihood of survival (Durkin

et al., 2005; Zwerling et al., 2005; Li et al. 2008; Gonzalez et al., 2009; Sánchez-Mangas, 2010)

and, as a consequence, increased the total number of fatal accidents observed in FARS, which

represents a complete census of all fatal MVCs. 24 To conduct this analysis, we collapsed the

FARS data into county-year cells and estimated equation (4) using the total number of fatalities

in county c and year t as the outcome. The results are reported in the second column of Table 5.

Full implementation of the ACA is associated with 5.17 additional fatal accidents per county-

year. Although sizeable (the mean number of fatalities per county-year was 6.13), because this

24
   Recall that FARS does not include information on non-fatal accidents. If an injured driver or passenger survived
because an ambulance arrived quickly, then information on the accident that produced the injury would not be
included in FARS. Below, we show that the implementation of the ACA did not affect accident observables in the
FARS data, suggesting any shift the underlying accident-generating process was negligible.


                                                        16
estimate is not statistically significant we cannot rule out the possibility that the ACA had no

effect on the total number of fatal accidents. Likewise, implementation of the ACA is associated

with 5.38 additional fatalities resulting from MVCs, but again this estimate is not statistically

significant at conventional levels.

        Finally, we used data from the County Business Patterns, published by the Census

Bureau, to construct two additional outcomes: (1) the number of workers who provided

ambulance services in county c and year t, and (2) the average salary of these workers in county

c and year t. 25 Estimates of equation (4) using these alternative outcomes are reported in the

remaining columns of Table 5. These estimates provide little evidence that the ACA led to

changes in the supply of EMS services, at least in the short run.



3.3. Specification checks

        In this section, we present results from a variety of regressions with the goal of ruling out

potential endogeneity concerns. As a test of the parallel trends assumption, we estimate an

event-study model that interacts treatment (i.e., Uninsured and Uninsured x Medicaid

Expansion) with the full set of year fixed effects (omitting 2013 as the base year). If the

identifying assumptions of the DDD model hold, the estimated coefficients of these interactions

should be statistically indistinguishable from zero. In the top panel of Table 6, we report the

event-study results for the ambulance response outcomes using the full set of controls. The

effect of full implementation in the post-ACA period is, as before, given the in the bottom panel

of Table 6. There are 24 falsification tests (6 parameters of interest in each of 4 regressions), but

only one significant estimate at the 5% level. This is less than would be expected by chance and

25
  Specifically, we constructed employee counts and average annual salary (total annual payroll divided by
employees) using the NAICS code 621910 (ambulance services). Counties had to have at least three establishments
that provided ambulance services.

                                                      17
provides assurance that the estimates in the bottom panel of Table 6 can be thought of

representing the causal effects of ACA.

       Next, because traffic congestion can have a powerful effect on ambulance response times

(Peters and Hall, 1999; Lee and Fazio, 2005; Ghosh et al., 2014), it also represents a potential

threat to our preferred identification strategy. If, for instance, the 2013 uninsured rate were

positively correlated with the change in congestion from 2013 to the post-ACA period, this could

impart an upwards bias to our estimates of the relationship between the ACA and ambulance

response times. To address this potential source of bias, we utilized information from the

“Urban Mobility Scorecard”, produced by the Texas A&M Transportation Institute.

Specifically, we included two new controls on the right-hand side of equation (4), both of which

are available on an annual basis for 101 metropolitan areas in the United States: the first, Hours

Lost to Traffic, is equal to the average time spent by commuters waiting in traffic per year; the

second, the Time Index, is calculated as the ratio of peak-period travel time to free-flow travel

time faced by commuters.

       The results of this exercise, reported in Table 7, provide no evidence that the interactions

Post x Uninsured and Post x Uninsured x Medicaid Expansion are somehow capturing the

influence of traffic congestion. In column (1) of Table 7, we show the effect of the ACA on

ambulance response times in counties that belong to the 101 U.S. metropolitan areas for which

we have information on traffic congestion. Full implementation is associated with an increase in

response times of 3.31 minutes, an estimate which is considerably larger than the estimated first

reported in Table 3. This result provides additional evidence that the effect of the ACA on

ambulance response times was more pronounced in more populous, urban counties. In the

second and third columns of Table 7, we control for traffic congestion by including Hours Lost



                                                 18
to Traffic and the Time Index on the right-hand side of equation (4). The resulting estimates of

the effect of full implementation are statistically significant and are of comparable magnitude to

the estimate in the first column of Table 7, suggesting that the relationship between pre-ACA

uninsured rates and ambulance response times is not simply a reflection of worsening traffic. 26

         In Table 8, we explore the sensitivity of our estimates to controlling for local economic

conditions, an important driver of pre-ACA uninsured rates. Specifically, we report estimates of

equation (4) with median household income, the poverty rate and the unemployment rate in the

vector 𝑿𝑿𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 . These measures were obtained from published sources and are at the county-year

level. 27 The results suggest that the relationship between pre-ACA uninsured rates and

ambulance response times is not a reflection of local economic conditions.

         Up to this point, we have excluded counties with a population of less than 10,000 from

our analyses in an effort to ensure that the pre-ACA uninsured rate estimates were sufficiently

precise. In Appendix Table A6, we explore whether our results are robust to removing this

exclusion. In addition, we experiment with excluding counties with population less than 20,000

as well as excluding counties with a population of less than 30,000. The estimated effect of the

ACA on ambulance response times is positive and significant across these different samples, but

26
  In Appendix Table A3, we test if the relationship between the ACA and whether an ambulance arrived within 8
minutes is sensitive to controlling for these same traffic congestion measures. In Appendix Tables A4 and A5, we
report estimates of equation (4) controlling for 4 proxies of traffic congestion at the county-year level: employment
in “support activities for road transportation” (NAICS code 4884), average concentration of carbon monoxide (CO),
average concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and a measure of fine particulate pollution. Information on
NAICS code 4884 employment was obtained from County Business Patterns, published by the Census Bureau.
Information on pollution levels was obtained from the Air Quality System database, collected by the Environmental
Protection Agency. We focused on these pollutants because nationally 50% of carbon monoxide emissions are
caused by motor vehicles, 34% of nitrogen dioxide emissions are caused by motor vehicles, and 11% of fine
particulate matter (PM 2.5) is caused by motor vehicle emissions (Ernst, Corless and Greene-Roesel 2003). The
results provide no evidence that the relationship between pre-ACA uninsured rates and ambulance response times is
not a reflection of worsening traffic.
27
  Data on median household income, the poverty rate, and population are from SAIPE (Small Area Income and
Poverty Estimates), produced by the U.S. Census Bureau. County-by-year estimates of the local unemployment rate
are from LAUS (Local Area Unemployment Statistics), produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.


                                                         19
becomes larger as we focus on more populous counties. 28 Our baseline sample selection criteria

can therefore be considered conservative. 29

        In a final set of specification checks, we examined whether the implementation of the

ACA was associated with changes in accident observables. Specifically, we regressed the

personal characteristics of people killed in MVCs (i.e., race, gender, age) on Post x Uninsured,

Post x Uninsured x Medicaid Expansion, a set of county indicators, and year-by-state indicators.

In addition, we regressed measures of accident victims’ behavior (e.g., an indicator for whether

the victim was wearing a seat belt, and an indicator for whether the driver’s Blood Alcohol

Content was over the legal limit) and other MVC observables on these same right-hand-side

variables. Because a MVC must produce at least one fatality to be included in FARS, any

association between the implementation of the ACA and accident victim characteristics could

reflect a shift in the underlying accident-generating process. For instance, although not

statistically significant, the estimates reported earlier in Table 5 raise the possibility that full

implementation of the ACA led to substantially more traffic fatalities and fatal MVCs.

Econometrically, it is not obvious that this phenomenon, in and of itself, would bias our

estimates, but changes in accident observables could potentially explain the post-ACA increase

in ambulance response times. The results of this exercise are reported in Appendix Tables A8-


28
   For instance, when we exclude counties with a population of less than 30,000 from the analysis, full
implementation is associated with an increase in ambulance response times of 2.74 minutes, which is almost 45%
larger than our original estimate reported in Table 3.
29
   Table A7 reports the results from additional robustness checks. Twenty states and the District of Columbia
partially expanded Medicaid under the ACA prior to 2014. Following Kaestner et al. (2015), we experimented with
excluding states from the analysis that partially expanded Medicaid under the ACA prior to 2014 but did not fully
expand on January 1, 2014 (IN, ME, TN, WI, DE, DC, MA, NY and VT). We also experimented with excluding
states from the analysis that partially expanded Medicaid under the ACA and fully expanded on January 1, 2014
(AZ, CA, CT, CO, HI, IL, IA, MD, MN, NJ, OR, RI and WA). The results are qualitatively similar to those
reported in Table 3. Finally, we re-estimated the relationship between the ACA and response times using the
average uninsured rate from 2011-2013 instead of the 2013 uninsured rate. Again, the results are qualitatively
similar to those reported in Table 3.


                                                       20
A9. Although we ran 17 separate regressions, only one produced a statistically significant

estimate of full implementation. The other estimates of full implementation were, without

exception, small and statistically insignificant. This pattern of results is consistent with the

hypothesis that the observed increase in ambulance response time is due to the ACA rather than

other factors, including endogenous selection into the sample, correlated with the intensity of

treatment.



                                         4. CONCLUSION

       A substantial literature examines the potential benefits of health insurance expansions on

access to medical care and various health outcomes, but relatively few studies have explored a

potential pitfall: the inability of providers of health care services to keep up with demand,

causing capacity shortfalls, at least in the short term. We help fill this void by leveraging

variation in county pre-treatment uninsured rates and state Medicaid expansions to explore

whether implementation of the ACA led to an increase in ambulance response times.

       Our estimates suggest that, after two years, full implementation of the ACA led to an

increase in insurance coverage of approximately 5 percentage points and an increase in

ambulance response time of 1.89 minutes (or one minute and 53 seconds). Together, these

estimates suggest that every percentage point increase in insurance enrollment in a given county

due to the ACA slowed down ambulances in that county by approximately 22.8 seconds, which

implies a short run elasticity of ambulance response time with respect to insurance enrollment of

3.2.

       In addition to examining the effect of the ACA on response times in minutes, we

considered two cutoffs from the medical literature: failure to arrive within 4 minutes, and failure



                                                  21
to arrive within 8 minutes. Our results suggest that every percentage point increase in insurance

enrollment led to an almost 0.02 percentage point increase in the probability of an ambulance

arriving after 8 minutes, the industry-recommended response time. However, we found no

evidence that the ACA affected the probability of responding after 4 minutes, which Pons et al.

(2005) suggest may be more relevant for MVC patient outcomes than the 8-minute cutoff.

       While the nature of the FARS data required that we focus on MVCs, our results likely

have implications for non-MVC emergencies as well. Cardiac arrest survival is particularly

sensitive to ambulance response times, (Pell et al., 2001; Vukmir, 2006; O’Keeffe et al., 2011),

with the most recent study finding that a one-minute reduction in response time was associated

with a 24 percent improvement in survival odds. There is additional research showing that when

distance travelled is used as an instrument for response time, a one-minute increase in response

time increases mortality risk for all emergencies by 8 to 17 percent (Wilde 2012). Therefore, if

the response times in the FARS are representative of all ambulances, then the estimated

ambulance slowdowns may have had a profound impact on patient outcomes for non-MVC

emergencies.

       We present suggestive evidence supporting the external validity of our estimates in Table

9. Table 9 reports average ambulance response times for all ambulances based on public reports

put out by several cities and by the state of Florida. Alongside those averages, Table 9 reports

the average response time for the corresponding location based on the FARS. The averages are

quite similar, making the argument that our results generalize to all ambulances and not just

those responding to fatal MVCs plausible. If this is the case, then the short run ambulance

slowdowns due to the ACA were likely quite costly in terms of patient outcomes given the large




                                                22
magnitudes found for the effect of response time on patient outcomes for events such as cardiac

arrest (Pell et al., 2001; Vukmir, 2006; O’Keeffe et al., 2011).

       Finally, note that we provide only one piece of a much larger puzzle with regard to

evaluating the costs and benefits of the ACA. Even if the ACA increased wait times for various

medical services, the resulting welfare losses should be evaluated alongside other factors such as

the costs of the Medicaid expansion and subsidies and the welfare gains from risk protection and,

potentially, improved health. Moreover, it is possible that the increase in wait times could prove

to be transitory, as adjusting the quantity of medical services provided may be more feasible in

the long run than the short run. Nonetheless, our research provides a novel addition to the body

of evidence on provider shortages and their implications for policy.

Notes: In the first column, we report OLS estimates from an accident-level regression. The regressions in the
remaining columns are at the county-year level and are weighted by county population from the 2010 Census. Data
are from the period 2010-2015. Standard errors, corrected for clustering at the state level, are in parentheses.
Accidents that occurred in counties with a population of less than 10,000 are excluded from the analysis.
