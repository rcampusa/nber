Household Debt Overhang Did Hardly Cause a Larger Spending Fall during the Financial
Crisis in the UK

                                          ABSTRACT

The "debt-overhang hypothesis" ­ that households cut back more on their spending in a crisis
when they have higher levels of outstanding mortgage debt (Dynan, 2012) ­ seems to be taken for
granted by macroprudential authorities in several countries in their policy decisions, as well as by
the international organizations that evaluate and comment on countries' macroprudential policy.
Results are presented for UK microdata that reject the debt-overhang hypothesis. The results
instead support the "spending-normalization hypothesis" of Andersen, Duus, and Jensen (2016a),
what can also be called the "debt-financed overspending" hypothesis ­ that the correlation
between high pre-crisis household indebtedness and subsequent spending cuts during the crisis
reflects high debt-financed spending pre-crisis and a return to normal spending during the crisis.
As discussed in Svensson (2019, 2020), this is consistent with the correlation reflecting debt-
financed overspending through what Muellbauer (2012) calls the "housing-collateral household
demand" and Mian and Sufi (2018) the "debt-driven household demand" channel. The
correlation is thus spurious and an example of omitted-variable bias. A simple model shows that
consumption and debt changes are directly and strongly positively correlated, whereas
consumption and debt levels are quite weakly negatively correlated. Importantly, and in contrast,
examples show that there is no systematic relation between consumption cuts and levels of or
changes in LTV ratios. The lack of a robust relation between consumption cuts and levels of or
changes in LTV ratios implies that tests of these hypotheses should generally not be done by
regressions of consumption cuts on levels of or changes in LTV ratios.

1        Introduction
At the micro level, several papers--including Mian and Sufi (2010) and Dynan (2012) for
the US, Andersen, Duus, and Jensen (2016a) (ADJ) for Denmark, and Bunn and Rostom
(2014, 2015) for the UK--have established a correlation between the level of household
indebtedness before the Global Financial Crisis and consumption spending cuts during the
crisis. But, as emphasized by ADJ, the mechanism behind this correlation has not been
well understood. A common interpretation is indeed that the correlation reflects a negative
causal impact of pre-crisis household indebtedness on spending cuts during the crisis, what
can be called the "debt-overhang hypothesis" (Dynan, 2012). ADJ calls this interpretation
the "household balance-sheet hypothesis." One potential mechanism behind such a causal
effect is that households having high levels of debt prior to the crisis were suddenly facing
binding borrowing constraints when the crisis broke out and therefore cut spending. Another
is that the housing-wealth loss due to falling housing prices and even finding themselves
"underwater" induced highly indebted households to delever. A third is that highly levered
households cut spending voluntarily due to precautionary motives.
    The debt-overhang hypothesis seems to be taken for granted by macroprudential au-
thorities in several countries, as well as by the international organizations that comment
on countries' macroprudential policy. Here are two examples, from Finansinspektionen (the
Swedish FSA) and the Bank of England:1

         The risks associated with household debt are primarily related to the possibility
         that highly indebted households may sharply reduce their consumption in the
         event of a macroeconomic shock. This development was noted in other coun-
         tries during the financial crisis in 2008­2009. If many households reduce their
         consumption at the same time, this can amplify an economic downturn. (Fi-
         nansinspektionen, 2017, p. 1)
         [H]ighly indebted households are more likely to cut their consumption sharply to
         keep paying their mortgages, deepening the economic downturn. (Carney, 2020,
         p. 20)

    However, ADJ emphasize that the correlation between pre-crisis indebtedness and subse-
quent spending cuts during the crisis could also reflect that the high debt level among some
households was simply the result of high debt-financed spending in previous years, while the
subsequent drop in spending reflected a return to normal levels. In this latter interpreta-
tion, the observed correlation does not reflect a causal effect from high debt on spending.
ADJ (p. 99­100) refer to this mechanism as the "spending-normalization hypothesis." Thus,
according to this hypothesis, some households decided to temporarily boost their spending
    1
        See Svensson (2019, 2020) for examples from the international organizations.


                                                       1
to high levels relative to their income before the crisis. Financed by borrowing, the high
spending level pushed up pre-crisis debt-to-income ratios for these households. But since the
spending boost was only temporary, spending subsequently dropped more for these house-
holds than for others, thus generating a negative correlation between pre-crisis indebtedness
and spending growth during the crisis.
    In examining the Danish microdata, ADJ first find a strong negative correlation between
pre-crisis indebtedness of households and the change in spending during the crisis. Then they
show that this reflects that highly indebted households spent a larger share of their income
than their less-indebted peers prior to the crisis. During the crisis the spending share of their
income fell back to a normal level. This is consistent with these households having borrowed
in order to finance overspending relative to income pre-crisis, resulting in larger increases in
debt for these households in these years. This borrowing and the overconsumption ceased
during the crisis, and spending fell back to a normal level. In particular, once ADJ condition
on the size of the pre-crisis change in debt, a high level of debt is no longer associated with
a larger spending decline. Thus, they reject the debt-overhang hypothesis for Denmark and
find support for their spending-normalization hypothesis.
    A possible explanations to such a temporary increase in spending pre-crisis is a credit
supply shocks, for example, through lower lending standards (Mian and Sufi, 2018). Suppose
that some households used easy access to credit before the crisis to borrow large amounts
for spending purposes, thus elevating their spending very much relative to their income. If
these households were no longer able to borrow because of tighter credit restrictions after
the crisis broke out, they would then have to reduce spending, prompting a large decline
relative to the pre-crisis level. An alternative explanation centers on expectations for future
income (Kaplan, Mitman, and Violante, 2019): Suppose some households had unusually
optimistic expectations about future income growth. According to the life-cycle model,
those households would have spent a higher fraction of their income than less optimistic
households. But the fact that these households were unusually optimistic before the crisis
may also imply that they lowered their expectations about future income more than others
once the crisis hit, prompting a larger cut in spending. Another alternative explanation
mentioned by ADJ is that the indebtedness-spending correlation is related to the timing
of purchases of large durable consumption goods, such as cars: Households that happened
to buy a car in 2007 most likely saw a large upwards spike in spending in that year. If
most of them realistically did not buy a car again within the next two years, the spike in
spending was then followed by a large subsequent drop. If financed by borrowing, the car
purchase would at the same time have implied a significant increase in debt in 2007 for these
households. Under these circumstances, perhaps even random differences in the timing of
purchase of large durables can potentially explain the observed correlation between pre-crisis


                                               2
leverage and weak subsequent spending growth.2
    As an additional possible explanation, Svensson (2019, 2020) emphasizes debt-financed
overspending through what Muellbauer (2012) calls the "housing-collateral consumption de-
mand channel " and Mian and Sufi (2018) call the "debt-driven household demand channel."
Through this channel, housing prices--or, more precisely, changes in housing prices--can
affect household consumption. As housing prices rose before the crisis, many households
increased their mortgages through housing-equity withdrawal (HEW) in order to finance
overspending relative to their income. This showed up in a lower household saving rate.
When the crisis hit and housing prices stopped rising and began to fall, further HEW was
no longer possible. When the overspending ceased, spending fell back to a more normal level
in relation to income and the saving rate rose. The housing-collateral channel--with HEW
used for consumption--was not only operating in Denmark, Australia, and the UK before
and during the crisis, but also in the US.3 4
    The ADJ results thus reject the debt-overhang hypothesis for Denmark and support the
spending-normalization/debt-financed overspending hypothesis. A most relevant question is
whether or not the ADJ results hold for other countries.
    In a companion paper to the present one, Svensson (2021) shows that the ADJ results
hold also for Australian microdata, so the debt-overhang hypothesis is rejected also for these
Australian data and the spending-normalization/debt-financed overspending hypothesis is
supported.5
   2
      ADJ (p. 113) separately examine whether the observed borrowing and spending pattern can be entirely
explained by car purchases. They find that the share of households with large debt increases that purchased
a new car in 2007 was much higher than for other households, but it was still only about 15 percent. For
the remaining 85 percent of these households, something else than car purchases must have been behind the
large increase in debt and subsequent drop in spending.
    3
      As discussed in Price et al. (2019, appendix B) and La Cava et al. (2016), there are institutional features
of the Australian mortgage market in the form of so-called offset or redraw facilites that most borrowers have
attached to their mortgages. These make housing equity more liquid than otherwise and provide convenient
ways to withdraw housing equity for spending purposes.
    4
      As noted by Guren et al. (2019, p. 1): "In the mid-2000s boom and subsequent bust, housing wealth
extraction through the mortgage market boosted consumption in the boom and reduced consumption in the
bust (e.g., Mian and Sufi, 2011; Mian et al., 2013)."
    5
      For Australia, Price, Beckers, and La Cava (2019) provide an extensive and thorough exploration of the
relationship between owner-occupier mortgage debt and the level of spending in Australia, using detailed
HILDA panel microdata on households. They focus on the level of spending in a give year, not on the fall in
spending during the crisis years. In particular, they examine whether high levels of household debt causes
a weaker levels of spending, what they call a "debt-overhang effect "--to be distinguished from what is here
called the debt-overhang hypothesis, which refers to the effect of high debt levels on the fall in spending
during the crisis years, as in Mian and Sufi (2010) and Dynan (2012) for the US, ADJ for Denmark, Bunn
and Rostom (2014, 2015) for the UK, and Svensson (2021) for Australia. Price et al. (2019) do indeed find
evidence of a debt-overhang effect. They furthermore conclude that this debt-overhang effect is not driven by
the spending-normalization hypothesis of ADJ. However, they do not test this hypothesis by running exactly
the same regressions as ADJ have done. Running the same regressions as ADJ, Svensson (2021) shows that
the ADJ results also hold for the HILDA microdata, that the debt-overhang hypothesis is rejected, and that



                                                       3
    Regarding the UK, Bunn and Rostom (2014, 2015) have been frequently cited in support
of the debt-overhang hypothesis for the UK.6 In Svensson (2019, pp. 34­38), I scrutinized the
results of Bunn and Rostom (2015) (BR) and compared them to those of ADJ. I concluded
that, although BR establish the correlation between pre-crisis household indebtedness and
consumption cuts during the crisis, they did not explicitly claim causality. Given other evi-
dence of HEW-financed overconsumption and similarities between the Danish and UK data,
I concluded that the BR results did not contradict those of ADJ and that the data were
actually fully consistent with the spending-normalization/debt-financed overspending hy-
pothesis. However, results of the crucial regressions with changes in household indebtedness
added as regressors were not published.
    The present paper tests the debt-overhang and spending-normalization/debt-finance hy-
pothesis for the UK by including the missing regressions, on the same microdata as those that
BR used. Indeed, the debt-overhang hypothesis is rejected for this data and the spending-
normalization/debt-financed overspending hypothesis is supported.
    A very simple model of debt-financed overconsumption--with a home-owning hand-to-
mouth household facing a loan-to-value (LTV) constraint--shows that consumption and
debt changes are directly and strongly positively correlated, whereas consumption and
debt levels are quite weakly negatively correlated. Furthermore, at tests of the debt-
overhang and spending-normalization/debt-financed overconsumption hypotheses any nor-
malization/scaling should divide consumption cuts, debt levels, and debt changes by the
same variable. Importantly, simple examples show that there need not be any systematic
relation between consumption cuts and levels of or changes in housing prices and LTV ratios.
This is because housing-price falls that lead to violated LTV constraints normally do not
require mortgagors to reduce their mortgages. There are no margin calls for mortgagors.
The lack of a robust relation between consumption cuts and levels of or changes in LTV ra-
tios implies that tests of these hypotheses should not be done by regressions of consumption
cuts on levels of LTV ratios--as in Dynan (2012) and some regressions in Bunn and Rostom
(2015)--or changes in LTV ratios.
    The paper is outlined as follows. Section 2 presents the simplest possible model of
debt-financed overconsumption. Section 3 reports the relevant ADJ results for the Danish
microdata. Section 4 presents the results for UK the microdata. Section 5 presents some
conclusions.
the spending-normalization/debt-financed overspending hypothesis is supported.
  Kearns, Major, and Norman (2020) provide a both broad and detailed analysis of the riskiness of Australian
household debt, including stress tests of banks and households. One of their results is that "the household
DTI ratio is a poor measure of the extent of risk [posed by Australian household debt]."

2       The simplest model of debt-financed overconsump-
        tion through the housing-collateral channel
In order to set up the simplest model of debt-financed overconsumption through the housing-
collateral channel, consider a credit- and liquidity-constrained household with owner-occupied
housing. Let it be a (wealthy) hand-to-mouth (HTM) household (Campbell and Mankiw,
1989; Kaplan, Violante, and Weidner, 2014; La Cava, Hughson, and Kaplan, 2016) with the
the simple budget constraint

                                       Ct = EIt - it Dt-1 + Dt .                                       (2.1)

where Ct denotes nominal (non-housing) consumption (spending) during year t, EIt denotes
the household's (after-tax) earned income, Dt denotes nominal mortgage debt held at the
end of year t, it denotes the (after-tax) nominal interest rate paid in year t on nominal debt
held at the end of year t - 1, and Dt  Dt - Dt-1 denotes the annual change in debt.
The household does not receive any transfers, owns no assets except its housing, and has no
liabilities except its mortgage debt. For simplicity, there is no operation and maintenance
cost of housing, and thus no depreciation of the housing.7
    The right-hand side of (2.1) is a measure of the household's cash-flow surplus available
for consumption and saving, that is, earned income minus interest payments plus the debt
increase. An HTM household uses all the available cash-flow surplus for (non-housing) con-
sumption and does not save anything in cash or other liquid assets. The implicit assumption
is that the household is credit- and liquidity-constrained to consume less than it would pre-
fer. Its rate of time preference is higher than the interest rate, so the household would prefer
to increase its current consumption by borrowing more, if it could.
    By (2.1),
                                  Ct                Ct
                                        = 1 and           = - it .                         (2.2)
                                  Dt               Dt-1
The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) out of a higher debt increase is positive and
unity, whereas the MPC out of a higher (lagged) debt level is small and negative, because
the interest rate is much smaller than unity. For an interest rate of 4%, the magnitude of
the MPC out of a higher debt increase is 25 times the magnitude of the MPC out of a higher
debt level.8
    7
     The simple model is extended to include mandatory amortization in (Svensson, 2021, appendix A).
    8
      We can also see that Ct /it = -Dt-1 . The consumption of highly-indebted HTM households is
very sensitive to the interest rate. This is the cash-flow channel of monetary policy (La Cava et al., 2016;
Flod´en et al., 2018). It implies that highly indebted households with variable interest rates benefit from
lower interest rates in crises. With flexible exchange rates and flexible inflation targeting, interest rates
become low in recessions. Thus, high debt and variable interest rates provide indebted households with some
insurance against bad times (Svensson, 2020, section 3.2).


                                                     5
    Clearly, here variations in debt changes will have a much larger effect on fluctuations in
current consumption than differences in the lagged debt level.
    Assume that the household is subject to a loan-to-value constraint, if it wants to increase
its debt,
                                    Dt  Pt if Dt > 0.                                     (2.3)
Here  denotes the LTV cap (for example, 85%) and Pt denotes the nominal price of the
household's housing in year t. Restricting the LTV constraint to apply only when debt is
increased implies the realistic property of LTV constraints that the household does not have
to reduce its debt if housing prices fall and cause the LTV constraint to be violated. (There
are no margin calls for mortgage debt.)
    Because the household is constrained to consume less than it would prefer, it takes out
the maximum possible mortgage--maximizes HEW--each year. If the LTV constraint is not
violated at an unchanged debt level, the household will borrow to make or keep the LTV
constraint binding. If housing prices have fallen so as to cause the LTV constraint to be
violated, the household will keep the debt level constant,
                                       
                                       P
                                            t    if Dt-1  Pt ,
                                 Dt =                                                    (2.4)
                                       Dt-1 if Dt-1 > Pt .

   Suppose prices are--and have been--non-decreasing, Pt  0, so the the household will
keep the LTV constraint (2.3) binding, Dt = Pt . It then follows from (2.1) that

                    Ct = EIt - it Pt-1 + Pt              if Pt-1  0 and Pt  0.                        (2.5)

Consumption will be very sensitive to changes in housing prices (as long as housing prices
are nondecreasing). This is an example of the housing-collateral household-demand channel
with a binding LTV constraint. Thus, the housing-collateral channel is a channel through
which housing prices affect consumption.9
    The household's disposable income equals earned income plus capital income (which is
negative here) plus imputed rental income from ownership of the housing.10 Introduce DIXt ,
disposable income excluding imputed rental income, which then equals earned income plus
capital income,
                                    DIXt  EIt - it Dt-1 .                             (2.6)
   9
      See Muellbauer (2012), Mian and Sufi (2018), and Svensson (2019, 2020) for further discussion of the
housing-collateral/debt-driven household demand channel.
   10
      The imputed rental income from owner-occupied housing in year t in theory equals the user cost of
housing in year t. In the absence of any operation and maintenance cost and under the simplifying assumption
that the cost of housing equity equals the mortgage interest rate, the user cost equals
[it+1 Pt - (1 -  )Pt+1 ]/(1 + it+1 ), where  is the (nominal) capital-gains tax on housing.



                                                     6
Then the budget constraint can be written

                                         Ct = DIXt + Dt .                                    (2.7)

(Non-housing) consumption (spending) will equal DIX plus the change in debt.

    Figure 2.1a shows an example in which earned income is constant and set at 110.11 After
having been constant at 440, housing prices start to grow at 4% per year after year 1 but
stop growing and stay constant from year 10 onward. The rising housing prices allow the
household to increase its mortgage through HEW while maintaining the LTV ratio at the
cap of 85%. Thereby it can increase its consumption substantially above DIX from year 2.
DIX is less than earned income by the interest payments. When debt rises, DIX falls further
below earned income.
    When prices stop growing, the household can no longer increase its mortgage and the
debt-financed overconsumption relative to DIX has to stop. Consumption drops by 19% in
year 11 and thereafter remains constant to just equal DIX, the earned income less interest on
the debt. Because debt and thereby interest payments are higher in year 11 than in years 1
and 2, consumption and DIX from year 11 onward is lower than in years 1 and 2. This
reflects that Ct /Dt-1 = - it-1 = - 0.04. But it is larger interest payments, not debt in
  11
     The parameters and initial values are  = 85%, P0 = P1 = 440, and D0 = P0 = 374, and EIt = EI =
110 and it = i = 4% for t  0.


                                                  7
itself, that keeps consumption and DIX lower from year 11. A lower mortgage rate in year 11
due to a lower monetary policy rate would increase DIX and consumption and reduce the
consumption drop.
    Figure 2.1b shows another example, in which housing prices also start to grow at 4%
after year 1 but do not remain constant from year 10 onward. Instead they drop by 25% in
year 11 and then resume to grow at 4%. The drop in housing prices increases the LTV ratio
from the LTV cap of 85% to 113%. This prevents further HEW, and consumption drops
by 19%. The rising housing prices reduce the LTV ratio back toward the LTV cap and in
year 19 the household resumes HEW and debt-financed overconsumption relative to DIX.
    In figures 2.1a and b, we can interpret year 11 as a crisis year and year 10 as a pre-crisis
year. The consumption change from year 10 to year 11 is in these examples by (2.1) given
by
                                                                                  g
       C11 - C10 = C11 = EI11 - i D10 + (D11 - D10 ) = - i                           D10 - D10 .            (2.8)
                                                                                 1+g
Here we use that EIt = EI and it = i are constant; that iD10 = igD9 = igD10 /(1 + g ),
where g is the constant growth rate of housing prices and debt up to year 10; and that
D11 = 0, because debt is constant after year 10 for several years.
    With i = 4% and g = 4%, on the right-hand side of (2.8) the coefficient of D10 is only
minus 0.0015, whereas the coefficient on D10 is minus 1. So in these simple examples, the
consumption fall during the "crisis" overwhelmingly depends on the pre-crisis debt increase,
D10 , not on the pre-crisis debt level, D10 . The pre-crisis debt level has a small increasing
effect on the consumption fall due to the interest payments on the pre-crisis debt increase,
iD10 = igD10 /(1 + g ).12
    What causes the consumption fall in these examples? First, the credit- and liquidity-
constrained HTM household desires to increase its consumption (its rate of time preference
exceeds the after-tax mortgage interest rate). This implies a binding LTV constraint (when
housing prices are non-decreasing). Second, a period of rising housing prices eases the LTV
constraint and allows debt increases through HEW to finance a welcome overconsumption
relative to the households disposable income. Third, an end to the period of rising housing
prices prevent further HEW-financed overconsumption, which forces consumption to fall
back to equal DIX (disposable income excluding imputed rental income). Thus, given the
setup, the fall in consumption is caused by the stop in HEW, which in turn is caused by
the end of the period of rising housing prices. The HEW during the period of rising housing
prices is caused by the household's desire to increase its consumption.
  12
    If we do not assume a constant interest rate, the term iD10 is replaced by i11 D10 - i10 D9 = i11 D10 +
i11 D9 . This illustrates that a fall in the interest rate during the crisis, i11 < 0, will for a large debt level
through the fall in interest payments have a large dampening effect on the consumption fall of the HTM
household (the cash-flow channel of monetary policy).

                                                        8
     Whereas there is, by the budget constraint (2.1), a direct relation between the change in
debt and consumption for an HTM household with an LTV constraint, there is, by the
liquidity constraint (2.4), a rather non-linear relation between housing prices and debt,
as illustrated by the two examples in the top panels of figure 2.1. As a result, there is
little systematic relation between the LTV ratio and the consumption fall in year 11. In
the example in figure 2.1a, the LTV ratio is constant before, during, and after the fall in
consumption. In the example in figure 2.1b, with the same consumption fall in year 11, there
is a rise in the LTV ratio in year 11, completely due to the fall in housing prices. The fall
in consumption is furthermore independent of the fall in housing prices. Then, for a few
years, consumption remains constant, while the LTV ratio falls towards the LTV cap, again
completely due to the rise in housing prices.
     Given this, for HTM households with LTV constraints, it makes little sense to regress
the crisis consumption fall on levels of and changes in the pre-crisis LTV ratios. The lack of
a robust relation between consumption cuts and levels of or changes in LTV ratios implies
that tests of the debt-overhang hypothesis should generally not be done by regressions of
consumption cuts on levels of LTV ratios--as in Dynan (2012) and some regressions in Bunn
and Rostom (2015)--or changes in LTV ratios.

      The registered-based data ADJ use do not include consumption or spending at the household level.
They instead rely on a spending measure imputed on data from household disposable income, assets, and
liabilities. In order to exclude capital gains on housing, they restrict the sample to households that have not
bought or sold one or more homes during the sample. The sample still include close to 500,000 households
(ADJ, section 3).

the left-hand side and the debt level and change on the right-hand side by the same variable,
in this case pre-crisis pre-tax income.
    According to the debt-overhang hypothesis, high indebtedness of a household in 2007
caused a larger drop in the household's spending from 2007 to 2009. A test of the hypothesis
is then whether or not the estimate of the coefficient 1 is negative as well as statistically
and economically significant.
    According to the spending-normalization/debt-financed overspending hypothesis, a larger
fall in spending from 2007 to 2009 is due to overspending in 2007 financed by a high debt
increase from 2006 to 2007. The hypothesis then implies that the fall in spending is predicted
by a high debt increase rather than by a high debt level in 2007.14 A test of the hypothesis
is then whether--when the debt increase is included among the explanatory variables--the
estimate of the coefficient 2 is negative as well as economically and statistically significant,
together with the estimate of 1 being small and economically insignificant. Put differently,
whether a regression with the debt level as regressor without the change in debt is subject
to an omitted-variable problem.
    The main result is reported in ADJ (table 4), reproduced here as table 3.1.15 The result in
column (1) of the table, with the dummy for a high debt level as the only regressor (besides
controls), gives some support for the debt-overhang hypothesis. However, in column (3),
where the dummy for a high debt change is added as a regressor, the debt-overhang hy-
pothesis is rejected and the spending-normalization/debt-financed overspending hypothesis
is supported. The negative correlation between high pre-crisis debt and larger subsequent
spending falls is entirely driven by the fact that a large share of the households with high
debt-to income ratios in 2007 had increased their debt by large amounts for consumption
purposes in the run-up to the crisis. The level of debt itself does not help to explain the larger
spending decline for this group. Not including the change in debt among the explanatory
variables thus results in a standard omitted-variable bias of the estimate of the coefficient
on a high DTI ratio.
    Columns (6) and (7) show that the same result occurs when the change in debt from
2003 to 2007 is substituted for the change from 2006 to 2007.
    ADJ (p. 108) summarize the main result as,

       within groups of households that experienced similar-sized changes in debt from
       2006 to 2007, those with a high level of debt in 2007 did not reduce spending
  14
     According to this hypothesis, it is an increase in spending intentions that leads to a debt increase to
support consumption. That is, there is reverse causality. Therefore, the debt increase predicts rather than
causes the fall in spending.
  15
     Note that the second regressor in (3.1) refers to the change in debt from 2006 to 2007 divided by income in
2007, not the change in the debt-to-income ratio from 2006 to 2007, as has been confirmed in correspondence
with Asger Andersen. The heading/note to ADJ (table 4) causes some confusion by mistakenly referring to
the change in the debt-to-income ratio, but the text of the paper is clear.

       more from 2007 to 2009 than those with only little debt in 2007. But those that
       experienced a large increase in debt from 2006 to 2007 cut spending by more
       than those that did not experience a large increase, even if they had similar debt
       levels at the end of 2007. . . [T]he results are the same if we instead use the change
       in debt since 2003, rather than 2006.

Broadbent (2019) summarized the ADJ result as:16

       Once you know the change in a household's indebtedness ahead of the crisis,
       knowing the level tells you nothing more about its subsequent spending.

    In the regressions in table 3.1 the regressors are indicator variables of high debt and high
debt change, more precisely, dummies for the debt-to-income ratio and the debt change nor-
malized by income exceeding their 75th percentile. In an online appendix to ADJ, (Andersen
et al., 2016b, table A5, reproduced here as table 3.2), the authors also report a regression
of changes in spending on continuous measures of levels and changes in debt, with the same
qualitative result.
  16
     Broadbent (2019) provides an insightful discussion and several examples of why the level of house-
hold debt--at very different points of time, across countries, and even for individual households--is a poor
predictor of subsequent financial distress, and why debt growth does better.

   Thus, the ADJ result rejects the debt-overhang hypothesis for Denmark and supports
the spending-normalization/debt-financed overspending hypothesis, both for discrete and
continuous measures of indebtedness and the change in indebtedness. Svensson (2021) shows
that the ADJ results also hold for Australian microdata. An important question is to what
extent the ADJ result holds for additional countries, in this case for the UK.


4     Results on UK microdata
4.1     Bunn and Rostom (2015)
As mentioned, Bunn and Rostom (2015) (BR) document a correlation between pre-crisis
household indebtedness and consumption spending cuts during the financial crisis for the
UK. They use a synthetic panel of UK microdata--following Deaton (1985)--constructed
from the Living Cost and Foods (LCF) Survey (UK Data Service, 2020), using two pooled
years and cohorts with of a single birth year and five and ten birth years (see BR for details).
   Because the LCF data are a repeated cross-section and not a panel, households in the
survey are different in each year. Therefore, BR cannot examine how debt and spending
varied over the years across individual households. Instead, they examine how debt and
spending varied over the years across different cohorts, where the cohorts comprise differ-
ent households in each year. Relying on cohort-level analysis is of course a disadvantage,
because of life-cycle variations of income, spending, and debt. The results on the relation
between debt and spending cuts during the crisis may be driven by the young. This is indeed

variables, namely changes in log income net of mortgage interest, number of adults, number
of children, log housing wealth, and log financial wealth.17
    Thus, the dependent variable is the consumption growth rate from 2006/2007 to 2009/2010,
regressed on a continuous measure of debt-to-income (DTI) ratios on 2006/2007. Columns
(1), (3), and (5) in table 4.1 report the results (for single and five birth years) in columns (1),
(3), and (5) in their table 2. The results establish a negative correlation between pre-crisis
indebtedness and consumption growth during the crisis. In isolation, they seem to give some
support for the debt-overhang hypothesis.

ratio from 2003/2004 to 2006/2007. Control variables include changes in log income net of mortgage interest,
number of adults, number of children, log housing wealth, and log financial wealth. The regressions are done
on a synthetic panel--following Deaton (1985)--constructed using two pooled years and cohorts with of
a single birth year and five birth years. Cohorts are also split into mortgagors and non-mortgagors. See

   But table 2 of BR does not include any measure of pre-crisis changes in debt among
the regressors. Columns (2), (4), and (6) in table 4.1 show that, when the regression is
amended to include changes in the DTI ratio from 2003/2004 to 2006/2007, the results

    The control variables thus differ between the BR and ADJ regressions, including that ADJ use levels

are qualitatively similar to the ADJ results in table 3.2. In particular, the debt-overhang
hypothesis is rejected, and the regression on only the DTI ratio is subject to omitted-variable
bias.
    However, the regression equation in table 4.1 is not exactly the same regression as the
continuous version of (3.1) in ADJ, underlying table 3.2. As suggested by the simple model
of debt-financed overconsumption, the left-hand and right-hand side of (2.8) should be nor-
malized by the same variable--in the ADJ case the income in 2007. However, in table 4.1, the
                                                                         h          h       h
dependent variable--the left-hand side of (4.1)--is approximately (C09     /10 - C06/07 )/C06/07 ,
that is, the change in consumption normalized by consumption in 2006/2007 rather than
by income. On the right-hand side, the added regressor is the change in the DTI ratio,
  h        h        h        h
D06 /07 /Y06/07 - D03/04 /Y03/04 , not the change in debt normalized by income in 2006/2007,
   h          h       h
(D06 /07 - D03/04 )/Y06/07 . For these reasons--although the results are sufficient to reject the
debt-overhang hypothesis--the amended regressions here do not represent as appropriate
a test of the spending-normalization/debt-financed overconsumption hypothesis as the ADJ
regressions.18 Nevertheless, the results in table 4.1 provide some support for this hypothesis.
    BR (table 2, columns (2), (4), and (6); not reported here) also provide regressions of
(4.1) where the DTI ratio is replaced by the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. Relative to (2.8),
this implies a rather arbitrary normalizing of the left-hand side by consumption in 2006/2007
and of the right-hand side by the housing price in 2006/2007. But, as noted in the discussion
at the end of section 2, for the simple model of an HTM household with an LTV constraint,
there is no systematic relation between the LTV ratio and a fall in consumption. For the
experiment shown in figure 2.1a, the LTV ratio is constant before, during, and after the
large fall in consumption in year 11, the "crisis". In the experiment in figure 2.1b, there is
a simultaneous fall in consumption and rise in the LTV ratio (the latter completely due to
the fall in housing prices). But the fall in consumption is independent of the magnitude of
rise in the LTV ratio. The lack of a robust relation between consumption cuts and levels of
or changes in LTV ratios implies that tests of the debt-overhang hypothesis should generally
not be done by regressions of consumption cuts on levels of or changes in LTV ratios.
    In summary, the debt-overhang hypothesis is rejected also for the regressions in table 4.1
for these microdata for the UK, and the spending-normalization/debt-finance-overspending
hypothesis receives some support.

household head is younger or older than 40 years (denoted "young" and "old", respectively).
They make the point that the results are mainly driven by the young. The regression result
for the young is similar to the result in column (3), but the negative coefficient on the DTI
ratio is larger in magnitude. In the regression for the old, the coefficient is smaller and only
significant at a 10 percent level.

   KRB do not include the change in the DTI ratios among the regressors. But given the
results in column (3) and (4) in table 4.1, it is pretty clear that, if the change in DTI ratios
were to be included, the results for the young would be qualitatively similar to those in
column (4) in table 4.1. The debt-overhang hypothesis would be rejected, and the spending-
normalization/debt-financed overconsumption hypothesis would receive some support. The
KBR regressions are subject to the same omitted-variable problem as the BR ones.


5     Conclusion
The results presented here for UK microdata reject the "debt-overhang hypothesis" --that
households cut back more on their spending in a crisis when they have higher levels of
outstanding mortgage debt (Dynan, 2012). The results instead provide some support for the
"spending-normalization hypothesis" of Andersen, Duus, and Jensen (2016a), what can also
be called the "debt-financed overspending" hypothesis--that the correlation between high
pre-crisis household indebtedness and subsequent spending falls during the crisis reflected
high debt-financed spending pre-crisis and a return to normal spending during the crisis. As
further discussed in Svensson (2019, 2020), this is consistent with the correlation reflecting
debt-financed overspending through what Muellbauer (2012) calls the "housing-collateral
household-demand" and Mian and Sufi (2018) the "debt-driven household demand" channel.
    It follows that it was not high household indebtedness in itself that caused the fall in

                                                     15
spending during the crisis in Denmark, Australia, and the UK.19 There were some highly
indebted households that cut down their spending more than others did, but this is better
explained by these households having before the crisis engaged in a mortgage-financed over-
spending relative to income. This overspending could not continue during the crisis, and
spending fell.
    At the same time, increased mortgage loans for consumption purposes contributed to
many households being highly indebted. Mortgage financing of overspending thus caused
both the fall in spending and to a certain extent the high indebtedness. This created a cor-
relation between high indebtedness and subsequent consumption declines--but not a causal
relationship between them.
    It follows that high household debt-to-income ratios in themselves contain little or no
information about risks of a spending fall associated with household indebtedness. This is
in contrast to what seems to be taken for granted by macroprudential authorities in many
countries, as well as by the international organizations that comment on countries' macro-
prudential policy. As discussed in Svensson (2019, 2020), in order to assess such risks of a
spending fall, among other things, one needs to examine whether there is any evidence of
an active housing-collateral channel and any mortgage-financed overspending of macroeco-
nomic significance--an aggregate debt-financed consumption boom, for example resulting
in a low household saving rate.20 As Muellbauer (2012) emphasizes, the strength of the
housing-collateral channel varies considerably between countries depending on differences in
the structure of housing and mortgage markets as well as in customs and preferences. Fur-
thermore, if there is significant housing-equity withdrawal, it matters for the risk assessment
whether this is used for consumption purposes--whether mortgages are effectively used as
consumption loans--or for other purposes, such as home improvement, paying off expensive
consumer loans, or investment in financial assets, including keeping a liquidity buffer.
    These issues for Sweden and their relevance for Swedish macroprudential policy--and for
the recommendations of the relevant international organizations--are further discussed in
Svensson (2019, 2020).
    It remains to test these hypothesis for other countries than Denmark, Australia, and the
UK. I would not be surprised if the rejection of the debt-overhang hypothesis and support
for the debt-financed overconsumption hypothesis is a pretty general result.
