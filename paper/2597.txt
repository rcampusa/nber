        Sovereign-Debt Renegotiations:   A   Strategic Analysis


                              ABSTRACT




Abstract: The process of debt—reschedulingbetween a creditor and a sovereign
(LDC) debtor is modeled as a noncooperative game built on a one—sector growth
model.   The creditor's threat to impose default penalties is ignored here as
inherently incredible; instead, the debtor's motivation for repayment is to
reap benefits from attaining an improved credit standing in international
capital markets.   The creditor can forgive portions of the outstanding debt.
so that a real—time bargaining process results with concessions being in the
form of debt—service payments by the debtor and debt forgiveness by the
creditor.   Subgame-'perfect equilibria of the game are characterized: the main
finding is that these all result in Pareto optima in which the creditor
extracts all the surplus.

1.   Introduction

      Any attempt to shed light on LDC—debt renegotiations must necessarily

come to grips with the question of why sovereign nations repay any portion of

their debts in the first place (or with its counterpart of why banks ever

choose to lend to sovereign nations).        Unlike in the case of domestic lending,

there is usually little colla'   -'ral   available in the form of seizable public

assets held outside the country,         Nonetheless, lending to sovereign countries

coexists along with the historical possibility of widespread          default,   As

explanations of this phenomenon, it is sometimes argued that countries say

attempt to meet their debt obligations in order to gain future benefits, such

as improved future access to capital markets, or to avoid future penñties,

such as restricted trade credi a and Imitations on future lending            that debt

repudiation may entail.    10 this paper we explore the strategic ra,pitications

of the former explanation.

      The 'carrots—versus—sticks" division of nations' motivations to service

and repay their debts, while somewhat arbitrary (since into which category any

particular measure falls depends on one's perception of the status quo), has

proven to be a useful way of organizing thoughts about the LDC—debt crisis,

Eaton and Gersowitz   (1981) examine the borrowing that can be sustained by a

country whose income periodically alternates between high and low levels,

Repudiation of the debt in this model causes the country to be excluded from

future borrowing with the consequence that the country must use costlier

methods to reduce fluctuations in consumption (such as stockpiling).             Sachs

(1983) investigates a two—period growth model where the default penalty

translates into a fixed—proportion reduction in the output that can he

produced from any given inputs and exclusion from future borrowing.

      While most work on sovereign lending has recognized that the set of loans

that a bank expects   will be fully repaid is      more   restricted than the set of
                                       —2—




loans that are merely feasible for the debtor to repay, this expectational        (or

strategic) consideration   has usually been incorporated by requiring that the

loan made by the bsnk be such that the debtor is at least as well off repaying

its debt as repudiating it.    Unless this statement   is made in an explioirly

strategic environment, however,   its significance is questionable.    The

knowledge, common to both parties, that a country prefers to repay some

portion of its debt to incurring the costs of default (or to foregoing the

benefits associsced with repayment) and that the bank prefers some repayment

as opposed to nothing merely means that a country may attempt to bargain with

the bank to reduce its total debt.    Why should the bank hold all the power in

this bargaining game?   The amount of the loan that will be repaid in the

game's equilibrium,   the factors that influence the bargaining outcome, and the

strategies that sustain it must be explictly determined.

     The existing sovereign—debt literature has, for the most part, been

content to assume, often implicitly, that the threat of applying the stick or

withholding   the carrot is completelycredible.    The consequences of departing

from the assumption that the bank can somehow precommit to imposing a penalty

or withholding a bonus unless the entire debt is repaid, has been examined

previously only by Bulow and Rogoff (1986).    Making use of Rubinstein's    (1982)

bargaining model, they study the subgame—perfect bargaining equilibrium that
                                                                         of an
emerges as a consequence of a country and bank negotiating over how much

exogenously determineddebt shall be repaid.       In their model, the country

                                                                         if
prefers to trade its domestically produced good for a foreign good, but,

declared in default, it is liable to having a certain percentage of its trsded

output seized.   Their game possesses a unique subgame—perfect bargaining

gains from trade, and the bank's ability to impose costs on

trade,   As in Rubinstein's model, and unlike ours,     ulow   and Rogoff assume

that no economic actions take place during the periods of negotiation.

     Our paper investigates      game—theoretic model of debt renegotiation

between a sovereign debtor and a creditor in which the motivation      for


repayment    is only of the carrot variety, so that any threatened default

                                                                                 we

                                                          'tore specifically,


assume that whenever the (renegotiated> debt is repaid in full, the former

debtor receives a bonus (in a generalized sense), not paid by the creditor,

(The bonus can be interpreted as improved access to international capital

markets.)     We are particularly interested in exploring debt renegotiation          in

a scenario which is able to capture some of the tension that exists between

debt repayment and LDCs' short—to—medium—term      growth prospects and living

standards.    To this end the game is built upon    t   traditional one—sector


growth model,

     Our game begins with the debt in place and growing according       to a given

rate of interest.     There is no link to any previous time to explain how this

debt was incurred, although it and the resulting game can be made consistent

with a larger game in which there is uncertainty about future shocks at the

time the loan is made.     The game is one of alternating moves: in each period,

the creditor first decides how much, if any, of the debt to forgive, and the

debtor then makes output—allocation    decisions for the period.     The country


begins the game with an exogenously given capital stock.        At the beginning of

each period production takes place determining the amount of output available
that period.    The country then decides how to allocate its output among

investment, consumption, and debt service.     The greater the debt serviced, rhe

smaller the output available for consumption and investment.          These decisions

carried out, time advances,    returns to investment are realized, interest

accrues, and the moves are repeated.     The game ends whenever the outstanding

debt is repaid, whereupon the country automatically receives the bonus; If

this never happens,    the game simply continues   indefinitely.    There    is   no

                                                                         at
uncertainty in the model, and both players are fully aware of everything

all times.

     We study the subgame—perfect equilibria of the game.          This equiiihrium

concept is the natural refinement of Nash equilibrium for extensive—form               games

like ours with perfect information.     It possesses the property of ruling out

those threats which an agent would not be willing to carry out if called upon

to do so.    We find that the behavior produced along the equilibrium path by

the subgame—perfect    Nash equilibria of our game is easy to describe.           We now

do so for one of them.    At the beginning of the game, the creditor forgives

exactly the amount of debt that makes the debtor just indifferent between two

plans: ignoring the debt and optimizing in the growth model on the one hand,

and, on the othsr, proceeding along the optimal program leading to ultimate

repayment assuming no further forgivenesses will be forthcoming.            The debtor

then follows the optimal repayment program, and the creditor never forgives

any additional debt.     (If at the beginning of the game the optimal program

                                                 debtor greater utility than
leading to full repayment of the debt yields the

the optimal program ignoring the debt, the creditor does not forgive any

portion of the debt.)     Furthermore, all other subgame—perfect      equilibria are
                                         —5—




similar in the sense that all generate the same payoffs as this one             t   both

parties.    We find this result surprising: it implies that the bank indeed

possesses   all the bargainingpower in the game, though why this should he so

is not apparent a priori.

     The rest of the paper i      organized as follows,    In Section 2 the model is

presented and the main result stated.      Section 3 is dedicated       to a proof of

the main result, and Section 4 examines the issue of uniqueness.              Section 5

contains remarks and conclusions,




2. The Model

     The game G(K0,D0) is played by two players:      the creditor, naaed A, end

the debtor, B, over discrete time periods 0,1,....         There     is a single

commodity   (best thought of as creditor—country's    currency),     in the units of

which everything is measured.      The debtor's capital stock at the beginning of

each period t is denoted Kt, and the level of debt at the beginning of each

period t is denoted Dr.     Initial nonnegative values for these variables,            K0

and D0, are specified exogenausly.      The game continues until the first time T

at which Dt falls to zero; if this never occurs, T         .    At   the beginning      of

each period tr,    the output from investing     K in production is        realized.   The

first move at each t (ST) then belongs to A, who selects              the part of    to
                                                                f,                Dt

be forgiven currently.    Next, B, knowing A's choice of            selects current

levels of Consumption,         and debt—service payment,   p.      Thus,    the following
                          c,
restrictions   on the players' moves apply:



     0                               and Ct+pt    g(K),                                     (2)
                                                   —6—




where     g:R-R       is the debtor's production         functioo.    If   p = Dt—ft,    the game

ends; otherwise,         the next period is entered with


        Kt±l        g(K)—tp       and Dr+i —   (l+r)(D—p—f),                                          (3)

where r(>O) is the interest rste on the debt.                  Both players are assumed to

know and remember all past moves in the game.

        The creditot wishes to maximize the discounted sum of debtor's                      payirours

           where a is the creditor's discount factor; similarly, the debtor

wishes to maximize


                         ÷   flT+l1()                                                                 (4)
        to    fltu(ct)


where $<l is the debtor's discount factor, u is B's one—period utility—from—

consumption function, and 1(K) gives the value of the future to the debtor

when ending the game with no debt and capital stock K.                     We assume that Z:R-P.

is increasing, continuous, and bounded below by the function v, with

Z(O)=v(O), where v(K) is the value to B of following the optimal plan for the

one—sector          growth model defined by    ,    g,   and u, with initial capital starS            V.




(hereafter GM(K)).            (If the game never ends, the last term in (4) is

identically zero.)           We assume that u and g ste C2, increasing, atrirtly—

concave functions with g'(O)          —    and g'() — 0 (see e.g.           Casa (1965));      this

insures      that    CM has a unique solution for all initisl conditions and that v                        is


strictly concave.            The game C(K0,D0) is now completely specified,             and its

extensive form is expressed schematically                 n   Figure 1,    Note that C(K9,D0)         ia

        Let Nt denote the set of possible partial histories of play h. through

the end of period (t—l); i.e.,            H    0    and, for t       1,

Let a and b be any strategies for               A   and B, respectively; ie,

a is a sequence of functions (a0,a1,..), where, for all                        t,   a   selects for

each          an         between zero and the Dt determined by ht; and b is a sequence
       htEH
of functions (b0,b1,           -   .), whe,     for each   hcHt    and feasible     f,   b   selects

and Pt feasible for g(K) and (Dr—ft).                  The strategies a and b form an

eouilibriuin of C(K0,D0) if a unilateral switch to any other strategy by either

player does not yield that player increased utility.                      As is well—known by now,

some of the equilibria in games like C(K0,D0) can be based on implausible

threats.    Subgame—perfection            is imposed to rule these equilibria aut.                For

tl, any htEHt generates a new game GA(Ko,Do,ht) initiated by the M. and

that result from                   Similarly,   a and b generate strategies         at and bt for
                         h.
                   as follows: delete the first (t—l) component functions of a and
GA(KO,DO,ht)

b, then restrict the domains of ar and br for all                    rt   to begin with      h.
Similarly, for all t, ht followed by feasible                       generates another kind of

subgame, call it GB(Ko,Do,ht,ft)                in which B moves first after the ir.Ltal

                                                                                induced by a and b
condition    (Kt,Dt—ft) determined by            h   and          Strategies

for GB(Ko,Do,ht,ft)           are defined similarly to those for GA(KQ,DO,ht).                 The


strategies a and b form a subame—perfect eui1ibrium of the game G(K0,D0                                 if

they form an equilibrium of G(K0,D0) and, in addition, if they induce

equilibria on all subgames CA(Ko,Do,ht) generated by all                       htmH     and on all


subganies   Gg(Ko,Do,ht,ft)           generated by each htEHt followed by each feasible                 f.


Proposition:        If   a—(l+r) there          is a subgame—perfect      equilibrium for G,V0,D0

for any (K0,D0)O,          the play of which has the following properties:                   All debt—
                                                   —8—




forgiveness      (if any) occurs at time 0.          The debt (possibly reduced) together

with accrued interest is repaid at some              T<.   The players' utilities at the

equilibrium play ara Pareto—efficient,              with the creditor recaiviog all the

surplus over the debtor's maximin payoff, which is either v(K0) or the rsximum

of v(K0) and whatever the debtor can obtain by repaying all the original debt

with appropriate interest in the event that this is a feasible plan.

Furthermore, all other subgame—perfect              equilibria generate the same payoffs as

this one for both players.




3. Proof     of Proposition

      For each K0. let R(K) denote the set of debts 0>0 such that eveotual

repayment of 0 plus accrued interest is feasible starting from (K,D), ossumiog

no future forgivenesses, and let P —               {(K,D): K0   and DcR(Kfl.   For coy

(K,0)eW, let w(K,D) denote the payoff to B from rursuing an optimal program to

repay all of 0, together with appropriately accrued iotersst, starting                   from

(K,D).     This growth—with—debt      model having objective function w will ho termed

ODM(K,D),

              For every v0,      R(K) is either empty or an open interval.          Throughout

0, the function w exists, increases in its first argument, and decreases

continuously      in its second,

fp:        If   11—0   and g(0)—O, then   11(11)   is empty. Otherwise,   g(K)eR(K) and if

DeR(K), rhen (0,D)cR(K).         To see that sup(R(K))FR(K), consider the volo K

such that g'(K)—(l±r).         Above K, marginal productivity is less than (l±r),

so   that an efficient payback plmn (with no consumption) involves using onactly
K ma input      to production.     Hence, if       Dg(K)K and     if
then B can never reduce the debt after time 0.                  On the other hand, if
                                            —9—




r(D—g(K)+R) < g(R)—R, the debt can be reduced by an increaaing amount in

each period and hence repaid; therefore R(K) is open when g(K)K.                   If g(K)<K

efficiency requires using all     of K in production.           Under our aaaumptions,

however, after finitely many iterations           (say   r)   of this, gT*l(K)K.       At this

point, a teat similar to the one above applies, with the left side of the

inequalities replaced by r((l+r)TD_gTU(K)+R), so that the same conclusion,

that R(K) is open, follows.

       To see that w increases with K, it is sufficient to notice that the

additional units of K can simply be consumed immediately,              then the optimai

program for GDM(K,D) followed as before, resulting in increased utility.

Similarly, if D is reduced, the optimal program for GDM(K,D)              together with

additional units of K reinvested each time and available              at T resolt      in

increased utility.

       For the existence and continuity properties, first fix any vsiues for r

and   K.   Now note that the set of feasible (c0,p0               c,p)   thot resuit in

repayment by r is a compact—valued     continuous correspondence          over K K,.        If

repayment    occurs at T<r, set cT+l,pT+l           cr,pr equal to zero.       shoe              is

continuous when viewed as a function of (D0,c0,p0                  °TI     'he rxi.s e

theorem applies, so that     w   (w restricted to programs that repay by           r    exists

and is continuous as a function of     U.    As above, the set of D's feasible for

   is an interval      (though closed on the right now), and w7 decreases on this

interval to the value


                   4
       u(O)toflt


Now extend w7 continuously to all of R(K) in steps: first by setting it equal

to the expression in (5) until wr÷l crosses this constant from above, then

letting Wr        track   w1   (which eventually    tracks   Wr+2    etcj    thereafter.

     From Lemma 4 we oan deduoe that the equilibrium (,k) is also subgame

form equilibria for Ge—games            is exaotly   the same as in Lemma 4,

     We oome finally to the payoff—uniqueness issue.              Obsarva that at any

subgame—perfect         equilibrium, B r tst receive a payoff of at least aax

since   B has a strategy that guarantees this payoff regardless of A's strategy

in the subgame.          (Technically, this is inaccurate, sinoe       A   osn foroe a

repayment earlier than planned by forgiving all the debt.                  Obviously,   curb a

production function that is steep enough (for small K) and a K small enough

that g'(g(Kfl>>l, g'(g(Kfl>(l+r),            D>g(K), and Z(.)v(.).         The first

inequality guarantees         that all consumption will be postponed under v (and

therefore under w given the last condition), and the second and third

inequalities       guarantee that no payments will take place in the initial peci.od

under w.

      Next, observe that even with Z strictly concave, there is no reason to

expect w to be concave in K; hence, B may have multiple (subgame—perfect)

equilibrium best responses to A's strategy g.              For a concrete example of this,

it is easiest if we first relax some of the assumptions. Suppose D0=l, K4=5,

r—.5, and $.l.           Suppose u(c)_.l(l_et), g(K)—2K, and

                    10    + 180K              if Ks.5
      ZK       5
               1    100    + u(K) — u(S)      if K>.S.


Now, for every K, v(K)           (l—fl1u(m)        1/9.   Also, v(0)=u'(O)=.l, and

Z'(O)=lSO.     Clearly, Z(K)>v(K) VK.         Repaying    0 at t=0, B receives     .1Z(4)=1.

In order to repay optimally at time                                                    Ii
                                              1,   p0 must be   0, since   g'>(l+r).

as well, B's payoff is


                                         + .11(5—c1))
                    l0ax<5      (u(c1)


It is straightforward          to check that the maximum is attained at 01=0, with

payoff .OlZ(.5)—l.           Furthermore, for any coc[0,lJ, the analogous maximum is

<1.   Repaying at time t2 generates (u(co)+.lu(cl)+...+.1tu(ct)]+.ltZ(Kt+l)

The expression in brackets is no larger than 1/9, while the last term is no

                                                                             Hence k may call
larger than .1001, the sum being therefore less than unity.

     To modify    the example so that it satisfies all our assumptions;      first

replace Z with an increasing, strictly—concave      function that is zero at    I<—0


and 100 at K—.5, is very steep initially, and has slope 180 at K—S.          Red'ce


D0 slightly so that Z(l—D0)'l0.    Now approximate g by a C2—strictly—concave

function that agrees with g at K—.5, satisfies g'(0)= and       g'()0,    and   hs
slope close to 2 on the interval ,5,l(.        Finally, adjust r so tt,at the

product D0(l+r)    is as before.




5. Remarks and conclusions

     The driving forces behind our results, as in other bargaining models

requiring subgame—perfect    equilibria, are difficult to identify.    A possLhLe

explanation may be thought to lie in the argument that the debtor cannot

credibly refuse to repay a debt if in so doing it is not made aorse sif tnr

by repudiating it.    A symmetric argument, however, should then coneinc        Ce
that the bank must forgive the entire debt since, by similar reasoning, the

bank cannot credibly refuse to accept repayment of any positive amount,          If


the situation is likened to a bilateral monopoly modeled as a noncoopetsti'Je

game in which a sole seller (the creditor> facea a sole buyer (the debter' ard

bargains over the price of a good (the bonus), the outcome is gener1y

sensitive   to the particular specifications    of the institutional structure

which it is embedded.     As demonstratedby Rubinstein in a pure iterated

bargaining model, the existence of fixed bargaining costs per period borne oy

each player yields results on the division of the surplus that depend

crucially on the relmtiva magnitudes of each player's respective bargainind

costs and on the order of the opportunities to make offers,       when the
                                          —16—




assumption of   fixed costs is replaced by fixed discount factors, the

conclusions as to the way in which the surplus is divided are different and

less extreme, but still give a relative advantage to the player who moves

first.    In our model, on the other hand, where economic actions take place

alongside   the negotiations,    the order in which the players move is not

particularly important.       (If the order is reversed, B's initial move is

determinedby v(K0) and A grants a forgiveness,       f, such that


w(K1,(l+r)(D0—f))=v(K1).)       It seems to be the real—time nature of the

bargaining process      that is at least partly responsible for the extreme nacurc.
of our   conclusions,   in contrast with Rubinstein's.

     The equilibrium behavior described in Section       3   aeems, at first g1snnc.

to be in conflict with events surrounding the current LDC—debt crisis, s;hoco

there have apparently been no forgivenesses.       It is possible, however, to

interpret the widespread granting of new loans, extended to permit countrios

to keep interest payments on the debt current, as forgivenessea,         since the

interest rates on the new loans are often lower than on the old.          The

occurrence of repeated rescheduling of debts, however, most probably testifies

to the fact that we have omitted some features that are important in the

current crisis, especially      default penalties and uncertainty.     When

incorporated into our model, the latter could account for repeated

rescheduling,   since uncertainty,    say, as to the productivity    of next period's

capital stock, might create. an incentive for the bank to reduce the amount of

a forgiveness, with the intention of readjusting it upward later if need he.

Unlucky outcomes stemming from this uncertainty at the same time provide an

expanation of the existence of a debt too large to be incentive—compatihle
                                               —17—




with full repayment.     The role that a default penalty might play is more

complex.   The qualitative differences between a final declaration of defaulc

on a debt and simply never paying over an infinite horizon bars the

possibility of adapting our results in a straightforward           way to a model vich

default penalties,     Moreover,     the historical evidence on default    pen1:is
appears mixed, ranging from countries           that have suffered invasion and

temporary loss of sovereignty        (e.g.    Egypt 1879 and Mexico 1859—61) cc ochers

that have suffered no apparent cost (see Lindert and Morton (1987)).

     The existence of multiple subgame—perfect          equilibria provides yec ar.ccher

avenue by which to reconcile our results with observed reality            as   ir   iic iced


in Section 4.    If the debtor's moves under both v(K0) and J(K0,D0—f) coincide

for some number of periods commencing with the initial period.           forgiveneaaes

(the present discounted value of which must equal tne value of f dececincd

in the initial period) may occur at any one or a combination of           c}.os


thus permitting negotiations        to extend beyond one period.

     It is of interest to speculate on the roles that various of our

assumptions play in the analysis.            If the creditor's discount factor a were

less than both   (l+r)    and   ,   we would expect the debtor to be able to capture

some of the surplus, since the creditor might increase f beyond I if doing so

enabled it to receive debt repayments which possessed a more favorable

repayment schedule.    The results for other values of a seem less obvious

Allowing Z(O) to exceed v(O) introduces the possibility that the country could

attempt "suicide" (if, in addition, g(O)—O) by consuming all its output; thus

credibly committing to no future payments.            To forestall this, a must be

modified to require I to satisfy W(K,D—f)—max(v(K),u(g(K))+5Z(O));             otherwise
                                       —18—




our results remain unaffectedby this modification.      It should be noted in

addition that the qualitative nature of our results does not depend on the

particular version of the growth model considered; variants of it,    including

an extension to a two—sector model and the inclusion of international trade,

do not alter our main findings.    Lastly, the assumption of an infinite horizon

is not crucial—our conclusions can also be obtained in a finite—horizon

version of the game (in which a bonus is received only if the debt is repaid

by some predetermined period) as long as the debtor cannot avoid moving leer.
     In addition to uncertainty and default penalties as mentioned earlicr

inforrr tional asymmetries,   free—rider problems among the banks. and the

relationships   among the creditor banks and their governments are other

important factors influencing the outcome of LDC—debt negotiations that we

have ignored.    It seems possible that future research on their effects could

be undertaken by elaborating on the basic structure we have utilized.
