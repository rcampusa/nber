                  INCENTIVES AND GOVERNMENT RELIEF FOR RISK


                                  ABSTRACT


     Government relief is offered for a wide range of risks - - natural
disaster, economic dislocation, sickness and injury. This paper explores the
effect of such relief on incentives and the allocation of risk in a model
with private insurance.   It is shown that government relief is inefficient,
even when its level is less than the private insurance coverage that
individuals would otherwise have purchased and even when private insurance
coverage is incomplete due to problems of moral hazard.

    A number of important risks               -   -   natural      disaster, economic dislocation,
sickness and injury    -   -       sometimes give rise to government relief.t              This paper
examines the effect of such relief on incentives and the allocation of risk in

a model with private insurance.                   The primary conclusion is that government
relief distorts individuals' incentives:                           Individuals' decisions take into
account only their own exposure to loss                    -   -   the portion of loss uncompensated
by government relief       -   -    rather   than the total loss.            Moreover, given the

availability of private insurance, the resulting loss from distorted
incentives exceeds any benefit from relief in allocating risk.


    The paper begins with the straightforward situation in which insurance
companies can observe individuals' risk-reducing behavior.                           In this case, as

is well recognized, insurance policies in which premiums are based on behavior

allow individuals to achieve a first-best outcome (in which insurance against
loss is complete and incentives are not distorted) without government relief.
With relief, however, a first-best outcome is not achieved.                          Individuals

purchase full insurance coverage against their exposure, so that relief and
insurance completely compensate for any loss.                          But individuals are not induced
to behave optimally.           They are concerned only about how their behavior affects

their insurance premiums, which, of course, are based on their exposure rather

than total losses; as a result, the effect of risk-reducing behavior on the

expected cost of government relief is ignored.


    The paper then considers the situation in which insurance companies cannot
observe individuals' risk-reducing behavior.                          In this case, which involves
moral hazard, individuals generally purchase less than complete coverage                           -




against   their exposure, in order to retain some incentive to reduce risk.




   Relief, as distinguished from insurance, typically is not at a level chosen
by individuals and does not entail charging individuals a premium that is a
function of their observable behavior (including the level of insurance
coverage they purchase).


                                                       -1-
Here government relief distorts insurance decisions and thus behavior as well:
In determining the degree of residual risk to bear, individuals do not take

into the account that their incentives to reduce risk affect the expected cost

of government relief.

      After demonstrating these results,                      I comment briefly on the range of

situations to which they apply.




                                                  I.       The Model


                            A.         Definitions and First-Best Outcome


      A standard model of the risk of loss and insurance2 is consideced in

studying government relief.                      It is assumed that individuals choose an

expenditure level x, which determines the probability p(x) of a loss A, where

      < 0 and p"> 0.        An individual's utility U is a function of wealth,

initially assumed to be zero, where U'.> 0 and U" < 0.                                          UA and U0 denote,

respectively, utility evaluated in the states with and without the loss

occurring.          The government provides relief r in the event of a loss; the

program of relief is financed by a lump-sum tax r                                         pr.    An individual,

knowing the government's relief policy, chooses a level of insurance coverage

q, paid in the event of a loss, and is                         charged an actuarially fair premium

it   = pq.3       An individual's expected utility is therefore

(1)     EU =      (l-p(x))U(-x     -    it   -   r)   +   p(*)U(-x   -   it   -   r   -    A    + q +   r)
              =   (l-p(x))U0   +   p(x)Ux.


       The first-best levels of r, q, and x solve

(2)                 Max          EU subject to:
              r,r,q,ir,x

              (A) r — pr

              (B)    ir —   pq.

Substituting pr for r and pq for ir and differentiating (1), we have:


(3)
              dEU — dEU
                        —          (l-p)U[-p]      +    pU[-p     +   1] —0, or


(4)           p(l-p)[U -           U]    0.




Wealth will thus be equal in the states with and without a loss, so that

q +       r    — A.         Hence, EU can be written simply as U(-x -               p(x)A),   so that the

first-best x must minimize x +                         p(x)A,   the sum of the costs of avoiding the

loss and the expected ross.                        This implies that x is determined by


(5)           p'(x) -        -




          The next two sections consider optima'. relief.                         The government's problem

consists of choosing r so as to maximize expected utility subject to the

requirements that

      -        lump-sum taxes finance expected relief payments -- as in (2A)                        --   and

      -        the individua' chooses a feasible insurance contract and expenditure
               level x so as to maximize expected utility, where r and r are taken as
               given.

This problem is now ana'yzed explicitly in the two cases noted in the

introduction.


                                              B.       First-Best Insurance


          If insurance companies can observe expenditure levels x, they will be ed

to offer insurance policies that take individuals' behavior into account.                                      In

particular, assume that insurance companies charge a premium if equal to

p(x)q.'             As a result, the optimization problem for the government in this case




   Alternative models would yield equivalent results.  For example,
individuals could choose ir, while the insurance company would offer a schedule
q(x), where, for any x, q(x) is the level of coverage for which if — p(x)q(x).


                                                                -3-
(6)    Max EU subject to:
       r,r

       (A)    r —          pr

       (B)     Max              EU(        subject to:
                                       r
              q,ir,x


                   (1) ir(x) =             p(x)q.

The government's problem (6), unlike (2), involves an added constraint (B),

corresponding to the condition that individuals' insurance coverage and

expenditure decisions are privately optimal.                                 Note that, at r = 0,          the private

maximization in (B)                     is the same as that for the first best (2).


      More generally, for any r, the problem (B) is identical to that in (2)

where one substitutes for the total loss A that portion to which the

individual is exposed,                       A   -   r    (and initial income is -r).     As a result, the

solution involves, from (4), equal wealth in the states with and without a

loss (q —          A   -       r)   and an expenditure level that minimizes x               -4-   p(x)(A    -   r).
Hence,

                           -
(7)        p'(x)


It    is clear (compare (5)) that the first-best level of x will be chosen if and

only if r — 0.                      In addition, the higher is r,            the lower is x and the lower is

expected utility.6


       PROPOSITION I:                   If the expenditure level x is observable by Insurance

companies, the first-best outcome is achieved with no relief, r = 0.

Moreover, r =                  0    is the unique optimum.


                                                     C.    Second-Best Insurance


       Itt many instances, x will not be observable by insurance companies, so the

optimal insurance contract in the absence of government relief will be second-



   The first best required only that q +                              r   = A,   so that q and r were redundant
instruments in (2).
6
      It can readily be demonstrated that sign dEU/dr — -sign r, for r < A.  For
r      A, the lowest possible x will be chosen; expected utility will be lower
than for any r < A.

                                                                  -4-
best due to moral hazard.                   In this case, the optimization problem for the

government is

(8)     Max EU subject to:
        r,r

        (A)      r —   pr

        (B) Max EUI                 subject to:

                     (1) r — pq

                     (ii) Max EUI
                                      r,r,q,ir
                            x


(B) indicates that individuals purchase insurance to maximize expected utility

(given r and r).                  Constraint (ii) indicates that insurance is determined (and

the actuarially fair premium is set) taking into account that an individual
will choose x to maximize expected utility, with q and r taken as given (as

well as r and r).


       This problem differs from that involving first-best insurance:                           The

earlier problem (6)                  for constraint (B)     involved the maximization of expected

utility over q,             it,   and x (given r and r) subject to (i).          Here (8), insurance

is subject to the familiar moral hazard problem.                         Government relief will make

matters worse, because individuals choose insurance coverage as if the loss

were A      -    r   rather than A, which in turn affects their expenditure decision.

Note that the governments problem (8), involving the choice of r, is the same
as the individual's optimization problem (B) when r — 0,                        involving the choice

of q, except that the former problem has an added constraint.7                          These

observations suggest the following result.


       LEMMA:         For any level of relief r, let q and x be the insurance coverage

and expenditure level that an individual would choose.                         Let     be the

expenditure level that would be chosen if r — 0 and                        insurance   coverage is

r -t   q.       Then    EUIrqx = EU!3 r+q*' and        x     ;   that   is, the utility and

expenditure level at any level                    of relief can be replicated with no relief and

insurance coverage of r -t q.


   It should be clear that this reasoning is not dependent upon the particular
model adopted here.


                                                       -5-
      PROOF:              Let 2            0 and                —       r   + q.       Consider insurance premium 9 —                p.
Noting that 9 — 0 (since 2 — 0),                                             one has:

(9)     9 + 9 —               p   =   pr       +   pq               r +     r.

It is therefore clear that the maximization decision involving x (8Bii) is the

same for the original and transposed problem, so the same expenditure level

will be chosen.5                      This implies that the posited premium 9                                   satisfies        (8Bi).

Thus, x = 2 and expected utility is the same for both problems, which

completes the proof.


       The lemma immediately implies that r = 0 is an optimum, since the expected

utility achievable at any r                                             0 ran also be achieved at r =               0.       In fact, r = 0

is the unique optimum.                                  To demonstrate this requires us to examine the first-

order conditions forq (SB) and x (BBii).                                                      For the latter,


(10)    12                -(l-p)U          -       p'T70        -       pU   +   p'U         0, or



(11) p'(x) =                  -
                                  o            A                                   -




where    U'    — (l-p)U                ± pU.                Compare this expression with (5) and (7).                                (Note

that if individuals were risk-neutral, (11) would reduce to p'

          -   r       -   q).)        When          choosing                 x, individuals consider only the portion of

the loss that is not compensated by government relief or insurance.


        For the maximizing insurance decision,


 (12)             =       (l-)U[-xq                     -   p       -   qp'xq}         -   P'xqU0 +   Uj[-xq    -   p    -   qp'xq   +   lJ

                          +   P'xqux       =       0,


where x5 denotes the derivative of x with respect to q.                                                        Because (10) holds at

 the optimum,9 many of the terms multiplying x5 can be eliminated, and the




    This result holds if the solution is unique.  See note 9.  For other cases,
 it would be sufficient to assume that, if multiple global optima for x exist,
 the same selection rule is used in the initisl and transposed problems.

   As explored in Arnott and Stiglitz (1988) and Grossman and Hsrt (1983), for
 this substitution necessarily to be valid, the solution to (10) must be a


                                                                                       -6-
remainder can be regrouped as follows:


(13)         —   p(1-p)(U       -   tJ)       -   p'qxqU'            0.



The first term reflects the benefit of further equalizing wealth between the
statea with and without a loss, and the second is the incentive cost (moral

hazard).         The critical feature for assessing the effect of government relief

is that this latter term is weighted by q, not q +                                                        r:     Only that portion of

the incentive cost covered by insurance is reflected in the insurance

dectsion.         The portion covered by government relief is ignored, just as in the

case of first-best insurance.

       To establish uniqueness, note that, at any optimum r,                                                        the first-order

condition for q (13) must hold not only for the stated r, but also, under the

lemma, for the equivalent scheme in which                                           —    0.           For the initial and

transposed schemes, all varfables in (13) have the same values, except

(possibly) for q and x.                   Therefore, qxq =

For the substitutions made, note that 9 and 0, as well as U will have the
same values for the initial and transposed schemes, given the results of the

     PROPOSITION II:         No relief, r          0, is the unique optimum, even when the

expenditure level x is not observable by insurance companies.

     The lemma indicates that insurance can mimic any level of government

relief.    Clearly, the government cannot improve upon r = 0.12                  Uniqueness is

illuminated by considering how individuals will choose q when r e (0,A)

First, if r > q*, where q* is the optimal level of insurance when r                      0,

individuals will purchase additional coverage despite the fact that the

government offers relief above the level of coverage they would otherwise have

purchased:    At q = 0, marginally increasing q reduces risk-bearing costs and

imposes no private incentive costs.                    (In (13), the first term is positive and

the second is zero.)          Second, even if r              q*, one would expect individuals to

purchase coverage such that q + r > q*:                   A marginal increase in total coverage

from q* will produce the same risk-spreading benefits as in the case in which

r    0, but less incentive cost (since a portion of the incentive cost is borne

by the government).13



    The only possible exceptions are: (1) U = 0; see note 9.     (2) qxq    0;
this implies equal wealth across states, which in turn implies (from 10) that
U' = 0, which is ruled out by assumption.    (3) qxq and    are both  infinite;
this will not hold at an optimum and would, in any event, from (16), impl1
that U - qO — 0 and U            -    9
                                 0, which is only possible if, again, q — q or
if 9 —    and    — 0, tiie latter having been considered.

The conclusion does not rule out all government action, such as taxes and
subsidies applied to the relevant activities. See Arnott and Stiglitz (1986)

                                II.   Concluding Remarks


      Government relief for risk distorts incentives because individuals no

longer bear the full cost of their actions.          Such relief is inefficient even

when insurance coverage is incomplete due to moral hazard.                   These results are

relevant to a wide range of government programs --              including     disaster relief,

Medicare, trade adjustment assistance, and bailouts              -   -   and, as now noted, to
windfall taxation and relief for changes in government policy as well.


      (a)   The model considered government relief for the risk of losses, but

the analysis is equally applicable to the symmetric case involving windfall

taxation of gains.         Gains and losses are defined, after all, relative to an

arbitrary origin.          (Suppose in the model that A,   q,   and r are negative, where

p    > 0 and p" <    0,)    This application is consistent with the familiar notion

that windfall taxation of gains distorts incentives to generate the gains.


      (b)   An important source of risk is that associated with government action

itself --    that   is, with the enactment, repeal, or modification of regulations,

tax rules, budget priorities, and so forth.          The analysis presented here is

applicable to government-created risk, suggesting (other things equal) the

inefficiency of the wide range of mechanisms --            including       compensation and

windfall taxation, grandfathering, phased-in implementation - -                 often   employed

to mitigate gains and losses for those who invested under the preexisting
regime 14


      (c)   If insurance markets suffer from imperfections other than moral

hazard, government relief may be efficient.          One problem of particular

interest in this context is that some individuals may incorrectly perceive the


13
   This final argument holds only locally.          Subtle wealth effects must be
ruled out to establish the result globally.         Compare Kaplow (1987)
14
    In this context, it would often be relevant to consider a model in which p
is given and the loss A is a function of individual decisions x, because
individuals will often have little influence over the probability of
government action whereas the amount of loss will be determined by their level
of investment.   (In such instances, the plausibility of first-best insurance
may be greater than otherwise because the relevant states often will be
observable.) For a model of this case and further consideration of issues
arising in this context, including the effect of relief on the government's
incentives, see Kaplow (1986, 1987).

probability of loss'5   If the probability is underestimated significantly,

government relief may have less of an adverse effect on incentives while
spreading risk for which individuals would not choose to purchase insurance.
Compulsory government insurance, however, would be more efficient than relief:

For example, one who contemplated construction on a flood plain and

underestimated the risk of a flood would be led to make a more efficient

decision if notified in advance of the compulsory premium that would be

charged -for different levels of investment in different locations.   Observe

that government insurance (optional or compulsory) that imposes an actuarially

fair premiwn taking into account other insurance coverage or that prohibits

supplementary coverage has wholly different effects from those of government

relief.




5   Of course, other factors, such as adverse selection or administrative
costs, can also provide a case for government insurance or relief.   Note that
diversification of ownership through financial markets may address these
problems in some instances. Moreover, as to unsystematic risk, a diversified
firm may effectively be risk-neutral, making all the more apparent the
inefficiency of government relief.   (The government generally is in no better
position to absorb risk than are financial markets.   See the discussion in
Kaplow (1987) of the applicability of the Arrow and Lind (1970) result in this
context.)
