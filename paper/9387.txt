                                           ABSTRACT

       This paper describes the updating of the NBER trade dataset, which now provides U.S.

import and export values to the year 2001, disaggregated by Harmonized System (HS), Standard

International Trade Classification (SITC), and the U.S. Standard Industrial Classification (SIC)

categories. In addition, U.S. tariff data at the HS level have been added for the years 1989-2001.

Earlier CD-ROMs distributed by the NBER described data on U.S. imports and exports from

1972-1994, and these values have been slightly modified for 1989-1994 and then updated to

2001. Together with the earlier data, there are now 30 years of disaggregate U.S. trade data

available to researchers. These data, along with the tariff information for 1989-2001, are all

available over the internet at www.nber.org/data/.

1. Introduction

        This paper describes the updating of the NBER trade dataset, which now provides U.S.

import and export values to the year 2001, disaggregated by Harmonized System (HS), Standard

International Trade Classification (SITC), and the U.S. Standard Industrial Classification (SIC)

categories. In addition, U.S. tariff data at the HS level have been added for the years 1989-2001.

Earlier CD-ROMs distributed by the NBER (see Feenstra, 1996, 1997) described data on U.S.

imports and exports from 1972-1994, and these values have been slightly modified for 1989-

1994 and then updated to 2001. Together with the earlier data, there are now 30 years of

disaggregate U.S. trade data available to researchers. These data, along with the tariff

information for 1989-2001, are all available over the internet at www.nber.org/data/.

        This paper has five parts. First, we describe the updating of the U.S. HS imports and

exports. The import data for 1989-2001 is now reported as both “general imports” and “imports

for consumption,” and the distinction between these is discussed in section 2. In section 3, we

describe how the HS trade data has been aggregated to the 1987 version 4-digit SIC industries.

This aggregation was performed by Peter Schott, using (unpublished) concordances.1 However,

there are 73 (out of 459) 4-digit SIC industries for which we are not able to compute imports or

exports at the present time. This will be corrected when updated U.S. production data becomes

available.2 The U.S. tariff data at the HS level for 1989-2001 is described in section 4, and these

data have been collected and made available by John Romalis.3 Finally, in section 5 and the

Appendices we provide documentation for all the data.

2.   U.S. Imports and Exports

       U.S. merchandise imports are collected under two methods. “General imports” are

imports as they come off the dock. They reflect the total arrival of merchandise from foreign

countries that immediately enter consumption channels, bonded warehouses, or foreign trade

zones. In contrast, “imports for consumption” are a combination of entries for immediate

consumption, including those coming from U.S. foreign trade zones and withdrawals from

warehouses for consumption. Since April 1995, the National Trade Databank CD-ROMs that

are distributed by the U.S. Department of Commerce have reported “general imports” rather than

“imports for consumption.” Likewise, recent issues of the Economic Report of the President

report U.S. “general imports” at the aggregate level.

       The earlier U.S. import data distributed by Feenstra (1996) for 1972-1994 was for

“imports for consumption,” but the updated data for 1989-2001 described herein also includes

“general imports.” As noted, these data will differ for goods used in foreign trade zones or

entering into bonded warehouses. Examples include automobiles and their parts, where in 1993

the volume of automobile trade entering U.S. foreign trade zones was over $12 billion (Swenson,

1997, p. 37). It is expected that the use of “general imports” rather than “imports for

consumption” will give a more accurate picture of the import of these goods in the U.S. prior to

their further manufacture in the foreign trade zones.

       For this update to the U.S. import and export dataset described in Feenstra (1996, 1997),

we have recomputed U.S. imports and exports at the HS level for the six years 1989-1994 (which

overlap with the earlier 1972-1994 dataset) and then provide new data for six additional years,

1995-2001. Researchers interested in the full 30 years of data will therefore be using the 1972-

1988 files from the earlier dataset, and the 1989-2001 files from this updated dataset. As noted
                                                        3


in the introduction, all data are available over the internet at www.nber.org/data/, and also

www.internationaldata.org at the University of California, Davis.

        In Tables 1 and 2, we report the total values of merchandise imports and exports for the

updated years, 1989-2001, and for comparison, we also report the values from the Economic

Report of the President (ERP). For imports, “general imports” from the database and the ERP

are quite close in all years (Table 1). For exports, the database includes only “domestic exports,”

but excludes re-exports of foreign goods passing through the United States. In 2000, for

example, domestic exports were $712,287 million, and the disaggregate HS, SITC and SIC data

on these exports are reported in the database. Re-exports in 2000 were $68,131 million, or

nearly 10% of domestic exports. These sum to $780,419 million, which is close to the value of

total exports reported in the ERP (Table 2).

        The disaggregate HS data for both imports and exports include the corresponding SITC

code (5-digit, revision 2 and 3), SIC code (4-digit, 1987 version), and the new North American

Classification System (NAICS) code (6-digit, 1997 version). The NAICS codes are now being

used to classify domestic industry data in the U.S.4 However, for most statistical work, the U.S.

SIC classification will continue to be used rather than the new NAICS classification.

Accordingly, in this database we provide the U.S. imports and exports according to the 4-digit

SIC classification (1987 basis). In Table 1 and 2 we also report total values of manufactured

imports and exports (SIC codes starting with 2 or 3) for the updated years, 1989-2001, and for

comparison, the values for 1989-1994 from Feenstra (1996, 1997).5 In these overlapping years,

the total value of manufactured imports and exports are quite close in the two datasets.

  Feenstra (1996, 1997) reported 1972-revision SIC imports and exports up to 1992, and these were later extended
to 1994 and made available on the website www.internationaldata.org.

        At the disaggregate level, making the transition from the 10-digit HS codes to the 4-digit

SIC system is difficult, for the following reasons. The SIC codes commonly reported in the U.S.

import and export data do not correspond to the true domestic-based SIC codes. Rather, they are

so-called import-based SIC (MSIC) and export-based SIC (XSIC) codes. This distinction is

needed because the domestic-based SIC codes often depend on the method of processing for a

good, and this information is not available for imports and exports. For example, SIC industry

2011, meat packing plants, and industry 2013, sausages and other prepared meats, produce many

of the same products. What distinguishes them is that industry 2011 slaughters while industry

2013 uses purchased carcasses. There is no way to determine the source of materials for

imported meat products, and this is also not known for exports, so both imports and exports are

classified into the single MSIC and XSIC code 2011, with no trade at all in code 2013.6

        The fact that there is no trade reported in industry 2013 is an artifact of the classification

system, of course: there is positive domestic production in that industry, and it faces import

competition and also exports some of its output. So in order to measure the import competition

and export opportunities, it is necessary to make the transition from the MSIC, XSIC codes to the

domestic SIC codes. Feenstra (1996, 1997) made this transition for the trade data in 1972-1992

(later updated to 1994), so as to report U.S. imports and export according to the 4-digit SIC

(1972 version). Under the new database described in this paper, we shall report U.S. imports and

export according to the 4-digit SIC (1987 version), for 1989-2001. These were computed using a

new concordance that mapped directly from the HS categories to the 4-digit domestic SIC codes,

as described in the next section.



6
   The MSIC and XSIC code 2013 was not used at all between 1989 and 2001, though it was used for a small
amount of trade in earlier years. Feenstra (1996, 1997) uses this example to describe the trade flows in 1978, when
there was a very small amount of trade in MSIC and XSIC 2013.

3. Concording HS Products to SIC Industries

        The US began recording international trade transactions using the ten digit Harmonized

System (HS10) in 1989. More recently, both the Census Bureau, which administers the export

codes, and the US International Trade Commission (USITC), which manages the import codes,

have posted concordances between the HS10 and 1987 version 4-digit SIC (SIC4) industries on
                  ,
their websites. 7 8 Neither agency, however, makes available a comprehensive concordance that

includes all product codes which have been used since 1989.9

        By piecing together data from a variety of sources, Peter Schott created a master HS10 to

SIC4 concordance for product trade between 1989 and 2001. This master list is imperfect in two

ways. First, it does not cover all HS10 products. Second, all SIC4 industries are not included in

the concordance. We outline how each of these problems are dealt with in turn.


3.1 Not All Products Are Assigned an SIC4 Code by Census

       Of the 26,277 HS10 product codes used to track US imports and exports between 1989 and

2001, we cannot find an SIC4 code for 1,222.10 Of these 1,222 product codes, 898 can be

assigned to an SIC4 via the HS10 to 1987 Import SIC4 (MSIC4) concordance provided by

Feenstra (1996). Though in principle MSIC4 codes differ from SIC4 codes, a number of MSIC



7
  See Feenstra (1996) for an algorithm for concording seven digit Tariff System of the US (TSUSA) product codes
to US industries for 1972 through 1988. Feenstra (1996) also contains an alternate aggregation scheme for HS to
SIC for 1989 to 1994. The results of that procedure are compared to the results from this paper's procedure in
Section 2.3 below.
8
  Technically, import codes use the Harmonized System while export codes use a system referred to as Schedule B.
Schedule B codes are based upon the HS, but are typically less detailed than import codes. Though this can
complicate a matching of imports and exports at the product level, it does not prevent such a matching at the
industry level.
9
  Import and export concordances are available for 1992 at http://www.census.gov/epcd/www/intronet.html . A
search engine for looking up a given current product's SIC4 industry is available at http://dataweb.usitc.gov/ .
Finally, a subset of past import concordances is available at http://www.eiit.org/ .
10
   The primary reason for this, we believe, is that we have been unable to obtain Census' HS10 to SIC4 concordance
for years 1989 to 1991. It is possible that the missing HS10 codes are located in these files.
                                                        7


codes map directly into regular SIC4 codes. This direct mapping can be used to assign SIC4

industries to 898 products.

       We assign the remaining 324 products to industries via the following algorithm. First, if

other HS10 products within the target’s HS8 code are assigned an industry, use that industry for

the target. If there are no such neighbors, or the neighbors have not been assigned a code, keep

going up levels of aggregation (e.g. HS7, HS6, etc.) until a match can be made.

       Of the 1,222 products classified via MSIC4 industries or via the SIC4’s of their neighbors,

1,087 are in manufacturing. Schott’s version of the master HS10 to SIC4 concordance is

contained in HS10_SIC4_8901.ASC.


3.2 Not All SIC4 Industries are Included in Census' HS10 to SIC4 Concordance

        Table 3 lists the 73 SIC4 industries that are not captured by Census' HS10 to SIC4

concordance. As noted in Feenstra (1996), some HS10 products cannot be assigned a unique

SIC4 industry because industry classifications are based upon the process by which goods are

made as well as their end use. Because the process is not known for imports and some exports,

the census places questionable goods into one or more alternate SIC4 industries. Table 3 lists the

excluded industries as well as the alternate industries into which they are bundled.11 Products in

64 of the 73 problem industries can be assigned to alternate industries: of these 64 products, 52

map to a unique alternate industry and the remaining 12 map to more than one industry. The

first example in Table 3 is industry 2013, sausages and other prepared meats, which produces

  The mapping of excluded to alternate industries detailed in Table 3 is according to Census' internal “Principal
Differences” file, provided by Jack Barna of Census. It is very similar to Appendix D of Census’ US Commodity
Exports and Imports as Related to Output (OEI), available at http://www.census.gov/epcd/www/intronet.html .
Appendix D itself is entitled Concordance of the SIC-Based Publication Codes to the Five-Digit SIC Product Codes
and is available at http://www.census.gov/epcd/oei/view/appndxd.txt .

many of the same products as industry 2011, meat packing plants, and industry. As noted above,

what distinguishes these industries is that 2011 slaughters while 2013 uses purchased carcasses.

There is no way to determine the source of materials for imported meat products, and this is also

not known for exports, so both imports and exports are classified into the single SIC and SIC

code 2011, with no trade at all in code 2013.

        Feenstra (1996, 1997) solved this problem of “missing” trade in SIC industries by taking

the combined industry (e.g. 2011), computing the ratio of imports or exports to U.S. domestic

production in this combined industry, and then using this ratio to impute trade in the “missing”

industries (i.e. as equal to U.S. production in that industry times the import or export ratio for the

combined industry). In other words, imports or exports in any combined industry is allocated its

separate industries using the same proportions as U.S. domestic production. We have not yet

been able to make this calculation for the 1987-based SIC import and export data, however,

because the domestic U.S. production is not known for years after 1996. So the 1987-based SIC

trade data included in the database has missing values for 73 (out of 459) SIC industries. This

will be corrected when the updated U.S. production data becomes available.12

        Despite these “missing” trade values, it is possible to compare the trade values with other

industry data by suming up the industry-level to match “super SIC4” trade categories (i.e. those

for which trade values are available), with the help of Table 3. Bernard et al (2002a and 2002b),

for example, aggregate plant-level US manufacturing data in excluded industries to match the

“super SIC4” trade data created by the HS10 to SIC4 concordance detailed above.

   The 1987-based SIC trade data computed by Peter Schott, with the “missing” values, is available at
www.som.yale.edu/faculty/pks4/sub_international.htm . The revised 1987-based SIC trade data, that imputes trade
within the “missing” SIC categories, will be made available at a future date at Robert Feenstra’s website,
www.internationaldata.org .

3.3 U.S. Manufacturing Trade, 1989 to 2001

       Figure 1 summarizes total US manufacturing imports (general value) and exports for 1989

to 2001. Imports grow from $401 billion to $961 billion in this period, while exports grow from

$291 to $619 billion.13 Schott’s estimates of manufacturing trade via the SIC87 concordance

described here are quite similar to those derived by Feenstra (1996, 1997).14 Tables 4 and 5

provide a reconciliation of the two methods for both imports and exports. The second column of

each table reports the sum of manufacturing value in the database across products whose MSIC

or XSIC is between 2000 and 3999. The values in this column exclude products falling into the

category 3XXX, for which an exact match to a more disaggregate industry was unknown. The

value of these 3XXX products are reported in the third column of the table. The fourth and fifth

columns report the value of products classified by only one of the two systems, e.g. the value of

products classified as manufacturing via MSIC/XSIC but not the new SIC87 concordance

discussed above. The sixth column reconciles the MSIC/XSIC system with Schott’s: it is the

sum of columns 2 through 4, less the values in column 5. Feenstra’s (1996, 1997) estimates are

provided for comparison in the final column.


4. U.S. Tariffs, 1989-2001

         The U.S. Tariff database is based on the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States

(HTS) for the years 1989 to 2001. It includes ad valorem, specific and estimated ad valorem

equivalent (AVE) tariffs based on the most favored nation (MFN) rate of the HTS. The file also

indicates products that are eligible for tariff preferences under free trade agreements such as with



13
    Note that manufacturing exports, like all other merchandise exports in the database, do not include re-exports
from the United States.
14
   Feenstra (1996) describes this aggregation in great detail. For imports, it boils down to the following chain of
concordances: HS10 to 1987 MSIC4 to 1972 MSIC4 to 1972 SIC4.

Canada, Mexico and Israel, and indicates products eligible for any preferential programs such as

the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) and the

African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). The database provides details of the applicable

tariffs under all of these agreements and programs. Tariffs can of course be inferred using data

on actual tariffs paid and the value of trade. The main information contained in the tariff

schedule that is not available elsewhere is information on applicable tariffs where no trade is

observed. While the MFN tariff can almost always be observed in this way the same is not true

for many preferential tariffs, because in many cases trade in the product between with the

relevant country simply does not take place. The other potential advantage is that the tariff

database provides information separately on specific versus ad valorem tariffs.

      There are a number of limitations of the tariff database (Romalis, 2002). One big limitation

is that it does not include information on quotas, such as quotas under the Multi-Fibre Agreement

or special quotas under NAFTA. The database does not include anti-dumping duties or special

duties such as those imposed on certain European Union goods. Information on rules of origin

which impact on eligibility for tariff programs is also absent. The chief difficulty is in mapping all

this additional information on quotas and rules of origin into the HTS. The database also excludes

information on almost all “production sharing” arrangements under which tariffs are only levied

on foreign value added. The data is also based on the first edition of the US tariff schedule for

each year, and any changes within the year will not be captured until the following year. For all

these reasons the tariffs in this database often do not coincide with actual tariffs paid.

      The database has been organized in two different ways. The format of one set of files

(USHTSxx.TXT) is kept as closely as possible to the format now used by the US International

Trade Commission (USITC) for summarizing tariff schedules. This allows users to easily update
                                                             13


the database as new information is posted by the USITC.15 These files are organized by tariff

program such as MFN, free trade agreements, GSP, or CBI. Another set of files (USTARxx.ASC)

has been created in a format more easily merged with the US trade data described in this paper.

These files list the lowest potential applicable AVE tariff for each 8-digit HTS product and each

country of origin. For example, the estimated AVE tariff for a product from a country that is

potentially eligible for the GSP will be 0 even though not all exports of this product from that

country may meet the requirements of the GSP program.


5. Documentation

       Links to all the data are available at www.nber.org/data/. In addition, the data are available
at three sites: www.internationaldata.org (for the HS and SITC import and export data),
www.som.yale.edu/faculty/pks4/sub_international.htm (for the 1987-based SIC trade data) and
gsbwww.uchicago.edu/fac/john.romalis/research/ (for the U.S. tariff data choose Tariff.ZIP).
Documentation for the files available at each of these sites is provided in the following pages.

5.1 Harmonized System Imports
           In 1989 and later years, the Harmonized System of commodity classification has been
used to measure disaggregate U.S. imports and exports. The particular application of the
Harmonized System to U.S. imports is called the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). These
datafiles contains the U.S. import data according to HTS number, distinguished by source
country, and including both quantitative information about imports and descriptive information
about each commodity.
           The files IMPYR_1.ASC, IMPYR_2.ASC AND IMPYR_3.ASC contain U.S. import
data for 1989-2001, sorted by HTS numbers, with YR = {a two digit number in the range 89-
01}. The first of these files, IMPYR_1.ASC, includes commodities with a HTS number
beginning with the digits 0-4; the second, IMPYR_2.ASC, contains those includes commodities
with an HTS number beginning with 5-7; and the third, IMPYR_3.ASC, includes those
commodities with a HTS number beginning with 8 or 9.

Missing Values:
        Missing values for any alphabetic variable are indicated by a blank field, as occurs
especially for the Units of quantity, indicating that either the units could not be measured, or
were simply missing. When the units could not be measured, there will be a zero value for
Quantity, but positive entries for consumption or general value. In other cases, a zero value for
Quantity and also for the consumption and general values indicates that the commodity was not
imported from that country in that year.
        The variable dutiable value is missing for 1989, which is indicated by a period.

Variable Definitions:
1. Customs Import Value. The Customs value reflects the value of imports as appraised by the
U.S. Customs Service. This value is generally defined as the price actually paid or payable for
merchandise when sold for exportation to the United States, excluding U.S. import duties,
freight, insurance and other charges incurred in bringing the merchandise to the United States.
2. Imports for Consumption. Imports for Consumption measure the total of merchandise that
has physically cleared through Customs either entering consumption channels immediately or
entering after withdrawal for consumption from bonded warehouses under Customs custody or
from Foreign Trade Zones. Many countries use the term “special imports” to designate statistics
compiled on this basis.
3. General Imports. General Imports measure the total physical arrivals of merchandise from
foreign countries, whether such merchandise enters consumption channels immediately or is
entered into bonded warehouses or Foreign Trade Zones under Customs custody.
4. Dutiable Value of Imports and Calculated Duty. The dutiable value represents in general, the
Customs value of foreign merchandise imported into the United States which is subject to duty.
The calculated duty represents the estimated duty collected. Estimated data are calculated by the
Census based on the applicable rate(s) of duty as shown in the HTS.
5. Import Charges. The import charges represent the aggregate cost of all freight, insurance and
other charges (excluding import duties) incurred in bringing the merchandise from alongside the
carrier at the port of exportation and placing it alongside the carrier at the first port of entry in the
United States. The sum of the Customs value and the charges is the c.i.f. (cost, insurance and
freight) value.

6. The import-based SIC (MSIC) codes reported in these files differ from the true domestic
based SIC numbers, as discussed in the main text of the documentation.
7. The NAICS codes were reported by the U.S. Census beginning in 2000. For earlier years,
these codes have been imputed based on the commodities with similar descriptions, or SIC,
SITC, or End use classifications.

Related Files:
1. A complete list of the commodities, including the HTS number for each, 1987 import-based
SIC numbers (4-digit), Rev. 3 SITC number (5-digit), ENDUSE classification, NAICS
classification, units of quantity, and the first and last years that the HTS number is used for that
commodity, is contained in the concordance CONIMP89_01.ASC, which is described in
CONIMP89_01.TXT.
2. The source country for each imported commodity is identified by a name and United Nations
(UN) code. The complete list of names and UN codes, along with a correspondence to the
country codes used by the U.S. Census, is provided in COUNTRY.TXT.
3. There is a cross-reference between the Harmonized Tariff System (HTS) numbers that are
used in the 1989-1994 import files, and the Tariff Schedule of the United States Annotated
(TSUSA) codes that are used in the 1972-1988 import files. This cross-reference is contained in
HS_TSUSA.ASC and described in HS_TSUSA.TXT.

5.2 Harmonized System Import Concordance

       In 1989 and later years, the Harmonized System (HS) of commodity classification has
been used to measure disaggregate U.S. imports and exports. The HS contains approximately
5000 headings and subheadings covering all articles in trade. The particular application of the
Harmonized System to U.S. imports is called the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS).
       The file CONIMP89_01.ASC is a concordance that contains a complete list of the HTS
numbers used identify U.S. imports over 1989-2001, along with various information about each
of these commodities.

Record Layout:

columns 1-10            -   Harmonized Tariff System (HTS) number
columns 12-15           -   1987 version import-based SIC code (4-digits)
columns 17-21           -   Revision 2 SITC code (5-digits)
columns 23-27           -   Revision 3 SITC code (5-digits)
columns 29-33           -   End-Use Classification
columns 35-40           -   North American Classification System (NAICS) code
                            (1997 version, 6-digit)
columns 42-44           -   First year that this HTS number was used (89 – 101)
columns 46-48           -   Last year that this HTS number was used (89 – 101)
columns 50-52           -   Units of quantity (see UNIT8901.ASC)
columns 54-103          -   Short HTS commodity description
columns 105-254         -   Long HTS commodity description
column 256              -   End of record indicator (the number 1)

Missing Values:

Some units of quantity are missing, which are indicated by a blank.
                                                18



Special Considerations:

1. The HTS number can be repeated due to differing commodity descriptions in various years, or
changing units of quantity. For example, the file CONIMP89_01.ASC contains the two lines:

0301920000 0273 03411 01000 112511 1989 1992    EELS (ANGUILLA SPP.), LIVE
0301920000 0273 03411 01000 112511 1993 2001 KG EELS (ANGUILLA SPP.), LIVE

This is an example of a repeated HTS number due to a changing unit of quantity. Note,
however, that the range of years over which each HTS number/description/units of quantity
applies is non-overlapping (so that the HTS number and first year used is a unique identifier).
2. The “first year” is computed as the first year that an HTS number is actually used for imports,
while the “last year” is computed as the last year that this HTS number appears in a concordance
from the source below. There are a small number of commodities that are never actually
imported over 1989 - 2001, their HTS numbers do not appear in this concordance.
3. The import-based SIC (MSIC) codes reported in these files differ from the true domestic-
based SIC numbers, as discussed in the main text of the documentation.
4. In the files IMP*.ASC for 1989-2001 and the concordance CON89_01.ASC, the SITC Rev. 3
category 95000 has been introduced for “Gold coin and other coin.” These are distinguished
separately from “Gold numismatic (collector’s) coins,” which has the SITC Rev. 3 number
89650, and the SITC Rev. 2 number 89605. Accordingly, the SITC Rev. 3 number 95000 has
been introduced, with the corresponding SITC Rev. 2 number of 89605.
5. The NAICS codes were reported by the U.S. Census beginning in 2000. For earlier years,
these codes have been imputed based on the commodities with similar descriptions, or SIC,
SITC, or End use classifications.

Related Files:

1. The HTS description, SIC, SITC, NAICS numbers, and units of quantity in this concordance
are identical to those used in the files IMPYR_1.ASC, IMPYR_2.ASC, and IMPYR_3.ASC, for
the years YR=89,90,...,00,01.
2. For years before 1989, imported commodities are identified by the Tariff Schedule of the
United States Annotated (TSUSA) numbers. A concordance of these numbers is contained in
                                               19


CONIMP72_88.ASC, as described in CONIMP72_88.TXT. A cross-reference between the
TSUSA and HTS numbers is contained in HS_TSUSA.ASC, as described in HS_TSUSA.TXT.
3. The units of quantity are described in UNIT8901.ASC.

Size: CONIMP89_94.ASC contains 23,234 records.

5.3 Harmonized System Exports

        For 1989-2001, exports to the United States at a disaggregate level were measured
according to the Harmonized System (HS) classification. These datafiles contain U.S. export
data according to their HS number, distinguished by destination country, and including both
quantitative information about exports and descriptive information about each commodity.
        The files EXPYR_1.ASC, EXPYR_2.ASC, and EXPYR_3.ASC contain U.S. export data

Missing Values:
Missing values for any alphabetic variable are indicated by a blank field, as occurs especially for
the Units of quantity, indicating that either the units could not be measured, or were simply
missing. When the units could not be measured, there will be a zero value for Quantity, but
positive entries for Value.

Variable Definitions:
1. Export statistics are compiled by the Census according to two types: D (Domestic) or F
(Foreign). Domestic exports are defined as merchandise grown, produced, or manufactured
(including imported merchandise which has been enhanced in value) in the United States
Foreign exports are defined as merchandise that has entered the United States and is being re-
exported in the same condition as when imported.        Only the Domestic exports are included in
this data; foreign exports, i.e. re-exports, are not included.
2. The export value is the selling price or cost if not sold, including inland freight, insurance,
and other charges to the U.S. port of export, but excluding unconditional discounts and
commissions. This value is called the F.a.s. (free alongside ship) value.
3. The 1987 export-based SIC numbers are not the same as the SIC numbers used to identify
U.S. industries. This is because industries in the United States are sometimes defined in terms of
the processing that occurs in them, whereas the method of processing may not be known to the
exporter. As a result, a condensed set of SIC numbers called export based SIC are used, as
discussed further in the main documentation.

4. It should be noted that the HS commodity numbers for any commodity change over time, so
the only sure way to keep track of a given commodity is by its full alphabetic description.

1. A complete list of the commodities, including the HS number for each, 1987 export-based
SIC numbers (4-digit), Rev. 3 SITC number (5-digit), ENDUSE classification, NAICS
classification, units of quantity, and the first and last years that the HS number is used for that
commodity, is contained in the concordance CONEXP89_01.ASC, which is described in
CONEXP89_01.TXT.
2. The source country for each exported commodity is identified by the name and United
Nations (UN) code. The complete list of names and UN codes, along with a correspondence to
the country codes used by the U.S. Census, is provided in COUNTRY.TXT.
3. For years before 1989, exported commodities are identified by the Schedule B numbers. A
concordance of these numbers is contained in CONEXP78_88.ASC, as described in
CONEXP78_88.TXT. A cross-reference between the Schedule B and HS numbers is contained
in HS_SCH_B.ASC, as described in HS_SCH_B.TXT.

5.4 Harmonized System Export Concordance

       In 1989 and later years, the Harmonized System (HS) of commodity classification has
been used to measure disaggregate U.S. imports and exports. The HS contains approximately
5000 headings and subheadings covering all articles in trade. It replaces the Schedule B system
used in earlier years for exports.
       The file CONEXP89_01.ASC is a concordance that contains a complete list of the HS
numbers used identify U.S. exports over 1989-2001, along with various information about each
of these commodities.

Record Layout:
columns 1-10            -   Harmonized System (HS) number
columns 12-15           -   1987 version export-based SIC code (4-digits)
columns 17-21           -   Revision 2 SITC code (5-digits)
columns 23-27           -   Revision 3 SITC code (5-digits)
columns 29-33           -   End-Use Classification
columns 35-40           -   North American Classification System (NAICS) code
                            (1997 version, 6-digit)
columns 42-44           -   First year that this HS number was used (89 – 101)
columns 46-48           -   Last year that this HS number was used (89 – 101)
columns 50-52           -   Units of quantity (see UNIT8901.ASC)
columns 54-103          -   Short HS commodity description
columns 105-254         -   Long HS commodity description
column 256              -   End of record indicator (the number 1)

Missing Values:
Some units of quantity are missing, which are indicated by a blank.

Special Considerations:

1. The HS number can be repeated due to differing commodity descriptions in various years, or
changing units of quantity. For example, the file CONEXP89_01.ASC contains the two lines:
                                                 23



0301920000 0273 03410 03411 01000 112511 1989 1992    EELS (ANGUILLA SPP.), LIVE
0301920000 0273 03410 03411 01000 112511 1993 2001 KG EELS (ANGUILLA SPP.), LIVE

This is an example of a repeated HS number due to a changing unit of quantity. Note, however,
that the range of years over which each HS number/description/units of quantity applies is non-
overlapping (so that the HS number and first year used is a unique identifier).
2. The first year is computed as the first year that an HS number is actually used for exports,
while the last year is computed as the last year that this HS number appears in a concordance
from the source below. There are a small number of commodities that are never actually
exported over 1989 - 2001, their HS numbers do not appear in this concordance. An important
example is fertilizer, where the concordance includes the line:

3100000000 2874 56200 56200 12510 325312 1989 2001    FERTILIZERS A FERT MATERIALS

However, the concordance does NOT include the following lines, which are particular types of
fertilizers, but these HS codes are never used 1989-2001:

3101000000 1989 2001 TON ANIMAL/VEG FERTILIZER, MIXED/NT/CHEMICALLY TREATED

The above HS codes are included in the concordances from Census, but since they have no
exports, they are not included in CONEXP89_01.ASC.
3. The export-based SIC (XSIC) codes reported in these files differ from the true domestic
based SIC numbers, as discussed in the main text of the documentation.
4. The NAICS codes were reported by the U.S. Census beginning in 2000. For earlier years,
these codes have been imputed based on the commodities with similar descriptions, or SIC,
SITC, or End use classifications.

Related Files:
1. The HS description, SIC, SITC, NAICS numbers, and units of quantity in this concordance
are identical to those used in the files EXPYR_1.ASC, EXPYR_2.ASC, and EXPYR_3.ASC, for
the years YR=89,90,...,00,01.
2. For years before 1989, exported commodities are identified by the Schedule B classification.
A concordance of these numbers is contained in CONEXP78_88.ASC, as described in
CONEXP78_88.TXT. A cross-reference between the Schedule B and HS numbers is contained
in HS_SCH_B.ASC, as described in HS_SCH_B.TXT.
3. The units of quantity are described in UNIT8901.ASC.

Size: CONEXP89_00.ASC contains 10,740 records.

5.5 SITC Import and Export Data

       Using the files IMP*.ASC and EXP*.ASC for 1972-2001, the import and export data are
summed according to the 5-digit Standard International Trade Classification (SITC) codes. The
results are stored in IMP_SITC72.ASC,....,IMP_SITC01.ASC and EXP_SITC72.ASC,....,
EXP_SITC01.ASC. Here we describe the features of the 1989-2001 data.

Record Layout for 1989 – 2001 import data, IMP_SITC??.ASC:
columns 1-5           - SITC Rev. 2 number (5-digit)
columns 7-11          - SITC Rev. 3 number
                        A 5-digit Revision 3 number for 1989-2001
columns 13-18         - Country code (UN codes are used, as listed in COUNTRY.TXT)
columns 20-27         - Source country name
columns 29-40         - Customs value, Imports for Consumption (dollars)
columns 42-53         - Customs value, General Imports (dollars)
columns 55-66         - CIF value (dollars)
columns 68-79         - Duties paid (dollars)
columns 81-83         - Year

Record Layout for 1989 – 2001 export data, EXP_SITC??.ASC:
columns 1-5           - SITC Rev. 2 number (5-digit)
columns 7-11          - SITC Rev. 3 number
                        A 5-digit Revision 3 number for 1989-2001
columns 13-18         - Country code (UN codes are used, as listed in COUNTRY.TXT)
columns 20-27         - Source country name
columns 29-40         - Value (dollars)
columns 42-44         - Year

Special Considerations:
1. See the file IMP89_01.TXT and EXP89_01.TXT for a detailed definition of all variables. CIF
import value is computed as the sum of Customs Value, Imports for Consumption, and Import
Charges (import charges equal freight plus insurance).
2. For 1989-2001, the data are initially organized on a 5-digit SITC Rev. 3 basis. In this case the
concordance SITCR3_2.ASC gives a unique 5-digit SITC Rev. 2 code for each of the Rev. 3
codes. So these Rev. 2 codes were added into the file for each year, and then the records were
re-sorted according to the Rev. 2 codes. As is apparent by inspection, each 5-digit Rev. 2 code
can appear more than once. Thus, to compute the value of imports by 5-digit Rev. 2 code, it
would be necessary to sum over all records for each such code.

3. Also included in these files are the variables listed above summed over all source countries, in
which case the Country name is listed as WORLD, and the Country code is 100000.

Size: Each file IMP_SITC*.ASC and EXP_SITC*.ASC is between 2 and 10 megabytes.

Related Files:
1. The commodity names corresponding to each SITC code, for each revision of the SITC, are
found in SITCREV1.ASC, SITCREV2.ASC, and SITCREV3.ASC.
2. Concordances between the various revisions of the SITC are found in SITCR2_1.ASC,
SITCR2_3.ASC and SITCR3_2.ASC.

5.6 1987-based SIC Import and Export Data

       Using the files IMP*.ASC and EXP*.ASC for 1972-2001, the import and export data are
summed according to the 4-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes.
       For the years 1972-1994, the bilateral data have been summed according to the 1972
version of the SIC by Robert Feenstra, at www.internationaldata.org . For the years 1989-2001,
the bilateral data have been summed according to the 1987 version of the SIC by Peter Schott, as
documented below and available at at www.som.yale.edu/faculty/pks4/sub_international.htm.
Schott’s master HS10 to SIC4 concordance is contained in HS10_SIC4_8901.ASC.

(1) Record Layout for HS10_SIC4_8901:
The variables included in HS10_SIC4_8901.ASC are listed below, by column. This file is a

                       (Customs value and General Imports are defined below)
column 6      - Dutiable Value (dollars)
column 7      - Calculated Duties (dollars)
                       (The dutiable value and calculated duties are defined below)
column 8      - Import Charges (dollars)
                       (Import charges equal freight plus insurance, as defined below)
Variable Definitions:
1. The export value is the selling price or cost if not sold, including inland freight, insurance,
and other charges to the U.S. port of export, but excluding unconditional discounts and
commissions. This value is called the F.a.s. (free alongside ship) value.
2. Customs Import Value. The Customs value reflects the value of imports as appraised by the
U.S. Customs Service. This value is generally defined as the price actually paid or payable for
merchandise when sold for exportation to the United States, excluding U.S. import duties,
freight, insurance and other charges incurred in bringing the merchandise to the United States.
3. Imports for Consumption. Imports for Consumption measure the total of merchandise that
has physically cleared through Customs either entering consumption channels immediately or
entering after withdrawal for consumption from bonded warehouses under Customs custody or
from Foreign Trade Zones. Many countries use the term “special imports” to designate statistics
compiled on this basis.
4. General Imports. General Imports measure the total physical arrivals of merchandise from
foreign countries, whether such merchandise enters consumption channels immediately or is
entered into bonded warehouses or Foreign Trade Zones under Customs custody.
5. Dutiable Value of Imports and Calculated Duty. The dutiable value represents in general, the
Customs value of foreign merchandise imported into the United States which is subject to duty.
The calculated duty represents the estimated duty collected. Estimated data are calculated by the
Census based on the applicable rate(s) of duty as shown in the HTS.
6. Import Charges. The import charges represent the aggregate cost of all freight, insurance and
other charges (excluding import duties) incurred in bringing the merchandise from alongside the
carrier at the port of exportation and placing it alongside the carrier at the first port of entry in the
United States. The sum of the Customs value and the charges is the c.i.f. (cost, insurance and
freight) value.

5.7 U.S. Tariff Database
       The tab-delimited text files USHTS89.TXT to USHTS01.TXT contain the items listed in
the record layout. Not all items are present in every year. For example, the special rates of duty
for Mexico under NAFTA will of course not appear before 1994. The “MFN_OTHER_RATE”
and “COL2_OTHER_RATE” are missing for Chapter 91 of the HTS (watches and clocks) due to
the complexity of the tariff lines for most of these items. These two rates are missing for all other
products prior to 1997 due to the difficulty of extracting the data from the original tariff files. A
small number of additional products are affected in these years; only a dozen such tariffs apply in
the year 2001.

Record Layout USTAR??.ASC:

The ASCII files USTAR89.ASC to USTAR01.ASC include the following variables:

columns 1-10          - 8-digit Harmonized System (HS) number
columns 11-20         - Country code
                        United Nations codes are used (see COUNTRY.ASC)
columns 21-31         - Country name
columns 32-41         - Estimated Ad Valorem Equivalent tariff

Size: Each file is between 57MB and 116MB.

Sources:
Files from 1997 onwards have been sourced directly from the USITC at www.usitc.gov. The
main modification has been the calculation of Ad Valorem Equivalent (AVE) tariffs under a
number of import programs using observed unit import values also sourced from the USITC.
                                                 32


Files prior to 1997 have been extracted from WordPerfect files of the HTS that were at one time,
but are no longer, posted on the USITC’s website. The major additional change that had to be
made to these was for the 1994 file, which did not include tariff preferences for Mexican goods
under NAFTA because NAFTA had not been approved when the first edition of the1994 HTS
was written. This information was inferred from the NAFTA staging categories kindly provided
by Antoni Estevadeordal of the Inter-American Development Bank.

Missing Values
Missing values occur where there is a specific tariff, but no observable unit price in that year to
enable estimation of the AVE tariff. Missing Values are coded “.”.

Appendix A: Country Codes and Names (United Nations Basis)
        The U.S. import data collected by the Bureau of the Census keeps track of the source
country by certain Census codes. For the import database, the United Nations (UN) country
codes and names are used instead. The file COUNTRY.ASC gives a complete list of the UN
codes, UN country abbreviations, the corresponding Census codes, and the full name of the
Census country. This file is printed on the following two pages.

Record Layout:
columns 1-6             -   United Nations (UN) code
columns 8-15            -   Abbreviated UN country name
columns 17-20           -   U.S. Census country code
columns 22-50           -   Full Census country name

The records are sorted by the six-digit UN codes. The first two-digits of that code are a regional
identifier, the next three-digits are a specific country code, and the last digit is a special modifier
than equals zero in nearly all cases.

Special considerations: There are more Census country codes than UN codes. This means that
a given UN code may appear on several subsequent records, followed by the same abbreviated
UN country name; on each of these records, a different Census country code and Census county
name will appear. For example, South Africa is treated as one country in the UN codes, but is
broken down into several smaller regions in the Census codes and names.

Related Files: The UN codes and abbreviated country names included in COUNTRY.ASC are
identical to those used in the files IMP*.ASC for 1972-2001.

Size: COUNTRY.ASC has 250 records (including its header).

Sources: The UN codes are the six digit Standard Classification of Customs Areas and
Territories, and are the same as that used by Statistics Canada in their World Trade Database.
The Census codes and country names are taken from the file COUNTRY.DBF contained on:
