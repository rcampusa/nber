                                        ABSTRACT

Over the past twenty years, especially the past decade, China has taken enormous strides to
develop its bond market as an integral step of financial reform. This paper aims to provide the
most up-to-date overview of Chinese bond markets, by highlighting two distinct and largely
segmented markets: Over-the-Counter based interbank market, and centralized exchange market.
We explain various bond instruments traded in these two markets, highlighting their inherent
connection with the banking system, and many multi-layer regulatory bodies who are interacting
with each other in an intricate way. We also covers the credit ratings and rating agencies in
Chinese market, and offer an account of ever-rising default incidents in China starting 2014.
Finally, we discuss the recent regulatory tightening of shadow banking since late 2017 and its
impact on bond investors, and the forces behind the internalization of Chinese bond markets in
the near future.

1 Overview of Chinese Bond Markets

Over the past twenty years, especially the past decade, China has taken enormous strides to develop its

bond market as an integral step of financial reform, along with its tremendous effort in interest rate

liberalization and internalization of its currency RMB.

Figure 1 Panel A depicts the growth of Chinese bond market capitalization scaled by GDP in the past

decade; we observe that bond market capitalization over GDP rises from 35% in 2008 to more than 90%

in 2017. For comparison, the bond market capitalization over GDP in U.S. stays slightly above 200%

during the same time period. Relative to the stock market capitalization, Chinese bond market has been

also experiencing a steady uprising trend, only to catch up to the U.S. level which is about 130% in 2017.

Due to historical reasons, there are two distinct and largely segmented markets in today’s Chinese bond

markets: Over-the-Counter based interbank market, and centralized exchange market. The interbank bond

market in China resembles the interbank market observed in developed countries like U.S., while the

exchange bond market in China is part of the Stock Exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen. Section 4.2


                                                                          2/65
offers a brief history of the development and evolution of these two bond markets. The interbank market

is the dominant one within these two markets; at the end of 2018, about 89% of the total bonds outstanding

in China are in the interbank market, while the rest of 11% is in the exchange. 2 Various fixed income

securities are issued and traded on these two bond markets, with many multi-layer regulatory bodies

interacting with each other in an intricate way.

We first elaborate on the above mentioned two bond markets in Section 2, together with various bond

instruments traded there. Section 3 provides a brief history of Chinese bond markets, and Section 4

highlights their inherent connection with and the banking system, together with the internalization of

Chinese bond markets in the near future. Section 5 covers the credit ratings and rating agencies, and

Section 6 offers an account of ever-rising default incidents in China starting 2014. We provide some data

sources for in-depth study of Chinese bond market in Section 7.


2 Bond Markets and Bond Types

In this section, we first go over the details of the two segmented Chinese bond markets, i.e., the interbank

market and the exchange market. After explaining the various bond security types traded in Chinese bond

markets, we provide a comparison between these two bond markets.




2   Besides these two major bond markets, there is also a Counter Trading System through which retail investors trade bonds with commercial

banks at their bank counters. This retail Over-the-Counter market can be considered as the natural extension of the interbank market.



                                                                     3/65
2.1 Segmented Bond Markets


2.1.1   The Interbank Market (银行间市场)


The interbank bond market, often called as the China Interbank Market (CIBM, 中国银行间债券市场),

was established in 1997 and has become the dominating market for bond issuance and trading in China.

Beside spot and repurchase transactions, swaps and futures are also actively trade by participants in the

interbank market. The value of outstanding bonds in the interbank market reached 76 trillion RMB at the

end of 2018, with an annual issuance of 41 trillion RMB in the same year.

As a wholesale market, the participants of interbank market are restricted to various qualified institutional

investors including commercial banks, mutual funds, insurance companies, and security firms. As shown

in Figure 2, commercial banks (e.g., state-owned commercial banks, join-stock commercial banks, urban

and rural credit unions, etc.) form the largest group of institutional investors who held about 57% of the

outstanding bonds in the interbank market in 2018. The second largest group is mutual funds, broadly

defined to include the fast-growing asset management industry thanks to the rise of wealth-management

products after 2012; they held about 29% of outstanding bonds in the interbank market. Security firms,

insurance companies, and foreign institutions are the next; these three groups of institutional investors

formed a market share of 7% in the interbank market.

The main regulator of the interbank market is the People’s Bank of China (PBC, 中国人民银行), the

central bank in China. Participants in the interbank market trade via China Foreign Exchange Trade

System (CFETS, 外汇交易中心), and all participating institutions are required to open their accounts in

China Central Depository & Clearing Co. Ltd (CCDC, 中债登), a leading depository and clearing house

in China. After the terms of trades are finalized through bilateral bargaining, CFETS record these

transactions and CCDC offers exclusive custodial and clearing services in the interbank market. This

                                                     4/65
monopolistic position came to an end after the establishment of Shanghai Clearing House (SHCH, 上清

所) on November 2009. Led by the PBC, SHCH competes with CCDC by offering clearing services for

products like Medium-Term Notes, Commercial Papers, and Private Placement Notes.


2.1.2   The Exchange Market (交易所市场)


The exchange market for the Chinese bond market is part of the two Stock Exchanges located in Shanghai

and Shenzhen, which were established around 1991 in the wake of State-Owned-Enterprise (SOE, 国有

企业) and financial reform. In August 1995, the exchange-based bond market was designated as the only

legitimate bond market in China. This dominant position came to an end on May 1997 when the PBC,

who worried about the overheated Chinese stock market fueled by bond repo financing, ordered all

commercial banks to switch to the newly established interbank market on June 1997 (see Section 4.2 for

more details). Despite this setback, the exchange market has been keeping its pace with the rapid growth

of the ever-complicated Chinese financial system. At the end of 2018, the value of outstanding bonds in

the exchange market reached 9.2 trillion RMB, with an annual issuance of 2.5 trillion RMB in 2018.

The regulator of the exchange bond market is China Security Regulatory Commission (CSRC, 证监会),

the powerful agency that is overseeing the Chinese stock markets. The participants of the exchange bond

market include both institutional players and retail household investors, with only spot and repurchase

transactions available. Electronic order books aggregate all bids from investors, and matched trades are

settled via China Security Depository & Clearing Co. Ltd (CSDC, 中证登).


2.2 Bond Types

We classify the fixed-income securities in Chinese bond market into three broad categories based on

issuing entities: government bonds, financial bonds, and corporate bonds (that are issued by non-financial


                                                   5/65
sectors). There is also another widely used classification among practitioners in China, which groups

financial bonds and corporate bonds together as the so-called “Credit Bonds.” Note that, in Chinese bond

market, the issuers are still dominated by government or entities directly owned by the government (e.g.,

SOEs, most commercial banks, etc.)

Consistent with international practice, overall speaking, the creditworthiness of these bond instruments is

decreasing in these three broad categories. Although corporate bonds in some international context also

include long-term bonds issued by financial institutions, we specifically separate out bonds issued by

financial institutions, given that almost all entities in Chinese financial sector are state-owned. Figure 3

compares the outstanding bonds in China and U.S. from 2008-2018, by these three categories. We observe

relatively large fraction of government bonds (U.S. Treasury) in the U.S. bond market, but the weight of

financial bonds and corporate bonds are similar.

We now turn to details of these bond types. Table 1 gives two snap shots of the outstanding balances of

these bonds by types in Chinese bond markets in 2008 and 2018, and Table 2 gives the outstanding balance

and issuance amount by bond types in 2018.


2.2.1   Government Bonds (政府债)


Treasury Bonds (国债)

Treasury bonds are issued by the Ministry of Finance and backed by the fiscal revenue collected by the

central government of China, representing the creditworthiness of China as a sovereign. There are mainly

two types of Treasury bonds: book-entry treasury bonds that can be traded and transferred in the market,

and certificate treasury bonds which cannot be traded and hence mainly used as a savings vehicle. As one

of the key instruments by the PBC in implementing its monetary policy through open market operations,

treasury bonds are one of the most important financial products in today’s Chinese financial market,


                                                    6/65
enjoying relatively large issuance and trading volumes with significant secondary market liquidity. At the

end of 2018 the Treasury bonds reached 15 Trillion RMB, which is about 17% of the Chinese bond market.

This is rather small relative to the importance of U.S. Treasuries in the U.S. bond market (46%).

Nowadays, a market mechanism via competitive bidding of participating financial institutions (mainly

commercial banks) determine the interest rates offered by Treasury bonds. We will come back to this issue

in Section 4.1.

Municipal Bonds (地方政府债)

Municipal bonds are issued by local governments in China. The market for municipal bonds almost did

not exist until the 2009 four-trillion stimulus plan pushed out by Beijing in the wake of 2007/08 global

financial crisis. The outstanding municipal bonds grew steadily but rather slowly in the next five years,

only to observe a dramatic burst in its issuance volume in 2015. As explained later in Section 4.3, this is

the outcome from a sequence of noticeable regulatory tightening from Beijing to reign in the ever-growing

local government debt problem in the second half of 2014, especially the tone-setting guideline “Article

43.” As a result, in 2015 local governments issued 2.8 trillion RMB municipal bonds, of which 2 trillion

is used to swap the debt initially raised by Local Government Financing Vehicles (LGFVs, 地方政府融

资平台).

At the end of 2018, the outstanding municipal bonds reached 18 trillion RMB, with a value-weighted

average maturity of 6.4 years at issuance. Because municipal bonds are assigned to zero risk weights, most

of municipal bonds in China are held by commercial banks (85% at the end of 2018).

Policy Bank Bonds (政策银行债)

China has three policy banks today: China Development Bank, Export-Import Bank of China, and

Agricultural Development Bank of China. They were established in 1994 to take over the government-

directed lending functions from state-owned commercial banks, and are responsible for financing

                                                    7/65
economic and trade development and state-invested projects. Policy bank bonds are issued by these three

policy banks who are essentially backed by the central government, and hence considered to be quasi-

sovereign bonds and risk-free (e.g., they receive zero risk-weight if held by commercial banks).

At the end of 2018, there were 14 trillion RMB policy bank bonds outstanding, which actually exceeds

the Treasury bonds outstanding issued by Ministry of Finance. The weighted average of maturity at

issuance is 8.1 years and two major institutional holders are national commercial banks and mutual funds.

It is important to highlight that 55% of policy bank bonds are issued by China Development Bank (CDB,

国家开发银行). Thanks to its depth and sheer size, the CDB bond has gained its superb secondary market

liquidity (even better than Treasury bonds in some dimension). In addition, from the perspective of most

institutional investors, CDB bonds are with same tax-treatment with other fixed-income securities. As a

result, CDB bonds are widely accepted as the risk-free benchmark in practice (as opposed to Treasury

bonds).

Other Government Bonds

Other government bonds include central bank bills and other bonds with government support. They are

negligible in recent years.


2.2.2     Financial Bonds (金融债)


We classify all bonds issued by financial institutions, including commercial banks, insurance companies,

and security firms, as “financial bonds.” Because the financial industry, which is considered to be a

command-high industry for economic growth, still remains largely state-owned and often with implicit

government guarantee, financial bonds are considered to be better risk-profile than corporate bonds issued

by non-financial firms. This better risk profile is reflected in a higher rating distribution received by




                                                   8/65
financial bonds (see Figure 7 in Section 5.2); there is little difference in yield spreads between financial

and non-financial bonds once conditional on ratings.

Negotiable Certificates of Deposit (NCDs, 同业存单)

As a money market instrument, a NCD is a certificate of fixed-term deposit issued by depository

institutions in the interbank market. Often the time it is also called interbank CDs, or just CDs. As shown

in Table 1, there were no NCDs in 2008. But the NCD market grew rapidly since its inception in December

2013, reaching 9.8 trillion RMB at the end of 2018, thanks to its high credit quality (guaranteed by issuing

banks), excellent secondary market liquidity, and reasonable premium over risk-free benchmark offered

by government bonds). The NCD rates tracks closely with Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate (Shibor, 上

海银行间同业拆放利率), with a premium of 80 bps over CDB bonds in 2018.

The typical issuers of NCDs are relatively smaller joint-stock commercial banks and urban credit unions,

while the buyers of NCDs are large state-own banks (e.g., the Big-five) or their Wealth Management

Products (WMPs, 理财产品), as large state-owned banks enjoy cheap funding sources either from retail

deposits or various central bank facilities. 3 Besides large state-owned commercial banks, money market

funds and mutual funds (broadly defined to include asset management plans funded by wealth-

management products) are also investing in NCDs for favorable returns.

Other Financial Bonds

Other than NCDs, investors can also invest in senior and/or subordinate bonds issued by commercial banks

(large state-owned banks, joint-stock banks, and urban and rural credit unions), insurance companies,




3
  The Big-five banks are Bank of China, Construction Bank of China, Commercial and Industrial Bank of China, and
Agricultural Bank of China (these banks are often-called the Big-four) and the Bank of Communications. The issuance of
NCDs, especially for rural credit unions, was severely curtailed by the recent Macro-Prudential Assessment regulatory
tightening starting May 2017.


                                                         9/65
security firms, and other financial institutions. These financial bonds contribute to a relative small part of

Chinese bond market (about 7% of the market at the end of 2018).


2.2.3   Corporate Bonds (产业债)


The category of corporate bonds broadly covers all fixed-income securities issued by non-financial firms

in China, including asset-backed securities and other convertible securities.

Enterprise Bonds (企业债)

Enterprise bonds, which emerged as early as in early 1980’s, are an important financial instrument used

by non-financial firms in China as an alternative to bank loans. After the establishment of the interbank

market in 1997, the interbank market became the only market where enterprise bonds were issued and

traded, as back then enterprise bonds are mainly issued by SOEs who are not publicly listed in stock

exchanges. In 2005, the exchange market started to compete for businesses, and issuing entities can choose

to sell their bonds in both markets. As a result, about 82% of enterprise bonds become dual listed since

then, and at the end of 2018, about 1/3 (2/3) of enterprise bonds are issued and traded in the exchange

(interbank) market. Wang, Wei, and Zhong (2015) and Chen et al (2018) study dual listed enterprise bonds.

For historical reasons, the issuance of enterprise bonds have been always regulated by National

Development and Reform Commission (NDRC, 国家发展改革委员会), a powerful government agency

that is overseeing SOE reform and relatively remote from PBC and CSRC. The outstanding value of

enterprise bonds has reached 3 trillion RMB at the end of 2018, and their investors are mainly commercial

banks and mutual funds.




                                                     10/65
One important component of enterprise bonds is Municipal Corporate Bonds (MCB, 城投债), 4 which

consist of 75% of enterprise bonds outstanding at the end of 2018. Municipal Corporate Bonds are bonds

issued by LGFVs which are state-owned enterprises to support the infrastructure investment, both at the

provincial and city level. They are one of the perfect examples of the mixture between planning and market

in today’s Chinese economy: they are with implicit backing of the corresponding local government (the

word Municipal), but in a strict legal sense they are issued by LGFV entities just like other regular

corporations (the word Corporate).

Exchange-Traded Corporate Bonds (公司债)

Exchange-traded corporate bonds stand for corporate bonds that are issued in the exchange market and

regulated by the CSRC. When first launched in 2007, exchange-traded corporate bonds could only be

issued by publicly listed companies. In 2015, the CSRC expanded the eligible list of issuing entities in a

significant way, which allowed all firms registered as “corporations” to issue exchange-traded corporate

bonds. Besides, the CSRC also loosened the bond issuance criterion, and gave greenlight to both public

issuance as well as private placement. Since then exchange-traded corporate bonds grew rapidly, reaching

6 trillion RMB at the end of 2018.

Medium-Term Notes (中期票据)

Issued in the interbank market, medium-term notes are mainly used by large SOEs as well as prominent

private enterprises since 2008. The typical debt maturity at issuance is between three to five years, but




4   These bonds are also called Urban Investment Construction Bond, or Chengtou Bond which is the phonetic translation of its Chinese name,

in other existing papers. Bai and Zhou (2018) offer the first comprehensive study on the pricing of MCBs, and Liu, Lyu, and Yu (2017)

investigate the role of implicit local government guarantees for these bonds.



                                                                    11/65
also can go as high as ten years. At the end of 2018, the outstanding bond value of medium-term notes

reached 5.7 trillion RMB.

Commercial Papers (including Super Commercial Paper, 短融及超短融)

Issued in the interbank market, commercial papers are short-term (generally below one year) financing

instruments mainly used by large SOEs as well as prominent private enterprises. For commercial paper,

the typical debt maturity at issuance is within 1 year, while for super commercial papers it is about 270

days. Commercial papers were launched in 2005, and at the end of 2018, the outstanding bond value

reached 1.9 trillion RMB.

Asset-Backed Securities (ABS, 资产支持证券)

First launched in 2005 and growing by about 49% per year since then, ABS can be issued and traded in

both interbank and exchange markets. As a nascent financial product, ABS is the financing engine behind

the peer-to-peer lending platforms, a burgeoning sector that has been experiencing an astonishing growth

recently (for example, the micro-financing arm under Ant Financial Services Group). It is also common

for commercial banks to issue ABS backed up by consumer or industrial loans, which essentially removes

their on-balance-sheet assets to off-balance-sheet. In 2018, the outstanding value of asset-backed

securities reached 2.6 trillion RMB, which was about 13% of the corporate bonds and 3% of all bonds.

Private Placement Notes (PPN, 定向工具)

Launched in 2011, PPN represents one of the financial innovations by the interbank market and essentially

is a mixture between private debt and public bonds. Non-financial firms can issue PPNs to a relatively

small number of select institutional investors, who then may transfer these notes among themselves before

their maturity in the interbank market. Relative to other more standard publicly placed bonds, PPNs face

much less stringent requirement of information disclosure, as the issuers can even negotiate the particular

way of information disclosure with the small number of select investors. This significantly alleviates the


                                                   12/65
concern of information leakage for those small-medium enterprises, especially for those start-ups in the

technology sector. After several years of rapid growth, the outstanding PPN has reached 2 trillion RMB

at the end of 2018, which is about 2.3% of the market.

Other Corporate Bonds

Other bond products include International Institution Bonds (国际机构债) and Railway Bonds. They are

about only 0.5% of the outstanding bond value in 2018.


2.3 Bond Market Liquidity

The last two columns in Table 2 gives the annual secondary market trading volume and the turnover

(trading volume over the average outstanding balance) of each bond during the year of 2018. Among all

the categories, financial bonds have the highest turnover of about 4; government bonds rank the second

with a turnover of 1.6, and corporate bonds with the lowest turnover (about 0.9).

Chinese government bonds are far less liquid compared to U.S. Treasuries; the latter is perhaps the most

liquid financial instrument in the world, with an annual turnover of about 10 in 2018. The lack of market

liquidity for Chinese government bonds is often blamed for its poor functioning in efficient price discovery,

potentially hurting the effective monetary policy conducted by the PBC.

Chinese corporate bonds are significantly less liquid than Chinese stocks, with an annual turnover of about

2.3 in 2018. 5 For a comprehensive study on the liquidity of Chinese corporate bonds and its evolution in

response to Beijing’s relentless interventions in the last decade, see Mo and Subrahmanyam (2019). That

lack of market liquidity of corporate bonds is a universal phenomenon that holds in other developed

financial markets like in U.S. and Europe, perhaps because natural corporate bond investors say insurance

companies typically keep their holdings until maturity. By calculating the widely used liquidity measures

 Chinese stock markets have a higher turnover rate than U.S. stock markets, as the investor base in Chinese stock market is
mostly retail-driven instead of institutional investors.

                                                           13/65
between the two bond markets in China and that in U.S. based on, Table 3 shows an overall similarity of

the corporate bond market liquidity across these two economies.

Given the unique two-market system in Chinse bond markets, it is interesting to compare the market

liquidity between the interbank and exchange markets. Figure 5, taken from Chen et al (2018), plots the

number of trades and RMB volumes of corporate bonds in these two markets, respectively. Compared to

the interbank market, there are way more trading activities in terms of number of trades in the exchange

market (90% in terms of number of trades, shown in Panel A), but the volume weighted by trading size is

miniscule (5% in terms of RMB volumes, shown in Panel B). This is consistent with Table 3, and reflects

the fact that retail investors speculate in the exchange market heavily, while in the interbank market

sophisticated financial institutions only trade whenever they need to. In summary, the interbank market is

deeper but lacks immediacy, relative to the exchange market.


2.4 Summary

Table 4 summarizes the comparison between the interbank and exchange markets, with a detailed list of

various bond products traded there. Though largely segmented, these two markets overlap in several key

bond products, mainly government bonds and enterprise bonds. Starting 2015, the exchange market

opened its access to enterprise bonds, which had been issued and traded only in the interbank market

before. Chen et al (2018) provides an analysis on the market segmentation of dual-listed enterprise bonds,

whose cross-market arbitrage is severely hindered by the transfer-of-depository which is a time-

consuming process. 6

  Suppose investors would like to sell their interbank holdings to the exchange market, perhaps for a better exchange price.
According to Chen et al (2018), investors need to apply for transfer of depository from the interbank market (the CCDC) to the
exchange (the CSDC), which takes about three to four working days in 2014. The other way around from exchange to interbank
will take a slightly longer process (about four to six working days in 2014). The transfer of depository becomes quicker in
recent years, but still takes about a few days.


                                                            14/65
The market segmentation is also reflected in the distinct regulators for these two bond markets. The

government agency who is overseeing the exchange market is CSRC, the powerful watchdog for Chinese

stock market. In contrast, the interbank market is overseen by the central bank PBC, who is the de-facto

gate-keeper of this market. Under the guidance of PBC, National Association of Financial Market

Institutional Investors (NAFMII, 银行间交易者协会) is a self-regulatory organization established in

October 2007 to formulate rules governing institutional participants in the interbank market. Regulatory

competition among different government agencies is a recurrent theme commonly seen during the

development of Chinese financial system. For reference, Table 5 provides a complete list of regulators

specialized to each detailed bond product. One notable regulator besides the above-mentioned two is the

NDRC. As mentioned, the NDRC is in charge of the issuance of enterprise bonds; recently, it has been

playing an increasing role in regulating and approving local government debts, including the municipal

bonds (issued by local governments directly) and municipal corporate bonds (issued by LGFVs).

The coexistence of OTC-based interbank market and exchange-based bond market is an important feature

that is unique to Chinese bond markets. For historical reasons, these two markets have been developed in

a relatively independent fashion. Despite the recent effort made by the NDRC to integrate these two

markets which gives rise to the dual-listed enterprise bonds (Chen et. al, 2018), we expect the coexistence

of these two bond markets to last for quite a long time in China.


3 A Brief History of Chinese Bond Markets

This section offers a brief account on how the bond market in China has been evolved to what it looks like

now. The thread that connects all the milestone events in Chinese bond market is the segmented market

system described in Section 2.1: the exchange market and the interbank market.




                                                   15/65
3.1 Physical Bond Counter Market

The development of Chinese bond markets in the modern era started from the resumption of the Treasury

bond issuance by Ministry of Finance in 1981. 7 Besides the government, a few enterprises as well as

financial institutions were also conducting debt financing from either their own employees or outside

investors. These non-bank-loan debt instruments became legal “enterprise bonds” after the release of

“Regulatory Guidelines of Enterprise Bonds” by the State Council in 1987. The secondary market for

bond trading followed, and in 1988, Ministry of Finance carried out a pilot project for Treasury bond

circulation and transfer in 61 cities. Through this program, individual investors can buy and sell Treasury

bonds at the bank counters as well as regional trading centers. Trading was done mostly in the form of

physical bonds, hence it was called a “physical bond counter market” (Sun, 2015).


3.2 The Exchange Market Era

Many deficiencies emerged during the early 1990’s for this physical bond counter market. Among them,

the most critical one is the lack of uniform bond custody system. Fake Treasury bonds were common, as

it was extremely difficult for decentralized custody systems to verify the authenticity of the physical paper

bonds.

The centralized exchange market, with electronic “book-entry” Treasury bonds, was considered to the

solution to this problem. Established in December 1991, the Shanghai Stock Exchange provided uniform

bond custody service across the country, and the government was explicit in supporting the development




7   Without market-based mechanism at play, allocations of Treasuries were based on apportionment via administrative channels

at that time.



                                                             16/65
of this exchange bond market. 8 In August 1995, the government officially announced that stock exchanges,

including both Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges, were the only legitimate bond market in China.

This greatly improved the liquidity and functioning of the secondary market on these two exchanges, and

an exchange-based bond market system has shaped by 1996.

It was not long before another dramatic turn that pushed the interbank market onto the stage. Keep in mind

that the two exchanges in China are developed mainly for equity financing and stock trading. During the

first half of 1997, the Chinese stock market experienced an unprecedented boom, witnessing Shanghai A-

share index rising from 1000 in early 1997 to above 1500 in May 1997. The secondary bond market

activities, which involve commercial banks and individual investors, contributed to this speculation-driven

stock market surge. Essentially, bond repo transactions in the exchange market allowed investors to use

bonds as collaterals to obtain debt financing from banks, which in turn was channeled toward the stock

market to fuel its rally.


3.3 The Rise of Interbank Market

Worrying about the large amount of bank funds that flowed into the overheated stock market, on June

1997 the PBC ordered all commercial banks to withdraw from exchanges and switch to the newly

established interbank market. The PBC also mandated that all commercial banks move their Treasury

bonds, central bank bills, and financial bonds issued by policy banks into the interbank market under the

custody of CCDC.




8   These initiatives include the pilot program of convertible bonds and the short-lived episode of Treasury futures trading on the exchange.

Shanghai Stock Exchange introduced the Treasury future contracts in December 1992, but terminated them in May 1995 after the infamous

scandal of “The event of 327 Treasury Future Contract.” The Treasury future market in the exchange was resumed in September 2013.



                                                                     17/65
This PBC-led event marked the beginning of the dramatic growth of interbank bond market. During the

next twenty years, the “wholesale” interbank market, standing in contrast to the more-or-less “retail”

exchange market, has become the dominating pillar of Chinese bond markets. The participants were

initially restricted to only 16 head offices of commercial banks in 1997; by the end of 2000, a total of 693

financial institutions, including insurance companies, urban and rural credit cooperatives, and security

firms, had become members of the interbank market.

In February 2014, facing the rapid rise of “shadow banking business,” the PBC allowed 16 large

commercial banks to invest their own WMPs in the interbank market. In May 2016, direct accesses to the

interbank market were further granted to all qualified institutional investors, including WMPs, investment

funds and trust companies. The total number of the interbank market members has reached 6,543 in

December 2018, and these financial institutions are covering almost the entire financial system in China

nowadays.


3.4 Bond Markets and the Growth of Chinese Economy

The rapid and steady development of the Chinese bond market offers great benefit for various economic

agents in Chinese economy. First, the interbank market has become the primary place for the Ministry of

Finance and government-backed entities like policy banks to issue bonds to finance their activities. Second,

it helps the central bank, the PBC, to implement its open market operations and other monetary policies.

For instance, in April 2003 the PBC conducted the first formal open market operation in the interbank

market, by issuing central bank bills valued at 5 billion RMB with a maturity of 6 month. We are coming

back to this topic in Section 4.1.

But perhaps an equally important role played by the Chinese bond market is to channel household savings

toward the real sector, which is critical for the Chinese economy to achieve its astonishing growth in the

last three decades. Various forms of debt instruments have been developed in both markets. In the

                                                    18/65
interbank market, commercial papers, a form of short-term high-quality enterprise bonds with a typical

maturity of below one year, emerged in May 2005; and medium-term notes with a typical maturity of five

years saw their debut in April 2008. On instruments besides enterprise bonds, the first Asset Backed

Securities were issued in the interbank market in December 2005; and the first Municipal bonds (by local

governments via Ministry of Finance) in April 2009. On the exchange market, listed companies first issued

exchange-traded corporate bonds in 2007, and in 2015 the CSRC expanded the eligible list of corporate

bond issuers to all incorporated companies (as opposed to only listed companies). All these reform

activities gave a great boost for the development of corporate bonds market in China.


4 Issues and Recent Trends of Chinese Bond Markets

In this section, we first point out that a full market mechanism is yet to be achieved by Chinese bond

markets. We then highlight the predominance of commercial banks in China’s bond markets; this also

explains why the Chinese bond markets are deeply intertwined with the shadow banking system in China.

We finally discuss the recent trend since late 2017 in authorities’ hardline stance in deleveraging and

restraining shadow banking activities, together with opening up Chinese onshore bond markets to

international investors.


4.1 Interest Rate Determination and Monetary Policy Transmission

The risk-free benchmark interest rates and the associated term structure, which are implied by the prices

of all government bonds with various maturities, “anchor” the pricing of all financial assets in modern

financial markets. Like in other modern financial markets such as U.S., interest rates of newly issued

Chinese government bonds are determined via competitive bidding of participating financial institutions

(mainly commercial banks and securities firms) in the primary market; they then can trade among each




                                                  19/65
other in the secondary market. Today, it is fair to say that market mechanisms are at work in Chinese bond

markets after more than two decades of successful and continuous development.

Figure 6 plots the yields for Treasury bonds and CDB bonds for 1 and 10 year maturities, respectively.

These four series of interest rates are moving mostly in parallel and varying between 1.5% and 6% since

2012, with slightly lower yields for Treasury bonds (than CDB bonds) due to their tax advantage. Overall,

in the past half decade, the term structure of interest rates in China is upward-sloping, and the steadily

falling interest rates over the period of 2013-2016 made this episode the “bull” market for Chinese bond

traders.

Despite the rapid growth in the size of the bond market, it is well-recognized among policy makers and

practitioners that Chinese bond markets are still underdeveloped in many key dimensions. Compared to

the deep and liquid market for U.S. Treasuries, the market for Chinese government bonds still lacks

sufficient liquidity, and is often blamed for its poor functioning in efficient price discovery. The latter role

of price discovery is key to the effective monetary policy conducted by the PBC in stabilizing the Chinese

economy.

There are several institutional reasons for the steady but somewhat slow development of the Chinese

government bonds market toward a full market mechanism. A well-functioning primary and secondary

market for risk-free rate determination is an integral part of interest rate liberalization, which started in the

late 1980s and saw its formal completion when the PBC finally lifted the banks’ deposit rate cap and rolled

out the deposit insurance scheme in 2015. Second, the “12th five-year plan” in 2011 has made it clear that

future monetary policies should put more emphasis on market-driven price-targeted tools (e.g., repos with

the PBC, and Standing Lending Facilities), although quantity-targeted tools (e.g., M2 growth or total bank

credit) and “guidance rates” frequently published by the PBC remain until today the most effective

measures taken by Chinese monetary authorities. Third, from a market design perspective, an entry barrier



                                                      20/65
exists for the primary market, which limits participation in the auctioning of government bonds to qualified

financial institutions. Most of market-makers, who serve the secondary market in the interbank market,

are commercial banks with unpleasantly high degree of homogeneity in trading strategies and funding

sources. Finally, the above-mentioned segmentation between the interbank and exchange markets, with

potential violation of the “law of one price,” hurts price discovery and liquidity of Chinese government

bond market.


4.2 The Role of Banks and Shadow Banking

Another distinct feature that seems to be inconsistent with the fast development of Chinese bond market

is that the participants remain highly concentrated in one particular type of financial institutions:

commercial banks. As explained in Section 3.3, the Chinese interbank bond market has been closely

intertwined with the banking system ever since the establishment of the bond market in 1997, when

commercial banks were mandated by the PBC to be the first participants of bond issuance and trading.

It is crucial to recognize that the official statistics significantly underestimates the dominance of

commercial banks in Chinese bond market. It is well-known among practitioners and regulators that in

China, commercial banks participate in the bond market via two channels: the direct on-balance-sheet

channel, through which the bank’s so-called financial market division buys and sells bonds (and engage

in even arbitrage trades) in the interbank market; and the indirect off-balance-sheet channel, where the

bank’s asset management division sets up some wealth management plans (just like Special Purpose

Vehicle in the U.S. market) financed by WMPs and invest in both interbank and exchange markets. The

dominating share of commercial banks (57%) of the interbank bond market in Figure 2 only counts the

first channel.

This perspective suggests that in China’s financial system, corporate bonds, to a significant extent, can be

considered another form of disguised bank financing. Facilitated by the growingly sophisticated shadow-

                                                    21/65
banking activities, the transfer of on-balance-sheet loans (inside the traditional banking system) to off-

balance-sheet assets outside (say corporate bonds) is commonly observed, especially when banks were

facing tightened regulation on the overheated real estate sector and LGFV financing. This is why

practitioners often argue that, different from other developed countries, in China the shadow banking is

literally just the “shadow” of commercial banks.

Let us take the example of WMPs, which are the biggest component of shadow banking in China and the

most important vehicle to connect back to the banking system. Starting 2014, China Banking Wealth

Management Registration System releases its annual report on WMPs, which gives an official account on

the role played by WMPs in today’s Chinese financial system. According to these reports, a majority of

WMP is invested in the bond market, with the percentage to be 44% in 2016 and 42% in 2017.

In fact, many industry reports corroborate this view. Ehlers et al (2018) estimate that 38% of the net

issuance of all bonds is funded via bank-issued WMPs in 2014; the funding percentages are 35% and 31%

in 2015 and 2016, respectively. In a more recent study, Lei et al (2018) find that 7 trillion out of 18 trillion

outstanding corporate bonds’ balance is funded by WMPs; and as explained in footnote 8, these numbers

are likely to be biased downward. Overall, evidence suggests that bond market is an integrated part of the

bank-dominated shadow banking in China.

Chen, He, Liu (2018) argue that the China’s the shadow banking problem is connected to the local

government debt problem, which is further rooted in the four-trillion stimulus rolled out in 2009. They

document that three to five years after the 2009 stimulus plan, LGFVs need to refinance their maturing

bank loans and/or fund the ongoing infrastructure projects. However, soon after mid-2010, indebted

LGFVs were squeezed by tightening credit standards from traditional banks. As a result, these LGFVs

then started issuing Municipal Corporate Bonds (MCBs, as explained in Section 3.3) in the interbank




                                                      22/65
market. The majority of these MCBs was bought by WMPs, which was sold and implicitly guaranteed by

commercial banks. 9

There is another important channel through which commercial banks facilitate industrial firms to issue

bonds in the interbank market and hence are exposed to default risk. In China, commercial banks often

engage in guarantee provisions on corporate bonds, though it is hard to estimate the severity of this risk

exposure.

To illustrate this point, consider the interesting case on the scandal of Cosun bonds (侨兴债事件), which

involves financial innovations, shadow banking, and (some malfunctioning of) the commercial banking

system. In December 2016, the Cosun Group, a privately-owned Telecommunication company in

Guangdong, defaulted on a series of its privately placement notes issued two years ago. 10 Shocked by the

default news, retail investors went to Zheshang Insurance, the insurance company which provided

insurance on this credit event. But Zheshang Insurance immediately made a public announcement stating




9   Chen, He, Liu (2018) find that about 60% of MCBs are invested by WMPs by the end of 2016. This 60% number is likely to

represent an underestimation of the extent to which MCBs are relying on WMPs with the ultimate endorsement of banks.

Before the 2017 regulation tightening on China’s shadow banking activities, it was popular for managers of WMPs to invest

in asset management plans (or several layers of asset management plans, like CDO square in the U.S. market before the 2007/08

financial crisis), which then eventually invest in MCBs. The official statistics ignores this indirect exposure of WMPs in MCB

(hence introducing a downward bias of our estimate). According to practitioners in this market, the rough estimate of the true

exposure is that about 70% of MCBs were invested by WMPs around 2016.


10   These notes were placed in a local-government owned (Guangdong) exchange market) but sold through some peer-to-peer

platform to retail investors, with the help of financial innovation. Recall that PPNs are only allowed to be invested by a select

group of sophisticated institutional investors. However, it turns out that many retail investors are buying pieces of PPNs issued

by Cosun Group, thanks to the financial innovation by some peer-to-peer lending platform.



                                                              23/65
that China Guangfa Bank, one of the earliest-incorporated joint-stock commercial banks, had promised

some guarantee provision to repay Zheshang Insurance at the bond issuance but reneged on its promise.

It turned out the Huizhou Branch of China Guangfa Bank provided a “counterfeit” letter of guarantee for

this bond issuance; 11 this guarantee helped Cosun to issue these bonds, only to rollover Cosun’s maturing

loans extended by the Huizhou Branch itself several years ago.


4.3 Regulatory Tightening Starting 2017

The Chinese government is well aware of these “shadow of bank” activities that essentially tie the

commercial banking sector to the financial products offered in the interbank market. The dramatic

regulatory change started in 2017 is expected to reshape the Chinese financial market in a profound way,

bringing a sea change in the interbank market. Under this new framework, WMPs will be put under the

scrutiny of the PBC for the first time and into its calculations on prudence, capital adequacy and loan

growth guidelines. Another equally important regulatory tightening is on the rules of new asset

management plans, first proposed in Nov 2017 and released in April 2018 (though still yet to be finalized).

The new rules aim to prohibit implicit guarantee and multi-layer structure, the two important ingredients

that had contributed to excessively high leverage in China’s shadow banking system in the past decade.

Not surprisingly, in response to policy tightening, the Chinese bond market experienced a dramatic

downward adjustment in 2017. The annual increment of the value of outstanding bonds, adding together

the interbank and exchange markets, experienced about a 35% of drop going down from 16 trillion RMB




11   After the credit event, Zheshang Insurance released documents carrying Guangfa Bank’s official seals, showing that the bank’s Huizhou

branch had promised the guarantee. However, the headquarter of Guangfa Bank claimed that the guarantee documents presented by Zheshang

Insurance, together with official seals and personal seals, were “all fake.” For details, see https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-china-banks-

fraud/china-imposes-record-fine-on-guangfa-bank-over-guarantees-for-defaulted-bonds-idUKKBN1E21KU.



                                                                    24/65
in 2016 to 10 trillion RMB in 2017 and 2018. We will come back to this topic in Section 6.2 together with

the recent insurgence of corporate default in Chinese bond market.

Looking forward, we believe that Beijing’s recent effort in streamlining and tightening regulations in the

ever-complicated Chinese financial market is well justified. Though it is inevitable to bring pain to market

participants in the short-run, a transparent regulatory environment is tremendously important to build a

healthy and sophisticated bond market in a modern financial system where market participants understand

fully the consequences of their own decisions, including issuance, underwriting, trading, and investment.


4.4 Internalization of Chinese Bond Market

Despite the fact that the Chinese bond market has developed to be third largest in the world, the foreign

participation is miniscule. At the end of 2018, the total foreign holdings of the Chinese bonds reached 2.6
                                                                                   12
trillion RMB, or around 3.1% of the bond market capitalization.

Historically, to gain access to Chinese bond market, offshore investors were required to go through some

quota-based foreign investment programs. One of them is the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor

(QFII, 合 格 境 外 机 构 投 资 者 ) program, which was launched in 2002 and regulated by State

Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE, 国家外汇管理局, a powerful arm of PBC) which monitors

the remittance and repatriation of funds across the border. Initially QFIIs could only invest in the exchange

bond market; since March 2013 they are allowed to get access to the much bigger interbank market.

Another closed related program is the Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII, 人民币

合格境外机构投资者) program. This program allows domestic financial institutions to establish RMB




12   On the other way around, many Chinese firms have actively sought oversea funding sources by issuing foreign-currency denominated

bonds (Huang, Panizza, and Portes, 2018).



                                                                 25/65
denominated funds in Hong Kong, attracting offshore RMB in the hands of oversea investors back to the

onshore bond market. At the end of 2018Q3, the total quota combining QFII and RQFII was about 1.34

trillion RMB, though the actual usage was just 0.3 trillion RMB (within which about 10% was invested in

bonds while the rest was in equities). 13

As a milestone effort in the effort of internalization of RMB, Beijing launched the PBC bond direct-access

program in 2010. Based on a case-by-case approval system, this program attracted offshore institutional

investors (e.g., foreign central banks and offshore RMB clearing banks) to the Chinese interbank bond

market. In July 2015, the PBC further eased the regulation by allowing institutions with long-term

investment mandates--such as foreign central banks and sovereign wealth funds--to participate in the

interbank market without quota limits. More importantly, these qualified institutions can follow a

registration system, rather than a pre-approval system, to participate in the interbank market. In February

2016, similar accesses were granted to a much wider range of institutional investors, including commercial

lenders, insurance companies, securities firms and asset managers (excluding short-term or “speculative”

investors). One year later in February 2017, the SAFE was giving overseas investors access to its foreign-

exchange derivatives market to allow hedging of bond positions, a crucial step in attracting foreign inflows.

On an almost independent effort, motivated by the success of Stock Connect started in November 2014,

China launched its Bond Connect (债券通) on July 2017. Like Stock Connect, Bond Connect is a mutual

market access scheme that allows investors from mainland China and overseas to trade in each other's

bond markets, through connection between the related mainland and Hong Kong financial infrastructure

institutions. Thanks to Hong Kong being the leading world-class financial center, foreign investors offer




13   Unfortunately, we only have data for stock investments in QFII. We hence estimate the total investment of QFII and RQFII using 90%

invested in stock and 10% in bond and assuming the same investment structure for RQFII.



                                                                  26/65
a warm welcome to Bond Connect: The rise of foreign ownership of mainland bonds in July and August

in 2017 almost doubled the pace of the prior year.

No doubt, the sophistication and development of mainland bond markets are crucial for advancing RMB

internalization, one of the policy goals that has received top priority for Chinese government. Looking

forward, given Beijing’s strong intention to push forward the liberalization of the mainland bond market,

we expect a more and more relaxed regulatory environment for foreign investors to participate. Like-wise,

oversea investors are flocking to China’s mainland bond market for its strong value and potentially

tremendous opportunity. This process is likely to be expedited by the decision of Bloomberg, which

announced that, starting April 2019, it will add over 300 China’s government bonds into the Bloomberg

Barclay’s Global Aggregate Bond index. Of course, this progress might be interrupted by the concerns of

capital flight in the wake of potential significant slowdown of Chinese economy.


5 Bond Ratings and Rating Agencies

A key characteristic of bonds is their credit risk as reflected in ratings. Rating agencies are vital in any

financial market. While rating symbols used in China closely follow global standards, the rating scale

differs. China has currently de-facto only three rating categories. This section illustrates and discusses the

skewed rating distribution. Reasons for this observation include low default rates, ongoing trend of more

upgrades than downgrades, implicit guarantees, regulatory requirements and a fierce competition among

the domestic rating agencies, which differ little in their ratings assessments. The previous section

introduced three different bond types. As ratings for government bonds are always AAA rated, this section

focuses on “credit bonds” including financial and corporate bonds. 14




14   “Non-financial credit bonds” and “corporate bonds” are used as synonyms in this section.



                                                                     27/65
5.1 China’s Credit Rating Scale

China’s domestic rating scale includes nine long term grades (AAA, AA, A, BBB, BB, B, CCC, CC, C)

and six short term grades (A-1, A-2, A-3, B, C, D) as officially set by the PBC. This is in line with

international standards as set by the globally dominating three U.S. based rating agencies Moody’s,

Standard & Poor’s and Fitch. However, there are two main differences in the rating scale used by Chinese

versus global rating agencies. First, the definition of investment grade differs. In China AA is generally

seen as the lowest investment-grade level while this is BBB in global ratings. Despite the higher threshold,

the issuance of non-investment grade bonds is much scarcer in China. Second, China’s domestic rating

scale knows an additional, informal rating grade: the AAA+” or “super AAA” category provided by

investors. These AAA+ issuers keep an official and legally relevant rating of AAA provided by rating

agencies. However, the AAA+ issuers enjoy a higher weighting in valuation indices, reflecting lower

default probability assigned by investors who expect these corporates to essentially have a credit risk

similar to government bonds. By 2018, there are 10 central-government owned issuers in this category

(Table 6).


5.2 Distribution of Credit Ratings

The distribution of the Chinese ratings is well-known to be skewed to the upside (Kennedy 2008, Poon

2007, Standard Chartered 2017). Despite the large market size (about 2,000 corporate issuers) on global

standards, over 95% of the outstanding amount of non-financial credit bonds are covered in only three

rating categories (Figure 7 Panel A). By the end of 2018, 54% of the corporate bond outstanding in China

enjoys an AAA rating, versus about 6% in the U.S. corporate bond market. 23% is AA+, another 19% is

AA rated and only 2% are rated as AA- and below and therefore as non-investment grade. 1% of the

outstanding amount of corporate bonds are not rated. For financial bonds, the shares are AAA 82%, AA+

13%, AA 4% and AA- or lower 1% of the outstanding amount of corporate bonds respectively, reflecting

                                                    28/65
the explicit government guarantees. The high share of AAA rated corporate bonds in value terms is partly

explained by large amounts of bond issuance of just a few issuers who are mostly linked to government.

Of the top 10 issuers (Table 7), only one is privately owned, which is a real estate corporate, while the

others are all central SOEs. However, clustering in only three categories also holds in terms of the number

of issuers. Of the Chinese corporate issuers, 14% hold an AAA rating, 19% an AA+ rating and 41% an

AA. About 8% of corporate bonds are private placement, where credit ratings are not mandatory. Only

18% hold a non-investment grade rating of AA- and below (Figure 7 Panel B). Consequently, China

currently has essentially no high yield or speculative grade bond market.

The tilted distribution is controversially discussed. On one hand, the low credit risk differentiation is

generally seen as a hindrance to the development of the bond market. For domestic investors, the absence

of a more granular credit risk opportunities and the lack of a speculative, high yield market might lower

the attractiveness of the bond market particularly relative to the stock market. For international investors,

the low guidance offered by the current rating distribution is often given as one reason why they currently

take up only a small part of the investor base in the Chinese bond market, despite a steady loosening of

investment restrictions (Section 4.4). On the other hand, implicit guarantees entailed in the credit

assessments of a good part of corporate issuers with links to government may partly justify a higher

rating. 15


5.3 Low Default Rate, Implicit Guarantees and Rating Migration

Low default rate




15   This is similar to the case of “stand alone” versus “support” ratings assigned to some international banks, which enjoy a lower default risk

and higher all-in rating due to government support schemes.



                                                                       29/65
A main reason for the high credit ratings is the very short and limited history of defaults in China. The

first onshore public bond default occurred only in 2014. The defaulted amount in the Chinese bond market

amounted to only 1.26 billion RMB in 2014, reached a first peak at 30.1 billion RMB in 2016, before

falling to 27.7 billion RMB in 2017. The amount of defaults jumped to a new high of 128 billion RMB in

2018 (Figure 8 Panel A in Section 6.1). This surge in corporate defaults was triggered by challenging

refinancing conditions and increasing redemptions (mentioned in Section 4.3) due to tightened regulation

starting end of 2017. However, since the first default in 2014 until the end of 2018, the defaults

represented only 0.2% of the overall outstanding amount, suggesting a rather small default probability

relative to the global counterpart. See more details on corporate bond defaults in Section 6.

Rating migration

As the number and amount of defaults start to increase, though at quite low levels, one would expect that

this trend slowly but steadily softens the skewness of the rating distribution. However, the opposite was

so far the case. Since the first default in 2014 until 2018, there were about ten times more upgrades than

downgrades (Table 8). Of the 2,784 bond issuers 918 received rating upgrades, only 129 were downgraded

and the vast majority of 1737 remained the same rating level over the past four years until end of 2018.

The biggest rating migration occurred for the AA- rated bonds where over 49% were upgraded and only

6% downgraded. Of the large share of AAA rated bonds only 2% were downgraded. The mismatch

between increased defaults and ongoing trend of an upward bias in rating changes lets many commentators

doubt whether the upgrades are backed by improvement in credit fundamentals. Alternatively, they

suggest that this phenomenon is related to the fierce competition among the many Chinese rating agencies

which we cover in Section 5.5.

Rating migrations are also discussed in the context of their timing, which is sometimes seen as too late or

too hesitant, despite signs of weakening cash flow and earnings. As illustrated by the examples given in



                                                   30/65
Section 6, rating changes in cases of bonds that later eventually default occur often alongside

announcements and media reports of financial distress. This somewhat limits the use of ratings as an early

warning system for investors.

Implicit guarantees

The low default rate and rating migration is often related to implicit guarantees. While it is difficult to

quantify the amount of defaults that are prevented by government support, in some cases ratings are

obviously adjusted due to expected, even though not legally binding, moral commitment of the Chinese

government. As an example we refer to the bonds issued by the four asset management companies (AMCs,

资产管理公司) that were established to purchase overall 2.4 trillion RMB non-performing loans from

commercial banks during early 2000’s. The rating agencies considered the AMC bonds not as speculative

but as part of the highly rated Chinese sovereign debt, expecting the Ministry of Finance to step in in case

of default. Although implicit guarantees are not a unique Chinese feature as the case of Fannie Mae and

Freddie Mac in the U.S. illustrates, the degree of implicit guarantees is likely more severe in China due to

more widespread or closer links of corporates to the government.


5.4 Regulatory Framework

The regulatory framework is another important factor that supports the clustering in only the three highest

rating classes.

Rating requirements

For corporate bonds to be qualified for public issuance, minimum ratings are mandatory, but in most cases

only one rating is required. This makes it often the main motivation for issuers to buy a rating and invites

rating-shopping. The specific regulatory requirements vary with the bond type and are set by the respective

regulator. For instance, in the interbank market, NAFMII asks for commercial papers and medium-term




                                                    31/65
notes issuers to be rated AA- or above. 16 For exchange-traded corporate bonds that are issued to retail and

qualified investors, they generally need an AAA rating, except for issuers in the property sector where a

rating of AA or above is sufficient. However, the CSRC removed the rating requirements for corporate

bonds that are issued only to qualified investors. Also, the NDRC has its own rating requirement for

enterprise bonds. Guarantees are only required for LGFVs with debt-to assets ratios of 65% or above. No

guarantee is needed in the case of an AAA rated issuer of an enterprise bond with ratios below 85% and

AA+ rated enterprise bond issuer with ratios below 80%.

Repo eligibility and haircuts

The possibility to use a bond as collateral in a repo transaction, which is essentially a collateralized

borrowing, is an additional value to bondholders. The greater the haircuts are, the lower the ability of

collateralized borrowing is. Bond issuers may therefore be hesitant to issue bonds which lack this property.

The repo eligibility of corporate bonds is limited as they are generally only accepted by non-bank financial

institutions while banks accept only government bonds. Further, money market funds as key players in

the liquidity provision are allowed to accept only bonds rated AA+ or higher as repo collateral.

The repo eligibility on the exchange market is even more restricted, due to its centralized nature. In this

market, investors conduct repo transactions against the CSDC who serves as the Centralized Counter-

Party (CCP, 中央对手方) and sets bond-specific haircuts. Chen et al (2018) document that haircuts are

almost entirely determined by bond ratings, and explore the Dec 2014 policy shock when the CSDC

suspended the repo eligibility for enterprise bonds with ratings below AAA. Later in 2017, the CSDC

tightened the required minimum rating from AA to AAA for exchange-traded corporate bonds.




16   For super commercial papers, two ratings from different agencies are mandatory with one at AA or above.



                                                                    32/65
Overall, the regulatory framework offers clear incentives to issue ratings only in the very high rated

categories. It seems unlikely for bond issuances to receive a broader range of credit categories without at

least some further loosening of the regulatory restrictions in that respect.


5.5 Rating Agencies

The specific structure of rating agency industry in China is a further reason for the upward-skewed ratings

in China. After a brief historical review, we discuss the increasing diversification by nationality, the

incentive model of rating agencies and possible impacts on the rating distribution.

A brief historical review and licensing

An early form of rating agencies were already established in 1987 when the State Council issued the

“Regulatory Guidelines of Enterprise Bonds”, which introduced ratings in their guidance of bond issuance.

At first ratings were offered by credit rating departments in provincial branches of the PBC. Later a series

of independent rating agencies took up business, in some cases as a spin-off of the previous rating

departments. The PBC regulations on the types of bonds and loans requiring a rating became mandatory

from 1993 onward, further fueling the offering of rating services. To assure quality and consistency in the

rating agency industry, the PBC demanded since 1997 that corporate bonds must have at least one rating

from a PBC-approved agency and limited the number of qualified rating agencies to nine. In 2006 the

CSRC followed with a formalized licensing process for credit rating agencies covering bonds regulated

by the CSRC. Today, each of the three regulators covering corporate bonds (NAFMII, NDRC, CSRC)

issues separate lists of qualified agencies for rating bonds under their respective program. Consequently,

a rating agency usually needs to get approval by more than one regulator depending on which types of




                                                     33/65
bonds they are providing rating services for (Table 9). 17 Recognizing the fragmented accreditation process

for rating agencies, the State Council started in 2014 to issue notes that deregulate at least partially and to

simplify the accreditation of domestic agencies.

Nine approved rating agencies

The international rating agency industry is famously dominated by three U.S.-based agencies Moody’s,

Standard &Poor’s and Fitch. About 95% of all globally outstanding ratings are currently provided by these

so-called Big3. 18 China has a relatively large number with nine recognized domestic credit rating agencies

(Table 9 provides an overview on market share and accreditation). However, six agencies (or four counting

the sub-institutes as one) dominate with a market share of 91% of the outstanding bond issuance in China:

Chengxin (Chengxin Securities Rating and Chengxin International Rating), Lianhe (China United Rating

and China Lianhe Rating) and Dagong Global Credit Rating. Both Chengxin and Lianhe have a domestic

agency licensed by the CSRC to offer ratings in the exchange market, and a separate joint venture licensed

by the PBC with a minority ownership of an international rating agency to offer ratings in the interbank

market. The fully domestically owned Chengxin Securities Rating, China United Rating and Dagong were

founded in 1992, 2002 and 1994, respectively. Chengxin International Rating was established in 2006 and

49% of its shares are owned by Moody’s while Lianhe Rating was established in 2007 and 49% of its

shares are by Fitch ratings. S&P has a partnership with Shanghai Brilliance Investor Service since 2008.

It is worth emphasizing that all the joint-ventured rating agencies mentioned above are operating




17   Further, China Insurance Regulatory Commission, the regulator of the insurance sector (which was merged with China Banking Regulatory

Commission in early 2018), once issued a list of recognized agencies for fixed income investments of domestic insurance companies.


18   The global agencies made earlier attempts to enter the Chinese rating industry but at the time decided to disinvest. Fitch had a joint venture

with Chengxin from 1999 to 2003 and Moody’s a cooperative agreement with Dagong from 1999 to 2002 (Lee, 2006; Moody’s, 1999).



                                                                        34/65
completely separately from the corresponding international global rating agency, who takes no active role

in the joint ventures.

All this time, the global rating agencies could have only minority stakes in joint-venture operations.

Further, they were not accredited to issue “national ratings”, ratings of Chinese firms issuing bonds

onshore. Instead, the global agencies assign “international ratings” for Chinese firms issuing bonds

offshore. In July 2017, the PBC announced liberalization steps on both accounts. Global rating agencies

will be allowed to register for rating services in the China interbank bond market and to own a majority

stake in an accredited agency, provided that the agency meets some criteria in terms of market experience

and corporate governance.

Aside from the five major agencies mentioned above, there are four domestically-owned accredited

agencies with a relatively small market share. Shanghai-based Shanghai Brilliance was founded in 1992,

Pengyuan Credit Rating based in Shenzhen in 1993, Golden Credit Rating International based in Beijing

in 2005 (often labeled as “Orient” in the market), and China Bond Rating Corporation in 2010. China

Bond Rating Corporation is the only agency operating under an investor-pays model, a topic that is

covered in the next section.

Little differentiation of rating agencies

While in the early days of rating agencies in China standardized procedure was missing, the rating industry

is seen as too homogenous today. Rating methodologies, including the specific factors and weights that

are used to determine default probabilities, may only differ slightly. Also, rating decisions across domestic

agencies offer little variation and are also similar in timing. None of the domestic agency has gained a

clear advantage in reputation or market leadership. Consequently, the rating industry in China is highly

competitive with similar fee structures. For agencies, the incentive to pro-actively downgrade an issuer is

low. The problem worsens as bond issuers often aim for just one rating in order to fulfill regulatory



                                                    35/65
requirements. This is obviously only the case under the issuer pays model, which is the international

standard and the model for eight of the nine officially approved Chinese agencies. Recognizing the

challenging incentive structure, in 2010 the NAFMII installed an agency China Bond Rating Corporation

(CBR, 中债资信) that operates under the investor pays model. On average, CBR offers a stricter rating

scale, with two to three notches below the issuer pays model.

There is little difference in rating assignments between the joint ventures and fully domestically owned

agencies. It remains to be seen to which extent the recently allowed entrance of foreign rating agencies

will change the upside bias in ratings. Comparing ratings from domestic versus global agencies, Jiang and

Packer (2017) find the latter to be six to seven notches lower on average. Furthermore, they find

differences in underlying drivers. Domestic agencies weigh size more positively in the risk assessment,

while global agencies weigh profitability and state-ownership more positively and leverage more

negatively. These findings can only serve as an indication since currently the sample of bonds rated by

both domestic and global agencies is limited. Moreover, as long as a single domestic rating fulfills the

regulatory requirements, the appetite of domestic issuers to buy an additional global rating remains unclear.

This status quo might change however, once Chinese issuers see value in broadening their investor base

and tapping the large but yet still underutilized pool of foreign investors, particularly institutional investors.


5.6 Outlook

The large and increasing Chinese bond market contrasts with the low diversification in credit risk as

measured by ratings. We have mentioned a series of contributing factors. Therefore, a change might not

be imminent for the ratings provided by the approved agencies we covered here, though shortcoming of

the current narrow and upward skewed rating distribution is obvious. Consequently, there is a strong

appetite for alternative rating procedures, especially due to the rising interest from oversea investors. A

straightforward approach already used by some market participants is to complement the third-party rating

                                                      36/65
agencies with market-implied credit ratings, which is determined by comparing the bond’s secondary

market value against valuation indices. Along these lines, in October 2017, CCDC announced a plan to

offer market-based ratings using available information through their oligopolistic custodian and clearing

services. We can expect more market-driven initiatives of this kind.


6 Credit Spreads and Defaults in Chinese Bond Market

Ever since early 2014, China has witnessed a wave of credit events, which quickly peaked in 2016 mainly

driven by the tightened liquidity and deepening financial deleveraging campaign. Despite the relatively

tiny amount of defaulted bonds compared with the entire market, the jitters aroused by the default shocks

have expanded far beyond the bond market, even to the entire Chinese financial system and the macro

economy. Investors’ priors of “implicit government guarantee” was gradually broken; financial

institutions ceased taking it for granted that corporate bonds are absolutely safe and began to put more and

more emphasis on the credit risks underneath the firms.


6.1 Bond Defaults in China: A Summary

The unprecedented bond default event of “11 Chaori Bond” on March 5th, 2014 marked the elimination

of implicit government guarantee, opening a new era of Chinese bond market. The issuer, “Shanghai

Chaori Technologies Inc.” failed to pay its interests in full in the exchange market, constituting the first-

ever default in Chinse bond markets. We will review several landmark default cases in Chinese bond

market in Section 6.3, together with a discussion of recent progress in bankruptcy rulings in China.

Up till December 31, 2018, there have been 263 defaulted bonds, involving 111 issuers in total. Figure 8

Panel B plots the distribution of these default events since 2014, as a fraction of the entire corporate bonds

market in China, based on Wind database. A total of 94 private firms have defaulted, taking up a larger

percentage of the issuers sunk in defaults. For state-owned firms, there are 11 defaulting SOEs owned by


                                                     37/65
local governments, while only 6 are central SOEs. Industry-wise, before 2017, defaults were concentered

in those over-capacity “old economy” sectors like coal, steel, and commodity-related industries; but in

2018, the fraction of the “new economy” defaulting firms rises. Finally, the percentage of total amount of

defaulted bonds remains quite low, standing at 0.6% in its peak year of 2018. In contrast, the global

counterpart during 2008-2017 is 1.8% according to a recent report by Moody’s. 19


6.2 Defaults, Bond Ratings, and Credit Spreads

Credit ratings should reflect the bonds’ default probabilities. Before 2014, ratings were not that indicative

in China, due to the widely perceived “implicit government guarantee” among bond investors. The spring-

up of bond defaults in recent years brings investors’ attention back to ratings. Figure 9 plots the credit

spreads of enterprise bonds, which is defined as the bond yield minus the matched CDB yield, across all

ratings classes since 2013. The credit spreads of lower-rated enterprise bonds (A and BBB+) experienced

a clear upward trend since early 2014, dipped a bit in 2017, but soared again in early 2018.

Typically, both bond-level and issuer-level ratings are downgraded before the default event, following

negative public announcements by firms. This partly explains the dispersion of credit spreads across

ratings in Figure 9. For example, before the default of “16 Katie Bond” on June 1, 2018, the bond rating

status was adjusted to “Negative” on September 1, 2017, and the issuer, Sunshine Katie Co., Ltd., was

downgraded by Pengyuan (one of the rating agencies) to “BBB” and put in the “credit risk” watch list on

May 8, 2018.

The evolution of the credit spreads and their dispersions in Figure 9 reflect not only the perceived default

probabilities across various rating classes, but also the credit conditions of the bond market as a whole.




19 This estimation is derived from “Annual Default Study: Corporate Default and Recovery Rates, 1920 – 2017” by Moody’s, which covers

the credit histories of more than 25,000 corporate issuers that had long-term rated bonds between 1920 and 2017.

                                                                38/65
The burst of bond defaults in Chinese bond market, the continuing tightening credit and policy

environment in combination with investors’ jitters contribute to the spiking credit bonds spreads.

The ever-growing default incidents in recent years have ignited investors’ concerns about credit risks,

though in our perspective, these temporary market disruptions are inevitable pains that China has to go

through towards a more market-oriented financial market. For instance, Credit Risk Mitigation Agreement

(CRMA) and Credit Risk Mitigation Warrant (CRMW), which are essentially Credit Default Swaps (CDS)

derivative products and initially introduced in 2010, gained their popularity following the recent wave of

corporate defaults. What is more, tightened regulations by Beijing starting late 2017 on Wealth

Management Plans, together with the government-led deleveraging campaign, further curbed the inflow

of funds towards corporate bonds, especially those lower-rated ones on the edge of defaulting. This

worsens their default probability and, in turn, making institutional investors even more cautious in

purchasing the bonds newly issued by these firms. This type of negative rollover spiral due to market

liquidity dry-up is responsible for the explosion of bond defaults in early 2018. 20


6.3 Bond Default Cases, Bankruptcy, and Post-default Recovery 21

This section discusses several recent prominent bond default cases in China. These cases also illustrate

the underdeveloped legal environment in China, and the uncertain bankruptcy litigation procedures faced

by bond investors when seeking recovery of their defaulted bonds.




20   The defaulted companies in 2018 are having much stronger balance sheets than those defaulted in 2016-17, in terms of simple financial

ratios like book leverage and interest coverage cited from some industry report by China International Trust Investment Corporation (CITIC)

Securities.


21   We thank Andrew Levin’s contribution to this section, which is heavily drawn from his term paper for the MBA class “Chinese Economy

and Financial Market” in Chicago Booth taught by Zhiguo He in the winter quarter of 2018.



                                                                    39/65
Before delving into these detailed default cases, we provide a bit background on China’s bankruptcy laws.

A well-functioning bankruptcy law, including restructuring and reorganization, is important to business

owners and investors. There are three types of bankruptcy proceedings: liquidation, settlement, and

reorganization. China introduced the Enterprise Bankruptcy Law in 1986, though it is the 2006 reform

that led China on a path towards convergence with international practice, with the inclusion of

reorganization proceedings that are similar in nature to Western bankruptcies and restructurings.

Despite these positive changes, many concerns about implementation of the bankruptcy code remain

nowadays due to lack of legal infrastructure, a disparate court system, and potentially ongoing moral

hazard issues particularly related to SOEs. Besides, key differences remain between China and U.S./U.K.

bankruptcy proceedings including a lack of Debt-in-Possession financing in China and the inability of

creditors to propose a plan of reorganization.

Shanghai Chaori Solar (上海超日)

On March 4, 2014, Shanghai Chaori Solar, a privately-held solar equipment producer, announced that it

would not meet interest payments on its 1 billion RMB bond issued in the exchange market. This was the

first case of a publicly issued bond default in China. Despite the small bond size, this event was still a big

deal to market participants because until that point it seemed as though the government would support

struggling companies to keep defaults from occurring.

What happened in the end? In October 2014, a number of state-owned entities, mostly asset management

companies (including China Great Wall Asset Management), worked together to provide loans and

guarantees to Shanghai Chaori Solar. Under this help, Shanghai Chaori Solar fully repaid its past due

principal and interest. This led analysts to say that this action was “good for investors but bad for credit

pricing,” as many practitioners argue that real credit defaults in China would reduce the guise of moral

hazard in the economy and therefore lead the country to develop a healthier credit market.


                                                     40/65
Baoding Tianwei (保定天威)

On April 21, 2015, Baoding Tianwei missed an interest payment on its 1.5 billion medium-term note.

While this was the third onshore default in 13 months, the Baoding Tianwei default was meaningful in

that it was the first for a 100% state-owned enterprise. Baoding Tianwei had been established in 1995 as

a unit of China South Industries Group, a military and defense company wholly owned by State-owned

Assets Supervision and Administrative Commission (SASAC, 国资委). As such, the default of Baoding

on 1.5 billion RMB of bonds (and later up to 4.5 billion RMB) was a meaningful shift in the government’s

stance towards SOEs. With over 90% of corporate bonds outstanding issued by SOEs, this was an

important event in China’s history. While the company’s issues have yet to be resolved, it has since

defaulted on additional debt outstanding and formally filed for bankruptcy. Jin, Wang, Zhang (2018) study

this historical event to estimate the value of implicit guarantee in Chinese bond market.

Sichuan Coal Industry Group (川煤集团)

Sichuan Coal Industry Group, a local SOE, defaulted on its 1.05 Billion bond principal in June 2016. The

local government quickly stepped in and provided emergency financing to the company who was then

able to pay back bondholders in full. The company repaid investors with entrusted loans from the state-

owned Sichuan Provincial Investment Group which obtained the loans from the Bank of Communications

and other state-owned banks. Then, in December 2016, only 5 months after paying bondholders in full,

Sichuan Coal defaulted again, as its operating metrics could nowhere near support its debt-load. The

government’s intervention in June/July 2016 had only “thrown good money after bad.” This example

highlighted the uncertain process with which different defaults were handled in China.

Guangxi Non-Ferrous Metal (广西有色)

Another SOE bond default involves Guangxi Non-Ferrous Metal (GNFM), which is owned by the

Guangxi provincial government. This case is unique because of the sheer size of GNFM’s capital structure

                                                   41/65
that includes 14.5 billion in debt outstanding. Also, after GNFM failed to propose a reorganization plan

within six months after a court order, the restructuring period was brought to a close and the company

declared bankrupt; GNFM became the first interbank bond issuer to declare bankrupt.

The failure of the plan of reorganization was said to stem from the court-appointed administrator who did

not properly take creditor demands into account when forming the plan. In reaction to the proposed plan,

one lawyer said “bankruptcy law in China is not aligned with the interests of the creditors, and the fact

that the administrators are always appointed by a court raises the suspicion that there is government

intervention.” 22 But one has to see the positive side of this case, in which the Chinese government did not

intervene to provide financing to GNFM or have an government-backed asset management companies do

so. This shows that the ‘implicit guarantee’ is fading away and the Chinese government is letting the

Enterprise Bankruptcy Law and the markets determine the fate of an increasing number of private

enterprises and SOEs. 23

Dongbei Steel (东特钢)

In a precedent-setting case for the Chinese bond market, Dongbei Steel agreed to a restructuring plan in

2017 to settle with its outstanding creditors. Dongbei Special Steel Group is a company majority-owned

by the Liaoning provincial government and defaulted on its 0.8 billion RMB commercial paper in March

2016. In August 2017, creditors mostly agreed to haircuts in order to settle the first restructuring of an

to a plan of reorganization that would have seen creditors receive under 20% recoveries and a large amount of equity in lieu of their claims.

Instead, the firm was placed in involuntary liquidation, being forced to start selling everything from equity ownership of subsidiaries to office

                                                                      42/65
onshore bond default in China. The plan, which involves restructuring of 45.6 billion RMB, called for the

following:

            •         Creditors owed less than 500,000 RMB are repaid in full; 24

            •         Non-financial creditors and bondholders owed more than 500,000 RMB could elect for a

            one-time cash payment of 22.09% of the amount owed or have their bonds converted into equity;

            •         Financial creditors owed more than 500 thousand RMB converted to equity;

            •         Two strategic investors would inject a combined 5.5 billion RMB into the company in

            exchange for a 53% equity stake in the company. Creditors convert into the remaining 47% of the

            equity.

As the first market-led restructuring, Dongbei presented an important test case for future progress in

corporate bankruptcy procedures. It sets precedents akin to restructurings in the U.S. and the U.K. While

this could increase overall default rates in China, it could greatly improve economy efficiency and overall

dynamism. 25

We close this section by highlighting that “government-led/coordinated solutions,” especially by local

governments, are one of the most prominent Chinese characteristics when dealing with defaulted bonds.

For economic or political reasons, Chinese local governments often rescue failing firms by either issuing

relevant guidance documents, or pushing other healthy local SOEs or financial institutions to inject capital.

However, local governments do not have unlimited resources. The wave of breaking “implicit guarantees”




24   The cut-off of 500,000 RMB below which receiving the full repayment is likely due to the deposit insurance in China implemented in

2015, which sets the limit of 500,000 RMB as well. Perhaps more importantly, it reduced the number of claimants drastically paving an easier

path towards resolution.

alleviate the notorious soft budget constraint problem that still looms in China’s economic and financial

reform today.


7 Data Sources on Chinese Bond Markets

We briefly summarize commonly used data sources for conducting research on China’s interbank market.

The data on the exchange market can be obtained from the Stock Exchanges.


7.1 Data from Wind

Wind Information Co. (Wind, 万得) consolidates various data sources and offers comprehensive data

access to interbank bond market data. On the bond level, Wind provides data on individual bonds’

characteristics and time series of daily trading. Variables of bond characteristics include but not limited

to bond issuance information, issuer’s financial statement information, etc. Variables of daily trading

include but not limited to close clean price, dollar trading amount, etc. In addition, data on yield-to-

maturity   based   on   secondary     market   transactions   calculated   by   CSDC        (available   from

www.ChinaBond.com.cn) can also be downloaded through Wind.

On the market level, Wind aggregates individual bonds’ issuance and trading information by bond

category, maturity, region, rating, etc. Wind also collects information on depository market and investor

composition for various bond types. Besides data on bond characteristics and trading, Wind has several

special statistics on interbank market, such as bond credit risk analysis, convertible bonds, oversea bonds,

open market operations, asset-backed securities, interest rate swap and derivatives, etc.


7.2 China Foreign Exchange Trading System

The secondary market bond trading in the interbank market is conducted through CFETS. CFETS provides

several standard bond data products for practitioners and academic researchers, including bond transaction
                                                    44/65
data aggregated at daily frequency, effective bond quote data as of the end of each trading day, interbank

market spot and repo transaction aggregated at institutional category level with daily, monthly, quarterly

frequency, etc. Among all standard products, the daily bond quote data and transaction by category data

are proprietarily provided by CFETS and not available from other data vendor. In addition, customized

data service is possible for academic research upon receiving written research proposal.


7.3 PBC Statistic Reports

The PBC releases various statistic reports covering the interbank market, including Financial Market

Statistics, Financial Statistics Data Report, China Financial Stability Report, etc. Most the PBC statistics

are available from Wind, and can be directly downloaded from the website of the PBC (under the

Department of Statistics). Some reports, e.g., China Financial Stability Report, are only available in hard

copy.


7.4 Issues in Using the Interbank Market Data

Bond data quality of commercial vendors in China is on average lower than those in the U.S. market, i.e.,

the TRACE dataset. Due to the complexity of the interbank market, sometimes the same variable provided

by two different data sources could be inconsistent. Researchers have to dig into details of the original

data description files and regulatory documents to pick the right one. Finally, researchers should pay

special attention to noticeable changes in time-series variables, as the measurement of statistics changes

more frequently in China than developed countries, due to volatile policy and regulatory guidelines.

We sum up the outstanding bond amounts and count the number of issuers for each rating class using all corporate bonds available on
12/31/2018 (see Table 1 for our definition of corporate bond categories). We exclude all Asset-Backed Securities (ABS, 资产支持证券) in
the corporate bond category. Since the “issuer” performs an “underwriter” role to these ABS securities, the issuer ratings do not represent
the creditworthiness of the security.

Data Source: Wind Database Credit Bond Research (Defaulted Bond Summary Table and Issuers First Default Table)

We report the number and the amount of defaulted bonds, both in amounts (Panel A) and percentage (Panel B, relative to all corporate bonds).
We count the principal value of defaulted bonds only (excluding interests). We only keep one record for duplicate events caused by defaulted
dual-listed bonds, except Jiangquan and Hongchang Gas (for these two issuers, the two records on the same date are separate default events:
one for principal and the other for interest).

Private firms include all firms in our sample that are not SOEs.

All numbers are as of the end of each year.

This table, which is taken from Panel A of Table A.1 in Chen et al (2018), reports various measures of China’s corporate bond
market liquidity and its comparison with the U.S. bond market. ZDays is the time series average of the fraction of bonds that
do not trade on a given day. ZDaysw/trade is the time series average of the fraction of bonds that do not trade on a given day,
excluding bonds that do not have any single trade over the sample period. Turnover is the average daily turnover across all
bond-day observations where a zero is recorded on days without trade. Amihud is the average Amihud (2002) measure across
all bonds, where a bond’s Amihud measure is estimated using its all non-zero daily trading observations and multiplied by
106 . The sample period is 1/1/2012 to 12/31/2017 for China’s two markets and the sample period is 1/1/2010 to 12/31/2014
for the U.S. market, where the U.S. market liquidity measures are from Anderson and Stulz (2017).

Our rating migration matrix consists only of issuers with ratings on 1/1/2014 and 12/31/2018, excluding not-rated issuers.
More specifically, we begin with a full list of corporate bonds that are available on 12/31/2018 with their respective issuer
ratings. For each issuer, we then match its ratings on 1/1/2014 and 12/31/2018. With the two ratings for each issuer, we
assign them to their corresponding cells in the rating migration matrix.
