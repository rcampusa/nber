     This paper investigates whether the parameters of labor demand functions

are sensitive to alternative methods of estimation. The assumption that the

production technology is of the Generalized Leontief type implies that the

demand system can be estimated by analyzing cross-section differences in

earnings across labor markets, by studying longitudinal changes in earnings

within a labor market, or by investigating cross-section differences in labor

force participation rates across labor markets. The estimation of these

models on the 1970 and 1980 Public Use Samples from the U.S. Census reveals

that the estimates of labor demand functions are indeed quite robust to

major specification changes.

I.      Introduction

       After a long period of relative neglect, the empirical study of labor

demand functions has begun to attract the interest of labor economists.

Recent work by Berger (1983), Freeman (1979), Grant and Hamermesh (1981), and

Johnson (1970), reveals the existence of substantively important interactions

in the production process among various labor inputs. The earlier studies in

this literature analyzed the substitution possibilities among labor inputs

defined by skill level (e.g., blue and white collar work, high school and

college graduates, etc.). However, major demographic shifts in the population

(e.g., the continuing rise in the female participation rate, the fluctuation

in the size of the youth cohort, and the increase in the number of immigrants)

raise important policy questions about the impact of these demographic trends

on labor markets. Hence more recent studies in the literature study the

extent of substitution among labor inputs defined by race, sex, immigrant

status, and/or other demographic traits.1 Even at this early stage, several

major findings are emerging:. (1) the increased participation rates of women

has had a negative impact on male earnings (Berger, 1983; Freeman, 1979; and

Grant and Hamermesh, 1981); (2) the increased entry of immigrants into the

labor market did not have a major impact on the earnings of the native-born

(Borjas, 1986; and Grossman, 1982); and (3) there is little evidence of a

strong degree of substitution between blacks and Hispanics (Borjas, 1983).

       It is important to stress that all these findings are based on studies of
                                   -2-




cross-section data. In effect, the labor demand literature infers its con-

clusions by comparing labor markets (i.e., SNSAs) where certain demographic

events occurred with labor markets where those events did not occur. For

example, if the study found that men and women are strong substitutes in

production, the data leading to this result is essentially a negative correla-

tion across StISAs between the earnings of men (women) and the relative number

of women (men) in the labor force. Since differences exist across SMSAs in

many other factors, the existence of these SMSA-specific fixed effects raises

important questions about the robustness of cross-sectional findings.

     This paper investigates whether the estimates of cross-section labor

demand functions are sensitive to alternative methods of estimation. Two

alternative methodologies will be presented. First, by pooling data from the

1970 and 1980 U.S. Censuses, the study will consider whether the technological

relationships predicted by the cross-section results are similar to those ob-

tained by a study of how changes in the earnings of particular groups in the

1970-1980 period are related to changes in the demographic characteristics of

the labor market. The second test of the robustness of the cross-section

results will investigate whether the observed labor force participation pat-

terns are consistent with the predictions of the more traditional labor demand

estimates (based on earnings or shares of earnings). The main finding of this

paper is that the traditional cross-section results are indeed consistent with

those obtained from alternative methods of estimation.



II. Framework

     Assume that the production technology is characterized by the Generalized
                                                2
Leontief production function (Diewert, 1971):
                                                       —3-



     0 =             y..(X.X.)          ,   (i,j   =   1,    ...,   n)     ,             (1)

where 0 is output; X. are the various inputs; and y.. are the technology

coefficients.           The production function in (1) is linearly homogeneous and

restricts the values of the technology parameters so that y.. =                          The

sign of y.. determines whether inputs                        i and j are substitutes (y.<0)
                                  3
or complements (y..>O).

     The assumption that firms in this labor market maximize profits and face

constant input prices leads to the marginal productivity conditions:

     Wi             +                 (X./X.)1 ,       i,j=l,       ...,       n,        (2)
                        J

where w. is the price of input i .                      Equations (2) show the main advantage
of the Generalized Leontief technology: linear-in-parameters wage equations.

Thus the Generalized Leontief technology can provide an important link between

studies of wage determination and input demand theory.

     Although the signs of the parameters y.. contain information about the

substitution possibility among the n inputs, it is useful to transform these

parameters into Hicks partial elasticities of complementarity (Hicks, 1970).

This elasticity is defined by:

              00.
     c                                                                                    3
         ii   0.0.


where 0. =                  0..                         . The Hicks elasticity of complementarity

measures the effect on the relative price of factor i of a change in the

relative quantity of that factor, holding marginal cost and the quantities of

other factors constant. In the Generalized Leontief technology, the elasticities

of complementarity are given by:
                                        -4-

where s. =   wX./O    .     The sign of c.. (ij) depends on the cross-partial from

the production function; it will be positive when the inputs are complements,

and negative when the inputs are substitutes. Given this framework, the next

three sections show how the parameters in (1) can be estimated from census data

on earnings, earnings growth, and labor force participation.



III. Cross-Section Earnings Analysis

     The cross-section estimation of the demand system in (2) is affected by

two major econometric problems. First, equations (2) are not wage-determination

functions unless (relative) supply conditions are also specified. It is not

uncommon in the literature to estimate the production technology assuming that

input supply is exogenous. The usual justification for this assumption is

that the supplies of age-specific sex/race groups are fixed at a point in

time. However, this assumption ignores the fact that although the total stock

of the labor input may be treated as fixed, its distribution across labor

markets is likely to be guided by input price differentials. Although initially

the demand system will be estimated using ordinary least squares, the analysis

below will also consider the impact of alternative estimation strategies

(which account for the endogeneity of supply) on the empirical results.

     The second econometric problem that has been ignored in the literature

concerns the aggregation of workers into labor inputs X.. An implicit

assumption in specifying (1) is that all group i workers are homogeneous

within and across labor markets. Of course, there exist differences in the

skill levels of individuals within each of these groups, and this may lead
                                          —5—




to group I individuals having different average skills across different labor

markets. Hence wage differentials (or Income share differences) across SIISAs

may simply reflect an unequal distribution of skill levels. This problem can

be approached by characterizing an individual's effective labor supply in terms

of a fixed effect indexing the skill level of the individual. In particular,

the wage paid to individual            in group i, w., , depends on:       (a) the market-

determined wage level for the average group i person, w.; and (b) how the skills

of individual £ vary from the skills of the average group i person,

Hence w12 =
                   w    (w1, f), and the individual's wage rate depends both on market

forces and on his (relative) skill level.

          To make this approach useful it is necessary to add structure to the

model. Two possible simplifications are w. =
                                                 i     w.f ii   and w.    w. +
                                                                           1
                                                                                 f£   .     The

additive fixed effect assumes that the wage premIum due to differential skills

is independent of the demographic characteristics of the labor market, while

the multiplicative specification allows for the possibility of such an inter-
           4
action.        Both of these models were used in preliminary work and the results

were quite similar. For simplicity, the analysis in this paper uses the

additive specification. If it is assumed that f2 can be written in terms of

both observable socioeconomic characteristics, Z , and a random uncorrelated

error,         ,   the stochastic equivalent of (2) is given by:

          w1       Z.   +
                            3
                                          +     , i,j=l,   ...,   n   .               (5)

Equation       (5) shows how individual earnings are affected not only by socioeconomic

characteristics, but also by the environment in which the individual is employed.

          The data set used In the cross-section analysis is the 1980 A Sample from

the U.S. Census5 The study was restricted to working-age individuals (18 <                        age
<   64)   who: (a) are not in the military; (b) are not self-employed; and (c) had

records containing complete information on the variables used in the analysis.

The "local labor market" is defined to be the SMSA where the individual resides.
                                   -6-




     There was considerable experimentation in the determination of the number

and definition of the labor inputs to be included in the production process.

Most of the crucial results of the study can be obtained from a four-way

breakdown of the labor input: white males (WM), black males (BM), immigrant

males (IM), and females (F). Some of the results obtained under an alternative

disaggregation of the labor force are discussed below.

     The employment data necessary for the estimation of equations (5) are

obtained from the Census files. The labor input X. (in the SNSA) is defined

as the number of individuals in group i who are of working age and were employed

in 1979. Finally, the capital (K) data is drawn from Grant (1979). It gives

the capital stock in each of 84 SMSAs for over a ten-year period up to 1969,

and was constructed from the Census of Manufactures and the Annual Survey of

Manufactures. 6 The capital data used below is the 1979 extrapolation made
                       .




from the time-series. It is well known that capital stock calculations are

subject to large measurement errors. To complicate matters, the capital data

is available only for manufacturing industries. Since the analysis in this

paper is conducted over all industries, the capital data leads to biased

parameter estimates unless it is assumed that the aggregate capital stock in

the SNSA is (roughly) proportional to the manufacturing capital stock.

     Equation (5) was estimated on the micro Census data using 1979 annual

earnings as the dependent variable. The use of annual earnings, instead of

the wage rate, facilitates comparison between the results in this paper and

those available in the labor demand literature which uses the average income

share in a given year to estimate translog equations.7 The variables held

constant in the vector Z include: years of schooling, years of labor market

experience (age-schooling-6), and years of labor market experience squared. The

estimated coefficients (using the restrictions y..   y..) obtained from the

OLS regression are presented in Panel A of Table 1. Several findings are
                                      —7—




worth noting. First, immigrant males are not substitutes with black males.

In fact, these two inputs - under the assumption of exogenous relative supplies -

are complements. However, immigrant males do compete with white males in the
labor market. Second, women and white men are strong substitutes in production.

This result reinforces the emerging finding in the literature that the entry

of women into the labor force has negatively affected the male labor market.

Finally, capital and all the labor inputs (except for women) are strong comple-

ments in production. This result, again, is consistent with the thrust of the

findings in the literature.

     One important objection to these results is that the OLS estimation views

(relative) labor supplies as perfectly inelastic. The wage differentials

created across labor markets by the interactions among labor inputs are likely

to induce internal migration patterns where the groups move to areas where

they are likely to do relatively well. The presence of mobility costs and/or

imperfect information suggests that the wage differentials do not vanish in

the long run and that the correct estimation of (5) requires that the supply

of inputs to labor markets be modeled more fully.

     To account for the endogeneity of the supply variables, it is assumed

that at the SNSA level relative supplies of labor inputs are affected by a

vector of socioeconomic characteristics, A, describing the SMSA. Hence:



                    (X./xj = A    +                         (6)
The vector A includes the proportions of the labor force employed in each of

the one-digit industrial groupings, the probability of receiving SSI assistance

(relative to the poverty rate), and the mean level of SSI payments (relative

to the mean wage level in the SMSA.)8 The industrial composition of the SNSA

is likely to affect supplies since particular combinations of industrial con-

centrations will attract individuals with specific skills to the locality.
                                       -8-




Similarly, the chances of receiving a particular form of public assistance

(SSI), relative to the SMSA's poverty rate, as well as the 'real" levels of

that assistance, measure the economic welfare of low income individuals in the

SMSA. If the expected value of public assistance payments differs significantly

across SMSAs, geographic differences in the location of racial and! or immigrant

groups are likely to arise.

         The bottom panel of Table 1 presents the 2SLS estimates of the demand

system. Note that controlling for the endogeneity of relative labor supplies

does not alter the substantively important results of the analysis. For

example, in both panels of Table 1 white men and women are substitutes in

production, and immigrants have a negative impact on the earnings of white men

but a positive impact on the earnings of black men.9

         Using the results in Table 1, Hicks elasticities of complementarity were

calculated and are presented in Table 2. With the exception of the own-elasticity

for females (which is insignificantly different from zero), all the OLS own—

elasticities are negative as predicted by the theory.1° Since d ln w./d ln

=   s.c..   the estimated elasticities in Table 2 can be used to predict the
     j

behavior    of wages as the supplies of the various groups in the labor force

shift.11 For example, using the OLS regression, a ten percent increase in the

number of women in the labor force is predicted to lead to a .2 percent drop

in the earnings of white men, while a ten percent increase in the number of

male immigrants leads to only a .1 percent decrease in the white male wage.

Thus even if white men and the female and immigrant inputs are indeed substitutes,

the numerical impact of these groups on white male earnings is small.



IV. Time-Series Earnings Analysis

         Practically all that is known about the extent of labor substitution

among different labor inputs is inferred from cross-section regressions similar
                                   —9-




to those presented in Table 1 (or their translog counterparts). One potential

problem with this literature is that variation in earnings or income shares

across labor markets may simply be representing the impact of unobserved

fixed effects across SMSAs. One solution to this problem would be to study

the behavior of earnings within the SNSA as (presumably exogenous) demographic

shocks change the composition of the labor force. If a sufficiently large

longitudinal data set was available within each SMSA, the estimation of equa-

tions like (5) in differenced form could yield the technology parameters from

earnings growth regressions at the micro level. Since different censuses

cannot be used to match individuals across data sets, the best alternative is

to aggregate the data at the SNSA level, thus making the SMSA the unit of

observation, and estimate the earnings growth regression:

                                    x.
                         +
                             y..[(-)}1
                                          +   v.,   (i,j1,. ..   ,n),   (7)


where Iw. is the change in average annual earnings (in 1979 dollars) between

1979 and 1969 for group I; xZ. Is the change in the average values of the

socioeconomic characteristics; and L(X./X. is the change in the relative

employment variable.

     Using the 1970 and 1980 Public Use Samples from the U.S. Census, and

assuming that the change in the relative supplies of the labor inputs was

exogenous, the top panel of Table 3 presents the OLS estimates of the pro-

duction technology obtained from the estimation of equation (7)12 Three

basic results are obtained. First, men and women are substitutes in pro-

duction. Second, immigrant men and white men (but not black men) are sub-

stitutes in production. Third, capital and the various labor inputs are

complements in production. It is important to stress that these three

findings are essentially the three results given by the cross-section analysis

in Table 1. Thus the estimation of the demand system using earnings growth
                                        -10-



data reveals the same substantive patterns as those given by the comparison of

earnings across different SMSAs.

     There is, however, one difference between the OLS results in Table 1 and

the "longitudinal" results in Table 3: the magnitude of the cross-section

technology coefficients is usually smaller (in absolute value) than the magni-

tude of the same parameters in Table 3. Thus, although the use of cross-section

data does not lead to different conclusions regarding the substitution possibil-

ities among various labor inputs, it does lead to somewhat more inelastic

responses than those given by the longitudinal data.

     Of course, the longitudinal OLS results are even more sensitive to the

criticism that it is unlikely that changes in relative supplies in the labor

market over the 1970-1980 period are exogenous. To correct this problem, the

first stage supply function in (6) is adapted to the longitudinal analysis by

taking first differences at the SI4SA level. This yields:

            x.
                 =   (M)   +   c'   ,                            (8)

where M is the difference in the value of the market aggregate variables.13

The 2SLS coefficients yielded by the longitudinal analysis are presented in

the bottom panel of Table 3. The most visible change in the coefficients made

by the 2SLS technique is the relatively large rise in their standard errors.

This change can be traced to the fact that the variables in the first stage

regressions do not do a good job of explaining changes in relative supplies

across SMSAs. While the R2 in the first-stage cross-section reduced form re-

gressions often exceeded .5, the R2 in the corresponding reduced form longi-

tudinal regressions was usually below .1. This lack of predictive power led

to substantial error in the instruments, and to the relatively insignificant

coefficients in the second stage. Nevertheless, the signs of the technology

parameters repeat the story familiar from the cross-section and longitudinal

coefficients presented earlier.

V.   Labor Force Participatioys
     The previous sections have shown how earnings data can be used to estimate

the parameters of the production technology. An important advantage of the

Generalized Leontief functional form is that the technology parameters can

also be estimated by studying the determinants of the labor force participation

decision. The participation decision for individual £ in group i is based on

a comparison of his market wage, w., and his reservation wage, w. Define:

          i.
           i2 w.
               i —i2.                                                    (9)
     The individual will participate in the labor force if I., >   0.   Using (5)

and assuming that the same vector of socioeconomic characteristics, Z., deter-

mines the reservation wage, equation (9) becomes:

                     +                + v.,                              (10)
                         .1




where v. is a statistical residual. The vector      estimates the net impact of

the socioeconomic variables on the participation decision. If the relative

supplies of the labor inputs do not affect individual Vs reservation wage,

the estimation of (10) identifies the technological parameters y...

     Equations (10) were estimated using the linear probability model since

the large sample sizes and the large numbers of variables and equations make

maximum likelihood methods difficult to implement. This procedure also has

the additional advantage that the cross-equation symmetry restrictions can be

easily imposed. The OLS estimates of the technology coefficients are pre-

sented in the top panel of Table 4. The main result of the regression is that

the analysis of labor force participation rates tells basically the same story

as the earnings regressions. For instance, an increase in the number of male

immigrants in the SI1SA leads to lower participation rates for white men but to

higher participation rates for black men. Since there is a positive correlation
                                       -12-




between participation rates and wages, the results imply a substitutability bet-

ween white men and immigrants, and a complementarity between black men and

immigrants. Secondly, in labor markets where women represent a large fraction

of the labor force, both the participation rates of black men and white men fall

significantly.      Finally, in SMSAs where the relative capital stock is high, the

participation rate of all the labor groups rises.         In short, the qualitative

extent of labor market substitution among the four labor inputs considered in

this study is invariant to the choice of dependent variable in the demand

function. Generally, if inputs i and j are found to be complements, the

analysis in this paper reveals that as input I          enters the labor market the

wage of the other input j rises (relative to that obtained in other SNSAs),

the participation rate of input j rises, and the wage of input j grows

faster over time.

     As in the previous sections, the assumption of exogeneity in relative

supplies may impart a serious bias on the estimates of the labor force partici-

pation regressions. Using the aggregate supply functions in (6), the bottom

panel of Table 4 presents the 2SLS coefficients estimated from the labor force

participation model. A comparison of the two panels in Table 4 reveals only

minor shifts in the coefficients. Thus the analysis of labor force partici-

pation propensities -   within   a labor demand framework -    confirms   the robustness

of the substantive results implied by the earnings data.



VI. Disaggregation of Labor Inputs

     Finally, a serious problem with the empirical implementation of the labor

demand model is that the theory provides no guidance as to how the labor force

is to be disaggregated into the labor inputs X.     .   This   paper has used a

four-way breakdown of the labor force to analyze the sensitivity of labor

demand estimates. It is, therefore, important to determine whether the posi-

tive results of the previous sections hold up under alternative disaggrega—
                                      -13-


tions   of the labor force. A substantively interesting experiment can be made

by disaggregating the male immigrant sample into recent immigrants (immigrants

who have been in the U.S. fewer than 10 years), and "older" immigrants (immigrants

who have been the the U.S. longer than 10 years). This disaggregation, of

course, is designed to account for the well known fact that more recent immigrants

face different labor market experiences than earlier immigrants.

        Table 5 presents selected technology coefficients from the labor demand

systems estimated using earnings, earnings growth, and participation rates

under this more detailed disaggregation. Consider the OLS coefficients for

the three alternative dependent variables. These coefficients reveal that

white men are substitutes with both types of immigrants, with the degree of

substitutability being somewhat stronger for the older immigrant sample. In

addition, black men are complements with both types of immigrants. These

results are not only consistent with the findings from the earlier sections,

but as Table 5 shows they are also invariant to the choice of dependent vari-

able. The disaggregation of the immigrant group, therefore, confirms the main

conclusion of this paper: estimates of labor demand functions are quite

robust to major specification changes.



VII. Summary

    This paper has analyzed the sensitivity of labor demand functions to

choice of dependent variables. It was shown that the use of a Generalized

Leontief technology allows the parameters of the demand system to be estimated

from data on earnings, earnings growth, or labor force participation rates.

Remarkably, the analysis of 1970 and 1980 Census data indicated that the esti-

mates of labor demand functions were invariant to model specification.

    The empirical study led to three substantive findings:      (1) there exists

a strong degree of substitution between men and women in production; (2) male
                                      -4-


immigrants have not had a negative impact on the earnings of black men, but

have had a small negative effect on the earnings of white native men; (3)

capital and most labor inputs are complements in production.

     The analysis showed that each of these three empirical facts was corro-

borated by the behavior of wage levels, wage growth during the 1970-1980 period,

and labor force participation rates across labor markets. The robustness of

labor demand functions, therefore, implies that a wide array of important

empirical insights can be derived from continuing study of the substitutability

of labor inputs in the marketplace.

             See the survey by Hamermesh (1985) for a detailed description of the

two phases in this literature.
     2
             The choice of the Generalized Leontief functional form over alter-

native production functions (such as the translog) is essentially arbitrary.

Recent experiments by Griffin (1982) and Wales (1977) show that over certain

ranges of the data the translog function provides a better fit while over

other ranges the Generalized Leontief equation does a better job.

             Another restriction implied by (1) is that diminishing marginal

productivity for input £ requires that not all y2.                             be

negative. For a discussion of this issue, and a related restriction on the

signs of the elasticities of complernentarity (whose sign depends directly on

         see Diewert (1971) and Sato and Koizumi (1973).

            Note that the definition of the fixed effect requires that E(f)

in the multiplicative specification, and E(f2,) = 0 in the additive model.

             Since the Census data is quite large random samples were drawn from

the 5/100 A sample. The sampling proportions used are available from the

author on request. The sample sizes satisfying all the selection criteria

discussed in this section were 35804 white males, 4136 black males, 40459 male

immigrants, and 62710 females.
     6
            The 84 SMSAs used by Grant (1979) to construct the capital time

series are not a random sample of the 310 SMSAs identified in the A Sample of

the 1980 Census since they tend to be the largest SNSAs in the country.

          The study was replicated using the wage rate as the dependent variable

with similar qualitative results.
     8
          The industrial composition variables were calculated from the 1980

Census file while the public assistance variables were obtained from the 1976

Survey of Income and Education.

          The OLS results do differ from the 2SLS results in one important way:

the absolute value of the technology parameters tends to increase by 2 to 3

times in the 2SLS regressions. The meaning of this result is unclear since in

the simpler two-equation supply and demand model the differences in OLS and

2SLS coefficients depend on:    (a) the correlation between the levels of the

supply and demand functions; and (b) the relative variance of the two error

terms. The more complex model estimated in this paper includes across-equation

restrictions, thus further clouding the relationship between the statistical

assumptions needed to generate the observed differences and the economic

content of these assumptions.
     10
          The own-elasticities of complementarity were calculated by using the

fact that s.c. *   0.
            3 13



          The income shares are: s=.422, B=°34' SIM=•O35 F197 and

SK.3l2.
     12
          Since differenced aggregate data is being used in the regression,

the variance of the residuals is given by cr2(n0+n1)/n0n1, where n is the

sample size in year t (t=0,1). The regressions in Table 3 correct for the

heteroscedasticity in the residual error.
     13
          Since the public assistance variables used in (6) are not available

in Census data the change in these variables cannot be calculated. Hence

equation (8) uses the two public assistance variables in level form.
