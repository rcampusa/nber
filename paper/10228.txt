                                            ABSTRACT

We study the relationship between past returns on a company's stock and the level of investment in

that stock by the participants in that company's 401(k) plan. Using data on 94,191 plan participants,

we analyze several different decision points: the initial fraction of savings allocated to company


stock, the changes in this fraction, and the reallocations of portfolio holdings across different asset

classes. Like Benartzi (2001), we find that high past returns on company stock induce participants

to allocate more of their contributions to company stock. We also find, however, that high returns

on company stock have the opposite effect on reallocations of portfolio holdings, with high returns

leading to shifts away from company stock and into other forms of equity. Overall, for company

stock decisions, participants in our sample appear to be momentum investors when making

contribution decisions and contrarian investors when making trading decisions.

Introduction

       Recent high-profile cases have illustrated the dangers of employee investment in

company stock. These debacles are unlikely to be the last ones, or even the most severe.

Companies with more than 50 percent of retirement assets in company stock are

common, and fractions over 80 percent exist at such large companies as Procter &

Gamble, Anheuser-Busch, and Pfizer.1

       The concentration of retirement wealth in company stock is a clear violation of

diversification principles. Recently, several studies have quantified the economic costs of

this concentration. Meulbroek (2002) uses a Sharpe-ratio approach and finds that the

average diversification cost of company stock is about 42% of its value. Ramaswamy

(2002) uses option-pricing techniques to compute the cost of insuring the extra risk of

company stock. For a range of plausible parameter values, he finds that this insurance

would be prohibitively expensive.2

       Despite these high costs, companies continue to offer employee stock in their

plans. There are many potential explanations for this behavior, but none are entirely

satisfying. For example, employers may believe that stock compensation is inexpensive

relative to cash, that there are strong incentive or morale effects, or that friendly

employees will aid management in a takeover or other proxy battle. Mitchell and Utkus

(2002) review these arguments and find little evidence to support them. The only

explanation with any significant empirical support is tax-driven: dividends paid to certain

employee ownership plans are tax-deductible at the corporate level. Liang and

Weisbenner (2002) find a significant relationship between company stock fractions of

total contributions and dividend payout. Nevertheless, this finding can explain only part




Choi, Laibson, Madrian, and Metrick             July 28, 2003                            2
of the puzzle, as many firms without any dividends still have significant employee

ownership of company stock in their plans.

       Even if employers offer their stock, it does not necessarily mean that employees

must buy it. While many plans make matched contributions in company stock, and some

of these plans restrict employees’ rights to sell this stock for some period of time, there is

still a significant amount of discretionary contributions to company stock. Benartzi

(2001) was the first to investigate this behavior and provided an interesting explanation

for it. Using a sample of about half of the S&P 500 companies, he finds that discretionary

contributions to company stock are positively correlated with the past returns on that

stock. He posits that this correlation is due to employees’ extrapolation of past returns

when forming expectations about future returns. Liang and Weisbenner (2002) confirm

this result for a larger number of companies over a longer time period.

       The Benartzi (2001) and Liang and Weisbenner (2002) results use firm-level data

drawn from SEC filings. These data provide the average contribution fraction to company

stock for each firm. Thus, these studies use data for a large number of firms to analyze

cross-sectional relationships between firm characteristics and employee discretionary

contributions to company stock. Our analysis looks at some similar questions, but our

approach is distinct and complementary: we use time-series variation in returns at three

large firms’ 401(k) plans from 1992 to 2000 to identify the effect of returns on the

company stock choices of 94,191 plan participants. Our main goal is to use this time-

series variation to better understand the mechanisms by which past returns affect

employee investment. Specifically, we attempt to measure the extent of “feedback”

investing in company stock: to analyze whether participants are momentum or contrarian




Choi, Laibson, Madrian, and Metrick               July 28, 2003                             3
investors. Momentum investors trade with a trend, adding to their holdings after high

returns; contrarian investors do the opposite. An active finance literature has developed

in the past few years to look at the empirical evidence on feedback trading.3 By focusing

on a salient asset class – company stock – we hope to make a contribution to this

literature while at the same time providing useful insights for the policy debate on

company-stock investment.

       In the next section, we describe the data in detail and provide summary statistics

about the three plans used in our study. The level of detail in these data allows us to

study several decision points in the asset allocation decision. When an employee first

enrolls in a 401(k) plan offered by her employer, that employee becomes a participant in

the plan and must choose, first, how much of her salary to contribute and, second, how to

allocate these contributions across the investment options offered by the plan sponsor. All

of the plans studied in this paper offer the stock of the employer as one of these

investment options.

       In the third section, we study the other part of this initial enrollment decision,

focusing on the relationship between the returns prior to the initial contribution decision

(“initial prior returns”) and the “initial contribution fraction” to an asset class. We find

that the initial contribution fraction to company stock is significantly related to the past

one-year returns on that stock. Those influential past returns include both the common

market-wide component of returns and the company-specific component of returns. For

both components, high returns induce participants to shift towards company stock and

away from other equities. The net effect on total equity holding is much smaller, but the

contributions are much less diversified within equities.




Choi, Laibson, Madrian, and Metrick             July 28, 2003                             4
       Over time, many participants change their initial decisions. These changes

provide another channel for past returns to affect contribution fractions. In the fourth

section, we analyze the relationship between past returns and the direction of contribution

changes. For this analysis, the returns are measured prior to the change, not prior to the

initial decision. We again find a strong influence of past returns. Here, high levels of

company-specific returns induce a substitution towards company stock and away from

other equities, and a net positive substitution towards all equity.

       Our final set of analyses focuses on the direct reallocation of portfolio holdings,

which we call “trades.” There, we study the relationship between the direction of trades

into or out of an asset class and the prior returns on that asset class. Here, we find that

high returns induce trades out of company stock and towards other equity, as participants

seem to be engaging in profit-taking by selling their successful investments. We conclude

with a summary of our results and a discussion of their implications.



Data

       Our data are provided by Hewitt Associates, a large benefits administration and

consulting firm. From Hewitt’s roster of clients, we identified three large companies

(which we denote as Alpha, Delta, and Gamma) that offered company stock as an

investment option and obtained detailed data on individual participant in each plan. The

data have two components. The first is panel data on every transaction that occurred in

the plans since Hewitt took over their administration. These data go from January 4, 1993

to October 20, 1999 for Alpha; January 31, 1994 to January 26, 2000 for Delta; and April

3, 1996 to March 3, 2000 for Gamma. The second component of the data is cross-sections




Choi, Laibson, Madrian, and Metrick               July 28, 2003                          5
taken at year-ends 1998 and 1999 that include demographic, hire and enrollment dates,

and balances information for all participants had positive balances or plan activity in

1998 or 1999. We will refer to December 31, 1999 as the “final date.” None of these

companies are financial services or technology companies.4

       Table 1 gives demographic statistics for those participants in our sample who

were active in the plans at the final date. (This is a subset of the 94,191 total employees

that we observe.) The average plan balance for these participants is $89,172. The most

comparable cross-sectional data to ours is the EBRI/ICI sample of 401(k) plans, which

covers about 35 percent of the assets in the 401(k) universe. Holden and VanDerhei

(2001) report average plan balances at the end of 1999 broken down by plan size. They

find that average plan balances are positively correlated with the number of participants

in the plan, mostly because larger companies tend to have started plans earlier, thus

giving more time for balances to be accumulated. For plans with greater than 10,000

participants—like all three of our plans—they report an average balance of $73,672.

       Table 2 breaks down the contribution fraction and asset holdings into three non-

disjoint asset classes. Company stock contribution fractions are 16.6 percent at Alpha, 4.5

percent at Delta, 12.0 percent at Gamma, and 9.9 percent as a participant-weighted

average across the three companies. The holdings in company stock are similar to the

contribution fractions at Gamma, but are significantly higher at Alpha (31.5 percent

versus 16.6 percent) and Delta (8.1 percent versus 4.5 percent). The disparity at Alpha is

partly due to the fact that Alpha makes matching contributions in company stock and

places some tenure restrictions on selling these contributions. Like most clients of Hewitt




Choi, Laibson, Madrian, and Metrick             July 28, 2003                            6
Associates, Delta and Gamma do not match in company stock and place no restrictions

on the holdings of company stock.

       These holdings fractions are somewhat lower than the national averages reported

by Holden and VanDerwei (2001) from the EBRI/ICI database. They find that, among

large plans (>5000 participants) with similar investment offerings to our sample

companies, the average holding of company stock is 23.9 percent of the portfolio. Note,

however, that many of the plans in this class of the EBRI/ICI sample are like company

Alpha in that they match contributions in company stock and impose some trading

restrictions on these matched contributions.      Nevertheless, even Alpha has lower

company stock holdings than the average company that matches in company stock.

       While the main focus of the paper is on company stock, it is also useful to know

the relationship between past returns and allocation to other asset classes. These

relationships are not only interesting in themselves, but are also important for knowing

whether changes in company stock investments crowd out other equities. We consider

two other asset classes in the paper. “Total equity” includes all equity holdings, domestic

and international, including company stock.5 “Other equity” is total equity minus

company stock.

       The paper studies the initial contribution fractions to these asset classes, the

subsequent changes in these contribution fractions, and the trades across the classes.

Before turning to these analyses, it is useful to examine the empirical frequency of

changes and trades. Figure 1 plots the likelihood of ever having made a change to

contribution fractions or a trade as a function of tenure in the plan. By three years after

initial enrollment, 49.8 percent of participants have made at least one change to their




Choi, Laibson, Madrian, and Metrick             July 28, 2003                            7
initial contribution fraction, and 46.7 percent have made a trade.6 These two groups

overlap significantly, so that their union comprises only 58.0 percent of the population.

By six years after enrollment, these percentages are over 70 percent for each of the two

activities separately, and 80.0 percent for either.

       Figure 2 plots the frequency of trades per year for all individuals that have at least

three years participation as of the final date. Within this whole group, 37.9 percent have

never made a trade. The next highest grouping is between 0.26 and 0.50 trades per year,

with 37.3 percent of participants falling into this range. Very few participants make more

than 0.50 trades per year. Overall, these trading frequencies are somewhat higher than

for the typical firm in the Hewitt universe, most likely because these firms were “early

adopters” of the Internet channel for trading and other participant activities (Choi,

Laibson, and Metrick (2002)).



Initial contribution fractions

       We begin with an analysis of the initial contribution fraction. Our central tobit

regression equation for this analysis is

                                      Yi = α + βXi + εi                                  (1)

where Yi is the fraction (censored below at 0 and above at 1) of company stock, other

equity, or total equity out of the total contribution, Xi is a vector of firm-level and

participant-level characteristics that may explain the cross-sectional pattern of flow

decisions, and εi is the participant-level error term. While we employ panel-data notation

to distinguish among participants and initial dates, these regressions use only one

observation per participant. The sample includes every participant with positive balances




Choi, Laibson, Madrian, and Metrick               July 28, 2003                            8
or plan activity in 1998 or 1999. For each member of the sample, we include a single

observation made on the date they first enrolled in their plan, and all explanatory

variables for that participant (Xi) are measured on that same date.

       We include several firm-level variables in the Xi vector. Our main variables of

interest are the past returns on company stock and on the overall stock market. Since we

would like to separate common shocks (stock market returns) and firm-specific shocks

(company stock returns), we include two past return variables. SP500 is the past return

for the S&P 500 in the one year (253 trading days) preceding the enrollment of

participant i. That is, if participant i enrolls on date t, then SP500i is the return from

trading date t – 253 to trading date t – 1. CSTOCKi is the excess return over the S&P 500

for the company stock of participant i. Like SP500, it is measured over the preceding 253

trading days. Thus, all participants who enroll on the same date t will have identical

SP500 values; all participants who enroll on the same date t at the same company will

have identical CSTOCK values. For notational convenience, we drop the i subscripts for

the remainder of this discussion.

       Previous research finds that investment behavior is also influenced by the

variance of past returns. Thus, we include two variance measures in X. Std(SP500) and

Std(CSTOCK) are the standard deviations of the daily returns on the S&P 500 and

company stock over the 253 trading days preceding the enrollment of participant i.

Finally, we include a separate fixed effect and trend for each company. The regression

constant is omitted.

       We include several participant-level variables as elements of X. Many researchers

have found that total equity fractions are related to age. The most common finding is a




Choi, Laibson, Madrian, and Metrick              July 28, 2003                          9
hump-shaped relationship between equity holdings and age, with equity fractions first

increasing and then decreasing later in life, although consistent relationships across

studies have been elusive.7 We include age and age2 as elements of X. In addition, many

studies show that overall equity holdings are positively related to salary; Holden and

VanDerhei (2001) confirm this finding in the EBRI/ICI sample. For company stock,

however, they find little relationship between salary and company stock fractions, with

just a hint of slight negative tilt at the highest salary levels. Like EBRI, we do not have

data on wealth, so we rely on salary as a proxy and include the log of annualized salary

for the year of enrollment as an element of X.

       Company stock contributions may also be related to job tenure. Workers with

longer tenure at enrollment may differ from other participants along several dimensions.

First, since they have been at the company longer, they may have more human capital

dedicated to the company. This should induce lower contributions to company stock,

other things equal. On the other hand, they may have a greater loyalty to the company

and feel more of a duty to invest in company stock. Finally, workers who first participate

later in their careers may have waited because they are less financially sophisticated. This

lower sophistication may be correlated with poorer diversification and higher

contributions to company stock. The relative importance of these different factors is an

empirical question. In the yearend 1998 EBRI/ICI sample, Holden, VanDerhei, and

Quick (2000) find a positive relationship. We include a variable, TENURE, which is the

log of 1 + job tenure (in years), as an element of X.

       The results are summarized in Table 3. The dependent variable is company stock

in column 1, other equity in column 2, and total equity in column 3. The results show a




Choi, Laibson, Madrian, and Metrick              July 28, 2003                           10
strong impact of past returns on the initial contribution fractions to company stock. The

coefficient on both SP500 and CSTOCK is positive and significant when the dependent

variable is company stock (column 1); conversely, the coefficients on these two variables

are negative and significant when the dependent variable is other equity (column 2).

These respective coefficients are positive but insignificant for total equity (column 3).

       This pattern of results suggests that when company stock returns are high, newly

enrolled participants contribute a higher fraction of their flows to company stock and a

lower fraction of their flows to other equity; on net, the fraction of flows allocated to all

equity (total equity) tends to cancel. Thus, these past returns – both the marketwide

(SP500) and company-specific (CSTOCK) have mostly a compositional effect on overall

equity holdings.

       For the other independent variables, we find results consistent with previous

studies. The coefficients on age and age2 (column 3), while not significant, are consistent

with a hump-shape relationship between total equity fraction and age. The relationship

between salary and total equity is positive and significant, while the relationship between

salary and company stock fraction is negative and significant.

       One possible criticism of these results is that the standard errors are understated.

If firm-specific shocks induce correlated behavior across participants enrolling around the

same time, then our assumption of cross-sectionally independent residuals would be

violated, and our standard errors would be biased downward. For example, if firms

change their communication strategies to new participants, then these new strategies

could induce correlated behavior. In this case, we would think that we have more

independent observations than we really do.




Choi, Laibson, Madrian, and Metrick              July 28, 2003                              11
       Our regression specification controls for firm-specific differences in average

behavior (with fixed effects) and for firm-specific changes in this average behavior over

time (with trend variables for each firm), but to control for firm-specific shocks would

require a specification of the correlation structure induced by such shocks. This is more

structure than we are comfortable imposing. Instead, we perform a simple robustness

check by assuming an extreme case: perfect correlation for all participants who enroll on

the same day. To do this, we compute the average percentage allocated to each asset class

by all participants who enrolled on each day. We then perform a separate time-series

regression of these averages for each firm on the firm-specific independent variables used

in equation (1). Furthermore, we allow for error correlation across days by computing

Newey-West (1987) robust standard errors. Even in this extreme case, we find evidence

that past returns affect contribution allocations. The results are summarized in the

paragraph below; full tabular results are available from the authors.

       The strongest evidence is for the company stock fraction, where two of the three

firms show a positive and significant impact of past company stock returns on the

company stock fraction, and one of the companies shows a positive and significant

impact of past S&P 500 returns. For other equity, the results are consistent with the

participant-level evidence from Table 3: the coefficients on company stock are negative

and significant for two firms, and the coefficients on S&P 500 are negative (but

insignificant) for all three firms. For total equity, these results appear to cancel, with no

strong pattern to the coefficient signs. Thus, as for the individual-level results in Table 3,

it appears that past returns play mostly a composition effect within total equity, with high




Choi, Laibson, Madrian, and Metrick               July 28, 2003                            12
past returns leading to higher fractions allocated to company stock and lower fractions

allocated to other equity.



Contribution Fraction Changes

       The preceding section focused on snapshots of flows and the impact of past

returns on these snapshots. This section examines the determinants of the changes to

these flows: How do past returns affect changes to flow fractions? We now shift attention

away from the returns preceding enrollment to the returns preceding specific changes.

       Table 4 summarizes the results of logit regressions for the company stock fraction

(column 1), the other equity fraction (column 2), and the total equity fraction (column 3).

The dependent variable is an indicator variable equal to one if the fraction is increased

and zero otherwise. The explanatory variables remain the same as in the previous section,

except that SP500 and CSTOCK are the returns for the year immediately preceding the

contribution fraction change. The sample includes every change made by any participant

who was active in the plans at year-ends 1998 or 1999.8

       The results demonstrate more evidence of the powerful impact of past returns on

participant behavior. As in the previous section, we find that the coefficient on CSTOCK

is positive and significant for the company stock regressions (column 1). In this case,

however, the coefficient is also positive (and nearly significant) for other equities, so it

appears that company stock does not crowd out other equities when contributions are

changed. Hence, the net effect of CSTOCK on total equity is positive and significant

(column 3). Furthermore, another contrast with Table 3 is that the coefficient on SP500

is negative and significant for company stock (column 1) and is positive and significant




Choi, Laibson, Madrian, and Metrick             July 28, 2003                            13
for the total equity fraction. In this case, high returns on the marketwide component of

company stock returns induce a shift away from company stock and towards other equity,

with a new effect of shifts towards equity and away from other assets (column 3).

Overall, participants act like momentum investors for total equity.

       As with the analysis in the previous section, we have some concern that the

coefficient standard errors in Table 4 may be understated due to firm-specific shocks. As

a robustness check, we again collapse all the participant observations on each trading day

down to a single observation for each firm. To do this, we construct a new dependent

variable, Ymnt, for each asset class m (Company stock, other equity, or total equity) at

each firm n on every trading date t. Ymnt is a fraction where the numerator is the number

of participants in firm n who increased their flow fraction to asset m on date t minus the

number of participants in firm n who made an allocation change to any fund on date t but

didn’t increase their flow fraction to asset m, and the denominator is all participants at

firm n who made any allocation change on date t. We then estimate separate time series

regressions for each firm. The results are summarized in the paragraph below; full

tabular results are available from the authors.

       The main question is whether the qualitative results from Table 4 also hold here.

The answer is yes. Several coefficients are significant and have the same sign as their

analogues in Table 4. These significant coefficients are negative for one firm on SP500

and positive for two firms for CSTOCK in the company stock regressions; positive for

two firms on SP500 and negative for one firm on CSTOCK in the other equity

regressions; positive for one firm on SP500 in the total equity regressions. Meanwhile,

no coefficients are significant with the opposite sign as their analogues in Table 4.

       The previous sections analyzed the determinants of contribution fractions—the

investment flows—to company stock and other equity. Many researchers focus on flows

because those data allow for the cleanest test of the impact of past returns on investment

decisions. In contrast, studies of asset holdings and past returns suffer from an obvious

problem: high returns through price appreciation on any given asset will tend to increase

the fraction of that asset in overall holdings, even if investors take no action.

Nevertheless, it is asset holdings, not flows, that drive the long-run distribution of wealth.

In an extreme scenario, one could imagine that all participants rebalance their holdings on

a regular basis, so that differences in flows cause only minor long-run differences in their

portfolio allocations.

       For example, consider a participant who wants to have five percent of his overall

holdings in company stock. Suppose further that this participant allocated 20 percent to

company stock at his initial enrollment because he had not yet decided to limit company

stock to 5 percent of his overall portfolio. Now, in later years, he could change his

contribution fraction in company stock to 5 percent, but he would still require periodic

rebalances of his holdings to ensure that this five percent fraction is maintained. It may be

the case that he finds it simpler to rebalance his holdings to 5 percent and ignore the flow

component in the short run. If so, even though contribution fractions might appear to be

influenced by returns prior to enrollment, we would not notice any long-run impact of

these fractions on portfolio diversification.




Choi, Laibson, Madrian, and Metrick               July 28, 2003                            15
       To examine this possibility, we perform several tests. First, we look at the

rebalancing decision (“trades”) with the same methods used to study changes in the flow

fraction. We take every trade initiated by employees who had positive balances or plan

activity in 1998 or 1999 and estimate a separate logit regression for each asset class,

where the dependent variable takes on a value of one if the trade increased holdings in

that asset class and zero otherwise.9

       The results are summarized in Table 5. The key evidence is in column (1). Here,

we see that returns one year prior to the trade on both components of company stock

returns (CSTOCK and SP500) induce participants to trade out of company stock, but only

for SP500 is there a significant effect. For both components, high returns induce

participants to substitute away from company stock and towards other equities, with

positive and significant coefficients on both components in column (2). These results are

consistent with “profit-taking” behavior found in other studies (Odean (1998), Grinblatt

and Keloharju (2001)), where investors tend to sell “winner” stocks and hold “loser”

stocks. Somewhat paradoxically, the net effect on total equity is positive and significant

for the CSTOCK component, perhaps because rising prices on company stock induce

participants to feel wealthier and less risk-averse.

       We next perform an analogous analysis at the firm level, using the same approach

as in previous sections. The dependent variable is the number of participants who

increased their holdings of the respective asset class in day t minus the number of

participants who made any trade but didn’t increase their holdings of the respective asset

class in day t, divided by the number of participants who made any trade in day t. We

estimate separate regressions for each asset class for each firm. Even in this extreme case,




Choi, Laibson, Madrian, and Metrick               July 28, 2003                          16
we find evidence that past returns affect contribution allocations. The results are

summarized in the paragraph below; full tabular results are available from the authors.

        Consistent with the results of Table 5, we find that the coefficient on SP500 is

negative and significant for one firm, and negative but insignificant for the other two. For

other equity, we find that the coefficients on SP500 are positive and significant for all

three firms. Overall, it appears that participants act as contrarians in their trades for

company stock.



Conclusion

       This paper studies the decisions of almost 100,000 individual 401(k) participants.

Our goal is to better understand the determinants of employees’ discretionary investment

in company stock. The great detail in the data allows for an analysis at several different

stages in the 401(k) process. Our main conclusion is that past returns matter for every

stage. We find that high returns on company stock for the year prior to enrollment induce

participants to make higher initial contributions to company stock. Furthermore, high

returns over any one year period induce participants to increase these contribution

fractions. High returns on company stock have the opposite effect on trading decisions:

high past returns induce participants to substitute away from company stock and into

other equities. Thus, participants are momentum investors when making decisions about

investment flows but contrarian investors when making trading decisions. One caveat to

our results is that our sample of three companies, while including many participants, is

still small relative the universe of 401(k) participants, and has a relatively low level of

company stock holdings.

        These results allow us to build on the important work of Benartzi (2001).

Benartzi finds a positive relationship between past returns on company stock and current

contributions to company stock, with the strongest results for past ten-year returns, and

weaker results for shorter horizons. We would explain this result as the combination of

several forces. First, when participants join, they are influenced by the past returns,

including the past one-year return. Some participants never alter these initial contribution

fractions, and so several distinct past years may seem influential at any point in time, but

the influence of the most recent year will be limited. Second, some participants do make

changes, but these changes are infrequent and fewer than 40 percent make changes in any

given year. These changes are influenced by the immediate prior returns, but such prior

returns are often far removed from the current year. Again, we see that the influence of

the most recent year is limited.         Taken together, the initial contributions and the

contribution changes are both influenced by one-year returns, but these years are spread

out over a long period.        Then, when we look for a relationship between current

contributions and past returns, the longer period appears better at the company level.

        Our most interesting and policy-relevant findings are for the relationship between

asset holdings and past returns. Absent frequent rebalancing, high returns on assets will

tend to increase the allocation to these assets. Thus, it is very difficult to directly test for a

relationship between asset holdings and the past returns on these assets. The best we can

do is to try to infer these relationships by looking at the different decisions made by

investors. Since most previous studies have used cross-sectional snapshots of holdings

and contribution fractions, they have logically focused on the latter as the cleanest source

of data. These studies find – as do we – that high past returns on company stock tend to

increase contribution fractions to company stock. Using the time-series data in this paper,

we see that trading decisions may work to mitigate some of this effect. Since high past

returns induce participants to substitute out of company stock, the strong relationship

between past returns and contributions is less dangerous for asset allocation than it might

appear from these previous studies.

500 on company stock for the 253 trading days prior to the post-change contribution. Std(SP500)
and Std(CSTOCK) are the standard deviations of the S&P 500 and company stock returns,
respectively, over the 253 trading days prior to the post-change contribution. Salary is the log of
annual salary in the year of the post-change contribution, and Total Balances is the log of total
balances in the plan in the calendar month prior to the change, both in 1999 CPI-deflated dollars.
Age is the participant’s age at the time of the post-change contribution, Age2 is the square of Age,
and Tenure is the log of one plus the years between the participant’s original hire date and the
post-change contribution. Company Trend x is the years between December 31, 1980 and the
participant’s post-change contribution if the participant is in company x, and zero otherwise.
Coefficients on fixed-effect company dummies and a constant are not shown. Standard errors are
reported in parentheses below the point estimates. Source: Authors’ calculations.

              Probability of Trading into Asset Class, 1/4/1993 – 3/6/2000,
                      as a Function of Asset Returns Prior to Trade
This table presents the results of a binary logit regression of the probability a participant
makes a trade increasing his or her holdings in company stock (column 1), other equities
(column 2), or all equities (column 3), conditional on the participant trading. SP500 is the
cumulative return on the S&P 500 for the 253 trading days prior to the trade. CSTOCK is
the cumulative returns in excess of the S&P 500 on company stock for the 253 trading
days prior to the trade. Std(SP500) and Std(CSTOCK) are the standard deviations of the
S&P 500 and company stock returns, respectively, over the 253 trading days prior to the
trade. Salary is the log of annual salary in the year of the trade, and Total Balances is the
log of total balances in the plan on the day of the trade, both in 1999 CPI-deflated dollars.
Age is the participant’s age at the time of the post-change contribution, Age2 is the square
of Age, and Tenure is the log of one plus the years between the participant’s original hire
date and the trade date. Company Trend x is the years between December 31, 1980 and
the participant’s trade if the participant is in company x, and zero otherwise. Coefficients
on fixed-effect company dummies and a constant are not shown. Standard errors are
reported in parentheses below the point estimates.
