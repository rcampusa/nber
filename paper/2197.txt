                 City Taxes and Property Tax Bases



                                ABSTRACT



       This paper investigates the simultaneous relationship between
   tax rates and city property tax bases using data for 86 large U.S.
   cities in 1967, 1972, 1977, and 1982. We find that a 10 percent
   Increase in the city's property tax rate decreases the city's tax
   base by about 1.5 percent. In addition, local income taxes and
   taxes levied by overlying jurisidictjons (such as county and state
   governments) also have negative impacts
                                           on the city's property tax
   base. Local sales taxes, in contrast, appear to have little
   impact. We conclude that taxes affect local
                                                property values more
   than is typically implied by previous studies that have investigated
   the impacts of state and local taxes on firms' location decisions.

                       City Taxes arid Property Tax Bases

                    Katharine L. Bradbury and Helen F. Ladd


    The property tax has traditionally been and continues to be the major

revenue source of U.S. cities. Although cities have increasingly turned to

other local revenue sources such as sales and income taxes, they still rely

heavily on the local property tax to finance their local public expenditures.

Despite this, surprisingly little is known about the impact of a city's

property tax rate on its tax base.

    Many local public officials apparently believe that property taxes have

significant adverse effects on city economic activity. Witness, for example,

their frequent willingness to grant tax abatements to encourage economic

investment in the city. Applied economists, in contrast, are nearly unanimous

in their skepticism both about the wisdom of such tax breaks and, more

fundamentally, about the magnitude of the adverse behavioral effects of state

and local taxes. Many empirical studies appear to support the contention that

differentials in state and local tax burdens are simply too small to offset

differences in the more basic determinants of firm location such as labor

costs and accessibility to markets. (See surveys by Case, Papke, and

Koenigsberg (1983); Kieschnik (1981); and Wasylemko (1981).)

    Recent econometric investigations of the link between state and local

taxes and the location of economic activity fall into two categories. First

are those that focus on particular types of location decisions, typically the

branch plant decision which, one might argue, is the most likely to be

affected by taxes. (See, for example, Carlton (1979), Bartik (1985, 1986),

and Schmenner (1982).) This approach has the advantage of allowing the

researcher to ground the empirical analysis in the microeconomic theory of
firm behavior. The second approach takes a much broader definition of

economic activity such as the level or change in employment or capital

investment either for all industries or certain industrial sectors. (See for

example, Papke (1986) who focuses on investment and Bradbury, Downs, and Small

(1982) who focus on changes in employment.) These more aggregate variables

are harder to model precisely because they reflect a variety of economic

decisions including, for example, the decision to expand, to shut down, to set

up a new branch plant, or to start a new firm.

    Even if economists better understood the links between local taxes and the

location and expansion decisions of firms, they would still not be able to

answer the central question of this study, namely, what impact do local

property taxes have on the size of a city's property tax base? The difficulty

arises because the city tax base includes residential as well as business

property and because the market value of such property reflects not only the

intensity of economic development (the quantity of capital) but also location

rents, that is, the prices that firms and households are willing to pay to

invest in the central city rather than elsewhere. High property taxes may

reduce the size of the tax base either by reducing the level of business or

residential economic activity in the city or by being capitalized into lower

property values, or by some combination of both. Whatever the mechanism, city

officials and economists ought to care about the responsiveness of the city's

property tax base to the property tax rate. To the extent that the current

tax rate reduces the size of the base, the additional tax rate needed to

finance a given increase in public expenditures will be higher.

    Other state and local taxes such as income or sales taxes may also affect

local property values despite their initial incidence on non—property factors

of production or on other economic transactions. Hence, a secondary goal of

this paper is to provide quantitative estimates of the effects of other state



                                     —2—
 and local taxes on the size of a city's property tax base. This aspect of the

 study can be viewed as the first step in a larger and more ambitious study

 that would examine the effects of all major city taxes on each of the city's

 tax bases.



 I. The Data and the Role of the Property Tax

     Our empirical work focuses on the relationship between city property taxes

 and the market value of potentially taxable property in U.S. central cities.

City governments, however, are often not alone in having the power to levy

property taxes on the property located within city boundaries. In many

metropolitan areas, independent school districts, county governments, and

special districts are also authorized to tax city property if it falls within

their jurisdictional boundaries. Moreover, the economic activity generated by

the city's property may be subject to state or local sales and income taxes.

Regardless of whether they apply specifically to property or are levied by

overlying governments, all of these taxes (and the corresponding public

services they finance) could affect the size of a city's tax base. Hence, all

must be taken into account.

    Our primary perspective, however, is the city government itself. As an

independent decision—making entity, its decisions about local taxes can be

modeled more easily than could those of an aggregated set of governmental

units. Hence, our goal is to measure the impact of city property taxes on

city property tax bases, controlling for all other taxes that may affect the

amount of taxable property in the city.

    The basic data are for 86 U.s. central cities for four years —— 1967,

1972, 1977, and 1982. The 86 comprise all those American cities with

population over 300,000 in 1970 or 1980 plus all the central cities of the 50

largest SMSAs in either 1970 or 1980. Thus, the analysis includes all major



                                     —3—
central cities in the United States. The combined 1980 population of the 86

cities constitutes 21 percent of the 1980 U.S. population and 94 percent of

the U.S. population in central cities containing 50,000 or more people.

   Property taxes are less important for city governments than for such other

types of local governments as counties and school districts, but they still

accounted for over half of the 1982 tax revenues of the average city in our

sample. Table 1, which provides information for the 79 cities with complete

revenue data for all four years, shows that reliance on the property tax

varies across cities of different sizes and across regions and that it

declined over time in all groups. Comparing cities grouped by size, cities

with population over 1 million relied least heavily on the property tax in

1967 and experienced the greatest decline in dependence in the succeeding 15

years. Of the six cities in this group, only Houston derived more than half

of its tax revenue from the property tax by 1982.

    Cities in the Northeast began the period relying more heavily on the

property tax than cities in other parts of the country. Even in 1982, the

five New England cities still received 98—99 percent of their tax revenue from

the property tax. In contrast, cities in other parts of the country began the

period with more access to alternative taxes and increased their use of such

taxes during the period. Nationwide by 1982, 18 of the 86 cities derived some

revenue from local income or payroll taxes and all but nine cities relied on

general or selectives sales taxes to some degree.

    Effective property tax rates, like dependence on the property tax, also

vary substantially across cities and generally declined over the 15—year

period. We define an effective tax rate as

         t =   T/B,
where T is the city's total revenues from the property tax, and B is the

market value of all potentially taxable property in the city. The tax base in

this measure is intended to be independent of how each city defines its tax

base in practice and to include all property other than that universally

exempt from the property tax such as churches and government buildings. Data

on property tax revenues are readily available from the Census of Governments,

but the market value of each city's potential tax base had to be estimated

from data on assessed values and assessment/sales ratios.1

   To estimate tax bases, information from the Census of Governments was

supplemented with data gathered directly from cities. Nonetheless, some

missing values remain, especially for the earlier years. As a result,

information on tax bases is available for only 56 of the 86 cities for all

four years, but a total of about 280 city—year observations are available for

the pooled regression analysis reported below.

    Table 2 shows the level and variation in effective tax rates for the 56

cities with complete information. The average rate decreased from 0.8 percent

in 1967 to 0.6 percent in 1982. (These rates may appear low, but they are

averages of city tax rates alone. The inclusion of property taxes levied by

overlying governments would raise the rates substantially in some cases.) The

table shows that tax rates are generally highest for the smallest and the

largest cities in the sample. This reflects heavy dependence on the property

tax relative to other revenue sources in the small cities and heavy overall

taxation in the large cities.

    Among regions, rates in northeastern cities, especially those in New

England, are strikingly higher than those elsewhere. For the New England

cities, the high rates reflect a combination of heavy dependence on the

property tax and a concentration of revenue—raising responsibility (including

for schools and counties) at the municipal government level. In the West,

rates were low in 1967 and declined by one—half, on average, over the ensuing

fifteen years. This largely reflects the 1978 passage of Proposition 13,

These effective property tax rates refer to city government property taxes
alone; see text for definition of effective property tax rate and sources.
Economic activity in these cities may also be subject to property taxes
imposed by independent school districts or county governments.
which rolled back local property taxes in California and strengthened the tax

limitation movement in other states.

    This wide variation in effective tax rates provides a natural experiment

for examining the hypothesis that city tax rates affect the attractiveness of

a city to households and firms and thereby directly influence the size of the

city's potential property tax base. Correspondingly wide variation in city

use of alternative revenue sources and in tax burdens imposed on city

residents by overlying jurisdictions also provide the information needed to

determine the effects of other taxes on city property tax bases.



II. Conceptual Framework

    The relationship between the market value of a city's property per capita

(PBASE) and the city's property tax rate (t)   is   given by the expression

         PBASE =   f(t,   X)

where X is a vector of exogenous variables, including public service levels,

that influence the size of the tax base. Estimating a relationship of this

form using ordinary least squares would not be a problem if the tax rate were

truly exogenous. This would be the case, for example, if state law mandated a

binding limit on the city's property tax rate. Perusal of the laws affecting

city property taxes, however, suggests that in most cases the property tax

rate, expressed as a fraction of full market value, is not exogenous. While

many cities are subject to tax limitations of some form, only rarely do these

limitations determine the effective tax rate. The clearest exceptions are

California cities in 1982 and Boston in 1982, each of which is subject to a

binding limit expressed in terms of an effective tax rate.2

    More commonly, the local property tax rate is determined in part by the

size of the tax base. Consider, for example the following model of city

behavior. City government officials choose a level of expenditures in



                                       —6—
response to the demand of citizen voters for public services. They then levy

sufficient   property taxes to pay for whatever portion of total expenditures

that they are unable to finance from other revenue sources. According to this

model, a higher tax base would lead to a lower tax rate for any given property

tax levy.

    Assuming a log—linear specification of the tax base equation, we can

eliminate the resulting simultaneity by substituting the definitional

relationship t = PTAX/PBASE, where PTAX is per capita property tax revenues,

for t in the equation explaining the size of the base. Before the

substitution we have


            (1) 1nPBASE=a-i.blnt+clnX+e,

where in denotes natural logarithm and e is a random error term. After

substituting for t and solving for PBASE, the equation becomes


         (2) ln PBASE =   a/(l+b)   + b/(l+b) in PTAX + cI(l+b) in X + e/(l+b).


Thus, treating property tax revenue, rather than the tax rate, as the

explanatory variable removes one source of the simultaneity problem, yet still

makes it possible to solve for b, the elasticity of the base with respect to

the tax rate.

    Even per capita tax revenue, however, may not be exogenous. A larger base

means that the same amount of revenues can be raised with a lower tax rate,

reducing the pain of raising taxes and thereby increasing the willingness of

voters to vote for higher taxes. (See later sections of the paper for further

discussion.) This endogeneity leads to the following two—equation model:


         (3a) PBASE = g(PTAX, X)             with ag/apTAx < 0

         (3b) PTAX = h(PBASE, Z)             with ah/apBAsE > 0




                                       —7—
where Z is a vector of exogenous variables that influence tax revenues. The

key to identifying the crucial coefficient of PTAX in equation 3a is that

there be good identifying variables, that is, that the vector Z include

variables that clearly belong in the revenue equation but not in the base

equation. One distinguishing characteristic of this study is the availability

of such variables.



The Tax Base Equation

    The tax base equation includes tax revenues and three sets of exogenous

control variables in addition to year dummies. First are those that emerge

from a simple monocentric model of an urban economy. Second are those that

control for taxes other than municipal property taxes levied on economic

activity generated in the city and third are measures of public services. The

variables and reasons for including them are explained in the subsections that

follow. Table 3 reports their mnemonic variable names, definitions, means,

and standard deviations.

    Variables Derived From an Urban Model. The starting point for the tax

base equation is a monocentric model of an urban economy. This strategy of

building on the descriptive implications of an urban model dramatically

simplifies what is in fact an enormously complicated and

not—very—well—understood problem, the behavioral modeling of economic activity

in an urban area.3 The following log—linear specification captures the

essential implications of the standard urban model for the total value of

property (B) per unit of land (LAND) in the portion of the metropolitan area

designated as the central city:


         (4) (B/LAND) = f(SMPOP, LAND).

metropolitan area as measured by metropolitan population (SMPOP) leads to a

higher value of property in the city per unit of city land. According to the

monocentric model, this occurs both because larger metropolitan areas have

higher land prices at the center and also because the higher price of land

induces more intensive economic development in the city in the form of

business and residential structures.

    More city land, controlling for metropolitan population, is predicted to

reduce the value of property per unit of land; more land means that the city

extends further down the rent and density gradients of the metropolitan area.

    Expressing the dependent variable in per capita terms rather than per unit

of land is more natural for the current empirical investigation. Hence, the

dependent variable in equation 4 must be multiplied by the inverse of the

population density (that is, by LAND/POP, where POP is the population of the

city). One approach at this point would be to add density (with a predicted

coefficient of —l in a log—linear specification) to the right hand side of the

equation. The difficulty here is that population density is endogenous in

that it, too, is determined by the exogenous determinants of land prices in

the city, namely SMPOP and LAND. Hence, including population density as an

exogenous variable in the estimating equation would not make sense. Instead,

we specify the reduced form of the model in log—linear form as


         (5) in PBASE = a + c1 in SMPOP + c2 in LAND + e


where PBASE is the property tax base per capita and the coefficients c1 and

c2 represent the combined effects of the exogenous variables on the base per

unit of land and on population density. Provided the population density

gradient is less affected by the exogenous variables than are the rent and

business density gradients, a positive sign for SMPOP and a negative sign for

LAND are still predicted.4



                                       —9—
   The sample cities, and the metropolitan areas in which they are located,

vary in how well they I it the simple monocentric model. Of most concern is

that some of the central cities in the sample are not the primary centers of

economic activity in their respective SMSAs. Thus, for example, Everett WA,

with its 1982 population of 57,000, has far less claim to being the center of

the Seattle—Everett metropolitan area than does Seattle with 490,000

residents. To help control for such variations, an additional variable

(KEYCC) takes on the value one for those cities that dominate their SMSAs and

zero otherwise. Dominant cities are defined as the central city in SMSAs with

one central city and, somewhat arbitrarily, as those that have 60 percent or

more of either population or employment in SMSAs with two central cities or 50

percent or more in SMSAs with three central cities. Dominant central cities

are predicted to have larger tax bases per capita than do nondominant central

cities because of their positions as centers of urban economic activity.

    Per capita income of city residents (PCY) completes the specification of

this part of the equation. This variable is expected to have a positive sign

because higher income increases the demand for housing.5

    The property tax rate (t) is simply added to equation 5 in logarithmic

form with a coefficient of b, hypothesized to be negative. A higher property

tax rate is expected to reduce the value of the city's property tax base in

part because the land component of the tax will be capitalized into lower

property values. In addition, the improvements component of the tax is

expected to induce producers to shift away from capital toward labor and to

reduce the attractiveness of the city as a place for investing capital. The

reduced attractiveness of the city may manifest itself either in a change in

land prices or in reduced economic activity or, most likely, in some

combination of both. Following the logic of equation 2, the equation is then

respecified as a function of per capita property tax revenues (PTAX) to yield:

where X .. .X
       5      n are the other control variables in the tax base equation
discussed in the next two sections.

    Nonproperty Tax Variables. Three additionai tax variables control for the

other taxes imposed on economic activity in central cities. Alternative taxes

levied by the city itself are represented in the tax base equation by

statutory city tax rates for income taxes (TRINC) and for general sales taxes

(TRSAL). Close to half the sample cities make no use of local general sales

taxes. In these cities the tax rate is zero.6               Only i8 of the 86 sample

cities had some form of a city income or payroll tax in 1982. Negative signs

are expected on both tax rate variables. A higher income tax rate lowers the

net—of—tax income of city residents, and may induce firms to pay higher wages

than they otherwise would, thereby reducing net profits and discouraging

investment in the city. This is predicted to reduce the demand for property

in the city except to the extent that the higher cost of labor induces firms

to substitute in favor of iand and capital. A higher sales tax rate may

reduce the demand for taxed goods, and, similarly, lead to less investment in

the city.

    The tremendous complexity and variation in the division of taxing

responsibilities among city and non—city governments across states makes it

impossible to control separately for each of the non—city taxes Imposed on

city economic activity. Instead, we constructed a single variable (OVTAX),

based on statewide data, as a proxy for the burden of overlying taxes. The

variable is calculated as the average state and local per capita tax burden in

the city's state multiplied by the "non—city" share of taxes in the state, and


                                               — 11 —
is based on the following logic. If the city itself imposed no taxes, all

residents (including residents of the city) could be viewed as being subject

to the average state and local tax burden in the state. But since each city's

major taxes (property, income, and sales) are modeled separately, city taxes

must be removed from the total state and local burden. This is accomplished

by using statewide data to subtract the average per capita taxes collected by

all those jurisdictions in the state that perform the same functions as the

city in question. Thus, for example, in constructing the overlying tax

variable for a city such as San Francisco which has responsibility for county

functions as well as municipal functions and hence has no overlying county,

care is taken to make sure that the calculated overlying burden does not

include county taxes.7 The expected sign of this variable is negative;

higher overlying tax burdens are likely to depress economic activity in the

city.

    Measures of Public Services. Public services are an important component

of any study of the effects of state or local taxes. Since public services

are valued and taxes are used to pay for them, failure to control for services

could lead to incorrect estimates of the effects of taxes alone. In

principle, we need to control for all services available to city firms and

households regardless of whether the services are provided by the city

government itself or by some overlying government such as a state or county

government or an independent school district.

    Public expenditures typically serve as the standard measure of public

services in studies of tax capitalization (e.g. Oates, 1969), but, as shown by

Rosen and Fullerton (1977), output measures such as educational test scores

are far superior. Hence, we have constructed three public service measures

that are intended to measure public sector outputs rather than simply public

inputs. The first is the number of crimes in the city expressed as a fraction



                                     — 12 —
of the city's total private sector employment (CRIME). Vocal public concern

about crime makes it plausible that the decision to invest in a particular

city might be influenced by the perceived risk of being assaulted or robbed.

Higher crime rates per worker in the city are predicted to lead to lower

property values.8 The second and third variables (FIRESER and MISCSER) are

proxies for fire protection and miscellaneous services (consisting of local

schools, sewers, sanitation, and health and hospitals) constructed from per

capita state and local expenditure data by state deflated by the estimated

costs of providing the respective service or sets of services in each city.

The cost indexes are designed to measure the effects of city—specific

environmental and demographic factors on the costs of providing a given

package of public services and are described in more detail below. To the

extent that the indexes correctly measure the costs per unit of final output,

deflating expenditures by them should lead to reasonable proxies for the level

of services actually available to city residents. We expect both variables to

enter the base equation with positive signs since higher service levels should

increase the size of a city's property tax base, ceteris paribus.

    Year Dummies. The final three variables are year dummies (YR82, YR77, and

YR72). These dummies are needed in the pooled regression to control for

cyclical trends in the aggregate economy and for secular trends such as the

fall in transportation costs that tend to decentralize business activity.



The Property Tax Revenue Equation

    Derivation of the property tax equation proceeds in two steps. First

comes the derivation of the demand for public services and second comes the

city's choice among revenue sources. This approach is consistent with the

view that the equilibrium amount of property taxes collected depends on

explicit choices by city officials. The basic structure of the estimating

equation follows from the identity

                                     — 13 —
    (7) PTAX =     II E

                                               I
where PTAX is property tax revenues,EEis all city operating expenditures

summed over I individual spending categories, OR is nontax exogenous revenues

such as lump sum intergovernmental aid, and TTAX is total revenues from all

local tax sources. For estimation, the variables derived from the two steps

are combined in a logarithmic equation with year dummies. The variables are

summarized in table 3.

    Demand for Local Public Expenditures. The literature on local public

expenditures is well developed and needs only brief review here.9 The

typical starting point is that quantity demanded is a function of resident

income, per unit costs, and tax prices. Desired expenditure on the ith

expenditure category (Ei) is the product of costs and quantity demanded.

Hence,


    (8) Ei =   CjQ =      f     (Y, Cj, TS),


where Y is the income of the decisive voter, C is per unit cost of the ith

expenditure category, and TS is the decisive voter's share of the local tax

burden. The cost and tax share variables are entered separately because they

have different predicted impacts on total expenditures. Assuming a constant

price elasticity of b1 in the equation for quantity demanded, the coefficient

of the tax share variable in the expenditure equation is predicted to be bi

and consequently negative. The coefficient of the cost variable, however, is

predicted to be (l-fb), which will be positive unless the price elasticity

is larger (in the negative direction) than minus one.

    Appropriately measured cost variables would reflect not only the costs of

inputs, but, following the logic of Bradford, Malt and Oates (1969), would

also incorporate the amount of intermediate goods such as police patrols that




                                               — 14 —
are needed to produce a given level of protection from crime. The idea here

is that environmental conditions in the city such as city density and the

incidence of poverty may affect the costs to the city of providing a given

level of the output, such as police protection, ultimately valued by city

residents. To reflect such cost variations, we have included three cost

indices for miscellaneous public services (MCOST), police protection services

(PCOST), and fire protection services (FCOST). The cost indices are derived

from a regression model that estimates the average impact on city expenditures

of each cost factor, controlling for other determinants of city spending such

as resident income and preferences)°

    Given the purpose of this study, there is little need to be precise about

the identity of the decisive voter. The goal is simply to capture the

essentials of a basic expenditure model in order to think clearly about which

variables appropriately belong in the tax equation and can serve to identify

the coefficient of the property tax variable in the base equation. In the

estimated equations, per capita income (PCY) serves as a reasonable proxy of

the relevant income measure and is expected to have a positive effect on

taxes. The decisive voter's tax share is inversely proxied with a measure of

property tax exporting, which is also expected to influence the choice among

revenue sources, described in the next subsection of the paper.

    As specified so far, desired expenditures are not explicitly dependent on

the size of the property tax base. This primarily reflects the simplicity of

the decisive voter model, particularly in its median voter form, rather than

economic reality. In more realistic models, the tax base or its components

might enter the expenditure equation for a variety of reasons. The value of

residential property, for example, might better proxy residents' permanent

income and, consequently, residents' willingness to pay for public services

than does current income. Or higher—valued property (whether residential or



                                    — 15 —
business) may require greater services in the form of protection from crime.

Or large amounts of business property relative to residential property in a

city may give business interests political power that can be used to convince

public officials to provide more services specifically for business or to keep

expenditures low to stabilize tax rates. Hence, using the simple model

presented in equation 8 to justify excluding the size of the property tax base

as an explanatory variable would be a mistake. Moreover, as discussed below,

the choice among revenue sources (the second stage of the derivation of the

tax equation) provides an additional justification for expecting the property

tax base to positively influence the level of property taxes.

    The analysis to this point argues for including in the tax equation

standard determinants of the demand for spending on individual public

services: resident income, a tax share variable, service—specific measures of

costs, and the property tax base. One additional variable related to

expenditures dominates all the others in terms of its relevance to this study,

namely a measure of the services for which each city government in the sample

is responsible. Given the cross—sectional nature of the data set, variation

in service responsibilities is likely to be a primary determinant of the

variation in total expenditure. Stated differently, the number of expenditure

categories over which the summation applies in equation 7 varies substantially

among cities.

    The variable measuring the total service responsibilities assigned to each

city (TSRI) indicates the per capita spending net of user charges that would

be required in each city to achieve national average per capita state—local

spending on each of 17 designated services, given the particular allocation of

spending responsibilities in each city's state. Constructed from statewide

rather than city—specific expenditure data, the measure avoids the potential

problem of attributing high service responsibilities to cities who choose to



                                     — 16 —
provide high service levels. The measure varies substantially across cities.

The most obvious variation relates to services such as elementary and

secondary education and municipal hospitals for which a city has either

complete spending responsibility or none. Some cities are also responsible

for services provided by counties elsewhere in their state. Variation across

states in the role of state government also accounts for a substantial portion

of the variation in service responsibilities across states. The greater the

state role in welfare, health, and corrections, the lower, in general, is the
             11
city role.

    Choice among Revenue Sources. Subtracting nontax exogenous revenues (OR

in equation 7) from total desired expenditures yields the amount of revenue

that must be raised from local tax sources. Nontax revenue is primarily

intergovernmental aid, but in principle, only the aid that is truly

exogenous. As measured, however, some of the per capita federal aid (FAID)

and per capita state aid (STAID) may be matching aid.

    How the remaining revenue requirements are allocated among local tax

sources has received much less attention from economists than has the

expenditure decision.12 Consistent with the decisive voter approach, one

might hypothesize the following model of the city decision regarding how much

to rely on local property taxes:


    (9) PTAX/TTAX= f(PBASE, Ày, ER)


where PBASE, as before is the per capita property tax base, AV is a vector of

dummy variables indicating the legal availability of alternative local taxes,

and ER is a vector of export ratios for alternative taxes.

   The larger is the property tax base per person, the easier it should be

for the city to raise revenue through the property tax. A larger tax base

allows the city to raise a given amount of revenue with a lower tax rate and



                                      — 17 —
thereby to avoid the potentially distorting effects and heavy tax burdens of

high tax rates.

    The legal availability of alternative revenue sources plays a key role in

the city tax decision given the stringent restrictions often placed on city

revenue—raising authority. As already noted, only 18 of the 86 sample cities

are currently allowed to use some form of local income or payroll tax, and 47

cities a general sales tax. A higher proportion of cities are permitted to

impose some form of selective sales tax. Availability of alternative tax

sources is likely to decrease a city's reliance on the local property tax.

Availability is indicated with dummy variables: AVINC refers to local income,

earnings, or payroll taxes; AVGSAL refers to the general sales tax; AVSSAL

refers to selective sales taxes.

    Not all taxing instruments impose equal burdens on resident voters. A

portion of the burden of a local sales tax, for example, might be shifted onto

nonresident tourists and commuters in the form of higher prices. Or a payroll

tax may fall partially on nonresident commuters. Similarly, part of the

property tax burden may ultimately be borne by nonresidents in the form of

lower profits, higher prices, or lower wages. The export ratios (ER), defined

as the proportion of the tax burden associated with each of the major local

taxes that can be shifted to nonresidents, are included in the equation to

account for this burden shifting. The hypothesis is that local voters choose

taxes in such a way as to minimize burdens on themselves. Hence, a higher

export ratio for the property tax (ERPROP) is expected to lead to greater

reliance on property taxes, but higher export ratios for sales (ERSAL) or

income taxes (ERINC) are expected to reduce city reliance on property taxes.

    The calculation of each export ratio relies first on assumptions about

which groups —— consumers, workers, or owners of property ——   bear the burden
of each tax and second on estimates of the proportion of each group that lives



                                    — 18 —
 outside the city. The incidence assumptions are straightforward for the

 income and sales taxes; local income taxes are assumed to be borne fully by

 workers in the form of lower wages and local sales taxes by consumers in the

 form of higher prices. The incidence assumptions used for the property tax

 are much more complex and are spelled out elsewhere.'3 Calculated export

 ratios for all three taxes vary substantially across cities because of

 differences in how cities define their tax bases, the diversity of city roles

 in metropolitan areas, and variations in the mix of shoppers, job—holders, or

property types across cities.



III. Estimation and Results

    Table 4 shows the coefficients estimated using two—stage least squares for

three equations: the tax base equation and two versions of the tax equation.

The results correspond quite closely to expectations.



The Tax Base Equation —   Results
    The coefficient of primary interest, that of the property tax variable in

the base equation, is —0.13 and significantly different from zero. Recalling

from equation 6 that this estimated coefficient is equal to (b/(l+b)), we

estimate the elasticity of the per capita property tax base with respect to

the property tax rate (b) to be approximately —0.11.    Thus, if the property
tax rate in one city were twice that of another city, per capita property

values would be expected to be 11 percent lower in the higher tax city.

    The three additional tax variables provide some interesting new insights

about the effects of alternative revenue sources on the size of a city's

property tax base. The results imply that city income taxes and non—city

taxes both reduce the size of a city's tax base but, somewhat
                                                                surprisingly,
that city sales taxes do not. The finding that sales taxes have no effect on

the size of the base may not be surprising to business owners, many of whom

seem to prefer sales taxes over other state and local taxes on the grounds

that forward shifting of tax burdens to consumers keeps business firms from

bearing the burden of such taxes. To economists, however, the finding is

still somewhat surprising; reduced consumption in response to higher prices

would generally be expected to lead to some reduction in economic activity in

the city.

    The coefficient of the overlying tax burden variable (LOVTAX) can be

interpreted directly as an elasticity once it has been multiplied by (l+b).

The coefficient of the income tax rate variable (TRINC) can be converted to an

elasticity evaluated at the mean income tax rate in the sample after

multiplying by (1-i-b). These calculations imply the following elasticities:

—.083 for overlying taxes and — .044 for income taxes, both of which are the

same order of magnitude but, not surprisingly, smaller than the elasticity of

—.11 estimated for the property tax rate. The policy significance of the

relative sizes of these magnitudes is discussed later in the paper.

    In contrast to the tax variables, the performance of the service variables

is somewhat disappointing. The crime rate and fire protection services enter

with the expected signs, but neither is statistically significant. Of more

concern is the negative sign on miscellaneous services. Why the quantity or

quality of services such as schools, health services, and sanitation should

lower property values is not clear. Measurement problems may be part of the

answer. Like the fire protection services variable, this measure is based on

statewide spending deflated by a local cost index. In the partial adjustment

model discussed later, the coefficient of miscellaneous services becomes

positive.

    Each of the other estimated coefficients in the base equation must also be

multiplied by (1-i-b) =   0.89 to determine the value of the relevant


                                        — 20 —
elasticities. However, since the precise magnitudes of elasticities of per

capita property values with respect to the other variables are not the focus

of this paper, the reader should simply keep in mind that they are somewhat

smaller (in absolute value) than the coefficients shown in Table 4.

    The variables derived from the urban monocentric model all perform as

expected. Cities in larger SMSAs have higher property values than those in

smaller SMSAs and cities with greater land areas have lower property values.

Moreover, because the dependent variable is expressed per capita rather than

per unit of land, the estimated coefficients imply that the impacts of SMSA

population and city land area on rent and business density gradients are

greater than on population density gradients. For example, the negative

coefficient of the land variable suggests not only that the market value of

property per unit of land is lower for larger cities (presumably because in

such cities the city extends further down the area's rent and density

gradients), but also that the lower property value per unit of land is not

offset by a sufficiently lower population density to produce a higher value of

property per resident.14

    Also consistent with the predictions of the model are the findings that

dominant central cities have higher property values than secondary cities in

multi—centered SMSAs and that the per capita income of city residents is

strongly positively associated with city property values.



The Property Tax Revenue Equation —   Results
    The explanatory power of the tax equation as a whole is remarkably strong;

many variables not only show the expected signs, but also exhibit coefficients

significantly different from zero. The two versions of this equation shown in

Table 4 differ only in the exclusion of the per capita income of city

residents from the first equation.



                                      — 21 —
    As discussed earlier, theoretical considerations argue for including both

per capita income and per capita property values in the estimating equation.

In practice, however, they are highly correlated, especially after controlling

for other variables in the equations. Hence, identifying the independent

effect of the size of the property tax base on property tax revenues in this

pooled time—series cross—section is difficult. When income is included, the

coefficient of the base is indistinguishable from zero; when income is

excluded, the coefficient reflects the effects on property tax revenues of

both the property tax base and of the portion of resident income that is

correlated with property values across cities. No matter how it is measured,

however, ability—to—pay has a positive effect on revenue, which differs

significantly from zero. If one city has 10 percent more property per capita

than another city, the "combined" coefficient estimate implies that it will

raise 5.7 percent more tax revenues, other things (not including income)

equal, and that its property tax rate will be 4.3 percent lower.

    A city's measured index of service responsibilities has a strongly

positive effect on tax revenues, as expected, and serves as a critical

variable identifying the tax variable in the base equation. Where the

"required bundle" of city services involves 10 percent more per capita

spending (at average costs), per capita property tax revenues are about 7

percent higher, on average, other things equal. Presumably the difference is

made up in service quality reductions or in additional revenues from other

sources. The three cost indexes are also positively associated with tax

revenues, indicating that in cities with higher production costs for local

public services, property taxes are also higher, other things equal.

   The variables relating to taxes other than the property tax used by city

governments all exhibit statistically significant negative signs, as

expected. The negative coefficients on the dummy variables representing



                                    — 22 —
availability of specific nonproperty taxes indicate that cities tend to

substitute these other taxes for property taxes when they are allowed to use

them. Moreover, where the burdens of these nonproperty taxes   fall   less upon

local residents, cities depend upon them more heavily, as shown by the

negative signs on the income and sales tax export ratios. Also as predicted,

the coefficient of the property tax export ratio is positive, but it is not

significantly different from zero.

    Intergovernmental aid from the federal government appears to have no

effect, while that from state government appears to exert a positive effect

on property tax revenues. This positive impact runs counter to the

expectation that intergovernmental transfers substitute for property tax

revenues, but might reflect reverse causation due either to matching

requirements or to distribution formulae that direct more aid to cities with

high property tax burdens. We attempted to purge the state and federal aid

variables of their possible endogeneity by using federal and state aid five

years earlier as instrumental variables, but the results were similar to those

reported in Table 4.

    The coefficients on year dummy variables suggest that, controlling for

changes over time in the other included variables, per capita property tax

revenues (in constant dollars) expanded from 1967 to 1972 and then declined to

1982.




Cross—Section by Year

    The basic structural model is generally robust over time. Estimating the

same tax base equation as shown in Table 4 (minus the year dummies) separately

for each of the four years yields signs and general patterns that are similar

across years, although some of the coefficients are estimated less precisely,

partly because the samples are smaller and partly because the quality of the



                                     — 23 —
data probably improved over time. An F—test of the complete equation does not

allow us to reject the hypothesis that the coefficients jointly are the same

over all four years and, hence, justifies pooling the four years of data into

one large sample.

    Table 5 reports the estimated coefficients by year of all the tax

variables in the base equation. The patterns are remarkably consistent across

years with the exception of 1972, for which year the coefficients of the

property tax variable and the overlying tax variable are surprisingly low.

Multicollinearity in this sample may be part of the problem; excluding the

miscellaneous service variable from the equation, for example, more than

doubles the absolute value of the coefficient of the property tax variable.

Overall, however, the results by year confirm the patterns from the pooled

data: negative effects on the property tax base of property taxes, income

taxes, and overlying taxes and positive (but insignificant) effects of sales

taxes.



Partial Adiustment Model

    Researchers generally view coefficients from a cross—section regression as

estimates of long—run responses or elasticities, on the assumption that

differences between cities reflect equilibrium responses to differences in

underlying city characteristics. But over time, the land rents and intensity

of economic activity that determine city property values may not adjust

immediately to changing conditions. The availability of four years of data

for our cities, five years apart, allows us to incorporate this dynamic

behavior into the estimating equation and thereby provides an alternative way

to estimate long—run elasticities.

   Partial adjustment models start from the premise that economic actors in

any one period move only part way toward a long—run equilibrium. Thus, if

             (11) PBASEt/PBASEt_i = (PBASE/PBAsEt_l)A,


where A is the proportional adjustment occurring in one (five—year) period.

Taking natural logarithms yields:


     (12) in PBASEt = A in PBASE + (1—A) in PBASEt.....i.


Hence, the variables needed in the estimating equation are simply the

determinants of the equilibrium base PBASE, as before, plus the lagged

base, PBASEt1.

    Estimates of the partial adjustment model are shown in Table 6. The

second column reports coefficients estimated for the base equation including

the lagged base, and the two final columns report estimated coefficients from

the corresponding tax equations. Lack of data on property tax bases in 1962

limits these equations to the later three years of the study —
                                                               1972, 1977, and
1982. The first column reports estimates with no lags —     the   same model as
shown in Table 4 but for the same three years as the partial adjustment model
— to
     provide a consistent comparison of the two estimates of long—run

responses.

    The estimated coefficient on the lagged base variable, 0.54, implies that

A is 0.46 and that slightly less than half of the adjustment to long run

equilibrium occurs during a five—year period. In the partial adjustment

framework, a long—run elasticity (that is, an elasticity of the equilibrium

base) with respect to any right—hand—side variable is equal to the estimated

coefficient shown in Table 6 divided by the estimate of A.    Correcting also
for the substitution of tax revenues for tax rates, the long run elasticity of

 the base with respect to the property tax rate is approximately equal to

 —0.15, somewhat higher than the —0.12 estimate implied by the equation with no

 lags. Both of these estimates are greater (in absolute value) than the —.11

 derived from the comparable equation shown in table 4, presumably because the

year 1982, when the elasticity was more negative, is given more weight.

    Although the reported coefficients of many of the other variables are

smaller in the partial adjustment equation than in the equation with no lags,

dividing by X (=0.46) to derive estimates of long—run elasticities restores

most to comparable or larger size. Including the lagged base has the

advantage that it nets out a variety of inter—city differences not captured in

the other included variables and thereby controls for special factors in each

city that might otherwise lead to biased estimates of long—run elasticities.

One not very surprising result of this is that the roles of some of the

descriptive variables such as KEYCC and LSMPOP are reduced. These variables

do not change much over time and their predicted effects on the tax base may

operate through the lagged base variable in the partial adjustment equation.

    The coefficients of variables representing public services available to

city residents appear to be quite sensitive to the inclusion of the lagged

base term. The measures of crime and of miscellaneous services now both enter

with the predicted signs, although with relatively large standard errors.

This provides some support, albeit weak, for the conclusion that higher crime

rates reduce property values and that higher miscellaneous services such as

education and sanitation increase property values in the city. Our proxy for

fire protection services enters with an unexpected negative sign but its

coefficient is virtually zero.

   The results for the tax equation are similar to those reported in Table

4. Even with lagged base as an additional instrument, we still cannot

identify separate effects for base and income. The elasticity of tax revenues



                                    — 26 —
with respect to the tax base (when income is excluded) is smaller than the

earlier results suggested —   closer   to 0.4 than to 0.6, indicating that a city

with a per capita tax base 10 percent above average would probably enjoy a tax

rate 6 percent below average.



IV. Interpretation: The Effects of Taxes on City Property Tax Bases

    Our best estimate of the long—run elasticity of a city's property tax base

with respect to its tax rate is —0.15. We prefer this estimate from the

partial adjustment model because it explicitly allows for the dynamics of

property market adjustments over time and controls for city—specific effects

that might otherwise bias the coefficients. The estimated response appears to

be well identified in a statistical sense thanks to the nature of the data

base and the attention devoted to the specification of the revenue equation as

well as to the base equation. Moreover, the elasticity emerges from a set of

two equations that yield reasonable coefficients for almost all the other

variables suggested by economic theory.

    How reasonable is the preferred estimate? In the absence of comparable

studies, one approach is to evaluate it with reference to the theory of

capitalization. Consider, for example, what would happen if property tax

rates were fully capitalized into property values. By way of illustration,

consider a parcel of property worth $100,000 and subject to a 0.8 percent tax

rate, the average city's rate in the sample. Then consider the change in

value predicted to occur with a 10 percent increase in the tax rate, to 0.88

percent. Assuming the resulting $80 tax increase were expected to continue

indefinitely, full capitalization would lead to a 1.5 percent reduction in the

value of the property (as our equation predicts) provided the relevant

interest rate were 5.3 percent (since $80/0.053 = $1500 =     1.5 percent of
$100,000). Thus, at an interest rate of 5.3 percent, the estimated long run



                                         — 27 —
 elasticity of —0.15 would be fully consistent with 100 percent

 capitalization. For higher interest rates, the estimated elasticity indicates

 a larger impact than would be implied by capitalization alone and for lower

 rates, it indicates a smaller impact.

     Even if one were sure that the relevant interest rate were exactly 5.3

 percent, it would be incorrect to interpret our results as evidence that

 property taxes are fully capitalized into values. In contrast to previous

 studies that explicitly measure capitalization (e.g. Oates, 1969), we

 purposely do not control for the amount of capital in the city.   Hence the
 estimated response of property values probably represents the combined effects

 of some capitalization (price change) and some physical disinvestment in the

 city (change in the quantity of capital). That is, part of the reduction in

 the base probably represents the decision of some potential residents

 (households and firms) not to move into the city, the decision of some firms

to let their city property depreciate as they invest elsewhere, and the

decision of some city residents to disinvest in their residential structures

by reducing maintenance. This decrease in investment occurs simultaneously

with a fall in the price of city land and stops once the after—tax rate of

return to investment is again equalized across jurisdictions.

    As noted earlier, this study provides new evidence that taxes other than

city property taxes also affect the size of a city's property tax base. The

one exception is local sales taxes which appear to have essentially no effect

on the property tax base. Table 7 compares the effects of the various taxes,

using the coefficients from the partial adjustment equation. The entries in

the first column show the impact on the logarithm of the property tax base of

a 10 percent increase in a particular tax rate or, equivalently for

nonproperty taxes, in tax revenues. As changes in logarithms, the entries

(multiplied by 100) can be interpreted as percentage changes in the base.

bThe first entry was evaluated at the average tax base and tax rate
in the sample. The second entry was evaluated for average tax
revenues.
Thus, a 10 percent increase in the property tax rate is predicted to reduce

the base by 1.5 percent, while a 10 percent increase in the local income tax

rate is predicted to reduce the base by only 0.5 percent. The estimated

impact of a 10 percent increase in overlying taxes is a 1.0 percent decline in

the base, halfway between the impacts of local income and property taxes.

These findings have two clear implications. First, a 10 percent increase in a

city's property tax rate will produce only an 8.5 percent increase in property

tax revenues on average in the long run. Second, increases in city income tax

rates or in taxes levied by overlying jurisdictions such as state and county

governments will reduce the property tax revenues collected with a given

property tax rate.

    Policymakers should also be interested in the second column of Table 7

which shows the impact on the (logarithm of the) property tax base of a $10

increase in per capita tax revenues from each source. The two entries for the

property tax reflect evaluation at different averages. The 1.4 percent

decline was evaluated at the average property tax rate and tax base in the

sample, while the 2.0 percent decline was evaluated at the average per capita

tax revenues in the sample.

    Surprisingly, the calculations indicate that a $10 increase in local

income taxes reduces the size of the property tax base by more than does a

comparable per capita increase in property taxes on average. This finding is

easily reconcilable with the apparently contradictory results in column 1: a

$10 per capita increase in revenue from income taxes requires a much larger

percentage increase in income tax rates than does a $10 increase in property

tax revenues, at current average rates in the sample. The larger Impact of

raising revenue through the income tax has important implications for

policymakers trying to reduce property tax burdens by substituting income

taxes for property taxes. Assuming constant total tax revenue and after



                                    — 29 —
allowing time for all adjustments, we find that the net effect of shifting

away from property taxes toward income taxes is to reduce the size of the

property tax base. Shifting away from property taxes in favor of local sales

taxes, in contrast, is estimated to increase the size of the local property

tax base.

    An alternative way for local officials to reduce property taxes   is   to

induce higher levels of government to take over some of the city's service

responsibilities and to finance them by higher noncity taxes. Our estimates

suggest that this shift would increase the size of the city's property tax

base. Reducing property taxes by $10 per capita would increase the tax base

by 1.4 to 2.0 percent, an increase that more than offsets the much smaller

decrease of 0.3 percent associated with the $10 increase in the overlying tax

burden on city residents and firms.



IV. Conclusion

    We began this paper with reference to the many studies that conclude that

state and local taxes do not matter in determining levels of economic activity

in cities. The results of this study indicate, quite to the contrary, that

taxes do matter. We find not only that cities with higher property tax rates

have lower property tax bases, but in addition that cities whose taxpayers are

subject to other taxes such as local income taxes and taxes levied by

overlying jurisdictions have lower property tax bases. These effects are

important because lower property tax bases require higher local property tax

rates to finance a given package of public services.

      1-Values of locally—assessed taxable and exempt real and personal
 property, and state—assessed property, were combined. Because personal
 property is partially or completely exempt from property taxation in many
 states, the reported "exempt" values for personalty were generally
 incomplete. Personal property values were imputed for most cities based on
 their commercial and industrial real property values and the relationship
 between personal property values and commercial and industrial real property
 values in those cities fully taxing personal property.

     2This means that the equation modeling tax revenues (discussed below) is
 less appropriate for Boston and the California cities in 1982 than for other
 cities. But deleting these observations does not affect the coefficient
 estimates.

    3See Bradbury, Downs, and Small (1982) for an attempt to model the
simultaneous determination of city population, employment, and per capita
 income.

    4More precisely, we have

           in (B/LAND) = b0 + b1 in SMPOP +
                                            b2 in LAND + e and
           in (POP/LAND) = d0 + d1 in SMPOP   + d2 in LAND +   ii,
           so that

           in (B/POP) = (b0—d0) +
                                  (bj—d1) in SMPOP + (b2—d2)
                       in LAND + (e—u).

    Hence, c1 should be interpreted as b1—d1 and c2 as b2—d2.

    5This prediction should not be confused with the more ambiguous effects
of income that typically emerge from an urban model. According to that model,
household income of the residents of a metropolitan area exerts two opposing
forces on the slope of the price gradient. On the one hand, higher income
increases the demand for space, which tends to flatten the gradient. On the
other, higher income increases the value of travel time and thereby raises the
cost of transportation which leads to steeper gradients, With the relevant
variable specified as the per capita income of city residents alone, the
effects of income on city vs. suburban location are already accounted for and
the issue becomes solely one of the demand for housing services.

    6Statutory rates for cities imposing a sales tax were pieced together
from a variety of sources. The four main sources are the Commerce Clearing
House, State Tax Guide; John Due and John Mikesell, (1983); John Due (i97?)
and Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, Significant Features
of Fiscal Federalism, various years.

    7The estimated overlying tax burden for all other California cities in
the sample exceeds that for San Francisco, because they all have overlying
counties. See Helen F. Ladd, John Yinger et al. (1986), ch. 8, for a complete
discussion of the complexities of calculating measures of overlying tax
burdens in a slightly different context.
    8Previous studies have shown that higher crime rates reduce housing
values. See, for example, Rizzo (1979) and Gray and Joelson (1979). We have
normalized the number of crimes (both property and violent crimes as reported
in The Uniform Crime Reports) by employees rather than by city population
because crimes rates per resident appear to be strongly correlated with the
amount of a city's nonresidential activity, especially commercial activity.
Hence, normalizing by resident population rather than by employees would lead
to a severe reverse causation problem; higher tax bases per capita would be
associated with higher crime rates per capita.

    9See, for example, T. Bergstrom and R. Goodman (1973); and
T. Borcherding and R. Deacon (1972).

    -0For a complete description of the basic methodology, see Ladd, Yinger
et al. (1986). A similar methodology based on Massachusetts communities is
described in K. Bradbury et al. (1984).

9 in H.F. Ladd, J. Yinger et al. (1986).

    ]-4That is, (b1—d1) and (b2—d2) from footnote 4 are positive.

    ]-5Furthermore, if it typically costs the city more on a per capita basis
to provide the shifted service than it costs other municipalities within the
jurisdiction assuming the responsibility, overlying taxes may rise by less
than $10 per capita; hence, the net increase in the property tax base may be
slightly greater.
