What Really Happened During the Glorious Revolution?

                                              ABSTRACT

The English Glorious Revolution of 1688-89 is one of the most famous instances of ‘institutional’
change in world history which has fascinated scholars because of the role it may have played in creating
an environment conducive to making England the first industrial nation. This claim was most forcefully
advanced by North and Weingast yet the existing literature in history and economic history dismisses
their arguments. In this paper we argue that North and Weingast were entirely correct in arguing that
the Glorious Revolution represented a critical change in institutions. In addition, and contrary to the
claims of many historians, most of the things they claimed happened, for example parliamentary sovereignty,
did happen. However, we argue that they happened for reasons different from those put forward by
North and Weingast. We show that rather than being an instance of a de jure ‘re-writing the rules’,
as North and Weingast argued, the Glorious Revolution was actually an interlinked series of de facto
institutional changes which came from a change in the balance of power and authority and was part
of a broader reorientation in the political equilibrium of England. Moreover, it was significant for the
economy not because it solved a problem of credible commitment, but for two other reasons. First,
because the institutional changes it led to meant that party political ministries, rather than the king’s
private advisors, now initiated policy. Second, because these ministries were dominated by Whigs
with a specific program of economic modernization.

                                         I. Introduction
       “In many vital matters the reign of William the Third marked a dividing line between ancient

and modern ways,” observed the financial journalist W. A. Steel in the pages of Macmillan’s

Magazine, in the late nineteenth century. It was in that reign, he noted, that the English “gave a

parliamentary basis to the monarchy, established the power of the House of Commons, and

originated the idea of a homogeneous cabinet and a responsible ministry, laying thus the foundations

of our political liberty.” The English lay the foundations for future economic growth during that

reign as well, one illustration of which was “the clear understanding and steady prudence of the men

who established a system of banking which in its leading features has seen little essential change

from that time to the present.”4 In the view of this confident late Victorian the Glorious Revolution

had started the process that would make Britain into the first modern nation.

       This account of the decisive and innovative nature of the Glorious Revolution has long been

disputed by specialists in both political and economic history. Scholars across the ideological and

methodological spectrum have chimed in with a single voice. The Revolution of 1688, they all claim,

was an act of recovery and conservation rather than one of innovation. The purpose of the

Revolution of 1688-89, argues J. R. Jones, “was restorative and conservationist.” The

revolutionaries in England, he affirms, “did not aim, like the dominant revolutionaries in France a

century later, at transforming government, the law, society, and changing the status of all individuals

who composed the nation.” John Morrill proclaims that “the Sensible Revolution of 1688-89 was a

conservative revolution.” 1688-89 “was a ‘glorious revolution’ – in the seventeenth century sense of

that word,” concurs Jonathan Scott, “because at last it restored, and secured, after a century of

troubles, what remained salvageable of the Elizabethan church and state.” Hugh Trevor-Roper notes

that since the Revolution “was essentially defensive, the product of determined resistance to

innovation, it too was necessarily conservative.”5 Harry Dickinson remarks that “the latest works on

the Glorious Revolution agree that it was a conservative settlement.” “Most scholars have reached a

consensus,” chimes in Kathleen Wilson, “that the Revolution was largely an episode in patrician

politics, unrelentingly ‘conservationist’ in ideological, political and social effect.”6

        This notion that the Revolution of 1688 was conservative, that it did little to change either

the political arrangements or the economic trajectory of England, is widely accepted by economic

historians as well. Gregory Clark suggests that the fact that interest rates did not fall discontinuously

after 1688 demonstrates that “secure private property rights existed in England at least as early as

1600.” In fact, he argues that the increase in taxation after 1688 meant that “The Glorious

Revolution had an immediate negative effect” on economic growth and that none of the political

events of the 17th century had any impact on total factor productivity.7 Others, such as Nathan

Sussman and Yishay Yafeh, follow Clark in seeing the interest rate evidence as demonstrating that

the Glorious Revolution had no impact on either financial development or the economy and

Stephen Quinn has argued that government borrowing after 1688 even drove up interest rates thus

discouraging private investment.8 The idea that the Glorious Revolution made government

financial policy more credible has been dismissed by Anne Murphy who insists that “the financial

promises of the post-Glorious Revolution government were no more credible than those of

previous Stuart monarchs.”9 The latest interpretation of the British industrial revolution by Robert

Allen is similarly dismissive of the role of 1688. Allen addresses the view that it was “the Glorious

Revolution of 1688 that consolidated parliamentary ascendancy, limited royal prerogatives and

secured private property … supposedly … [creating] a favorable climate for investment that made

the Industrial Revolution possible.” But he concludes that this view has “some weaknesses.”

Interest rates, he notes, did not fall immediately after 1688 suggesting that there was no real change

in the financial environment, that property rights had long been secure and taxes rose which was bad

for incentives. Allen also points out the lack of a mechanism leading from 1688 to the industrial

revolution or as he puts it “it was a long stretch from the excise tax on beer ... to Watt’s invention of

the separate condenser.”10

       In the midst of this emerging consensus, this view that the Revolution of 1688 mattered little,

Douglass North and Barry Weingast published their pathbreaking “Constitutions and Commitment”

essay in the pages of the Journal of Economic History. In many ways North and Weingast were

reviving the late nineteenth century interpretation espoused by Steel and many Whig radicals before

him. North and Weingast, however, added a good deal. Whereas the older story insisted that there

were fundamental changes, North and Weingast offer an account of why these changes took place

and they provided a new mechanism linking these changes to subsequent economic growth. They

argued that “institutions played a necessary role in making possible economic growth and political

freedom.”11

        In this essay we re-visit North and Weingast’s argument and the evidence supporting it. We

argue that North and Weingast were correct in their belief that the Revolution of 1688 was a

decisive turning point in the political and economic history of England (and later Britain)12. However,

we suggest that the causal account provided by North and Weingast is not substantiated by what

actually happened in the wake of the Revolution. They characterized the Glorious Revolution as a

change in the de jure institutions, alternatively ‘formal’ institutions, specifically emphasizing how this

constrained the future actions of the king. In fact, the Revolution Settlement actually established

very few new de jure rules or rights. Its only clear innovative characteristic – the exclusion of

Catholics from the throne – appears to have very few long-term political or economic implications.

Nevertheless, important institutional changes did take place. Rather than being de jure, the most

significant of these were de facto, alternatively ‘informal’, in the sense that they emerged from in the

context of a large change in the English political equilibrium which they greatly helped to

consolidate and reinforce. This was important for the economy, but for different reasons than those

proposed by North and Weingast.

   We make no detailed attempt to defend this point here though we do suggest what we believe are

                           II. North and Weingast’s Argument

        What then were the institutional innovations that in North and Weingast’s view led to a

transformation in England’s political and economic fortunes? They start with the premise that the

key impediment to economic success in the early modern period was that monarchies faced a

commitment problem. Although it would have been advantageous for property rights to be secure

monarchs could not commit themselves to respect property rights. This severely undermined

people’s incentives to invest. The inability to commit caused inefficiencies in a variety of contexts.

For instance, the monarch often needed to borrow to finance wars, but could not because he could

not commit to repay those that lent him money. This commitment problem could potentially have

been solved in different ways. North and Weingast (1989, 804) note “A ruler can establish such

commitment in two ways. One is by setting a precedent of “responsible behavior,” appearing to be

committed to a set of rules that he or she will consistently enforce. The second is by being

constrained to obey a set of rules that do not permit leeway for violating commitments. We have

very seldom observed the former … The latter story is, however, the one we tell.” For North and

Weingast behavioral changes without institutional constraints are extremely unlikely to solve the

commitment problem.

        The view that North and Weingast develop is that the Glorious Revolution represented a

change in institutions which “altered the incentives of government actors in a manner desired by the

winner’s of the Revolution” (804). By changing the ‘rules of the game’ that determined the costs and

benefits of different actions by the king, the Glorious Revolution solved the problem of credibility

because it was either not feasible or desirable for the king to renege on commitments after 1688.

The Revolution of 1688 led to a “fundamental redesign of the fiscal and governmental institutions”

which was mostly motivated by a desire to gain “control over the exercise of arbitrary and

confiscatory power by the Crown” (804). The “Revolution settlement,” they claim, “restructured the


                                                   6
society’s political institutions.” The Revolution, they imply, did not rely on a ruler “appearing to be

committed to a set of rules that he or she will consistently enforce” (804) – i.e. virtuous behavior –

but rather “constrained” the ruler “to obey a set of rules that do not permit leeway for violating

commitments.”

        More specifically North and Weingast emphasize three “main features of the institutional

revolution”. The first is parliamentary supremacy and a “permanent role for Parliament” (816) and a

situation where “the Crown no longer called or disbanded Parliament at its discretion alone.”

Second, Parliament gained central role in financial matters with the Crown kept on a short leash and

Parliament gained “the never-before-held right to audit how the government had expended its

funds.” (816) Third, royal prerogative powers “were substantially curtailed and subordinated to the

common law, and the prerogative courts (which allowed the Crown to enforce its proclamations)

were abolished” (816). In addition the “independence of the judiciary from the Crown was assured”

which judges no longer serving “at the king’s pleasure” (816).

        North and Weingast go on to emphasize that these new rules were self-enforcing because of

a credible threat of removal of any Monarch who violated them. They point out that “the conditions

which would “trigger” this threat were laid out in the Revolution Settlement, and shortly afterwards

the Declaration of Rights” (816). They also note that at the same time 1688 did not create the

opposite problem of parliamentary tyranny since “the institutional structure that evolved after 1688

did not provide incentives for Parliament to replace the Crown and itself engage in similarly

“irresponsible” behavior.” (804) In essence a balance of power emerged.

        These new institutions served to “limit economic intervention and allow private rights and

markets to prevail in large segments of the economy” (808). They had many ramifications, for

instance they “significantly raised the predictability of government” (819).




                                                   7
                                 III. What Really Happened?

        Did the Revolution Settlement of 1689 instantiate the institutional changes that North and

Weingast have stipulated? Did the Revolution Settlement guarantee parliamentary supremacy, allow

Parliament for the first time to audit governmental spending, establish the supremacy of the

common law, offer a new credible threat of removal against the king for malfeasance, and

significantly raise the predictability of government?

        Consider first parliamentary supremacy. Contemporaries and subsequent commentators

have all noted that from 1689 onwards parliament has met every year. “We were” by 1700, recalled

the Whig Bishop of Salisbury Gilbert Burnet, “become already more than half a commonwealth;

since the government was plainly in the House of Commons, who met since once a year, and as long

as they thought fit.”13 Julian Hoppit notes that “the Glorious revolution marked a sea change in the

meetings of parliament.”14 “After 1689 there were sessions every year without fail,” Mark Knights

points out, “and each session lasted longer, averaging 112 days, almost double the Restoration

figure.” And the post-revolutionary parliament had a much larger set of legislative achievements.

The average parliamentary session between 1689 and 1714 passed over twice the number of statutes

than had sessions before the accession of William and Mary.15

        Profound as this change was, it is difficult to maintain, as North and Weingast have, that

new institutions contained within the Revolution Settlement constrained the crown to call

parliament more regularly let alone annually. The Declaration of Rights, that document so central to

the Revolution Settlement, merely stipulated that “Parliaments ought to be held frequently and

suffered to sit.”16 Even this was no new development, as many contemporary commentators were

well aware. In Edward III’s reign, for example, parliament had passed a statute that called for

Parliament to “be holden every year, or oftener if need be.”17 At the time of the Revolution, one

Whig recalled in the 1730s, it was not judged “necessary, to the security and preservation of the

subjects’ liberty” to insist on annual parliaments, much less elections every year or three years.”18 In

the Bill of Rights, concurred Archibald Hutcheson two decades earlier, “among that long catalogue

of grievances which precede the said declaration, there is not the least mention made of want of

frequent elections, but only that parliament ought to be free.”19

        The Revolution Settlement was no more innovative with respect to financial accountability.

The 1624 Subsidy Act had included a financial oversight clause that was triggered in 1625. The

Long Parliament successfully implemented a variety of forms of financial oversight, establishing the

Committee of Accounts in 1644. After the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, Charles II was

forced to accept a new commission of accounts in 1667 that was explicitly modeled on the 1644

commission. After 1688, the government chose – but was not required to – provide the House of

Commons with an annual estimate of its expenditures, though the Commons did create a statutary

commission of accounts in 1691.20

        There was also no new legislation enjoining the supremacy of the common law at the

Revolution. Again the Declaration of Rights did proclaim that “the commission for creating the late

court of Commissioners for Ecclesiastical Causes, and all other commissions and courts of like

nature, are illegal and pernicious.”21 But this was merely a restatement of old law. Parliamentary

legislation in 1641 had eliminated the Courts of Star Chamber and High Commission, forbidding the

future creation of prerogative courts.22 The Revolution Settlement, in the view of its more fervent

defenders, had not created new legislative constraints upon the crown. What had changed, was

Parliament’s ability to enforce already existing laws. The English had long held many “ancient

liberties,” recalled Colley Cibber who had taken up arms in 1688, but they did not have “a real being,

before the Revolution.”23

        Naturally James II’s dramatic political demise in the Winter of 1688-89 did provide a

warning to future monarchs. But for English kings this was a refresher course, not a new lesson.

James II’s father, Charles I, had not only lost his throne, but his head on 30 January 1649 for his

alleged malfeasance in office. James II’s brother, Charles II, had faced innumerable rebellions, and a

real threat of civil war in 1678-1681. And, of course, English political upheavals in the fifteenth

century, so lovingly described in William Shakespeare’s history plays, surely did not teach kings they

were invincible. James II’s deposition was indeed a stern warning. But it was hardly a new warning.

        Far from making government more predictable, the Revolution of 1688 instantiated one of

the most intensely polarized and unstable period in English and then British history. The

Revolution gave birth to the rage of party. “Whig and Tory are as of old implacable,” commented

the poet and diplomat Matthew Prior in the 1690s.24 “The heats and animosities grow everyday

higher in England,” William Blathwayt wrote to his fellow Whig George Stepney: “parties very much

animated against one another.”25 The British were “a nation so divided into parties,” wrote the

politically enigmatic former paymaster of the Queen’s forces James Brydges in 1714, “that no one is

allowed any good quality by the opposite side.”26 Party divisions cut deeply into British society.

Party politics was not a game played only by a rarified metropolitan elite. “If an Englishman

considers the great ferment into which our political world is thrown at present, and how intensely it

is heated in all its parts,” the Whig journalist and future secretary of state Joseph Addison suggested

in 1711, “he cannot suppose it will cool again in less than three hundred years.”27 Robert

Molesworth thought that the party divisions accentuated after the Revolution would “last as long

amongst us as those of Guelf and Gibelline did in Italy.”28 “A man is no sooner in England, he

cannot set his foot over the border,” agreed Daniel Defoe in his Review, “but he falls a party-

making, a dividing, a caballing.”29 “The people of England, unhappily divided in their notions and

in their politics,” chimed in the Church of England cleric Arthur Ashley Sykes, “that all and every

step approved by one side is for that very reason disapproved by the other.”30 “The general division

of the British nation is into Whigs and Tories,” concluded Addison, “there being very few, if any,

who stand neuters in the dispute, without ranging themselves under one of these denominations.”31

         These party conflicts were not the staid, or ritualized contests, of twenty-first century

industrial democracies. “It is most certain that no nation under heaven is so unhappy by means of

our intestine quarrels and divisions,” asserted one English pamphleteer reflecting on a plethora of

comment by European observers, “we hate one another, and are ready to cut one another’s

throats.”32 This was no hyperbole; no rhetorical flourish. George Smalridge, the Tory Bishop of

Bristol, thought there was “no other way of deciding the present quarrel between the parties” than

by “a Civil War.”33 In fact, far from making government more stable and predictable, the

Revolution ushered in an age of remarkable instability. There were aborted rebellions in 1692, 1694,

1696, 1704, 1708 and 1722, and an all-out civil war in 1715. Even when elections generated

relatively peaceful ministerial changes the financial markets took a beating. When the Tories took

office in 1710, for example, Whig financiers refused to offer loans to the new government, setting

off an international financial crisis.34 The result was that foreign governments and domestic

investors alike learned to be wary of radical policy shifts after each and every British election. The

effect of party strife was not predictability but its opposite. “Our inconsistency in the pursuit of

schemes,” concluded Joseph Addison, “has as bad an influence on our domestic as on our foreign

affairs.”35

         While North and Weingast were right to insist on a radical change in English political

behavior after 1688 – contemporaries echo their views that something profound had indeed

changed – the mechanisms they have highlighted cannot have been the cause. Nothing in the

Declaration of Rights, or in the Revolution Settlement of 1689, specified that parliament meet every

year, created a new method for parliament to audit royal spending, provided new guarantees for the

supremacy of common law courts, or provided new credible threats of removal against miscreant

rulers. Nor did the Settlement instantiate more stable or predictable governments. The causes of

England’s revolutionary transformation must be sought elsewhere.



                                   IV. Evidence of Change

        While North and Weingast may incorrectly specify the mechanisms generating England’s

remarkable economic and political transformation in the late seventeenth century, they are right to

believe that something changed. Upon reviewing a range of economic statistics from the

seventeenth century, Sir Robert Walpole’s economic advisor John Crookshanks concluded that after

the Revolution “the trade and interest of England had more security and encouragement than in all

the preceding reigns.” There was, he said, “a Masterly Genius presiding for the advantage of

England.”36 The most obvious and most easily documented changes are in the political and

legislative arena. We have already mentioned one very significant change, after 1688 parliament met

every year. Figure 1 illustrates the significance of this by plotting the number of days per year

between 1660 and 1715. Though early on after the Restoration Charles II did summon parliament

and parliament sat frequently at very contentious times like the exclusion crisis of the late 1670s the

picture shows a distinct structural change after 1688. Figure 2, using data compiled by Julian Hoppit

shows another very significant innovation after 1688, the volume of legislation that parliament

produced accelerated rapidly. This legislation dealt with many things that were important for the

                                                   13
economy. For example, soon after the Glorious Revolution the first Calico Act (1701) was passed to

protect the English textile industries. Other important legislation had the consequence of allowing

large reorganizations of property rights which greatly facilitated not just the rational use of farm land

via enclosures but also sped up the construction of infrastructure, particularly the spread of canals

and turnpike roads. Figure 3 using data put together by Dan Bogart illustrates that the increase in

transportation legislation after 1688 did not just result in spilt ink. It also resulted in a rapid

expansion of the transportation network.37

        After the Revolution Parliament, for the first time, became a primarily legislative body. This

gave a very different dynamic to policymaking. One way of seeing this is the escalation of petitioning

after 1688. Figure 4, based on information compiled from the Journal of the House of Commons,

shows part of this. This figure records petitions received by the House per year and within all

petitions identifies how many of them had some political economy content. We count a petition as

having had political economic content if it concerned anything relating to the economic well being

of the country, including petitions from any professional groups (brewers, weavers) merchant

petitions, petitions over land and transportation - building a harbor or road, and into the 18th

century, payment of army arrears. Many petitions focused on the economy, for example, attacks on

monopolies took place via intense petitioning campaigns and parliament was responsive to these

campaigns.38 The Figure shows vividly the take-off in petitioning after 1688 reflecting the new locus

of authority and decision-making in British politics.

        Critics of the thesis that the Glorious Revolution was an important change have focused on

the two areas which North and Weingast themselves emphasized. The first is the stability of

property rights and the second the interest rate evidence. We largely agree that 1688 did not change

the security of property rights. The earl of Nottingham, no Jacobite, pointed out that “the liberties

and property of the subject were as little infringed in the reign of King James as is in any other since

the conquest except only in matters of religion” and in the arena of secular property little had

changed since 1688.39 But the fact that property rights were secure did not mean that economic

policy was such as to promote economic growth. With respect to the interest rate evidence we

believe that North and Weingast were themselves mistaken in pointing to falling interest rates as a

key implication of their view. They deduced this hypothesis from the idea that default risk would

reduce the supply of loans at any given interest rate, thus tending to increase the equilibrium interest

rate relative to a situation with lower risk of default. However, the financial world of Charles II and

James II was not one characterized by a competitive market where the interest rate changed to

equilibrate the supply and demand for loans. Copious evidence in fact suggests that credit was

rationed to the Stuart kings, since there was indeed a severe risk that they would default. With credit

rationing the interest rate does not move to clear the market for loans. In financial terms what 1688

did was to relax this rationing of credit, but such relaxation should not show up in terms of lower

interest rates but rather greater quantities of loans. That this was indeed the case is illustrated by

Figure 5. That figure shows that while the Stuart kings were able to issue little debt, the monarchy

after 1688 was able to borrow extensively. We believe therefore that the interest rate evidence is a

red herring. A final telling piece of evidence that things changed after 1688 is represented in Figure 6

which shows government tax receipts per-capita between 1490 and 1815. This figure shows the

rapid expansion of the English/British state after the Glorious Revolution. The idea that the

revolution was “conservative” or “restorative” cannot be reconciled with this evidence of such a

structural change in fiscal policy and the size of the state, as of course it cannot be reconciled with

the structural shift in the meeting of Parliament and the outpouring of new legislation.



                                    V. Why Things Changed

        Why did these changes happen? Why did English men and women turn to Parliament as a

source of redress so much more frequently after 1688? Why did Parliament legislate with so much

more frequency after 1688? Why did Parliament sit twice as long on average after 1688?

        The answer, we suggest, was not that the English parliamentary classes agreed to “some

credible restrictions on the state’s ability to manipulate economic rules to the advantage of itself and

its constituents.” The English did not in the wake of the Revolution agree to “limit economic

intervention” (North and Weingast, 808). Instead, the changes after 1688 were caused by two inter-

related factors. Most fundamentally, the Glorious Revolution did lead to a significant shift in power

and authority to Parliament. This change set in motion a set of de facto institutional changes with

very important consequences. These included Parliamentary sovereignty and changed the locus of

decision-making with respect to both economic and foreign policy. Nevertheless, these changes in




                                                    16
themselves would not have amounted to what they did without the rise of the Whig party and the

fact that it, and not the Tory party, dominated the newly empowered Parliament.

        To understand what went on and what didn’t go on during and after the Revolution of 1688

it is crucial to put it in the context of the entire way the political equilibrium was changing in

England during this period. After two decades of remarkable economic growth in the later

seventeenth century, England was becoming a more dynamic, more urban, and more commercial

society. The Venetian Resident Alberti reported in the 1670s “That the City of London has never

had so much trade as now.” “We have increased more in trade” since 1665, noted John Houghton

in his new economically-oriented periodical, “than it is possible any nation has done in like space.”

This impression of substantial late seventeenth-century English economic growth was confirmed by

more statistically-minded contemporaries as well as later scholars.40

       The newly dynamic economy shifted the social balance. Manufacturers, urban dwellers, and

colonial traders became much more wealthy. Most thought that as England became a nation of

tradesmen and shopkeepers, there had been a shift of political power. John Aubrey was convinced

that “the balance of the government [is] quite altered, and put into the hands of the common

people.” Dr. Charles Aldworth, a fellow of the ill-fated Magdalen College, confided to his

commonplace book that recently “the commons” had “got the riches of the nation in their hands by

trade” and had thus become “a match both for Kings and Lords.” James II’s friend and loyal

supporter Sir Edward Hales knew that as a result of “the great increase in trade since Henry VIIIth’s

time,” the English people had achieved “an equality of riches” and therefore power. Sir Henry

Capel argued in Parliament that political trust was placed where “there is most property,” and to him

it was clear that “the property of England was in the Commons.” Significantly, this was the

conclusion of memorandum circulated widely in James II’s court in 1685. “Trade and negotiation

has infected the whole kingdom, and no man disdains to marry or mix with it,” the author of the

memorandum contended, “by this means the very genius of the people is altered, and it will in the

end be the interest of the crown to proportion its maxims of power suitable to this new nature come

among us.” A variety of arithmetical calculations proved unequivocally that “trade is much the over-

balance of the wealth of the nation, and consequently must influence the power for good or ill.”41 A

large proportion of those who enjoyed this newfound political power were Whigs. The Whig party,

formed in 1679-1680, demonstrated its newfound political might in its sophisticated campaign to

exclude the Duke of York, the future James II, from the throne. So powerful had they become, that

many thought England was on the brink of Civil War in 1681. On the eve of the Revolution, then,

rapid social change had altered the balance of property and therefore the political equilibrium in

England.

        James II responded dynamically to the changing sociology of power. He decided to shift the

economic basis of royal power. Whereas previous English monarchs had based their authority on

being the largest landowners in England, James realized this was an increasingly fragile economic

foundation. James decided that England’s economic future lay in the East and West Indies. This

overseas element was crucial since the scope for unilaterally increasing taxation – taxation on a class

whose rents were steadily declining -- within England was limited. To do so without the consent of

parliament was impossible. Though James sought to pack parliament with his supporters to pass his

religious legislation, he aimed to secure a permanent increase in his revenue by expanding and

rationalizing England’s overseas empire. He created the Dominions of New England and the West

Indies, and sought with the aid of the director of the East India Company, Josiah Child, to create a

Dominion of India based in Bombay. This new territorial empire, he believed, would allow him to

split up the world with his French cousin Louis XIV. Louis XIV would rule over Europe, while

James would have an English overseas empire. This new empire would fill James II’s coffers with a

minimum of parliamentary oversight. It was both the domestic and imperial projects that the

revolutionaries cut short in 1688.

        The immediate proximate outcome of the Glorious Revolution was that James’s programs of

absolutism both at home and abroad failed. William and Mary abandoned James II’s grand plans to

build a self-financing centralized empire. However, William and Mary were not constrained to

abandon James II’s grand imperial vision by the Bill of Rights or any other statutory element of the

Revolution Settlement. Nothing in the Revolution Settlement stipulated the demise of the




                                                  19
Dominion of the New England or the West Indies; nothing demanded that Josiah Child’s plans for a

vast territorial empire in India be abandoned.

        William and Mary also surrendered the right to collect customs for life. Since the reign of

Henry IV, English kings had been granted the customs income for life on their accession. James II

started to collect the customs before being granted it and announced “That some might possibly

suggest that it were better to feed and supply him from time to time only, out of their inclination to

frequent Parliaments; but that that, would be but a very improper Method to take with him.”42

Persuaded by James II’s promises not to alter the constitution in church and state, both Commons

and Lords went along with it. In 1689, attitudes had changed. William wanted the customs for life

but he only got it for four years.

        Another interesting example of William and Mary’s tacit surrender of rights comes from

reduced use of the royal prerogative. Though the monarchy had lost the prerogative courts in the

1640s this had not stopped Charles II and James II using the royal prerogative to establish the

Ecclesiastical Commission. And both sons of Charles I had also intervened in the judiciary to

remove judges whose decisions they did not like. Yet William did not. Consider the seminal case of

Nightingale versus Bridges in 1689 where Justice Holt ruled that overseas trading monopolies could

not be created by the royal prerogative but only by parliament.43 This was a significant blow to the

power of the monarchy but William did nothing.

        Why did these changes occur? Why did William (and Mary) accede to demands that James II

had refused? The answer cannot simply lie in the personality of William III. William was no closet

republican. In fact, he had come to come to power in the United Provinces in 1672 after a wave of

popular anti-republican riots. He emerged as the Stadholder, or political leader of the United

Provinces, only after the republican leaders John and Cornelius De Witt had been publicly lynched

by Orangist (monarchist) mobs. William was, like his uncle James II, a Stuart with every reason to

want a strong monarchy.

        Scholars have treated the evident increase in parliamentary authority as a non-problem.

Some have argued that in the wake of the Revolution, the parliamentary classes agreed to keep the

king poor and it was this that was the basis of parliament’s supremacy. Others have asserted that the

English commitment to war after 1688 made parliamentary dominance inevitable.

        Clayton Roberts has most forcefully developed the view that Parliamentary power was based

on keeping the monarchy short of money even in peacetime. Contemporaries certainly made similar

arguments. For example, while the new monarchs “pressed” to have the customs settled for life, “it

was taken up as a general maxim, that a revenue for a certain and short term, was the best security

that the nation could have for frequent parliaments.”44 This was no retrospective rationalization. A

wide variety of members of parliament agreed, in the wake of James II’s successful efforts to create

an absolutist imperial state, that keeping the king “poor” was the best way to “necessitate him to call

frequent parliaments.”45 Yet Roberts’ own figures demonstrate that the only reason that William’s

revenues fell short of his expenditures was because he had allowed the Hearth Tax to be abolished

in March of 1689 and because of a fall in customs revenues created by the outbreak of war with

France.46 So Williams’ financial straits were self-inflicted.

        The view that it was warfare which was the most significant determinant of parliamentary

sovereignty after 1688 has many advocates and Jennifer Carter sums up this perspective by saying

“In the 1690’s the circumstances of the war gave Parliament an unexpected advantage over the

Crown because the government needed money, and the political climate suggested to members of

Parliament that they impose various limits on the powers of the Crown not contemplated in 1689.”47

In essence this view is that the desire of William III to conduct a large-scale war with France meant

that he had to call Parliament every year in order that they pass a Supply Bill. It was this that

empowered Parliament and allowed it to introduce such innovations as auditing the King’s accounts.

        Neither of these views is entirely satisfactory. Why did William agree to the abolition of the

Hearth Tax that had brought James II an income of ₤200,000 a year? William himself told Sir

George Savile the Marquis of Halifax that those who had persuaded him to give up the Hearth Tax

wanted a commonwealth something William himself clearly did not want.48 Why did he commit

himself to fighting a war that would significantly constrain his freedom of action? English kings had

fought wars for centuries without diminishing their powers. Louis XIV was not forced by the Nine

Years War or the War of the Spanish Succession to cede much of his political authority. Why did

the Nine Years War and the War of the Spanish Succession have radically different political effects

in England? The answer to these questions is to be found in the party politics of the later

seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

        While many Whigs and Tories agreed in late 1688 to put an end to James II’s absolutist

imperialism, they had radically different visions of what to put in its place. The Tories wanted to

dismantle the English fiscal-military state that had been growing by leaps and bounds since the

1640s. The Whigs wanted a big and interventionist state that would serve the interests of the new

urban and manufacturing classes. The Whigs, in other words, wanted a state run by themselves and

in their interests rather than an absolutist state. The Whigs, like most revolutionaries, wanted to

capture the state. On most issues William III’s sympathies were with the Tories. But, William’s

highest priority was to limit the growing power of Louis XIV. Only the Whigs were willing and able

to provide William the resources necessary to fight the world’s greatest power.

        From the outset the Whigs had wanted to go to war with France. The party began to

coalesce in the later 1670s, in part, to compel Charles II to go to war with Louis XIV. Andrew

Marvell, John Locke, Algernon Sidney, the 1st earl of Shaftesbury, William Lord Russell – the first

generation of Whig politicians – had all been passionate Francophobes. Louis XIV, the Whigs

believed, was trying to achieve a universal monarchy. He was trying to become a world hegemon.

Central to Louis XIV’s strategy, they argued, was to take over the world’s trade. This was why Jean-

Baptiste Colbert had done so much to jump-start French industry. This was why the French had

established high tariff barriers to exclude English manufactures from much of Europe. In order to

make his subjects “sole merchants of all trades” Louis XIV placed “all manner of discouragements

upon all foreign factories and merchants by difficulty in their dispatches, delays in point of justice,

subjecting them to foreign duties and seizures, not suffering them to be factors in the French or any

other nation but their own, and in case of death to have their estates seized as aliens.” The net

effect of these measures was predictably devastating for English merchants. England, which

continued to import French luxury items without the large protectionist imposts that Louis XIV

placed on English goods, began to run up a huge trade deficit. The result was “that in few years (if

some timely expedient be not applied) all the money of this nation will be drawn into France.” The

conclusion was inescapable: “the French doth deal far more unkindly with us than the Dutch.”49

        War against France was a central aim of the revolutionaries and William had, since the 1670s,

led the European struggle against Louis XIV. Even before William and his entourage had reached

London in December 1688 -- even before it was clear that William and Mary would be offered the

crown -- English men and women throughout the nation were convinced that they would finally go

to war against France, that they would finally engage in the struggle against the aspiring universal

monarch Louis XIV. The news of the Revolution “will be most of all menacing in France,” thought

Sir Robert Southwell, “all our thunderbolts will light there besides what may fall from the rest of

Europe. They have great desolations and inhumanities to account for and it looks as if Heaven were

now disposed to send an avenger.” “This sudden revolution of affairs,” the Levant Company

informed Sir William Trumbull, “may occasion a speedy breech with France.” The Dutch

Ambassador Van Citters learned that “the City in the next Parliament will very strongly insist upon a

war with France.” The directors of the East India Company reported in early December 1688 that

“war against France” was “the most general inclination of the English Protestants of all qualities and

degrees.” John Locke thought that no one in England “can sleep” until “they see the nation settled

interest of Europe.”50

       Not all wars needed to be so expensive. Not all wars required a financial revolution to

finance them. But, the Whigs argued, a war against the world’s greatest power required remarkable

sacrifices. Such a war required new sorts of taxes and new sorts of financial instruments that could

tap into the new wealth generated by the remarkable economic advances of the later seventeenth

century. The Whigs maintained that the war was necessary whatever the cost. Sir John Lowther

could not but admit the “extraordinary charge” of the war, but he pointed out this was because

England had never before gone to war “with so potent a prince as the French King.” “I have always

been of opinion that the French king is the most likely to trouble England,” the ancient Whig

William Sacheverell testified, “and I doubt not but gentlemen will give a million in trade” to support

the war effort. The Gloucestershire Whig and former political exile Sir John Guise responded to

Tory complaints about the cost of the war by insisting in November 1691 that “when I voted for the

war against France, I was in earnest, and I have not abated since the war.” “The taxes indeed fall

heavy upon everybody,” wrote Anne Pye whose husband Sir Robert Pye had taken up arms in the

Parliamentary cause and again in the revolutionary cause in 1688, “but considering the slavery we are

freed from, I wonder people complain.” “We must do anything rather than be slaves to the French,”

argued succinctly the Whiggish absentee Barbados planter Edward Littleton.51

        The Whig war strategy was an expensive one. They believed that the only way to defeat

Louis XIV, to put an end to his aspirations for world hegemony, was to defeat him on land in

Europe and at sea. To defeat Louis XIV, who had an army of over 200,000 men at his disposal

required an unprecedented exertion from the English state. It required a financial revolution. The

Whigs felt the only way to meet the costs would be to support growth in the manufacturing sector.

This was why the Whigs insisted upon the repeal of the hearth tax – a tax that hit the manufacturing

sector the hardest. This was why the Whigs created the Bank of England against stiff Tory

opposition. The Bank of England, as opposed to the Tory Land Bank, was designed not only to

provide loans to the government to support the war, but also to provide low interest loans to

manufacturers.52

       The Tories, by contrast, wanted a very different kind of war. While they detested the

Francophilic policies of James II, they did not feel as threatened by Louis XIV’s project to dominate

Europe. Perhaps because they were less dependent on European markets for their livelihoods, the

Tories wanted a short and cheap war that would have as its fundamental aim the prevention of a

Jacobite restoration. For Tories the war was always about defending the regime change in the British

Isles. The struggle on the continent was a peripheral concern. So, for Tories like Colonel John

Granville, it was clear that “of your enemies, your chiefest, [is] King James.” Unsurprisingly, given

this assessment, Tories were always far more interested in the course of the struggle in Scotland and

Ireland than in the European war with Louis XIV.53

       Tories quickly seized on the immense cost of the war and the massive interruption in

English trade. The Nine Years War was in fact larger than any previous English military

commitment. The army ballooned to almost double what it had been under James II, and the naval

forces were much more numerous as well. In all, England had on average over 115,000 men in arms

during the Nine Years War. The average military expenditure was almost £5.5 million, or about

74% of the annual state budget. The average annual tax revenue during the war was about double

what it had been before 1689. It was these kinds of numbers that made Tories and their political

allies quick to insist that the country could simply not afford a massive continental war. “If you

make not an end of the war this year,” insisted one of the most prominent Tories Sir John Trevor in

November 1689, “I know not how we can supply another.” “I do believe that we cannot supply the

war above a year longer,” chimed in the ancient and quirky William Garraway who had once again

fallen in line with the Tories. The diehard Tory Sir Edward Seymour told the House of Commons

that it was “mistaken” to believe that “England was in a condition to carry on the war for

themselves and the confederates.”54

       For Tories, the remedy was increasingly clear: England should sever its continental

commitments and adopt a blue-water policy. Such a strategy, the Tories argued, would be much less

expensive, would allow England to protect its trade, and would obviate the necessity of relying on

untrustworthy and perfidious allies. Sir Thomas Clarges had long insisted that “the strength of

England consists in our navy.” In the 1690s Clarges continued to defend a blue-water strategy in the

war against France. By sending “all our force into Flanders” where Louis XIV was “irresistible” the

only outcome would be to “ruin England.” “The most natural way” for England to fight the war,

Clarges suggested, was “by sea.” The English should become “masters of America” rather than

dominant in Europe. “As we are an island,” Clarges pointed out, “if the French have all the

seventeen provinces [of the Dutch Republic and the Spanish Netherlands], and we are superior at

sea, we may still be safe.” England’s “security,” agreed Sir Edward Seymour, was “to be found only

in the fleet.” The new Tory ally Robert Harley agreed “that the sea must be our first care, or else we

are all prisoners to our island.” Sir Richard Temple, who was a committed Tory after 1689,

believed passionately that “it imports this monarchy to have a vigorous militia at sea both for

defense, offense and commerce.” A land army, he thought, was unnecessary for England. Instead

of alliances and conquests on the continent, Temple argued, “the enlargement of trade and

Dominion of the Sea ought to be the proper object of our Empire.” Tory advocates of a blue-water

strategy had coalesced around the notion “that England is not much concerned in the general fate of

Europe,” “that the sea which divides us from the rest of the world is our safeguard against all

dangers from abroad,” and “that when we engage in any foreign war, it is not so much for our

preservation, as to make a show of our power.”55

        The Tories consistently initiated a series of legislative projects to make it difficult to finance

the war. In 1693, for example, the Tories penned a bill, the Triennial Bill, to guarantee that

parliamentary elections would be held at least once every three years. While scholars have usually

assumed that this was part and parcel of the Whig agenda, it was not. The Whigs wanted parliament

to meet frequently both because that would make it easier for parliament to obstruct an arbitrary

king and because frequent meetings made it much easier to pass social and economic legislation,

legislation that would facilitate economic development. “It is not in the frequent elections of

Parliament, but in their frequent sitting, that our safety consists,” one Whig pamphleteer put it

pithily.56 Tories introduced the bill into the House of Commons in 1693 and eventually forced it

through because they believed no MP that had to face the electorate with any regularity would vote

new taxes. At the very least, frequent changes of administration would make it difficult to undertake

any grand and expensive projects. Frequent elections meant smaller government.57

       The Tories were not satisfied with the Triennial Bill. From 1691, the Commission of

Accounts – meant to inquire into the finances of the war – took on an increasingly Tory character.

The reasons were obvious: the Tories were interested in limiting government expenditure on the

war.58 In 1696 the Tories sought to limit the war effort by destroying the Bank of England. Harley

and Foley, the same men behind the Triennial Bill and the Commission of Public Accounts brought

in the bill to create the Land Bank and destroy the Bank of England.

        Despite Tory victories in a variety of skirmishes, the Whigs determined the direction of

English (and then British) policy in the decades following the Revolution. Whig ministers directed

the war efforts in the Nine Years War and the War of the Spanish Succession. Whig institutions --

the Bank, the Land Tax, the new East India Company, the Duke of Marlborough’s army – provided

the essential infrastructure for the war effort. Whig financiers provided loans at key moments. All

of this had profound, indeed revolutionary, social consequences. Tories were convinced that the

Whigs were the party of social revolution. Whigs supported the war, they believed, in large part

because its escalating costs and increasingly punishing taxes was destroying the landed interest.59 At

the time of the Revolution, St. John later recalled, “the moneyed interest was not yet a rival able to

cope with the landed interest, either in the nation or in Parliament.” All that had now changed, St.

John informed Orrery in 1709, because “we have now been twenty years engaged in the most

expensive wars that Europe ever saw.” “The whole burden of this charge,” St. John was sure, was

paid by “the landed interest during the whole time.” The result was that “a new interest has been

created out of their fortunes and a sort of property which was not known twenty years ago, is now

increased to be almost equal to the Terra Firma of our island.” According to St. John, “the landed

men are become poor and dispirited.”60 Tory “lands” had paid for the Whigs wars, complained The



political tool. But what Downie sees as a coalition opposed to war spending is what we and others
see as the basis of the new Tory party.
59
   The landed interest was, of course, in large part an ideological construct: see Julian Hoppit, “The
Landed Interest and the National Interest, 1660-1800,” in Hoppit ed., Parliaments, Nations and

over to money.” “If the war continues some years longer” warned the authors of this Tory

newspaper, “a landed man will be little better than a farmer at rack-rent to the army, and to the

public funds.”62 This was not, in the Tory estimation, an unintended consequence of the Nine Years

War and the War of the Spanish Succession. The cries for “supporting a common cause against

France, reducing her exorbitant power, and poising that of Europe in the public balance” were

“specious pretences” of the Whigs to allow them to pile “taxes upon taxes, and debts upon debts”

so that “a small number of families” could gain “immense wealth.” “In order to fasten wealthy

people to the New Government” the Whigs, according to The Examiner, had “proposed these

pernicious expedients of borrowing money by vast premiums, and at exorbitant interest.”63

The Whig war strategy had succeeded in turning the British social world upside down. “The effects

of frequent parliaments and of long wars,” Henry St. John mourned, was “the departing from our

old constitution and from our true interest.”64 The authors of The Examiner later drew a verbal

picture of the social revolution that had taken place. “Our streets,” they complained, “are crowded

with so many gay upstarts” that they “outshine our quality in furniture and equipage. Our English

gentry with the antiquated bodies and virtues of our forefathers, are perfectly lost in a blaze of

meteors.” This was bad enough. But Britain’s natural rulers not only faced competition in the world

of the beaux monde. They also risked being replaced. “We have seen footmen removed from

behind the coach into the inside, and the livery left off for the laced coat,” observed the authors of

The Examiner chillingly, “princes have been made out of pages, chancellors out of clerks, and the

white staff and blue ribbon bestowed as playthings upon the lackey and by-blow.”65 No wonder the

Whigs had “a rage of warring.”66

        The Tories wanted a cheap war that would make the state unnecessary. They hoped to fight

a sea war that would pay for itself. By the early eighteenth century, the Tories thought that seizing a

territorial foothold in South America and access to the fabulous wealth of the South American silver

and gold mines, would allow them to pay off the war debt and make further increases in state

finance unnecessary. Britain could once again be governed by a landed elite supported by a

territorial empire. The Whig war strategy, by contrast, required a large redistributive state. The

Whigs wanted to stop French expansionism. But they hoped to do that by prying open European

and Spanish American markets for British manufactured goods. They were happy to spend and

spend to defeat the French, especially as the expenditures would help to support new and

burgeoning British industries.67

        Had the Tories dominated politics in the decades after the Revolution, English (then British)

state and society would have looked very different. Both Whigs and Tories, it is true, were

interested in making sure that no future James IIs could come to power. Both Whigs and Tories

agreed to put an end to the possibility of royal arbitrary government. But the Tories would not have

fought a series of incredibly expensive wars against France. The Tories would not have created the

Bank of England, an institution that provided crucial loans to new manufacturing initiatives. The

Tories would not have wanted a standing parliament that could legislate over such a wide swath of

social and economic life. The Tories would not have passed the series of turnpike acts, for example,

that did so much to improve Britain’s economic infrastructure. The Tories, in effect, would have

created – or tried to create – a vast territorial empire with a remarkably small state. That this did not

happen, that the Whigs were able to seize the political initiative after 1688, had a great deal to do

with the shifts which had already taken place in the sociology of power prior to 1688.

        These arguments suggest that the right way to think of the Glorious Revolution is of a series

of inter-linked institutional changes which took place in the broader context of a re-orientation of

the political equilibrium of England. The conflict stopped in its tracks the absolutist project that had

started with Charles II and intensified with James II, but it did not just do this. It did not simply re-

create a status quo ante or constrain future kings from doing the sort of thing that Charles and

James had tried to do. Rather it led to a permanent increase the in the power and authority of

Parliament. Some like Lois Schwoerer would argue that this increased power was manifested in the

change in the oath of office the king had to make and in the fact that Parliament had changed the

order of succession, both part of the de jure process which generated the Declaration of Rights.68

Such a view would be consonant with that stressed by North and Weingast. But we have argued that

it is very difficult to tie any of the significant changes to any clauses of the Declaration or

subsequent Bill of Rights. The Glorious Revolution was not significant because it was a change in

the de jure rules, but it was important in helping to cement a change in the distribution of power in

the country. We have shown that this change were manifested in many ways, via William not trying

to assume the collection of customs for life, in the reduced use of the royal prerogative and in the

adoption of policies, such as the repeal of the hearth tax, which William clearly did not like.

        This change had very significant consequences for institutions. The emergence of

Parliamentary sovereignty changed the way that economic and foreign policy got made. Policy now

responded to different interests both inside and outside Parliament. In 1678 Parliament had tried to

make Charles II go to war. It failed. In March and April of 1689 an address to the House of

Commons urged William to go to war before he wanted to. William tried to get the address

suppressed, but Parliament now got its way.

        What enforced this de facto institutional change? It is possible that the key role here was

played by the threat of revolution “off the equilibrium path”, but we have argued that this seems too

blunt a tool to have really worked and anyway had long been present. The Revolution Settlement did

not define what constituted a violation sufficiently egregious to warrant revolt and didn’t even create

a mechanism by which parliament could constitute itself if the king failed to call it. William vetoed

laws and even prorogued parliament when it looked like it might pass legislation he didn’t like. Why

didn’t that trigger revolt? An alternative hypothesis about what made these changes self-enforcing is

that it was the juxtaposition of William’s need for financial resources and the intensified warfare

which England embarked on after 1688. But as we have argued neither the financial argument nor

war on their own seem sufficient to explain the changes. Moreover, neither mechanism would have

operated without the shift in authority to Parliament which after 1688 induced William to abolish

the Hearth Tax and called the shots on foreign policy, including the decision to initiate war. They

also would not have operated without the dominance of the Whig party which wanted an expensive

war and greatly expanded role for the state. Nevertheless, the exact nature of the changes that made

the new set of institutions self-enforcing needs a great deal of further research.

                                         VI. Conclusions

        In this paper we have argued that contrary to the consensus view of political and economic

historians, North and Weingast were correct to emphasize the importance of the Glorious

Revolution as a significant institutional change. They were right that this represented part of a

dramatic shift in the political equilibrium of England (then Britain). What they have described

imprecisely was the nature of this shift and the mechanisms via which it transformed the economy.

We have argued that the shift was not one of re-writing the de jure rules of the game, as they

characterized it, but was rather a change in the distribution of power in favor of Parliament which

had important consequences for de facto institutions. An important component of these changes

flowed from the fact that Parliament came to be dominated by the newly dynamic manufacturing

middle classes. However, the importance of this change for future economic growth did not stem

from the fact that it established a credible commitment to property rights. We agree with other

scholars that though the Stuart monarchs had attempted to intervene in the economy and judiciary,

there was not a sufficiently broad threat to property rights to hold back investment or innovation.69

We also do not believe that the Revolution was important because it led to a balance of power

between the legislature and executive or because it led to stability or a small state. Rather, the

Revolution was important because the new political equilibrium featured parliamentary sovereignty

and parliament was to be dominated by the Whig Party for the coming decades. This had several

momentous consequences. The first set flowed from parliamentary dominance itself with the

consequent switch in the nexus of authority. This led to very significant policy changes because party

political ministries, rather than the king’s private advisors, now initiated policy. Since party

ministries depended on public support to stay in power, they were necessarily more responsive to


69
  A caveat to this argument though is that had James II succeeded in his attempt to build an
absolutist state, property rights might have got a lot less secure.
