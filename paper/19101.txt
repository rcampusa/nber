                                            ABSTRACT

Medicare currently allows beneficiaries to choose between a government-run health plan and a privately-
administered program known as Medicare Advantage (MA). Because enrollment in MA is optional,
conventional observational estimates of the program's impact are potentially subject to selection bias.
To address this, we use a discontinuity in the rules governing MA payments to health plans that gives
greater payments to plans operating in counties in Metropolitan Statistical Areas with populations
of 250,000 or more. The sharp difference in payment rates at this population cutoff creates a greater
incentive for plans to increase the generosity of benefits and therefore enroll more beneficiaries in
MA in counties just above versus just below the cutoff. We find that the expansion of MA on this
margin reduces beneficiaries' rates of hospitalization and mortality.

       The welfare implications of public versus private production of publicly-financed

services have been the subject of considerable debate (Shleifer 1998). Proponents of

private production highlight the greater incentives for efficiency and greater ability to

match services to individuals' preferences generally associated with markets. Opponents

emphasize the problems associated with imperfect monitoring and the ability of private

suppliers to avoid unprofitable clients.

       This debate has become increasingly relevant as the country struggles to improve

the operation of the Medicare program. Medicare, which provides publicly-financed

health insurance to the elderly and disabled, is the second-largest (after Social Security)

and the fastest-growing piece of the federal budget. This year, Medicare spending will be

3.7% of GDP, which is forecast to rise to 5.2% of GDP by 2027 (Congressional Budget

Office 2012). While the program has been successful in improving the lives of

beneficiaries, it is also widely acknowledged to be highly inefficient, with some

estimating that 20 percent of program spending is of questionable value (Skinner, Fisher,

and Wennberg 2005).

       Medicare currently allows beneficiaries to choose between a government-run

health plan known as Traditional Medicare (TM), and privately-administered plans,

known as Medicare Advantage (MA). Enrollment in MA has grown rapidly in recent

years, now accounting for 27 percent of all beneficiaries and 22 percent of program

payments (Kaiser Family Foundation 2012). The opposing views of private versus public

production have been manifested in two distinct policy perspectives on MA. On one

hand, MA plans may be better able to encourage physicians and hospitals to manage care

appropriately, leading to lower costs and/or better health outcomes. On the other hand,

MA plans may reduce welfare, by avoiding enrollment of sicker patients, stinting on care



                                                                                              2
for sicker patients once they are enrolled, or incurring administrative costs that are

disproportionate to their benefits.

       Identifying the effects of MA on resource use and quality of care is thus of first-

order importance from the perspective of economics and national fiscal policy. But

because enrollment in MA is optional, conventional observational estimates of the

program's impact are potentially subject to selection bias. To the extent that beneficiaries

who choose MA are unobservably healthier those who choose TM, conventional

estimates of the effect of MA will represent some combination of the program's true

causal effect and unobserved differences in its patient population.

       In this paper, we offer a new approach to this problem. We use a discontinuity in

the rules governing MA payments to private health plans that gives greater payments to

plans that cover beneficiaries who live in counties that are part of Metropolitan Statistical

Areas (MSAs) with populations of 250,000 or more. The sharp difference in payment

rates at this population cutoff creates a greater incentive for plans to increase the

generosity of benefits and therefore enroll more beneficiaries in MA in counties just

above versus just below the cutoff. The induced incremental enrollment, in turn, allows

us to identify the effect of MA on the use of medical services and the quality of care for

the incremental enrollees. We find that the expansion of MA on this margin reduces

Medicare beneficiaries' rates of hospitalization and mortality.

       The paper proceeds in four parts. Part I provides background on the MA program

and a summary of the vast academic literature on the effects of public versus private

provision of publicly-financed health insurance. Part II describes our experimental

design in detail and the data that we use to investigate the effects of MA relative to TM.

Part III presents our econometric models and results, and Part IV concludes.



                                                                                             3
I.      Medicare Advantage: Background and Previous Literature

        The Medicare program has a long history of private-sector involvement (see

McGuire, Newhouse, and Sinaiko 2011 for an excellent and comprehensive review).

Private insurance plans were introduced to Medicare starting in 1985 with the goals of

expanding beneficiary choice and transferring to the Medicare program some of the

efficiencies thought to have been achieved by managed care plans in the private sector.

Enrollment in private Medicare plans has always been, and still is, optional for

beneficiaries. Those beneficiaries who choose to enroll in a private plan continue to pay

Medicare premiums to the government, equal to about 13 percent of the value of their

benefits (CMS 2011, Table I.1).     In return, they receive their coverage through (and may

pay supplemental premiums to) an MA plan. MA plans receive from Medicare a

predetermined monthly payment, adjusted for the demographic characteristics and health

status of their enrollees.

        There is a vast empirical literature that seeks to investigate the relative

performance of MA and TM. This literature has three distinct parts. The best-developed

arm compares the budget cost of MA to that of TM. The finding from this work is clear:

MA spends more than would TM to cover a similar set of beneficiaries (MedPAC

2012a). In 2011, for example, MA spent $1.10 for every dollar that would have been

spent by TM; in 2012, the comparable figure is predicted to be $1.07. This is all the

more striking since the preponderance of evidence suggests that MA enrollees are on

average healthier (MedPAC 2012b).

        However, this anomaly is by design. Medicare pays MA plans as a function of a

legislatively-determined rate called the "benchmark," and benchmarks are on average set

well above what it would cost TM to coverage a comparable population. The Affordable



                                                                                            4
Care Act (ACA) reduces MA payments, but they will still be more than TM, likely

because it is immensely popular with beneficiaries: at least some of the extra payments

to plans are passed back in the form of supplemental benefits.

       Thus this work leaves two important questions unanswered: notwithstanding

supplemental benefits, does MA consume more or less resources than TM, and is the care

it provides of higher or lower quality? Researchers have sought to address the first of

these questions by comparing rates of use of specific services available in both MA and

TM, controlling for the demographic characteristics and health status of enrollees. This

work generally finds that MA enrollees use fewer services, and experience more

appropriate use, than do their counterparts in TM. For example, Landon et al. (2012) find

that MA enrollees have fewer emergency-room visits, ambulatory surgeries, and inpatient

admissions than comparable TM enrollees. Other work examines rates of readmission to

the hospital (Lemieux et al. 2012, Cohen et al. 2012) and rates of admission for

outpatient-care-sensitive illnesses (Basu and Mobley 2012), and finds them to be lower in

MA as well.

       Comparisons of the quality of care in MA versus TM have been more mixed. On

one hand are the studies catalogued above that find lower rates of use of services in MA

typically associated with inferior care (Kruzikas et al. 2000), which points to better

quality of care in MA versus TM. Researchers have also found significantly lower

mortality in MA versus TM (Dowd et al. 2011). On the other hand have been studies

such as Keenan et al. (2009), which show that beneficiaries in MA self-report less

favorable experiences with Medicare than comparable beneficiaries in TM, although

more recent analysis by MedPAC (2012a) suggests that the gap between MA and TM

plans on this dimension is shrinking.



                                                                                           5
       Yet, the research design of all of these studies suffers from an important

limitation. They identify the effect of interest by comparing outcomes for beneficiaries

who choose MA rather than TM, controlling for the observable differences between

them. The assumption underlying this strategy -- that enrollees in MA are comparable to

those in TM, conditional on observables -- is potentially problematic. There is evidence

of favorable selection into MA on the basis of observables, and the model used to adjust

payments to MA plans on the basis of observables explains only a fraction of the

variation in beneficiaries' use of services (MedPAC 2012b). Because the unobservable

characteristics of beneficiaries are likely positively correlated with the observables, the

possibility remains that at least part of the estimated cost and quality advantage of MA

over TM is due to unobserved differences in their covered populations rather than the true

causal effects of the programs.

       In addition, some related work finds that private health plans in the government's

Medicaid program have been more costly and/or lower quality than their publicly-run

analogue. Private plans were used in the Medicaid program by some states as early as the

1970s, but expanded dramatically after the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997,

which made it possible for states to require certain beneficiaries to enroll in managed care

without obtaining a federal waiver. Two-thirds of Medicaid beneficiaries now receive

most or all of their benefits through a private plan (Kaiser Family Foundation 2012).

Duggan (2004) finds that the cost but not the quality of care increased in California

counties after versus before they switched most Medicaid beneficiaries to private plans;

Aizer, Currie, and Moretti (2007) use a similar identification strategy and find that the

phase-in of Medicaid managed care reduced the quality of prenatal care and increased the

rates of adverse birth outcomes.



                                                                                              6
       Findings from these studies of Medicaid are not necessarily generalizable. First,

the low-income populations that they examine face challenges that the broader elderly

population does not. Second, the data they use comes from California in the 1990s,

which may not reflect the current state of private health plans nationally. Third, in

California, Medicaid fee-for-service reimbursement rates (on which Medicaid managed

care payments are based) are much lower than Medicare rates (Zuckerman, Williams, and

Stockley 2009). Nonetheless, this work provides a cautionary note to the otherwise

generally favorable assessment of MA from the observational analyses.

       For these reasons, assessing the performance of MA remains an open empirical

issue. In this paper, we offer a new approach to identifying its effects. We make use of a

discontinuity in the benchmark rate on which Medicare's payments to plans are based. In

the Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000, Congress established "urban

floors": minimum benchmarks, effective in 2001, for MA plans serving beneficiaries in

counties that were part of MSAs with populations of 250,000 or more in 2000. Plans in

smaller markets were paid lower rates. According to Pope et al. (2006), urban floors had

a major impact on the program, causing plans to expand their benefits and widen their

networks, thereby raising enrollment beyond what it would have otherwise been.

Although the impact of floor rates has been examined in other work, no study to date has

used the urban floor to identify the effect of MA on service use and quality of care.




                                                                                           7
II.     Experiment and data

        To understand the nature of our experiment, it is necessary to understand the rules

governing payment to MA plans.1 Plans bid to offer coverage, where the bid is to cover

an average beneficiary. Medicare bases its payment to plans on the relationship between

the bid and the benchmark (payments to plans are also adjusted for their enrollees'

demographics and health). The benchmark is a publicly-disclosed, county-level number

which is a function of several factors, including the county's average historical spending

on TM beneficiaries. If a plan bids above the benchmark, enrollees must pay a premium

equal to the difference between the bid and the benchmark. If a plan bids below the

benchmark, it receives a "rebate" from Medicare equal to 75 percent of the difference,2

which it must pass back to beneficiaries in the form of supplemental benefits or premium

offsets. Thus the existence of an urban floor in the benchmark rate creates a pseudo-

random experiment: beneficiaries in counties subject to the urban floor are more likely to

be offered plans with a higher benchmark relative to TM in the area and thus more

generous benefits and/or lower premiums.

        We study the utilization of services and quality of care for beneficiaries in the 449

counties that are part of MSAs with populations between 100,000 and 400,000 in 2000.

We compare outcomes from counties in MSAs with populations between 100,000 and

249,999 (not subject to the urban floor) to outcomes from counties in MSAs with

populations between 250,000 and 400,000 (subject to the urban floor).

        We use data from several sources. To construct the cohort of beneficiaries that

we examine, we use data from the MedPAR, enrollment, and Part D Plan Characteristics

Files (all files come from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services). MedPAR

contains information on the inpatient hospital admissions of every Medicare beneficiary

enrolled in TM, and since 2008, every beneficiary enrolled in MA. We match these data,

at the beneficiary level, with data from the enrollment file, which contains information on

demographic characteristics (age, gender, race, and county of residence) and whether the

beneficiary was enrolled in MA or TM. For beneficiaries enrolled in MA, we determine

the type of MA plan in which they enroll with the Part D Plan Characteristics File. With

this information we construct a cohort of elderly beneficiaries (aged 65-99) who were

enrolled in TM for all months of 2009 that they were alive, or enrolled in an HMO, Local

PPO, or Regional PPO MA plan for all months of 2009 that they were alive. We exclude

beneficiaries enrolled in other types of MA plans, in particular Special Needs Plans,

Private Fee For Service Plans, and Employer Plans. These types of plans are

characteristically different from other types of plans, and Special Needs and Employer

Plan enrollees are characteristically different from other enrollees and subject to different

payment rules.

           We augment our primary data with information on counties from other sources.

First, we obtained information on the county composition and population of MSAs from

the Census Bureau website.3 Second, we obtained information on the characteristics of

counties from the 2011 Area Resource File and the 2009 American Hospital Association

survey. We did this to investigate the extent to which counties in MSAs above versus

below the urban floor had similar incomes and numbers of physicians and specialists.

Third, we constructed zip-code level measures of hospital market competitiveness

(measured by a Hirschman-Herfindahl Index (HHI)) and the density of hospital market

                                                                                            9
characteristics (for-profit/non-profit/public, teaching, system, and hospital-size status)

using 2008 Medicare data according to the method in Kessler and McClellan (2000).

Fourth, we obtained information from the CMS website on the composition of MA

enrollment by plan type,4 the average risk score of MA enrollees,5 and the average risk

score of TM enrollees6 to investigate the extent to which beneficiaries in counties above

versus below the urban floor had similar health status. We match either the MA average

risk score or the TM average risk score to each beneficiary based on his Medicare

enrollment status.

        Table 1 presents means and standard deviations of our outcome and control

variables for all non-rural Medicare beneficiaries and beneficiaries from MSAs with

population 100,000 - 400,000. For beneficiaries from MSAs in this population range, it

also presents descriptive statistics by county floor status (in MSAs with above versus

below 250,000 population), along with p-values from difference-in-means hypothesis

tests (based on heteroscedasticity-robust standard errors clustered at the county level).

The first row of the table shows that floor status affects incentives and MA enrollment in

the way that a simple model would predict. Beneficiaries from counties above the urban

floor threshold have a significantly higher benchmark payment rate ($832) than do

beneficiaries from counties below the threshold ($784), or about 6 percent. It is also true

that beneficiaries from above-threshold counties are significantly more likely to enroll in

MA -- 11.3 percentage points as compared to 6.1 percentage points, p < 0.001.

       The next panel of the table presents average outcomes by floor status, and

previews our analysis. On average, 16.8 percent of non-rural beneficiaries are admitted

to the hospital at least once; the admission rate in our sample is slightly higher at 16.9

percent. This aggregate rate, however, masks an important difference in counties above

versus below the floor threshold. Beneficiaries from above-threshold counties have an

admission rate of 16.4 percentage points, whereas those from below-threshold counties

have a rate of 17.3 percentage points. This difference of 0.9 percentage points, or

approximately 5 percent, is statistically significant at the 1 percent level. The rate of

admissions for conditions thought to be sensitive to appropriate outpatient care (referred

to in the literature as ambulatory-care-sensitive (ACS) (Nicholas 2011) or preventable

(Basu and Mobley 2012) admissions) is also statistically significantly lower in above-

threshold counties; although the difference is smaller in magnitude, it is proportionately

almost twice as large. Mortality in the two groups is not statistically distinguishable at

conventional levels.

       If the above-threshold and below-threshold counties were otherwise similar, these

results would imply that expansion of MA along the margin we examine leads to fewer

hospitalizations but better (or at least no worse) health outcomes. In terms of most

(although not all) important covariates, above- and below-threshold counties are not

statistically distinguishable. The CMS risk scores for the two groups -- Medicare's best

guess as to the groups' expected medical spending -- are virtually identical (0.975 versus

0.977). T-tests fail to reject no difference in the age, gender, racial, and regional profiles

of the two groups as well. There are some notable differences in the two types of

counties. Most striking, of course, is the difference in their size. The average beneficiary

in a below-threshold county lives in a significantly smaller MSA than one in an above-



                                                                                             11
threshold county. This is relevant because other work shows that small urban areas had

fewer MA options than large areas even before urban floors were established (Pope et al.

2006, Table 3-4). There are other relevant differences between the groups, also likely

related to size. Above-threshold counties have higher (beneficiary-weighted) Medicare

enrollment and median income ($47,300 versus $44,500, p = 0.023), although their

poverty rates are not statistically distinguishable at conventional levels. Their residents

are also more likely to be admitted to larger hospitals (100-299 and 300+ beds, versus

<100 beds). The extent to which these factors explain differences in MA enrollment or

outcomes is an important question to which we now turn.



III.    Econometric models and results

        Our models specify the hospitalization or mortality during 2009 of beneficiary i =

1, ..., Nzc in zip code z = 1,..., Z that lies in county c = 1,..., C, Yizc, as a function of MA

enrollment status, health and demographic characteristics, and zip-code and county

characteristics:

                       Yizc = α + βMAizc + Xizcγ + Hczδ + Wcη + uizc ,                             (1)

where

Yizc    is an indicator = 1 if the beneficiary had a hospital admission, an ACS admission,

        or death in 2009;

MAizc is an indicator = 1 if the beneficiary was enrolled in MA for all of 2009;

Xizc    is the CMS risk score and indicator variables for the age (70-74, 75-79, 80-89, 90-

        99, omitted group is 65-69) gender, and race of the beneficiary;

Hzc     represents zip-code level hospital market characteristics, including the HHI, a

        hospital capacity index, and the density of for-profit, non-profit (omitted group is



                                                                                                   12
       public), teaching, system, 100-299 bed and 300+ bed (omitted group is <100 bed)

       hospitals;

Wc     contains the county's number of Medicare beneficiaries in 2009 (and its square

       and cube), its 2009 median income and other county-level characteristics in 2009,

       and its MSA's population in 2000 (on which its floor status is based, and its

       square and cube); and

uizc   is an error term that we allow to be arbitrarily correlated within each county.

       OLS estimates from this model identify the effect of MA on Yizc only under the

assumption that MA enrollment decisions are uncorrelated with uizc , which is likely to be

incorrect. For this reason we specify the MA enrollment decision as a logit model of Xizc,

Hzc, Wc, and Zc , where Zc is an indicator = 1 if county c is in an MSA with population of

250,000 or more:

                              exp(  X izc  H zc  Wc   Z c   izc )
        Pr( MAizc  1)                                                       ,            (2)

and vizc is an error term that we allow to be arbitrarily correlated within each county.

We follow Wooldridge (2010, section 21.4.1.) and estimate (1) by instrumental variables,

using as instruments Xizc, Hzc, Wc, and MAhatizc , where MAhatizc are the predicted values

from (2). We also present OLS estimates of (1) for comparison.

       Finally, we estimate placebo models in order to investigate the validity of the

assumptions underlying our IV strategy. We present OLS and IV estimates of (1) and (2)

using DIED2000izc and MA2000izc, respectively, as dependent variables. DIED2000izc is

defined for the cohort of beneficiaries enrolled in either MA or FFS Medicare for all 12

months in the year 2000, DIED2000izc = 1 if beneficiary i died in 2000, 0 otherwise;




                                                                                            13
MA2000izc = 1 if beneficiary i was enrolled in MA for all 12 months of 2000.7 Because

the urban payment floor did not take effect until 2001, in the absence of unobserved

differences in beneficiary health or the medical care environment between above- versus

below-threshold counties, there should be no effect of floor status on MA enrollment, and

in turn no negative IV effect of MA on DIED2000izc.

         Table 2 presents estimated marginal effects from (2), the logit of MA enrollment

on Xizc, Hzc, Wc, and Zc . For ease of interpretation, all effects in this and subsequent

tables are measured in percentage points, i.e., on a scale from 0 to 100. The table reports

heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors allowing for arbitrary clustering within

counties. The first row of the table shows that counties above the 250,000 population

threshold have significantly greater MA enrollment, with a marginal effect evaluated at

the mean of the other variables of 4.7 percentage points. The effect of the other

covariates is consistent with previous research. High-risk and older beneficiaries are

significantly less likely to enroll in MA; female, black, and beneficiaries from poorer

MSAs are significantly more likely to enroll. With these estimates, we construct a

predicted probability of enrollment in MA for each beneficiary which we use as an

instrument to estimate equation (1).

         Table 3 presents selected OLS and IV estimates from equation (2), the effect of

MA on hospital admissions, ACS admissions, and mortality.8 MA enrollment reduces

the rate of admission to the hospital in general and for ACS conditions. According to the

IV estimates in column (2), MA reduces the probability of admission by 3.4 percentage

  The variables Xizc, Wc, and Zc are defined as above, except a) they are based on 2000 data and b) exclude
the CMS risk score, which did not exist and cannot be calculated for 2000. We substitute conventional
county-level measures of hospital market competitiveness and other market characteristics (Hc) based on
hospital bed shares from the year 2000 because we did not have sufficient information to calculate Hzc.

  We report estimates for covariates that differed significantly above versus below the floor threshold.

points (standard error 1 percentage point). On a base admission rate of 16.9 percentage

points (table 1), this amounts to a 22 percent reduction. Part of the effect of MA on

admissions arises out of its impact on ACS conditions; MA reduces the probability of an

ACS admission by 0.69 percentage points (standard error 0.38 percentage points,

significant at the 10 percent level). There is also a significant IV effect of MA on

mortality of 0.7 percentage points (column (6), standard error 0.19 percentage points); on

a base of 4.6 percentage points, this amounts to a 15 percent reduction. Although the IV

estimates are smaller than the OLS estimates, they are not statistically distinguishable

from them at conventional levels, based on the IV standard errors. Of the other

covariates, only the CMS risk score has a uniformly significant effect, suggesting that

most of the impact of differences in the other covariates in above- versus below-threshold

counties are accounted for by the polynominals in area size.

       Table 4 presents results from placebo models of (1) and (2). They show results

from models of the probability of enrollment in MA in the year 2000, and the OLS and

IV effects of MA on mortality in 2000, using as an instrument the predicted probability of

enrollment based on what the floor status of each year-2000 beneficiary's county would

have been, had the urban floor then been in effect. These estimates have no causal

interpretation, since the instrument on which they are based is by definition invalid.

Instead, they are intended as a diagnostic test for the presence of unobserved differences

in the probability of MA enrollment and beneficiary health in the year 2000 between

above- and below-threshold counties. None of the year 2000 models include controls for

the CMS risk score, since risk adjustment did not begin until 2004.

       These tests suggest that the instrument is picking up the incentive effects of the

benchmark on enrollment and is otherwise uncorrelated with unobserved determinants of



                                                                                            15
health. According to column (1), there is no significant or economically important effect

on MA enrollment of residing in an above-threshold county in the year 2000, before the

payment change was implemented. The positive coefficient on MA in column (3) is

inconsistent with the hypothesis that beneficiaries in above-threshold counties had better

health in 2000; if anything, it suggests that the opposite is true. To the extent that area-

level differences in health are time-invariant, this finding suggests that our IV strategy

understates (in absolute value) the true effect of MA.

       We also reestimated the IV models underlying Table 3 excluding the risk score to

investigate whether our estimated effects might be due to endogeneity in the score's

determination. If MA plans encourage more intensive coding, and more intensive coding

leads to higher risk scores, estimates of the effect of MA conditional on risk score would

be inconsistent. The inconsistency arises because of positive correlation between

measurement error in the risk score and the instrument; overstated risk scores for MA

beneficiaries would make MA appear to have a greater beneficial effect on health than it

actually did. However, we found no evidence to support this hypothesis. IV estimates

of the models underlying Table 3 excluding the risk score were of approximately the

same magnitude, although their standard errors were larger, reflecting the larger variance

of the residual in equation (1).



IV.    Conclusion

       Medicare currently allows beneficiaries to choose between a government-run

health plan known as Traditional Medicare (TM), and privately-administered plans,

known as Medicare Advantage (MA). Assessing the relative performance of TM and

MA is an important issue, with first-order implications for not only national health and



                                                                                               16
fiscal policy but also economic theory. However, because enrollment in MA is optional,

evaluating the MA program is difficult. Beneficiaries who choose MA are observably

healthier than those who choose TM. Because observational data on health is notoriously

incomplete, and unobservable differences are likely positively correlated with

observables, conventional analysis of MA's impact are potentially subject to selection

bias -- bias that would tend to make MA look more efficient than it actually is.

       In this paper, we offer a new approach to identifying the effects of MA. We use a

discontinuity in the rules governing MA payments to private health plans that gives

greater payments to plans that cover beneficiaries who live in counties that are part of

Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) with populations of 250,000 or more. The sharp

difference in payment rates at this population cutoff creates a greater incentive for plans

to enroll beneficiaries in MA in counties just above versus just below the cutoff. The

induced incremental enrollment, in turn, allows us to identify the effect of MA on the use

of health services and the quality of care.

       We find that the higher payment rate in these "urban floor" counties leads to

significantly higher MA enrollment. In turn, payment-induced MA enrollment leads to

statistically significantly lower rates of hospitalization and lower mortality. These

findings support the hypothesis that MA provides better care than TM.

       Our findings are consistent with recent regression-based estimates of the effect of

MA. Landon et al. (2012), for example, find significantly fewer admissions per

beneficiary in MA versus TM in 2009 using a matching algorithm; although our IV

estimates are larger than their estimates, they are not statistically distinguishable. Dowd

et al. (2011) find lower mortality in MA plans in the 1990s, although their selection-

corrected estimates show a much larger effect on mortality than do ours.



                                                                                           17
       Because our identification strategy depends crucially on the assumption that

county floor status is uncorrelated with unobserved determinants of service use and

health, we conducted placebo tests to investigate its validity as an IV. We estimated the

effect of county floor status on MA enrollment, and the effect MA on mortality, in the

year 2000. In the absence of correlation between the instrument and unobservables, there

should be no effect of MA: the payment increases due to the floor didn't take effect until

2001. We found no evidence that beneficiaries from counties that later had

discontinuously higher payment rates were more likely to enroll in MA, healthier, or less

likely to need hospital care -- if anything, the opposite appears to be true.

       Although we find that MA leads to fewer hospitalizations and less mortality, we

cannot say that MA is more efficient than TM. Because the incremental MA enrollment

underlying our estimates is induced by higher payment rates, we cannot determine

whether the superior care received by MA enrollees is due to better management by

private health plans or to the additional services provided to beneficiaries as a result of

the higher rates. Indeed, other work has found increasing payment to MA plans reduces

the rate at which their beneficiaries are hospitalized for certain conditions, which

suggests that the latter mechanism may be relevant (Nicholas 2011). By implication, we

cannot say whether MA plans would provide better care than TM, were they to be paid

less than they were in 2009. This limitation of our study design is important. The ACA

significantly reduces payments to MA plans in the future, especially those in areas with

benchmarks that are above TM spending levels -- which is obviously related to county

floor status. For this reason, our findings cannot be directly extrapolated to the future

performance of MA.




                                                                                              18
       However, our estimates can be used as a starting point to bound MA's efficiency

gains and inform current policy. To determine whether MA is more efficient than TM

from a social perspective requires a comparison of the marginal expenditure/benefit ratios

in the two programs. To derive this from our estimates for MA, the key question is the

share of floor-induced increases in the benchmark that represent real resources consumed

by health plans or beneficiaries, in the form of MA plan management expenses or

additional services that contribute to health, versus the share that are transfers, in the form

of funds returned to Medicare (i.e., the 25% of the difference between the bid and the

benchmark), gains to plans' shareholders, lower MA premiums or cost sharing for

beneficiaries, broader MA provider networks, or services like vision coverage (which,

although they may provide utility, do not directly reduce mortality or otherwise improve

conventional measures of health outcomes). If we assume that all of the $48/month

increase in the benchmark (the difference between the benchmark in above- versus

below-threshold counties, table 1) due to the floor represents real resource use, and the

only relevant measure of benefit is avoided mortality, then the MA expansion we

examine would be efficient as long as TM's marginal expenditure/benefit ratio were

greater than approximately $165,000 per year of life saved, since MA spent $576 (=

$48*12) per year to get approximately 3.5 fewer deaths per thousand beneficiary-years (=

0.0070 calendar-year mortality reduction from table 3 / 2).

       For several reasons, this understates the cost-effectiveness of MA. First, it

attributes no direct benefit to patients from the decrease in hospitalizations we observe,

over and above any effect on mortality. Second, it assumes that no mortality benefits

persist beyond 6 months on average. Third, it assumes none of the increase in the

benchmark is returned to Medicare, and none represents a transfer to beneficiaries or



                                                                                             19
plans. Nonetheless, the underlying calculations illustrate the sort of information that

would be necessary in order to assess more precisely the benefits of expanding MA.

       For purposes of policy, the key question is how much of the gains from MA that

we observe could be achieved in the absence of increased government outlays in the form

of the higher benchmark. This is related (although not identical) to the question above.

To the extent that spending increases attributable to the urban floor represent transfers,

the gains from expanding MA could be achieved without them, at least in theory. If all of

the increases were transfers, none would be necessary to obtain the quality improvements

that we found, as long as beneficiaries could be otherwise induced into the program by

(for example) making TM less attractive.

       Future research, along the lines of Song, Landrum, and Chernew (2012), might

seek to estimate or simulate the value of these parameters. Future work should also seek

to evaluate the performance of MA in the post-ACA world, where payments to MA plans

will be less generous on average than they were historically, and the performance of MA

under competitive bidding. Finally, future research might seek to investigate how MA

interacts with the competitiveness of hospital, physician, and insurance markets, to

determine the circumstances under which the gains from MA that we find would be most

likely to be achievable.
