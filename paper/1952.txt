                      Efficiency Wages and the Wage Structure




                                     ABSTRACT




        This paper examines differences in pay for equally skilled workers in
   different industries. The major finding is that there is substantial
   dispersion in wages across industries, even after allowing for measured and
   unmeasured labor quality, working conditions, fringe benefits, transitory
   demand shocks, threat of unionization, union bargaining power, firm size and
   other factors. Some direct evidence in favor of efficiency wage theories is
   presented. The evidence suggests that industry wage differentials are
   successful in eliciting better performance through reduced turnover and
   increased effort.

     The essential feature of a perfectly competitive labor market is that

workers who accept jobs can expect to receive compensation equal to their

opportunity cost.   Firms pay a wage that is just sufficient to attract

workers of the quality they desire and no higher.   Competitive theory makes a

strong prediction about the structure of wages. Job attributes which do not

directly affect the utility of workers should have no effect on the level of

wages. Alternative theories such as the efficiency wage formulations surveyed

by Stiglitz (1984) suggest that job attributes having nothing to do with the

utility workers receive on the job should have systematic effects on wages

because they influence the optimal wage for firms to choose. As Stiglitz

(1984), Bulow and Summers (1986) and many other authors have argued,

efficiency wage theories have positive and normative implications very

different from those of more standard competitive models.

     This paper examines the magnitude of non—competitive wage differentials.

We focus on the role of industry and occupational variables in explaining

relative wages. Our findings suggest that a worker's industry and occupation

exert a substantial impact on his wage even after controlling for human

capital and a variety of job characteristics. We are led to conclude that

there are important variations in wages which cannot be explained by standard

competitive theories. These findings complement demonstrations of important

relationships between firm size and wages, Brown and Medoff (1984), and of

large intra—industry wage differences, Dunlop (1957) and Groshen (1986) in

suggesting the importance of developing models of non—competitive wage setting

even in non—union settings.

     We focus on efficiency wage theories as an explanation for the setting of

non—competitive wages. Any economic theory that explains why wages deviate

from their competitive level must in a tautologous sense explain why firms

find it profitable to pay non-competitive wages. In this sense, any

explanation of non-competitive wages must have an efficiency wage element.

That is, it must postulate that over some range profits are an increasing

function of the wage rate offered. In some cases, the efficiency wage theory

is a triviality. For example, firms may find it unprofitable to violate

minimum wage laws because of the fines that will be imposed. Or it may be

necessary to pay supra-competitive wages to unionized workers in order to

avoid strikes. Our principle interest is however in "pure" efficiency wage

models in which firms can find it profitable to raise wages even when they

will not be punished by some outside party for failing to do so. The limited

evidence that is available suggests that high paying industries may benefit by

reducing turnover and eliciting more effort from their workers as suggested by

efficiency wage theories.

     The paper is organized as follows. Section 1 briefly discusses the

possible role of efficiency wage theories in explaining wage differentials.

Section 2 presents our basic econometric results using data from the Current

Population Survey (CPS) and documents the existence of substantial inter—

industry and inter—occupational variations in wages. Section 3 considers and

rejects a number of possible reconciliations of the results with competitive

theory. By providing fixed effects estimates we cast serious doubt on

"unmeasured labor quality" explanations for inter-industry wage differences.

We also present evidence strongly suggesting that wage differentials cannot
                                            —3—


     all be attributed to union effects, the short run immobility of labor or

     compensating differentials. Section 4 provides some evidence
                                                                     that high wages
     are efficacious in eliciting effort from workers and reducing turnover and

     thus provides some support for efficiency wage theories. Section 5 concludes

     the paper by reviewing some broader evidence on the importance of industry

     wage differentials, and by reviewing evidence on the importance of these

    differentials for economic theory and policy.



    1.      Efficiency Wage Theories


            Economists have a clear understanding of how perfectly competitive labor

    markets without any information or contracting problems would function.

    Equally productive workers would receive compensation package which provided

    equal levels of utility. Wages would depend only on worker& abilities and

    not on characteristics of their employers which did not influence other

    non—pecuniary benefits of employment. Falsification of this prediction would

    force consideration of alternative theories that predict linkages between job

    characteristics and wages. Any such theory has the property that at least

    some employers must be paying more than the going wage for workers of the type

    they attract. This behavior can be rationalized only by assuming that some

=   firms   do not profit maximize, or that some firms find that increasing wages

    above the going rate is profitable. The latter possibility is the defining

    characteristic of efficiency wage theories.

         At least four conceptually distinct efficiency wage theories may be

    adduced as possible rationales for the payment of non-competitive wages. Our
                                     -4-


goal in this paper is to demonstrate the potential importance of efficiency

wages not to distinguish between alternative motives for paying them. We

therefore describe these motives only briefly. For formal presentations of

the relevant models, and references to the relevant literature, see Stiglitz

(1984) and Katz (1986). The profitability of raising wages at least in some

circumstances has been asserted by many authors including Adam Smith, Karl

Marx, Alfred Marshall, Henry Ford and Max Weber.

      A first model of efficiency wages postulates that they are paid in order

to minimize turnover costs.   If firms must bear part of the costs of turnover,

and if turnover is a decreasing function of the wages firms pay, there may be

an incentive to raise wages in order to minimize turnover costs.

     A second possibility is that increasing wages raises workers effort

level. Workers who are paid only their opportunity costs have little

incentive to perform well since losing their job would not be costly. By

raising wages, firms may make the cost of job loss larger and thereby

encourage good performance.

     Alternatively, a third model postulates that workers' feelings of loyalty

to their firm increase with the extent to which the firms shares its profits

with them. These feelings of loyalty may have a direct effect on

productivity. As expounded by Akerlof (1984) such a model relies on notions

about gift relationships that are not well captured by traditional utility

functions.

      A final model is based on selection rather than incentive effects.

Firms which pay higher wages will find that they attract a higher quality pool

of applicants. If quality is not directly observable, this will be desirable.
                                       -5—


      If all firms or occupations were identical, one would not expect to see

different   firms or occupations paying different wages even if efficiency wage

considerations were important. But when there are differences in their

ability to bear the costs of turnover, to supervise their workers, or to

measure labor quality, either because of differences in management capacity,

or because of differences in the technology of production, then the optimal

wage to pay will vary. Thus efficiency wage models unlike standard

competitive formulations can explain why characteristics of firms or

occupations which do not directly affect workers' utility can affect wage

rates.

     It should be clear that demonstrations that similar workers can over long

periods of time be paid different wages in different industries makes

plausible the idea that some workers are involuntarily unemployed, for

involuntary unemployment can simply be thought of as confinement to a low wage

home production industry.


Previous Studies

     Previous studies have examined the effect an employee's industry or

occupation has on wages to test segmented labor market theories that are

closely related to the efficiency wage model considered here. Sumner Slichter

(1950) was among the first economists to study the industry wage structure.

After examining the average hourly wage rate of skilled and unskilled male

workers in manufacturing industries between 1923 and 1946, Slichter was struck

by the magnitude of industry wage differences for comparable workers.

     Slichter found several "regularities" in the wage structure. First, he
                                     -6-


found the average unskilled wage rate in an industry to vary positively with

the average hourly earnings of semi-skilled and skilled workers in the industry.

Second, he found that industry wages are positively correlated with value

added per worker in the industry, positively correlated with profit margins,

and negatively correlated with the payroll to income ratio.   And lastly, he

found that "the wage structure changes over time, but the changes are fairly

slow and the wage structure between industries within a period of twenty or

thirty years exhibits only moderate changes." Slichter theorized that these

facts were evidence that "managerial policy" is important in wage setting.

     Thurow (1976) phrases the question as follows: "Earnings data and

earnings equations are often corrected for both industry and geographic

location, but should they be? Wage payments in a marginal-productivity world

are supposed to be made on the basis of the skills supplied and not dependent

upon the industry or region of use." The answer he finds is that "industry

and geographic variables are significant in individual earnings functions....

This significance, itself, constitutes a deviation from the norms of a

competitive market."

     Using regression analysis, Wachtel and Betsey (1972) analyze the impact

of one digit industries and three occupation groups on the residual of wages

after controlling for education, experience and demographic factors. Like

Thurow they conclude that "there is a substantial portion of the variance in

wage earnings that can be explained by industry structure after the effects of

personal characteristics have been eliminated." They further find that an

employee's industry and occupation pair is more "important" in explaining

wages than other "structural characteristics," such as union status and
                                        —7—


 geographic location.

      After carefully reviewing the empirical studies on dual labor market

 theory, Cain (1976) concludes that the importance of
                                                         industry affiliation in
 determining wages is the most convincing evidence in support of dual labor

 markets.l However, Cain aptly cautions that the industry effects on
                                                                     wages
 "may represent transitory demand factors,
                                              compensating nonpecuniary effects,
 or unmeasured human capital variables." These possibilities have not been

 adequately addressed in the existing empirical studies
                                                          purporting to establish
 the importance of labor market separation.

      The empirical work reported below takes up Cain's challenge and examines

possible competitive explanations for inter—industry wage differences. We

also extend previous work by testing efficiency wage explanations for the

existence of segmented labor markets.



2. Data, Methodology, and Basic Results


     In textbook neoclassical labor economics an employee is compensated

according to his or her opportunity cost, which is determined by accumulated

human capital and the employer's work environment.     If an employee's industry
or occupation is a significant factor in determining wages after controlling

for labor quality and working conditions we must look beyond simple

competitive theories and ask why firms choose to pay workers more than their

opportunity cost.

     Our initial empirical analysis of industry and occupational wage

differentials is based on cross sectional data on individuals collected by the
                                       —8—


Bureau of the Census for the May 1974, 1979 and 1984 Current Population

Surveys. The May CPS contains labor force data for members of the sampled

households who are 14 years old or older.    In May 1979 the Bureau of the

Census asked additional questions on tenure, firm size, plant size, and fringe

benefits of a randomly selected sample of households for its Pension

Supplement. All of our results for 1979 are based on the Pension

Supplement.2 The samples we analyze contain full and part—time private

nonagricultural employees 16 years old or older. The earnings variable is

usual weekly earnings divided by usual weekly hours. We considered employees

who reported earning less than $1.00 or greater than $250.00 an hour outliers

and eliminated them from the sample.

     We estimate several standard wage equations in order to examine the

importance of industry and occupation in explaining relative wages. Our

strategy is to control for human capital, demographic background and working

conditions as well as possible, and then analyze the effect of industry and

occupation dummy variables on relative wages. We normalize the estimated

industry and occupation wage differentials as deviations from the (weighted)

mean differential.3

     Table 1 presents results of cross section regressions of log wage on one

digit census industries (CIC) with human capital and demographic controls for

1974, 1979, and 1984. The human capital and demographic controls include

education, age, sex, race, union status, a central city dummy, marital status,

veteran status, and several interaction terms.4 Table 2 presents comparable

results for two—digit CXC industries and Appendix Table Al contains comparable

results for 1984 for three digit dc industries. As a group the industry
                                      -9—


dummy variables are statistically significant and they are generally

significant individually.

      Furthermore, the industry variables have a sizable impact on relative

wages. The coefficient for mining in Table 2 for 1984, for instance, implies

that the average employee in the mining industry earns wages that are 26*

higher than the average employee in all industries, after controlling for

human capital and demographic background. In 1964 the industry differentials

ranged from a high of 38* above the mean in the petroleum industry to a low of

37% below the mean in private household services. These wage differentials

suggest that other factors besides opportunity cost are important in

explaining wages.

     The industry and occupation variables are very important in explaining

variations in log earnings. As an indication of their importance, the

standard error of the regression falls nearly 10% when the industry and

occupation controls are added to the equation, and two digit industry controls

alone lead to 4.5% reduction in the standard error of the regression after

controlling for occupation and other factors. In comparison, the union

variable only has a 1.5* effect on the standard error of the regression, the

human capital controls have only a 4.4* effect, and race and sex controls have

less than a .2% effect. This suggests that if industry and occupational wage

differences are non—competitive they have far greater impacts on the

allocation of resources than do the wage differences associated with unions or

discrimination.

     Some general observations can be made about the industry wage structure.

Durable manufacturing products and chemical industries tend to be high wage

industries while wholesale, retail and service industries tend to be low wage

industries, In 1984, for instance, workers in the capital intensive,

technologically sophisticated chemical industry were paid 24% percent above

the average employee, while workers in the customer oriented retail trade

industries were paid 16% to 19% less than the average employee, all else

constant.

     To summarize the overall variability in industry wages we focus on the

standard deviation of the industry wage differentials. A simple calculation

of the standard deviation of the estimated industry differentials is upwardly

biased because the industry differentials cannot be estimated precisely. We

therefore adjust the standard deviation of estimated ceofficients to reflect

sampling error.5

     Industry variations in relative wages are substantial. In 1984 the

employment—weighted standard deviation of two digit CXC industry wage

differentials was almost 15%, in 1979 the standard deviation was 11%, and in

1974 the standard deviation was 13%. Changing industries has about the same

impact on wages as does changing union status, on average.

     Focusing on occupation rather than industry, Table 3 shows that

occupation wage differentials are also large. in 1984, wage premiums ranged

from a high of 22% above the mean for managers and administrators to a low of

21% below the mean for transport operatives. The standard deviation of the

occupational wage differentials in that year was about 12%. As was the case

with the industry wage differentials, the occupation premiums are highly

correlated from year to year.

Non-Wage Compensation

     Fringe benefits are an important component of compensation, accounting

for as much as 40% to 50% of total compensation in some companies. To adjust

for variation in fringes across industries, we multiplied the CPS hourly wage

data for each worker by the ratio of total labor costs to wages in the

corresponding industry. The industry labor cost and wage data are reported in

the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA).

     The results of wage regressions with the dependent variable adjusted to

reflect nonwage compensation are reported in column (4) of Tables 1 and 2.

Since the NIPA and CPS classification schemes do not match perfectly, care

should be used in comparing these results to the CPS results. Nonetheless,

Tables 1 and 2 show that consideration of nonwage compensation reinforces

rather than reduces industries wage differences. For instance, the wage

differential in primary metals increases from 17 above the mean to 27% above

the mean when we take account of nonwage compensation.


Wage Differences Through Time

     Over time both the one and two digit CIC industries show a stable pattern

of inter—industry wage variability. The standard deviation of wage

differentials shows no trend during the years we studied and the differentials

are highly correlated from year to year. Between 1984 and 1919 the

correlation is .998 and between 1964 and 1974 the correlation is .970. As

further evidence of the stability of the inter-industry wage structure over

time, Krueger and Summers (1986) find a correlation of .56 between the

industry wage differentials for 1984 and the average wage of unskilled male
                                      —12—


 manufacturing workers in 1923. Like Slichter, we conclude that the industry

 wage structure remains constant over time.

      The stability of the industry wage structure casts doubt on explanations

 of wage differentials based on the short run immobility of labor,
                                                                   transitory
 labor demand shocks, and rent sharing. it is unlikely that labor is

 sufficiently immobile over several decades or even one decade to allow such

 large differentials to persist. And stock market data suggest that the rents

 available in different industries fluctuate
                                               widely through time. The standard
deviation in stock market return between 1984 and 1979 of 23 selected

 industries surveyed by Standard and Poor1s was 78%. The great variability in

rents available in an industry over time would make a rent-sharing explanation

of the industry wage differences implausible.

     in contrast to the predictions of the
                                              competitive model, we find that the

industry or occupation an employee is in has a statistically significant and

sizable impact on wages. Furthermore, these relative wage differentials

persist at about the same level over time, which is inconsistent with

explanations based on the short run immobility of
                                                    labor, transitory demand
shocks, or rent sharing. Next we examine whether these findings hold up

under closer scrutiny.



3.   Alternative Explanations of Industry Wage Differentials


     In this section we examine whether the
                                              substantial industry wage
differentials discussed in Section 2 can be given competitive or institutional

explanations. This section is divided into four subsections.     The first
considers issues of measured and unmeasured labor quality, the second examines

the importance of compensating differentials, the third section explores the

union threat effect, and the fourth section addresses other issues. The major

conclusion is that industry wage differentials are robust to additional

competitive and institutional explanations.


Labor Quality

      Perhaps the most plausible competitive explanation for our findings is

that there are differences in unmeasured aspects of labor quality across

industries. Tables 4A and 46 explore the impact of alternative degrees of

control for human capital on inter—industry and occupation wage variation.

If industry wage differentials were due to measured and unmeasured labor

quality differences across industries we would expect a significant fall in

the dispersion of industry wages once we control for measured human capital.

However, the addition of human capital controls -—     education,   tenure, and age

——   results   in only a 1* drop in the standard deviation of the wage

differentials in the 1979 CPS Pension Supplement. Despite the increased

controls for labor quality the standard deviation of industry wages remains

above 10*. And variation in occupational wage differences is also substantial

despite increased labor quality controls. Unless one believes that age tenure

and schooling account for only a negligible amount of the variation in labor

quality, this evidence makes it implausible to attribute inter—industry wage

differences to differences in labor quantity.

       It might still be argued that our results do not adequately control for

labor quality ——    that   unmeasured labor quality differences, such as motivation

and innate ability, vary systematically with industry and are being

"picked—up" by the industry variables instead of the human capital controls.

     We address the problem of unmeasured, unchanging labor quality by

analyzing longitudinal data. With these data we can compare the wages of the

same person as he or she switches industry. The longitudinal analysis

addresses the problem of unmeasured labor quality in the cross-sectional

results reported above, but is not without potential biases. These biases

include the selectivity of job switchers and increased measurement error.

     We have created a large longitudinal data set by pooling together three

matched CPS data sets. Since CPS cannot match individuals who change their

address, the sample is not completely representative and probably

under-represents job switchers. Nonetheless, CPS reports that about 7O of

respondents were matched from one year to the next year. Of the 18,541

employees in our data set, 2,137 reported changing major industries. However,

evidence from Mellow and Sider (1983) on measurement error in answering

questions about industry suggests that many of these reported industry

switchers truly did not switch industry affiliation, and are instead the

result of classification errors. As a result, it is necessary to correct our

estimates for measurement error.

     Table 5 presents the results of our analysis of longitudinal data. Since

measurement error is a severe problem in looking at persons who report changes

in industry, we report results with and without adjustment for measurement

error. The correction for measurement error in more than one dummy variable

in longitudinal data is derived in the Appendix. Our results show that the

longitudinal and level regressions are very similar. In all industries except

finance, insurance and real estate the level and adjusted longitudinal results

have the same sign and about the same magnitude. For instance, the

measurement error corrected results show that employees who leave (join) the

manufacturing sector gain (lose) a 9.7% pay increase (decrease), while a

regression on the levels shows a 5.9% pay premium for manufacturing employees.

For some industries the measurement error corrected results actually suggest

that the unmeasured labor quality is lower in the high pay industries.

     There are potentially important selection problems involved in studying

workers who change industries. As a partial test for the importance of these

problems, we examined the impact on wages of changing industries separately

for leavers and joiners. The selection effects operating on workers moving

from industry i to j are likely to be different from those operating on

workers going from industry j to industry i. We were unable, however, to

reject the hypothesis that wage changes were the same for joiners and leavers.

Along with the similarity of the cross—sectional and longitudinal results, we

find this evidence supportive of the view that observed industry differences

in wages do not reflect differences in average labor quality.



8.   Compensating Differentials

     The finding of stable inter—industry wage differentials could be

explained by pointing to compensating differentials. The compensating

differentials argument is that agreeable and disagreeable job attributes vary

systematically with one's industry, and therefore necessitate wage

differentials to compensate employees for nonwage aspects of the industry.

Since the results considered so far do not control for working conditions, it
                                             -16-


     could be argued that the industry wage differentials we observe merely

     represent compensating differentials.

          Although Brown (1980), Smith (1979), and several other studies have not

     been able to document
                             compensating differentials for a range of job

     attributes, we examine this possibility. We base
                                                           our analysis of working
     conditions on the University of Michigan's
                                                    Quality of Employment Survey (QES).
     The 1977 QES cross section contains data on a wide range of working

     conditions. Several other studies of compensating differentials have relied

    on QES, such as Preston (1985) and Brown and Medoff (1985). We focus on ten

    potentially important job attributes —— weekly hours, a variable indicating

    whether health hazards are present on the job and another indicating whether

    the hazard Is serious, second and third shift
                                                      dummies, commuting time, two
    variables indicating the extent of choice of overtime, and two catch—all

    variables indicating whether the physical work conditions are pleasant. These

    are the same variables Brown and Medoff (1985) hold constant.

         If the industry differentials do not change substantially once the

    working condition measures are added to the regression, we would conclude that

    compensating differentials are not playing an important role in
                                                                        determining
    the industry wage differentials.

         Table 6 reports results of standard wage regressions with and without the

—   ten working condition variables. Because the QES sample is much
                                                                        smaller than
    the CPS samples (1,033 usable observations compared to more than 9,000 in

    CPS), our estimates are less precise than our other results.     However, as can
    be seen from comparing Table 1 to Table 6 the industry wage structure in QES

    is highly correlated with our results from CPS.     By comparing column (1) and
                                     —11—


column (2) of Table 6 it is clear that the working condition variables do not

substantially alter the pattern of industry wages. The standard deviation of

the industry premiums actually increases from 0.11 to 0.12 when the working

condition controls are added to the equation.

     Table 7 reports occupation pay premiums with and without the ten working

condition controls. The results of this exercise are less convincing. The

standard deviation of the differentials drops from 6.2% to 4.9% once working

conditions are controlled for. These pay premiums are much less important

than industry premiums and than our earlier occupation results. However, the

attenuated occupational wage differentials may result from the imprecision in

the estimates. Even with working condition controls, the occupation variables

are statistically significant.

     Another possible compensating differential is for full—time versus

part—time work. We examined this possibility by narrowing the CPS sample to

only full—time employees. The industry and occupation pay premiums in this

subsample are not substantially different from the full sample. Consequently,

we conclude that this is not a major determinant of industry and occupation

wage differentials. Lastly, variation in the risk of unemployment across

industries might provide an explanation for industry wage differences.

However, Murphy and Topel (1986) find that variables measuring the probability

and duration of unemployment do not substantially reduce the effect of

industry and occupation affiliation on wages.

     Evidence considered in this subsection does not support the view that

industry and occupation wage differentials are due to omitted working

condition variables. It is not likely that the basic results reported in

section 2 would change if we could control for working conditions. Indeed,

our finding that controlling for working conditions raises the dispersion of

wages suggests that looking across industries, wage differentials are

additional rather than compensating.



C.   Union Threat

     For many years institutional economists have stressed the role of unions

in wage determination. A recent paper in this tradition by William Dickens

(1965) argues that varying costs of union avoidance across sectors will lead

some firms to offer pay premiums to avoid unionization. Firms that find it

costly to defeat a union will offer supra—competitive wages to prevent

unionization. According to this theory, the industry's ease of defeating a

union drive has a negative relationship with wage differentials. The testable

implication of Dickens' model is that inter—industry wage variability should

be low where the threat of unionization is low.

     Time series evidence does not support the union threat explanation of

industry wage differentials. Between 1970 and 1980 the percentage of workers

who were in union representation election victories fell from .6% to .2% of

the private sector workforce, yet our earlier results show that the industry

wage structure remained remarkably stable during this time period. This

finding should not be surprising in light of Sumner Slichter's (1950) finding

that the industry wage structure did not change substantially after the

passage of the Wagner Act and unprecedented unionization in the 1930's and

1940's. These results strongly suggest that the industry wage structure

exists independent of union activity.
                                      —19—


      Table 8 provides additional cross—sectional evidence on the industry wage

 structure and unions. Firms in southern states have a great legal and

 cultural edge over the rest of the country in avoiding unions. In 1978, for

 instance, non—southern workers were 2.5 times more likely to belong to a union

 than southern private sector wage and salary workers.    Consequently, the
 threat effect model predicts that industry wage differentials would be less

 important for a sample of southern employees. In row (1) we present the

standard deviation of industry wage differentials in southern states after

controlling for other factors. Contrary to the predictions of the threat

model, we find a substantial amount of variation in relative wages across

industries for this subsample, and we also find that the industry wage

structure in the south is highly correlated with the
                                                        industry wage structure
in the rest of the country. Similar results were obtained using a subsample

of SMSAs with very low unionization rates. It does not appear that the threat

of unionization is an important explanation of the
                                                      inter—industry wage
structure.

     We also address the question of whether industry wage differentials

result from varying degrees of union bargaining power across industries. If

the industry wage differences are due to "strong" unions who can raise wages

without suffering severe employment losses in certain industries (i.e. because

of varying elasticity of labor demand), we would expect to find less

variability in wages across industries for nonunion workers.    Rows (2) and (3)
of Table 8 show that this is not the case. Instead, we find that nonunion

workers have slightly greater dispersion in industry wage differentials than

union workers, and that there is a high correlation
                                                      between industry wages for

union and nonunion employees.
     Lastly, evidence on the industry wage structure worldwide surveyed in

Krueger and Summers (1986) militates against an explanation of industry wage

premia based on unions. Nations such as South Korea which vigorously oppose

unions have almost an identical wage structure to nations that have widespread

and legally protected collective bargaining such as England and West Germany.

     Industry wage differentials •exist to about the same extent in union and

nonunion environments and in situations where the credibility of union threats

differ widely, and therefore do not appear to be a union phenomenon.



0.   other Issues

     A plausible way to gain further insights into the inter—industry wage

structure is to examine how it varies across different types of workers and

plants. In general, we find that inter—industry wage structure is quite

stable.

     It is natural to conjecture that industry wage differences have something

to do with patterns of human capital accumulation. Firms may be forced to

share rents with older workers who have acquired substantial firm specific

capital. This would lead to inequality in wages across industries. In this

case our wage equation might not be accurately measuring inter—industry

differences in the expected lifetime income of new workers entering different

industries. In order to examine these possibilities, we examine separately

industry effects on the wages of young and old workers, and on workers with

short and long tenure. Rows (1) and (2) of Table 9 show that wage premium

across industries for the young and old are highly correlated. Furthermore,
                                     -21—


the standard deviation of industry wages is about 14 for both groups of

workers. Similarly, we find that workers with one year or less of job tenure

or more than ten years of job tenure have almost equally variable and highly

correlated industry wage structures. Varying patterns of human capital

accumulation do not appear to provide an explanation for the inter—industry

wage structure.6

     An important institution that affects wages is company and plant size.

Several studies have documented sizable size-wage differentials. For our

purposes, the size—wage differential is an important dimension of the wage

structure because several explanations of the size—wage differential are based

on efficiency wages that result from more costly monitoring in larger

establishments. (See Calvo and Wellisz (1978), 01 (1983), and Bulow and

Summers (1986) for examples of efficiency wage models applied to different

size firms.) Rows (5) and (6) of Table 9 show that industry wage dispersion

increases sharply with firm size. This suggests that monitoring difficulties

may in fact increase with firm size in some industries. Corroborating

evidence comes from an analysis of self employed workers. Despite the fact

that skills are most likely to be diverse among the self employed, and the

substantial reporting errors in reporting self employment, inter—industry wage

variations are about one—quarter smaller among the self employed than among

other workers.

     Rows (9) and (10) of Table 9 show that the industry wage structure is

fairly uniform for both blue collar and white collar employees. We also

reached the same conclusion when we examined more detailed occupations.

Industries which pay workers in one occupation group above their alternative

wage tend to pay workers in other occupations above their alternative wage as

well. This finding supports the conclusions of Dickens' and Katz's (1986)

more extensive examination of this issue. Since it is unlikely that workers

in different occupations within an industry have similar quantities of

unmeasured ability, this finding is further evidence against an unmeasured

labor quality explanation of industry wage premia. The similarity of the

industry wage structure for workers in different occupations suggests that the

factor that is responsible for industry wage differences cuts across

occupational lines.7 This may cast some doubt on efficiency wage theories

based on differences in monitoring technologies, since monitoring costs are

likely to vary somewhat across occupations. It militates in favor of

sociological explanations such as that of Akerlof (1984).



4.   Direct Evidence


     The previous sections were aimed at documenting substantial variations in

wages across industries and occupations that are not explained by the standard

competitive model. In this section we examine whether it is profitable to pay

these wage premia. Specifically, we test efficiency wage models that are

based on reduced turnover costs and improved performance. First we consider

the relationship between pay premiums and turnover and then we examine effort

and performance. The direct evidence that we present suggests that wage

premiums contribute to increased employee productivity and some limited

support for efficiency wage theories.

     Turnover is costly to firms. Increased quits cost the firm in terms of
                                     —23—


recruitment, lost production and lost specific training. While the

relationship between wages and turnover is well established in the literature

(see Pencavel (1970) and Viscusi (1980) for instance), we specifically examine

the relationship between turnover and industry and occupation wage premia.

Our approach to analyzing turnover is to regress tenure and quit rates on an

employee's wage premium and other controls. The wage premium is the sum of

industry and occupation wage differentials that we report in Tables 2 and 3.

     Table 10 shows that the wage premium variable is a significant factor in

explaining tenure and quits. The premium variable has an impact on tenure and

quits even after controlling for individual specific wage rates. Industry

and occupation wage premia thus have a stronger impact on turnover that goes

beyond the general effect of increased wages. This finding, at a minimum,

provides further evidence that wage premiums do not reflect compensating

differentials, since such differentials would not induce reduced turnover.

The results imply that a 75% increase in the wage premium, which equals the

change in wages of moving from the lowest paid industry to the highest paid

industry in 1984, would result in an estimated 38% increase in tenure and a

63% decrease in quit rates, all elseequal. Brown and Iledoff (1978) estimate

that the elasticity of output with respect to the quit rate is about .1. This

implies that reductions in turnover alone are not sufficient to justify wage

premiums of the magnitude actually observed if labor's share is substantial.

Although this is slightly more than the impact of changing from nonunion to

union status, higher wages do not appear to bring about a big enough reduction

in turnover to justify their cost unless they bring other benefits.

premiums on several self-reported measures of performance and job

characteristics, holding human capital, individual wages, and demographic

factors constant. For comparison, we also report the effect of union

membership on these same performance measures and job characteristics.

     We find that industry and occupation premiums are postiively related to

self—reported work effort. This is true even after holding constant the level

of wages. Furthermore1 workers in better paying occupations and industries

are more likely to report that their work is "meaningful" to them and that

they think about their work during their leisure time than workers in low

paying occupations and industries. These findings suggest that wage premiums

are successful in eliciting better performance from workers.

     Lastly, we find that workers in better paying industries and occupations

tend to have less repetitious work and greater freedom to determine their work

speed. While this result is contrary to an equalizing differences view of

industry and occupation wage differences, it is consistent with efficiency

wages based on varying monitoring costs since workers with greater discretion

are more difficult to monitor than workers with well defined, repetitious job

tasks.

     The direct evidence reported in this section provides some support for

efficiency wage theory by showing a link between wage premiums and reduced

turnover, increased work effort, and more job discretion. It is certainly not

clear, however, that these responses to high wages are sufficiently large to

make raising wages profitable.

5.   Conclusions


     The empirical results in this paper suggest that non—competitive

considerations play an important part in wage setting. After controlling for

labor quality and compensating differentials to the maximum extent possible

with available data we find that variables related to job characteristics but

not to workers' utility on the job have very substantial effects on wages.

Differences in industry have effects on wages that are comparable in magnitude

to the effects of unionism, firm size, sex or race. In Krueger and Summers

(1986), industry wage differences are remarkably stable over time and

remarkably similar across countries. There is some evidence that firms paying

wage premiums reap some gains in terms of lower turnover and better

performance as a result.

     These results have important implications for both micro and macro

economic policy. It is well known (e.g Bhagwhati and Srinivasan (1983)) that

in the presence of inter—industry wage differentials, a variety of subsidies,

tariffs, or other protectionist policies may be desirable in the sense that

they raise total economic welfare. Bulow and Summers (1986) demonstrate that

it is even possible that subsidies to high wage industries financed by

universal lump sum taxes will represent a Pareto-improvement.   Traditionally,

these results have not been thought of as having much policy relevance.

Inter—industry wage differentials have been viewed as distortions which are

best attacked directly and which may be exacerbated by second-best policies.

Efficiency wage models suggest that inter-industry wage differentials may not

be the result of imperfections in competition but of deeper information and
                                             -25—


 contracting   problems. In this case, second best industrial subsidies may be

 the only available policy instruments. Of course, it is far from clear that

 governments have the ability to actually use such policies in a desirable way.

        The demonstration of important
                                         inter—industry wage differentials, if
 accepted, creates a prima fade case for the existence of involuntary

 unemployment. Unemployment may be thought of as employment in home

 production. it is no more surprising that workers
                                                        should be confined to this
 "industry" than to other low wage industries. There is a more subtle linkage

 between inter—industry wage differentials and involuntary unemployment as
well.    The existence of wage differentials can provide the
                                                             motivation for
"wait" unemployment of the type considered by Hall (1975) and Bulow and

Summers (1986). In the presence of
                                         involuntary unemployment, there is a case
for policies directed at increasing employment. The natural rate of

unemployment is likely to be inefficiently high. As Akerlof and Yellen (1985)

emphasize, efficiency wage models can illuminate cyclical fluctuations in

unemployment as well. The finding here of large
                                                     inter—industry wage
differentials suggests that profits may be relatively insensitive to wages

over a wide range. This attentuates firms' incentives to adjust wages in the
                                         /
face of unemployment.

     The results in this paper suggest an important direction
                                                              for future
research. The sources of noncompetitive wage differentials need to be

isolated. As Stiglitz (1984) notes, different efficiency wage models have

somewhat different implications for a number of positive and normative issues.

Alternative non—competitive, non-efficiency wage theories, while difficult to

specify, undoubtedly also have differing implications.
                                                           Moreover, linking wage
                                    —27—


premia to variables suggested by efficiency wage theories, if possible, would

strengthen the argument by elimination presEnted here. There are, of course,

formidable difficulties of identification so it may be necessary to rely on

case studies to test efficiency wage theories. To this end, Summers (1986)

presents a case study of Henry Ford's introduction of the five dollar day.

Alternatively, production function estimates of the type presented by Brown

and Medoff (1978) might permit estimates of at least some efficiency wage

effects.

                                  APPENDIX

           CORRECTING FOR MEASUREMENT ERROR IN DUMMY VARIABLES IN
                             LONGITUDINAL DATA


    Under usual assumptions, measurement error bias is exacerbated in

longitudinal data because random misclassification in both periods increases

noise while a smaller number of changers reduces signal. Due to the

restricted status of a dummy variable, measurement error is correlated with

the change in a dummy variable in fixed effects models. Freeman (1984)

derives the correction for measurement in this case. The effect of

m!asurement error on a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive dummy

variables is a more complicated problem because the measurement error is

correlated across the dummy variables. In this appendix we derive the

correction for measurement error in more than one dummy variable in

longitudinal data. The procedure is then applied to adjust the estimated

fixed effects results in Section 3.

     We have the following problem. In either time period an individual can

belong to one of k+1 industries. If a worker joins industry i, the change in

dummy variable i is 1; if he leaves industry i the change in dummy variable i

registers a —1; and if he remains in industry I both periods or never is in

industry I, the change in dummy variable registers a 0. For simplicity, we

assume the true model is equation (1), where the change in log wage AW is a

function of k industry dummy variables AD*, and a random disturbance Ae. a is

the, vector of coeficients we want to estimate. All k+1 industry dummies

cannot be in equation (1) because they are colinear -—   if you leave one
industry you must join another. Since the change in industry status is
                                                        —29—


  probably orthogonal to the change in other
                                                                independent variables, such as
  marital status and education,
                                                 equation (1) is a reasonable approximation.

       The measurement error problem arises
                                                               because industry status is reported
 with error in both time periods.
                                                    For industry i we know the
                                                                                  reported AD1,
 which is the true change in status
                                                     plus the classification error,

       Following Freeman (1984), we assume that measurement error is independent

over time and random. We further assume that
                                                                  the measurement error is
proportional to the industry's size and that
                                                                 transitions from industry i to j
equal transitions from .5 to            I.
                                                 Under these assumptions, the distribution of

e1 conditional upon the true transition is reported in Table A2 below. In the

table r11 is the weighted
                                       probability an employee who is not in industry I is

misclassified in industry i, while rIT is the probability of being classified

as not in industry i conditional
                                                  upon being in industry i.              is the true
transition probability. The expected value of ei is equation (3):

                                         1




      And thus AD. can be written as:

where         is an orthogonal disturbance.

        In matrix notation we have:


(5) AU = AU*[I_R]           +   v


where:        R =    K   x K diagonal matrix with (r .                  + r. )   on the diagonal.
                                                               1,1         1,1
               I   = K   x K identity matrix.

              v =    Matrix     of disturbances which are orthogonal to AD*.

      Solving for AD* and substituting the result into the true model we derive

equation (6).


(6)   M.d =   AD[I—Rf1a         -
                                    v(I—RF1a   +   Ac


      From equation (6) it can be seen that an 01.5 regression of M.d on AD

yields a biased and inconsistent estimate of the wage differentials a because

(omitted) v and AD are correlated. A consistent estimator of a is given in

equation (7).



(7) a =
              (AD*1AD*)_jAotAD)[I_R]_1;oLS


      A proof of equation (7) is straightforward and useful for deriving the

standard errors of the estimates. The proof is as follows. Substitution of

the OLS estimate for aOLS in equation (7) yields the following equation.

         =


      And substitution of the true model, equation (1), for Aw in the above

equation gives

         =   (AD*1AD*il(AD1AD)[J_Rf'[(ADTAD)AD1(Ao*a                        +    Ac)].
      Finally, substituting AD' =              (I_RJ'AD*'      +   ul    and cancelling terms results

in equation (8).          (This result relies on the fact that [I—R] is a diagonal
                                            —31—


matrix.) The probability limit of (8) is a, and thus equation (7) is a

consistent estimator.



(8) a = a +    (I-R]       1(AD*'AD*i1{[I_R]1aD*1ag + v'AO*a   +   v'Ae}


Standard Errors

     The asymptotic variance-covariance matrix, V of a is E[(a—a)(a-a)'J. This

is presented in equation (9), where A =        [I_R]1(AD*'AD*).            This relies on the

assumption that Ac is iid.



(9) V =
            A(av'v     +   v'AD*aa'AO*v + a[I-RJ2AD*'Ao*)A'


     All of the terms of equation (9) can be estimated given information on

AD*'AO*, Aw, and AD, except for v'AD*a&AD*v.l However, ignoring this term

will not have an important effect on V if, as is usually the case with

longitudinal data, the variance of the noise is small relative to the residual

variance.

     The standard errors of the coefficients are the square root of the

diagonal elements of (9).


Application

     In order to apply the correction technique we need an estimate of the

misclassification probabilities and the moment matrix of the true industry

change variables, Ao*tAD*. The moment matrix of reported changers, AD'AD is

known. Mellow and Sider (1983) estimate that 7.7 of employee responses to

the industry question in CPS do not match employer responses to the same
                                                  -32-


 question for major industries. However, not all of these responses are

 employee errors. In fact, Mellow and Sider report some evidence that

employers frequently misreport their employees' industry.

       We use 5* as a rough estimate of random
                                                          misclassification in reported
industry status, r.           We   further assume that r.
                      1,1
                                                             1,3 is proportional to the
size   of industry j. The i,jth off—diagonal element of AD*'AD* is the negative

of the number of movers from
                                      industry i to j or j to i, while diagonal element
i,i is the total number of joiners to i and leavers from i. We adjust 8D'AD

for spurious joiners and leavers to derive aD*o*. Workers who truly

switched industry status are assumed to correctly report their industry

status. Under these assumptions, the number of misclassified movers from

industry i to j or 3 to i is:


           2(1-r. )N(T. .r.
                            1,1 I,J
                                      +   1.
                1,1                        •j,j.r..
                                                •3,i j.

1.      In a recent paper, Dickens and Lang (1985) examine the returns to

education and experience across sectors. Their estimating technique allows for

the simultaneous determination of the worker's sector and the characteristics

of the sectors. As a result they can test whether primary sector jobs are

rationed. They conclude that returns to experience and education differ

across sectors, and that some workers are involuntarily confined to secondary

sector jobs.

2.      All results were qualitatively the same when the full 1979 sample was

used.

3.      Since the wage regressions include a constant, we treat the omitted

industry variable as having a zero effect on wages, calculate the employment-

weighted average of wage differentials for all industries, and report the

difference between the industry differentials and the weighted average. The

resulting statistics are the proportionate difference in wages between an

employee in a given industry and the average employee.

4.      We return to the effects of unions in Section 3C.

5.      To crudely adjust the variances for sampling error, we subtract the

weighted average of the sampling variances of the differentials from the

unadjusted variance. The raw correlations are biased for the same reason the

standard deviation is biased. As a result, we adjust the correlation

coefficient of differentials across samples by multiplying them by the ratio

of the biased standard deviation to the unbiased standard deviations. This

procedure can be shown to produce a slight underestimate of the variance of
                                            -34-


the true industry wage differentials because of its neglect of covar-iance

terms.

6.      Note also that these findings bely human capital explanations holding

that differences in the level of wages across industries are caused by

differences in the slope of age or tenure wage profiles.
