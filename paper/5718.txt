         Evidence from the United States, Britain, and France suggests that recent growth in wage

inequality has been accompanied by greater segregation of high- and low-skill workers into separate

firms.    A model    in which workers     of different   skill-levels   are imperfect    substitutes   can

simultaneously account for these increases in segregation and inequality either through technological

change, or, more parsimoniously,   through observed changes in the skill-distribution.

Introduction




           One of the most disturbing economic trends of the last fifteen to twenty years has

been a growing wage gap between high- and low-skill workers in several industrialized

economies, including that of the United States.      This trend has been well documented.        Katz

and Murphy [1992], for example, find that, between 1979 and 1987, wages of men with a

high school education and 1-5 years of experience fell by twenty percent, while those of male

college graduates rose by ten percent.

        This paper provides evidence that this increase in inequality has been accompanied         by

growing segregation of workers by skill.       That is, over time, it has become less common for

high- and low-skill workers to work in the same firm. Economic activity has shifted from

firms such as General Motors, which use both high- and low-skill workers, to firms such as

Microsoft and McDonald’s, whose workforces are much more homogeneous.                For example, in

France, between 1986 and 1992, the correlation of log wages among workers in the same

establishment    rose from 0.36 to 0.44, the correlation of experience rose from 0.11 to 0.16,

and the correlation of seniority grew from 0.24 to 0.31.      In the United States, the correlation

between the wages of manufacturing        production workers in the same plant rose from 0.76 in

1975 to 0.80 in 1986, and the correlation of a dummy variable for being a production worker

rose from 0.195 in 1976 to 0.228 in 1987,

        We propose a simple model that can account for the simultaneous          increases in

inequality and in segregation, as well as for the absolute decline in wages of low-skill

workers.     In the model, workers of different skill-levels are imperfect substitutes,   and output
                                                                                                                2

is more sensitive to skill in some tasks than in others.        What happens in such a model when,

as the evidence bears out (see below), the dispersion and mean of the skill-distribution

increase?      We show that a rise in skill-dispersion     causes firms that once hired both high- and

low-skill workers to specialize in one level or the other, thereby fostering segregation

(Proposition     3). Although, in this model, an increase in mean skill-level can enhance the

wages of the poor -- thus formalizing       the so-called “trickle-down” principle (Proposition         1) --

we demonstrate that this principle relies crucially on a “tight” distribution          of skills.   Once the

skill-distribution   becomes sufficiently dispersed -- as it is now likely to be in the United

States -- a further increase in mean skill-level raises the wages of high-skilled           workers but

causes those of poorly-skilled     workers to decline, thereby aggravating inequality (Proposition

2).

         Note that this last implication contrasts with a widespread view of the labor market

articulated by Schmitt [1992]:       “Rising returns to skills in the face of large increases in the

supply of skilled labor suggest a substantial shift in labor demand in favor of skilled

workers. ” Whereas labor economists        such as Schmitt see rising mean-skill levels as

deepening the mystery of increasing inequality, our analysis suggests this rise in mean-skill

may have helped cause the increase in inequality.

         The model’s implication     that increases in skill-dispersion      promote segregation of

workers by skill is consistent not only with the time-series data cited above, but also with

evidence that, among U.S. states, those with wider dispersion in educational attainment are

more segregated by education in employment.              Casual empiricism     suggests that developing

countries, with wide dispersion of skill, are particularly prone to dualism.
                                                                                                          3

         We noted above that there is evidence that both the mean and the dispersion of the

skill-distribution   have increased in the economies studied in this paper.       It has been argued

(see Kahn and Lim [1994]) that skill-biased         technological   change may have raised the

effective skill-level of high-skill workers, which would have had the posited effects on the

distribution   of skills.    Of course, such technological   change is difficult to measure,   However,

there is also documentation       of increases in the mean and dispersion of observable skills levels

(see Juhn, Murphy, and Pierce [1993]).          These shifts have been fairly modest, but our model

shows how they could have been magnified into significant changes in the income distribution

and degree of segregation.

         The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.          Section I offers a sketch of our

model and the theoretical results.       Section II presents evidence that the United States, Britain,

and France have become more segregated in recent years.             Section 111develops our theoretical

propositions    in detail.   Section IV provides evidence that U.S. states with greater skill

dispersion are more segregated by skill, as the model predicts.          Section V interprets recent

increases in inequality and segregation in light of the model.         The conclusion discusses policy

implications    and speculates on the possibility    that segregation may spur inequality by

reducing opportunities       for low-skill workers to learn from higher-skill   co-workers, giving rise

to a vicious cycle of increasing inequality and segregation.




I. A Sketch of the Theory




         A model consistent with the stylized facts about segregation and inequality discussed
above must incorporate three ingredients.          Specifically,   it should be the case that

(i)    workers of different skills are imperfect substitutes for one another;

(ii)   different tasks within a firm are complementary;

and

(iii) different tasks within a firm are differentially       sensitive to skill.

          To see why (i), imperfect substitutability,      is needed, let us examine a model in which

perfect substitutability   obtains.    Specifically,   consider workers of two skill-levels q’ and q =

2q’. Then, in every firm, a worker of skill q can be replaced by two of skill q’, with no

other operational    change.    Clearly, q-workers will be paid exactly twice as much as q’-

workers regardless of the distribution       of skills in the economy.      Moreover, such a model

makes no prediction about what skill-levels we will see in a firm: there could as easily be one

worker of skill q as two of skill q’, To make any headway in explaining either inequality or

segregation, therefore, imperfect substitutability        of skill is required.

          In fact, there is a body of work within the labor economics literature that assumes

such imperfect substitutability       (see Sattinger [1993] for a review).         There is also empirical

evidence to justify the assumption;        see Katz and Murphy [1992] and Murphy and Welch

[1992].

          To understand the role of assumption         (ii), complementarily,     consider a firm in which

there are two tasks -- a “g” task and an “h” task -- but no complementarily                between them.

Specifically, take a production function in which, if a q-worker is hired for the g-task and a
q’-worker for the h-task, output is


 (1)
                                         f(~,9’) = g(q)+~(q’).


Different skills are imperfect substitutes in this formulation:      only one worker can be hired for

each task, and so the sort of two-for-one substitution       contemplated   above is ruled out. This

means that relative wages may depend on the distribution          of skills; if, for example, the

number of q-workers rises relative to that of q’-workers, the former workers’ wages are

likely to experience a relative decline.     Thus, unlike the first model, this formulation        may say

something about inequality.      However, it still implies nothing about the skill-composition         of

firms.   In particular, because tasks are not complementary,       the optimal choice of skill for the

g-task is independent    of that for the h-task.

         Finally, to understand the need for (iii), differential skill-sensitivity,   consider a

production function in which different tasks are complementary           but identical in their

sensitivity to skill:


 (2)                                         f(934’)   = 49’.

This is the production function used by Becker [1981] in his analysis of assortative marriage,

and also by Kremer [1993] in his study of labor markets and development.              It has the

implication that there is always comDlete segregation of skill within firms: q-workers are

matched only with other q-workers, etc. To see this, imagine that there are two q-workers

and two q’-workers.      Then either the q-workers can be matched with each other and the same

for the q’-workers (self-matching)     or else there can be two matches consisting of one q- and

one q’-workers each (cross-matching).        But self-matching    leads to total output of q2+q’2
                                                                                                       6

which is greater than the output of 2qq’ resulting from cross-matching.         Hence, regardless of

the distribution   of skills, production function (2) implies that we should see only self-

matching, and so the evolution from General Motors to Microsoft/McDonald’s              discussed

above could not have taken place.       We shall therefore introduce an asymmetry between tasks

by working with a production function of the form,


 (4)
                                          f(939’)= qcq’d,

where    t)<c<~.    By redefining the unit of skill, we can rewrite this as



 (3)
                                       ~( 93q’) = 94”,     e>l.

For ease of computation     (although none of the qualitative results depend on this), we shall, in

fact, take e=2, so that


 (5)
                                           flq,q’)   = 4q’2.

We can think of the q ‘-task (which is relatively sensitive to skill) as the “managerial”      task

and the q-task (which is relatively skill-insensitive)   as the “assistant’s” role.   Hence, let us

rewrite the production function as


 (6)
                                                 = 9aq:.
                                          fi9as~m)


Production function (6) has the implication     that if a firm employs workers of skills L and H

(L< H), it is more efficient for the H-worker to be the manager (since LH2 > HL2). This

production function is closely related to one used by Rosen [1981, 1982], Miller [1983], and

Lucas [1978]:
 (7)




where qm is the skill of the manager, qi is the skill of subordinate     i, and r, the number of

subordinates,   is a choice variable.   Under production function (7), there is no substitutability

of skill at the managerial level, but several low-skill subordinates    can be substituted for one

high-skill subordinate.    Hence, in equilibrium,   low-skill workers become subordinates,      and

high-skill workers become managers.        The higher a manager’s skill, the more employees he

supervises.

        By contrast, our production function (6) imposes imperfect substitutability       on

subordinates    as well as on managers. (In this sense, it combines the approaches inherent in (2)

and (7).) This has the implication that, in equilibrium,     a manager of one firm may be of the

same or lower skill than a subordinate in another firm (even though, as already noted,

managers are more highly skilled than subordinates       within the same firm).    For example, an

M.B.A. might choose either to accept an entry-level position with high-skill colleagues at an

investment bank, or a more senior position at a less prestigious firm.

        We consider a one-good economy in which there is an exogenous distribution             of

workers of different skill. We take this distribution     as given because, although ultimately it

too is endogenous,    it is likely to change more slowly than the wage and matching patterns of

interest to us. We suppose that there is an indefinite supply of potential firms, all of which

have the production function (6). Hence, this is a competitive       economy with constant returns

to scale.
                                                                                                             8

        Our theoretical results (Propositions      1-3 in Section III) examine how the competitive

equilibrium   wage distribution   and the pattern of skill-levels within firms are affected by shifts

in the distribution of skills. Here we give a simplified account of these results.

        Proposition    3 shows that, as the dispersion of skills increases in the economy, the

relative dispersion of skill within firms falls.     To get a feel for this, suppose that there are just

two skill-levels, L and H, where L < H. Now, given two workers of skill L and two workers

of skill H, it is more efficient for the workers to cross-match      (L-workers match with H-

workers) rather than self-match (workers of the same skill-level match) if and only if


 (8)                                        L3 + H3 K 2LH2.

Thus because competitive      equilibrium   is efficient, we will have equilibrium    cross-matching    if

and only if (8) is satisfied, i.e.,



 (9)
                                                       &




        Imagine that the economy begins with a skill-distribution        in which L and H are fairly

close in value.     From (9), we will have cross-matching      in equilibrium,   i.e., each firm --

following the G.M. pattern -- will employ both low- and high-skill workers.             (This cannot be

literally true if there are different numbers of L- and H-workers in the economy.            If, say,

there are more H’s than L’s, all the L’s will be matched with Hs, and the remaining Hs will

be self-matched.)

        Suppose now that the dispersion of skills increases. This can be modeled by supposing

that H increases and L decreases,      Eventually (9) will no longer hold, at which point the

economy will re-align so that there is @         self-matching.   That is, each firm will have only
H-workers (Microsoft) or only L-workers (McDonald’s).

          To understand this result less formally, note that there are two forces at work in

determining    the equilibrium     matching pattern.    On the one hand, the asymmetry of the tasks

in the production function militates in favor of cross-matching          between workers of different

skills, in which the more highly skilled worker is assigned the managerial task.             On the other

hand, the complementarily        between tasks promotes self- (i.e., assortative) matching.       Now,

when tasks are perfectly symmetric, only the second effect is present, and we have perfect

assortative matching.     For any given degree of asymmetry between tasks, however, there will

be some deviation from self-matching.           That is, unequally skilled workers will be cross-

hatched    up to the point in which the difference in their skills is so great that the second

effect overwhelms the first.       At that point, as in the above two-point example, the economy

switches to self-matching.       Proposition    3 generalizes this logic to the case of many skill-

levels.

          Let us turn to the issue of wages.      Proposition   1 demonstrates   that if the distribution

of skills has sufficiently low dispersion, then an increase in the mean skill-level reduces

inequality in the sense that the wages of low-skill workers rise, whereas those of high-skill

workers decline.     Proposition    2 establishes that the opposite is true if the distribution    of skills

is sufficiently highly dispersed.      That is, with a diffuse skill-distribution,   an increase in the

mean skill-level aggravates wage inequality.

          To see why these propositions        hold in a simple case, consider an economy with three

skill-levels, L < M < H, and let us suppose that H and L satisfy (9). For easy computation,

assume that there are equal numbers (say, x each) of L- and H-workers and that the number
                                                                                                   10

of M-workers is at least 2x. Because H and L satisfy (9), we know that it is inefficient for L-

and H-workers to be self-matched.      In fact, we claim that both L- and H-workers should be

matched with M-workers.       The alternative would be for the L- and H-workers to be matched

with each other.     But notice that, since L c M and M < H,


 (lo)                               LH2 + M3 c U2        + MH2.



Condition (10) implies that total output would be raised by taking an L- and an H-worker

who are matched with each other and rematching both with M-workers (who were previously

self-matched).     Now, because there is perfect competition   and constant returns to scale, firms

make zero profit in equilibrium.     Hence workers must absorb all revenue.     Since there are

more than ti M-workers, at least one pair must be self-matched       in equilibrium,   in which case
their firm’s revenue is M3. Therefore, the equilibrium M-wage is



 (11)                                             M3
                                           w(M) = —.
                                                   2




Thus, the zero profit requirement   implies that the equilibrium   L-wage is



 (12)                                                           M3
                               w(L) = LM2 -     W(M    =   LM2- —.
                                                                 2




Similarly,



 (13)                                               M3
                                       w(H) = MHZ - —.
                                                     2




        To model the idea of an increase in the mean skill-level, let us examine a small

increase in M. The derivatives of w(L) and w(H) with respect to M are, respectively,



 (14)                                      2LM - ;M2




and



 (15)
                                                                                                          12

            The assumption of “low” dispersion of skill -- the assumption       treated by Proposition        1

-- corresponds in this three-skill model to the condition that H = L. In this case, (14) is

positive, whereas (15) is negative.      But this means that w(L) rises and w(~        falls as M

increases, which is what Proposition       1 asserts.

            By contrast, it is readily shown that if

which corresponds       to the higher dispersion of Proposition   2, then (14) is negative and (15) is

positive.     Hence w(L) falls while w(~     rises when M increases, as required by Proposition          2,

        To understand Proposition       1 at a more intuitive level, notice that when L = M the

share of the revenue going to the M-worker in an L-M match (i.e., M3/2 ) rises with M more

slowly than does the total product M2.         Hence an increase in M confers a positive benefit on

L: the net marginal revenue left over after the M-worker is paid for his higher product is

positive.     This can be viewed as a manifestation     of the “trickle-down”    principle, the theory

that propounds that some of the fruits generated by improving the productivity            of middle- and

upper-class workers will accrue to the poor.

            In our model, however, the trickle-down principle pertains only to skill-distributions

with low dispersion.       If L and M are far enough apart, a further increase in M causes the

benefits from cross-matching       between L and M to deteriorate relative to those from self-

matching.       Therefore since w(M rises, w(L) must fall. At the same time, this increase in M

enhances the quality of a match between M and H (provided M and H were far enough apart
                                                                                                      13

to begin with), raising w(~.     Hence, an increase in mean skill-level causes the wage gap

between H- and L- workers to increase, as Proposition     2 establishes.

       Notice that our model has the feature that workers of median skill (M-workers in the

above example) can serve in equilibrium     as either managers or assistants, depending on whom

they are matched with.    This is a property that generalizes to the case of many skill-levels

(see Section III). We will speculate on its political and social implications   in the conclusion.




II. Rising Segregation    by Skill




       We offer evidence that segregation of workers by skill has increased in the United

States, Britain, and France.   Subsection 11.A defines the index we use to measure segregation,

and Subsection 11.B shows that the index has increased in these three countries when skill is

measured by any of three proxies: wages, worker classification,     and experience.




11.A. The Segregation    Index

       Sociologists   have used an index of correlation to measure segregation by dichotomous

variables, such as race [Bell, 1954; Robinson,   1950]. In this section, we propose an index of

segregation that generalizes this measure of correlation so that it can be applied to variables

taking on many values.    We also adjust it to take account of the concentration      of high-skill

workers that would have been expected purely from chance.        (Ellison and Glaeser [1994]

develop an index of geographic concentration     designed to address similar issues.)     Appendix I

discusses how confidence intervals can be constructed     around the estimated segregation index.
                                                                                                  14

        Suppose that there are J firms (or plants) in the sample indexed by j = 1, ....J. Let Zj

be the set of workers in firm ~ and zj the number of workers in this firm.      Given a measure of

skill, q, such as wages, education, or worker classification,    denote the mean skill-level in the



sample by     q (i.e., g = ~    ~ qi /N, where N is the total number of workers in the sample).
                           j4   iEZ,




Define p as our index of correlation or segregation:




 (17)




where workers are indexed by i and k (so that qi is the skill-level of worker i). A correlation

of zero indicates that all firms have the same skill-mix of workers, and a correlation of one

indicates complete segregation,        in which all workers within a firm have the same q. Note
                                                                                                     15

that this index is invariant to affine transformations   of the units in which skill is measured.z

        The index of correlation, p, is equivalent to one minus the variance of q within firms

divided by the overall variance of q, and thus to the R2 obtained by regressing q on a series


of firm dummies.    To see this, add and subtract the mean       q ~ within each firm j to obtain:




 (18)                                                    Zj                1,




    21n the case of a dummy variable, the correlation specializes to the index used by Bell
[1954] and Robinson [1950],




where D denotes the dummy variable. Note that this index normalizes the variance across
plants of the proportion of workers for whom the dummy variable equals one by dividing by
the variance of the dummy variable in the total population. Without normalization,
segregation by production-worker status, for example, would appear higher in an economy
with five firms consisting only of non-production workers and ninety-five consisting only of
production workers than in an economy with one firm consisting of only non-production
workers and ninety-nine firms consisting of production workers. After normalizing, however,
we find that both economies have the maximum segregation index of one.
                                                                                                       16

After deleting the terms which equal zero, we can simplify to


                                        J



 (19)                                                                       —sb2
                                                                             7’
                                                                             ST




where SW’and s~z represent the variance of g within and between firms, respective y, and ST’

represents the total variance of q in the economy.        For example,



 (20)




        One virtue of this index is that, since p depends only on the variance of q in the

population   and on the variance of mean q between firms, it can be calculated using separate

data sources for workers and firms.         This is useful if data linking employees and their firms

are unavailable,   as in the United States.

        Note that if firms are of finite size, there will be some correlation between the skill-

Ievels of workers in the same firm, even if workers are assigned to firms randomly.            That is,

some firms will happen to receive workers of above-average           skill, and others will receive

workers of below-average     skill.   If all firms consisted of K workers, then, with random

assignment, the variance of mean skill between firms would be 1/K times the over-all
                                                                                                        17

variance of skill between workers, and the expected correlation would thus be l/K.

        To compare the extent of segregation across economies with different average firm

sizes, or to determine whether an economy exhibits more segregation than would be expected

purely from chance, it may be helpful to use the adjusted R2 as a corrected index of

segregation:



                                        s; /(N -J-)
 (21)                     pc=l-

                                        s; /(N-l)
                                                      =1 -(l T)H
                                                                 [1N-J
                                                                         =R2,



To see how this index corrects for finite firm size, suppose that a proportion y of the

population matches with other workers of exactly the same skill, and that a proportion            l-y

matches randomly.     Let o~2 denote the variance of the underlying stochastic process

generating workers’ skills,       As noted above, s~2for the set of firms whose workers are drawn

randomly will converge to o~2/K as N+=,             where K is the number of workers per firm.     Since

the variance of wages within firms plus the variance of mean wages between firms must

equal the total variance of wages, the variance of wages within the set of firms with randomly

drawn workers converges to (1- l/~o~2.         Since the variance of wages within the firms

consisting of perfectly-matched       workers is zero, SW2for the set of all firms converges to

(l-y)(l - l/m(sT2. Note that in a sample of N workers, the expectation ofs;         is (N-1 )o~2/N.

Substituting   these expressions for SW2and s~2 into (21) and using the fact that K = N/J, we see

that pC converges to y, which, as desired, is the proportion of the population that matches

with others of the same skill.       Simulations    suggest that the expectation of pC is y even when

N is small, and even when firms vary in size.
                                                                                                          18

        Two properties of pC are worth noting.          First, holding N and J constant, increases in p

correspond to increases in pC. In Section III, we demonstrate          how changes in the distribution

of skill affect p. Given that we hold the number of workers per firm constant, changes in pC

will always be of the same sign as changes in p. Second, the adjusted R-squared may be

negative if the correlation between the skills of workers in the same firm is less than that

expected from random assignment of workers to firms.




11.B. Trends in Segregation

        Wages, experience, and worker classification         are all mperfect indicators of skill, but

together they paint a consistent picture of increasing segregation.          Positive correlation of

wages among workers in the same firm may be due to segregation by skill or to

compensating     differentials,   efficiency wages, or pressures for equity within the firm.

However, there is little reason to think these latter factors increased in importance over the

period, especially given the decline of unions in the United States and Britain.           Worker

classification   (for example, into production and non-production        worker categories) is also

somewhat problematic        as a measure of skill, since it reflects characteristics   of the job, as well

as of the worker.     Nonetheless,    non-production    worker status is correlated with wages, and

thus is presumably correlated with skill.       Berman, Bound, and Machin [1994] show that in the

United States, non-production        workers are more highly educated than production workers and

much more likely to be managers or professionals.

        Where possible, we measure indicators of skill at plant level rather than firm level.

Plant data are likely to be more economically          meaningful than firm data, since it is not clear
                                                                                                    19

that anything of economic importance changes if a holding company acquires both Microsoft

and McDonalds.       However, even the plant data may be misleading since they include only

workers employed by the firm owning the plant and therefore indicate increased segregation

when firms contract out work.3 The American and British data are at the plant level, whereas

the French data are at the level of the business unit, which is conceptually      closer to the

American firm than to the plant.

        The best available data come from France.       The Wage Structure Surveys (ESS),

performed by INSEE in 1986 and 1992, examined a sample of 10,719 business units and

318,332 workers in 1986, and 3,803 business units and 42,783 workers in 1992.4 The sample

was drawn from all business units with at least ten employees, excluding agriculture,

transportation,   telecommunications,   and services to individuals.   Table I, drawn from

Kramarz, Lollivier, and Pele [1996], shows that between 1986 and 1992, the correlation of

log wages among workers in the same business unit rose from 0.36 to 0.44, the correlation of

experience rose from 0,11 to 0.16 and the correlation of seniority rose from 0.24 to 0.31.

Segregation according to each of the six categories of worker classification       rose as well. For

example, unskilled blue-collar workers were more likely to be grouped together in firms, as

were engineers, professionals,    and managers.    Worker classification   is likely to be a good




     3 In the U. S., increases in the importance of pensions, combined with pension laws
requiring all workers to be treated equally, may have provided a small impetus toward such
contracting out over the period studied, but any increase in correlation from this source is
likely to have been more than counter-balanced by declines in wage correlation within plants
due to the weakening of unions.

    4 The ratio of workers to business units is smaller in 1992 because fewer workers were
sampled per firm.
                                                                                                  20

measure of skill in France, because it is governed by fairly precise rules.   We should also

mention that Kramarz, Lollivier, and Pele found that besides increasing segregation, the

period from 1986 to 1992 was also a period of rising inequality,

        In the United States, data linking workers and their plants are hard to come by,

However, segregation of workers by wage can be calculated using the Davis and Haltiwanger

[1991] estimates of the variance of wages among all workers from the CPS and of the

variance of average wages between plants from the Census of Manufactures.        Unfortunate y,

taking the ratio of estimates from two different data sources makes the measure of segregation
                                                                                                            21

noisier.    Moreover, data are available only for manufacturing       workers and reliable data only

for production workers within manufacturing.       However, since services are a growing share of

the economy, and services such as finance, restaurants, and law are highly segregated by skill,

their exclusion is likely to lead to underestimation    of any increase in sorting,

           Table II reports between- and within-plant   variances of production worker wages in

manufacturing,5 taken from Davis and Haltiwanger         [1991].     The final line reports the

correlation between wages of production workers within the same plant.c Both within-plant

and between-plant     variances of wages have increased, reflecting the widely documented rise

in inequality in recent years.    However, if there had been no realignment        of the way relative

skills were grouped within firms, both variances would have increased in the same ratio.               In

fact, the between-plant    variance increased proportionately      more than the within-plant     variance.

Thus, although the data are imperfect, and estimates for 1984 seem particularly           suspect, the

correlation between wages of production workers within the same firm increased from 1975

to 1986, as shown in the final row.’




     51t is not possible to obtain reliable data on non-production workers because of
differences in the sampling frames between the two surveys used by Davis and Haltiwanger.
However, the available data show no trend in segregation among non-production workers.
The segregation index was .447 in 1975 and .443 in 1986.

     c Note that these correlations are higher than those reported in France, because these data
include only production workers, whereas the French data include all workers. The variance
of production workers’ wages within plants is much smaller than that of all workers.

     ‘Given the large sample sizes, sampling error is likely to be small, and noise in these
estimates is probably due to other factors, such as business-cycle effects,

            British evidence also shows increased segregation by worker classification.9                The 1984

and 1990 Workplace Industrial Relations Surveys (WIRS) divide employment                       in each of 402

British establishments        into manual and non-manual components.          Manual employment           is then

further subdivided into unskilled, semi-skilled,          and skilled; and non-manual employment             is

subdivided into (i) clerical, secretarial, and administrative       staffi (ii) supervisors and foremen;

(iii) junior technical/professional;     (iv) senior technical/professional,   and (v) middle/senior

management.      Table IV shows that sorting increased in most worker classifications.           For

example, the correlation of a dummy variable for middle/senior             managers between workers in

the same firm increased from 0,058 in 1984 to 0.077 in 1990. Sorting of senior

professional/technical   staff also increased, contributing      to an increase in sorting among all

upper-grade, non-manual workers.           There was a rise in segregation among clerical workers,

and among all non-manual workers taken as a whole.               Within the category of manual

workers, sorting declined among skilled and semi-skilled            manual workers, but increased

among unskilled manual workers.            Note that the British evidence, unlike that from the United

States and France, indicates that segregation increased among a fixed sample of plants rather

than just in the economy as a whole.

        Section 111explores how segregation and wages are jointly determined given the

technology and the distribution        of skill.

III. Theory




        Let us extend the analysis of Section I -- which was conducted for two- and three-

point skill-distributions     -- to more general distributions.   We maintain the hypotheses of

competitive     markets and production function (6).


        We consider a pair of distributions       of types on the integers between           ~ and
                                                                                             —        ~ ,



parametrized by 6     ●     (O,1 ). For given e, let p(n;9) be the number of workers of skill-level n.

The values 13= O and e = 1 correspond to the “pre-shift” and “post-shift” distributions,



respectively.    Let p(e) be the mean of p(. ;e). That is,        p(e)    = ~np(n;O) / ~P(n;e)       . We
                                                                              n=        n=




assume that p(e) also equals n“(e), the mode of the distribution.

         Recall from Section I that, if the ratio of two workers’ skill-levels was greater than A

= 2/(1+51’2), then it was more efficient for each of them to match with another of his or her

own skill-level (self-matching),      rather than match with one another (cross-matching).           Let n,

be the smallest integer no less than An*(l); let nz be the smallest integer no less than


(3/2) 1’2n*(l); and let n] be the smallest integer no less than          @n    ●
                                                                               (1) . We assume that, for



e = O, 1, p(n;e) is “sufficiently peaked” near the mode n“(e), More precisely, “sufficiently

        As will become clear below, condition (22), which is imposed mainly to simplify the

computations,10 ensures that at least some workers of modal skill will have to self-match, i.e.,

match with others of the same skill in competitive                     equilibrium.          Given the zero-profit

condition, this will serve to tie down their wage (which is why (22) is so convenient to

impose).    Conditions   (23) and (24) imply that in equilibrium,                        some workers of every skill

level between nl and n“(e) and between n+(e) and nj will also match with modal workers,

           Both the mean level and the dispersion of skill have increased in recent decades.

We consider a shift in the distribution              of skill in which, as 6 increases from O to 1, (i) the




     ‘°Condition (22) can be relaxed considerably.                     However, the argument becomes
correspondingly more complicated.

and (ii) the lower and upper tails get fatter symmetrical y but retain their “relative shapes, ”

i.e., there exists q > 1 such thatll

        We first show that if the distributions p(. ; . ) are “tight” enough -- i.e., if          ~       is




sufficiently close to   — -- then an increase in 9 promotes equality in the sense that wages in
                        ~



the lower tail of the distribution     rise and wages in the upper tail of the distribution       fall,




Proposition   1 (The Trickle-Down       Principle):   Suppose that p(. ;.) satisfies (22)-(25),    Given




      llWe adopt (26) not because it is necessarily realistic, but because it facilitates the
presentation of our results. In particular, we wish to argue that, if the skill-distribution is
sufficiently dispersed, then a typical worker in the lower end of the distribution will see his
wage fall and one in the upper end of the distribution will experience a wage increase when
the mean skill-level rises. We demonstrate this (Proposition 2) by showing that the average
wages in the lower and upper tails, respective y, fall and increase. But a change in the
average wage would not be a good measure of what happens to a given worker if the relative
distribution of skills also changed. Hence, (26) makes comparisons easier, although our
qualitative results do not depend on it.

         We establish Proposition     1 through a series of Lemmas.




Lemma 1: For any n’, if n is such that


 (29)                                             n<   An’,


then workers of skills n and n’ cannot be matched in equilibrium.




Proof    As demonstrated   in Section I, total output for two workers of skill n and two workers

of skill n’ when they are cross-matched       (i.e., 2nn’2 ) is be less than that when they are self-

matched (i.e., n3+n’3) if n/n’cA,                                                                Q.E.D,




Lemma z:         w(n “(6);0)   = (n “((3))3/ 2.




Proof    From (22), even if all workers of all skills n’#n*(e) between An*(9) and n*(e)/A were

matched with workers of skill n*((3), there would still be some n*(f3)-workers left over.
                                                                                                                             29

Moreover, from Lemma 1, no skill outside the interval [An”(e), n*(9)/A] can be matched with

n*(6) in equilibrium.       Therefore, at least some n*(6) -workers must be self-matched                       in

equilibrium.     But this means that they earn 1/2 the output of a firm with two workers of skill

n“(e).                                                                                                                   Q.E.D.

n*=n*((3). Total output with the assignments                (n,n”) and (n”,n’) is Y* = n           **n + n’2n*.     To

prove the lemma, we need to show that Y’ > Y. Note that

Defining z = nln”, and z’ = n’in”, we obtain


                           ~=   Y*-Y=z+z,2                                        (Z’ =-1)(1-z).

Since    n’ > n*, Z’ >1,    and since n < n*, z   <1.        Thus the result follows.                                    Q.E.D.

show that total production by the firms (n,n’) and (n”,n”) (i.e., Y) is less than that by the

firms (n ,n”) and (n’,n”)(i.e., Y ‘). Here, Y =        n’2n + n*3 ,      and Y’ = n*2n + n’zn’. This

implies that


 (32)                              Y’-Y =   n“zn    + n“zn’     - n’zn    - n*3.



Dividing the right-hand side of (32) by n*3, we obtain


 (33)                z+   z’-   ~’ 2Z - 1 = 2(1 -2’2) + 2’-1         = (1 -2’)(2(1     +2’)- 1).


Now, l-z’ is positive, since      n’<n”.   As for   z(1 +Z   ‘)-l, it is increasing in both z and      z‘, so we



need only check that it is non-negative       at the bottom of the range: z = z’ = A. But at this

point it vanishes.                                                                           Q.E.D.




Lemma i:        If n G (An”(e), n*(f3)), then some n-workers are matched with n*((3) in equilibrium

and so w(n;6) = n(n”(e))z - (n*(e) )3/2,




Proof:   If n   ●   (An”(e), n“(6)), then from (23) and Lemma 1, the n-workers cannot be matched

exclusively with skills no greater than An”(e).          But from Lemma 3, they cannot be matched

with skills greater than n“(e) and, from Lemma 4, they cannot be matched with skills greater

than An”(e) and less than n*(0). Thus by process of elimination,                   some n-workers must be

matched with n*(e) -workers in equilibrium.           From Lemma 2, we conclude that               w(n;e)   =



n(n*(6))2 - (n*((3))3/2.                                                     Q.E.D.

Proof: Assume without loss of generality that n’ 2 n. Let Y’ denote total production with the

assignments       (n”,n) and (n*,n’), where n“=n”(e). Then Y’ = nzn” + n’zn”. Let Y denote

production with the assignments             (n,n’) and (n”,n”). Then Y =              n’2n+n*3.   Dividing Y’ - Y by

n*3 we   obtain


 (34)                   z=+ z’=- Z’= z-l            = Z’2 (1-z)+     Z=-1 = (Z-l) (z+l-z’=).


Now, z-l is positive.         As for z+l -      z ‘2, it   is increasing in z and decreasing in z’. Hence it


attains a minimum when            z =   1 and      z‘= ~,        at which point it vanishes.                    Q.E.D.

                                                     (g).   Thus some n-workers must be



matched with n*(9)-workers in equilibrium.     From Lemma 2, we deduce (35).

                                                                                                Q.E.D.




        We can now establish Proposition      1. Given a sufficiently tight distribution   of skills,

all workers will have skill greater than An*(0). Lemma 5 implies, therefore, that, for each

skill level below the mean, at least some workers will have managers of mean skill in

equilibrium.   Hence, an increase in the mean skill implies that low-skill workers will have

better managers and therefore that their firms will produce more output.         Because the wage

that their managers can obtain from self-matching      increases by less than this increase in

output, the assistants will receive part of the increased value of their matches.      That is, the

wages of the low-skilled will rise. A tight distribution    also means that no worker has skill


greater than   fin   “(e).   Lemma 7 implies, therefore, that for each skill level above the



mean, at least some workers will have assistants of mean skill in equilibrium.         An increase in

mean skill produces an increase in output for such matches.       However, the wage from self-

matching for those of mean skill will increase by more than output, and hence wages for

high-skill workers will fall in response to this shift in mean skill.      More formally, we have:




Proof of Proposition   1: Suppose     ~   is near enough     ~   so that      E 2 (2/3) 1’2fi. Because
                                                                                                      33


  (2/3)ln >314>       A, we have       u 2 (2/3) 1’2fi> 3n”(0)/4 > An”(e).    Hence, if n e n*(0),



Lemma 5 implies that w(n;e) = n(n*(e))2 - (n*(9))3/2. Thus dw(n;8)/dn*(6) = n*(e)(2n -

3n*(9)/2).   Since n > 3n*(9)/4, this derivative is positive, and so w(n;e) is increasing in e.


        Because       ?2●
                        (e) > U     and    (3/2)112< @,




 (36)



And so, if n > n*(8), Lemma 7 implies that w(n;e) = n*(e)n2 - (n*(e) )3/2.       Hence



 (37)                             dw(n;6) /dn ‘(0) = n2 - ~ (n “(6))2 .


From (36), this derivative is negative, and so w(n;f3) is decreasing in e.

                                                                                                  Q.E.D.




        We now turn to the case in which the distributions p(. ;.) are more diffuse.      In that

case, an increase e works against equality.      To see this, let nl(e) be the smallest integer

greater than An”(O) (recall that nl =nl(l)),   and let S[ consist of all workers with skills no

greater than nl(l).   Lemma 8 below will show that any worker in S1, except possibly for an

nl(0)- or nl(l)-worker,   is matched in equilibrium    with another worker in S1. Moreover, from

Lemmas 3, 4, and 8, any nl(0)- or nl(l )- worker not matched with another worker in S1 is

matched with an n*(9)-worker.        Hence, the average wage of workers in SI equals the sum of
                                                                                                       34

(i) the total output of matches between workers in S, and (ii) the wages of n,(0)- and n,(l)-

workers matched with n“(e)-workers, all divided by the number of workers in S1. But

W(nl(l );(3) falls as (3 increases because the wage of an n“(e)-worker from self-matching

increases faster than the output from an nl( 1)-n”(e) match.      Moreover, Lemma 1 implies that

in equilibrium    there are no matches between nl(0)- and n“(1)-workers, and so, for the purpose

of calculating (ii), we can assume that w(n1(0);(3) also falls as e increases.       Furthermore,   from

(26), the relative distribution   of skills in S1 does not change as (3 increases.    Hence, the

decrease in (ii) cannot be made up for by an increase in (i). We conclude that the average

wage of workers in S1 must fall.

         Next consider the set Sz consisting of workers of skill no less than nz (the smallest

integer no less than (3/2) 1’2n*(
                                1)). The average wage of workers in Sz equals the sum of (i)

the total output from matches between workers in Sz, and (ii) the wages of workers in Sz

matched with workers with skills in the interval [n”(e), nz-1], all divided by the number of

workers in Sz. Now, nz is big enough so that, for n 2 nz, the wage of an n“(e)-worker from

self-matching     increases more slowly than the output from an n*(0)-n match.        Hence, the wage

of an n-worker matched with an n“(e)-worker increases with e. Moreover, the argument of

Proposition     1 implies that, for n’= (n*(9),n1), w(n’;(3) falls with e. Hence, the wage of an n-

worker   (n > n2)   matched with an n’-worker must rise. We conclude that (ii) must rise with (3

and, so from (26), the average wage in Sz also rises.

         Formally, we can state:




Proposition z: Suppose that the distributions p(. ;.) satisfy (22)-(26) and are sufficiently
                                                                                                      35


diffuse so that    ~ < ~1 and ~2 < ~. Then the average wage in the tail below n, falls as 8
                   —



increases from O to 1. More precisely, we have




Similarly, the average wage inthetail        above nz increases with (3:

                             ~.?                        ~.~

                                 K                           ii




The formal proof of Proposition        2 is given in Appendix 2.




Lemmas:       Letnl(e)   be the smallest integer no less than An*(6) (sothatn1(l)=n1).        Ifn<

An”(e) and an n-worker is matched with a worker of skill n’ 2 An”(e) in equilibrium,           then

n’ = n,(e).




        The proof, which is in Appendix II, calculates the profit for a firm hiring an assistant

of skill n < An”(e).     It shows   that profit will be higher with a manager of skill nl(f3) than with

one of greater skill.
                                                                                                                       36

Segregation

        We now turn to the issue of segregation.               We will show that an increase in skill

dispersion accompanied by a rise in the mean skill-level leads to an increase in the index of

segregation, provided that the shift in the mean is not too large relative to that of dispersion.

        To make this last proviso formal, we will no longer work with distributions                       on the


integers alone.       Instead fix (rational) numbers        b— and     ~ with   o < —
                                                                                    b < ~. For each integer


r=   1, 2, .... choose integers —
                                n’ and fi r, such that -—
                                                       b = ~ ‘/r and ~ = ~ ‘. For each r, we


consider a pair of distributions          (p,(.;O), pr(.; l)), where for all integers   n   ●    [u’, ~ q, p, (n; e)


is the number of workers of skill n/r. From (25), notice that, if r is big, the shift in the mean

is small when 6 increases from O to 1.

        Let us suppose that there exist a >1 and ~ c 1 such that, for all r, (p,(.;O), p,(.; l))

satisfies (22)-(26) and


 (40)                              pr(n; 1) < ~pr(n; O), for all n~(nl,nz).



Condition (40) says that the shift from e = O to e = 1 reduces probability                      more-or-less

uniformly in the middle of the distribution,             Henceforth, we will drop the subscript r when

this does not create ambiguity.

        For   n, n’   and e, let   z(n, n’; (3) be   the equilibrium    number of matches between n- and

n’-workers.    Let    p(n,   n’) = (n +   n’)/2.   Then, from (19), the index of segregation can be
                                                                                                             37

expressed as




Pro~osition2:      Suppose that, foreachr=       1,2,..., the pair @,(. ;0), p,(.; 1))satisfies (23)-(26)

and (40). Then, for r sufficiently big, p(l )>p(0).




         To understand Proposition     3, consider a shift in the skill-distribution     satisfying (26)

and (40). The effect of such a shift is to move probability weight to the tails.             To simplify

matters, let us assume for the moment that this shift does not affect the mean.              Now, because

of the complementarily      between tasks, a firm will not hire workers that are too different in

skill-level.    Thus, if the shift pushes more workers into the tails of the distribution,        it will

push more firms’ means p(n,n’) into the tails. This means that the dispersion of firms’ means

.- the numerator and also the first term of the denominator         of (41) -- rises with the shift,

(This argument assumes that the overall mean p(9) does not change too much.)                  In contrast,

the dispersion of skill within a firm, (n-p(n,n’))2 + (n ‘-p(n,n’))2 does not depend very much

on whether the skill-levels are in the tails or the middle of the distribution         -- and thus is not

affected very much by the shift -- since it is determined mainly by the trade-off between task-

complementarity      (promoting matching of similar skill-levels)      and differential sensitivity to
                                                                                                               38

skill (enhancing matching of different skill-levels).           Hence the second term in the

denominator     of (41) remains about the same.           The over-all effect of the shift, therefore, is an

increase in p. The formal proof can be found in Appendix II.

        Several limitations of our model are worth noting.             First, we treat all skills as if they

can be reduced to a single dimension.         A fuller model would allow for multi-dimensional

skill, as in Roy [1951].     Second, the model assumes that all workers are producing a single

good, so that there is no interaction between workers through the product market.                 To the

extent that high- and low-skill workers specialize in production of different goods, increases

in mean-skill will tend to reduce the price of skill-intensive          goods, and thus will be more

likely to increase relative wages of low-skill workers.            This would partially offset the effect

described in Proposition     2.

        Second, the production function allows no substitutability            between quantity and quality

of workers.     The number of workers in a firm is taken as fixed, rather than as a choice

variable.     However, many of the results of this model would presumably              hold as partial

equilibrium     results in models that allowed for choice of quantity of workers, as long as

quality and quantity were not perfect substitutes.           To the extent that high and low-skill

workers specialize in producing different goods, it becomes more likely that an increase in the

mean-skill level of the economy will increase relative wages of low-skill workers.

        There is some gap between the theoretical finding that increased skill-dispersion                leads

to increased segregation of workers by W                and the empirical finding of increased segregation

of workers by wages.       Under the model, the relationship         between wages and skill is non-

linear and endogenous      to the skill-distribution.      For a high dispersion of skill, there will be a
                                                                                                         39

strong correlation between the wages of workers in the same firm, and, for a low dispersion

of skill, there will be a weak correlation.     Thus, on average, the correlation between the

wages of workers in the same firm will increase with skill-dispersion.         However, the

correlation need not increase monotonically,      because over some ranges, small increases in

dispersion may not change the pattern of matching by skill, but may change the wage

schedule so as to reduce the correlation of wages.       Thus there may be special cases in which

segregation by wages could increase without a concomitant          rise in segregation by skill.    This

contrasts with conventional   efficiency unit models in which an increase in correlation of

wages within firms will always correspond to an increase in the correlation of skills within

firms.




IV. Skill Dispersion    and Segregation       across U.S. States




         We next argue that, as proposition     3 implies, U.S. states with greater variance of

education are more segregated by education.        Casual empiricism      suggests the same is true for

countries.

         Kremer and Troske [1995] create segregation indices by state based on several

indicators of skill using the Worker-Establishment      Characteristics   Database (WECD),         The

WECD matches 199,557 manufacturing            workers to 16,144 manufacturing      establishments

[Troske, 1994]. It was created by linking individual data from the 1990 census with

establishment   data from the Longitudinal     Research Database, using detailed location and

industry information.   It should not be taken as representative     of American firms, since the
                                                                                                     40

match rate varies by industry, portion of the country, and plant size. The segregation indices

are computed as the adjusted R* from regressing worker characteristics        on a set of firm

dummies in a state.    The sample was restricted to firms for which data on more than two

workers were available, which led to the exclusion of four states.

        States with greater variance of education13 tend to be more highly segregated by

education, as shown in Table V. A regression of the correlation index on the variance of

education, with observations    heteroscedasticity   weighted by the square root of the sample

size, yielded a t-statistic of 5.47.    Although the model may be a good description of how

workers sort into firms by education, it is not a good description of how they sort by age. A

regression of segregation by age within plants on the variance of age among workers in the

state yielded a t-statistic of -1.69.   There was a positive, but not statistically   significant,

relationship   between segregation and the variance of skill when the skill indicator was either

the log wages or the predicted wage given age, education, sex, marital status, and race.14




    13The variance of worker characteristics in each state was calculated using the Sample
Detail File from the l-in-6 census sample, so it is based on a large number of observations
and should be representative of manufacturing workers in the state as a whole.

    14The predicted wage is calculated from a country-wide regression of log wages on age,
agez, and dummies for female, married, black, female* married, female* black, and various
education levels.

        Although comparable data are not available for rigorous comparisons                across countries,

the model is consistent with the widespread view that developing countries, with wide skill-

dispersion, are prone to “dualism.”         The model suggests that if skill-differentials     are

comparatively   small, as in highly traditional societies15 or modern societies, workers of high-

and low-skill will mix together within firms.          However, in developing economies with a wide

range of skills, such as India or Brazil, low- and high-skill people will work in separate firms,

and relatively low-paid workers in the advanced sector will earn more than relatively high-

paid workers in the traditional sector.        In fact, even the less skill-intensive    tasks in the formal

sectors of developing countries’ economies are often performed by workers who are highly

skilled and highly paid in comparison to workers in the informal sector,                For example, jobs as

clerks in international   hotels are highly prized by college graduates in China, and jobs as

flight attendants on Thai Air are sought after by the educated in Thailand.



    15 It seems likely that in pre-modern agricultural societies, such as medieval Europe,
Russia under serfdom, or colonial India, many of the better-educated workers helped landlords
manage their estates, and thus worked in the same “firms” with serfs or peasants.

V. Interpreting    Recent Changes in Wages and Segregation




         Under our model, the recent simultaneous     increases in inequality and segregation

could be due either to skill-biased technological    change or a shift in the observable skill-

distribution.   Both hypotheses are consistent with the data, although the latter provides a more

parsimonious    explanation.

        On the technological   front, the model predicts that both segregation and inequality

should increase following change in which the effective skill of high-skill workers improves.

There is some evidence that recent technological     progress has been of this type.     For example,

Kahn and Lim [1994] argue that total factor productivity      growth across American industries

has been proportional    to the fraction of skilled workers in the industry.   Moreover, Berman,

Bound, and Griliches [1994] find evidence that adoption of new technologies          may have

placed a premium on high-skill workers.       This means that although the old technologies       in

which high- and low-skill workers mix are still available,      high-skill workers now find it

more attractive to leave the firms and form firms with other high-skill workers.        This reduces

the relative wage of low-skill workers because firms hiring them must pay more to attract

complementary     high-skill workers,

         Our model, however, does not require appeal to largely unobserved         skill-biased

technological   change to account for changes in wages and segregation;        the data can be

explained through observed changes in the distribution      of skill in the United States and the

United Kingdom.

        There has been a substantial increase in mean-skill in the U.S. over recent decades.
                                                                                                    43

From 1960-1 to 1987-88, the flow of bachelor’s degrees as a percentage of the labor force

increased 1.58 times.   The flow of professional   degrees increased 1.65 times, masters’ degrees

2,14 times, and doctorates 1.87 times. [U.S. Department of Education,      1990, Table 220, cited

in Ehrenberg,    1992; Bureau of the Census, 1992]. Most of the increase in the flow took place

during the earlier part of the period, but the stock increased throughout the period, as less

educated people left the labor force.

        Evidence that the increase in the average skill in the United States has been

accompanied by a moderate rise in dispersion of skill is provided by .Juhn, Murphy, and

Pierce [1993].    They partition increased wage inequality from 1964 to 1988 into increases in

the dispersion of observable indicators of skill (education and experience),   increases in returns

to those observable skills, and increases in inequality due to unobservable    factors. 16

Somewhat more than 20% of the growth in inequality due to observable factors can be

attributed directly to increased dispersion of skill, holding the wage schedule constant .17

       We do not have data on the skill-distribution    in France, but British data also indicate

an increased mean and dispersion of skill.   Schmitt [1992] reports the distribution    of the




    lbThey measure wage inequality by the gap between log wages of workers at the 10th and
90th percentiles of the wage distribution.

     17The single biggest source of increased inequality is the increase in dispersion of wages
within education-experience groups, This could be due to increased variance in skills that are
unobservable to the econometrician or to increased returns to these unobservable skills. If
one assumes that the decomposition into quantity and price changes is the same for
unobserved as for observed variables, then slightly more than 20 percent of the total increase
in inequality is accounted for by the direct impact of widening of the skill-distribution.
Under the assumption that the entire change in the residual is due to changes in prices, rather
than quantities, of unobserved skill, widening of the skill-distribution explains just under 10
percent of the increased inequality.
                                                                                                         44

British workforce by educational qualifications        in 1978-80 and 1986-88, based on data from

the General Household Survey.        In 1974-76 the median worker had no qualifications        beyond

primary education.      By 1986-88, the median worker had some O-levels or lower-middle

vocational education.       We calculated the variance of expected log wages conditional on

education in both periods, holding constant the wage schedule, as a measure of the variance

of the observable skill distribution. lE The variance of skill, as measured by the variance of

expected log wages conditional       on education, increased 20% from 0.0410 in 1978-80 to

0,0488 in 1986-88.

        Thus, at least in the U.S and Britain, there have been significant changes in the mean

and dispersion of the skill-distribution.    These changes have not been as profound as the shift

in the wage-distribution,     but such a discrepancy    is to be expected from our theory (see

proposition    2 and 3). Of course, to assess the predictions of our model quantitatively        would

require a more detailed and richer formulation         of the production function than that of section

III.

        One issue that arises in interpreting the empirical results is the timing of the

relationship   between changes in the skill-distribution     and changes in worker-matching.      If

there are search costs, changes in the skill-distribution      may primarily affect matching of new

entrants to the labor force and of the unemployed,         rather than causing workers who were

already matched to switch jobs.       Matching patterns among workers may thus respond to

changes in the skill-distribution    only with a lag. Juhn, Murphy, and Pierce [1993] find the

greatest increase in dispersion of skill in the U.S. occurred from 1964 to 1979, There was a

smaller increase in skill dispersion from 1979 to 1988, with about ten percent of the total

increase in the wage differential between workers at the 10th and 90th percentiles of the wage

distribution    accounted for by increasing dispersion of observable skills.      Overall, only three

percent of the increase in wage dispersion between 1979 and 1988 can be attributed directly

to measured increases in skill dispersion.       The data on segregation of workers by skill cover

the period 1975-86, with the increase in segregation coming between 1977 and 1984. It is

possible that changes in sorting during the later period reflect either the small

contemporaneous      widening of the skill-distribution,     or the larger earlier widening of this

distribution.

         In sum, the data are consistent either with the hypothesis that technological          change

raised the effective skill of high-skill workers, or with the more parsimonious          story that there

were simply observed increases the mean and dispersion of skill.            In either case, the model

can explain the simultaneous        rise in segregation and inequality.

         Our model is also consistent with the absolute decline in wages for low-skill workers

found by Katz and Murphy [1992].           The simplest models of skill-biased     technological   change

do not generate such a decline.        Technological    change that opens up new opportunities      for

high-skill workers does not necessarily make low-skill workers worse off, since the older

technologies    remain available,     Technological    change that increases the productivity    of low-

skill workers could reduce their wages by reducing the prices of products they produce.

There is, however, mixed evidence about whether there has been a fall in prices of goods

produced by low-skill workers and, if so, sufficient to explain the reduction in wages for low-

skill workers [Lawrence and Slaughter,    1993; Krugman and Lawrence, 1993; Sachs and

Shatz, 1994; Krueger, 1996].




VI. Policy Implications     and Directions for Future Research




        To conclude, let us consider two prominent social policy issues that have rather

different implications   in our model than in more standard frameworks,      and speculate on the

dynamic interaction between inequality and segregation.

        In many countries, there are strong social norms promoting equality across workers

within a firm.   Freeman [1980], for example, provides evidence that unions typically reduce

intra-firm wage differentials,   Our model implies that social norms for equality within the

firm may have perverse effects on the distribution   of income in the economy as a whole, 19 If

low- and high-skill workers were perfect substitutes, pressures for equality within the firm

would lead to increased segregation by skill, but would not affect wages or output,       However,

in our model, pressures for equality within the firm will reduce output.      Moreover, they may

perversely reduce wages for low-skill workers by causing high-skill workers to sort into

separate firms, thus depriving low-skill workers of the benefit of cross-matching.20




    ‘we   are grateful to Daron Acemoglu for suggestions    on this point.

     20Forexample, suppose that some workers had skill 1, and that slightly more workers had
skill 1.5, so that rents from cooperation would accrue to the scarce low-skill workers. Some
firms would match together the two types of worker, and produce output 2.25. Firms with
only high-skill workers would produce output 3.375, so high-skill workers would earn half of
this, or 1.6875. Low-skill workers would earn 2.25 - 1.6875, or .5625. If pressures for
intra-firm equity made it impossible to have a wage gap this great, then .11 high-skill workers
would self-match together, and earn a wage of 1.6875 -- exactly what they earned otherwise.
                                                                                                       47

        The model also bears on tax policies, such as those in the Clinton health care

proposal, that encourage increased segregation of high-wage workers [Cutler, 1994;

Elmendorf and Hamilton,       1994; Sheiner, 1994]. Under standard efficiency unit models,

workplace composition     would be perfectly elastic to such incentives, and so revenue

calculations   based on the current workplace composition      would seriously overestimate

revenue.   However, such policies would have no harmful effect on efficiency.          Under our

model, by contrast, workforce composition        would be only imperfectly elastic to incentives for

segregation (and so naive revenue estimates might not perform badly).          Still, changes in

workforce composition     would create deadweight losses,

        We have taken the distribution      of skill as exogenous.   Future researchers may wish to

endogenize the distribution      of skill, and in particular to examine the effect of matching

patterns on skill acquisition.     In industries in which people learn from high-skill colleagues, a

worker often serves as assistant to a high-skill manager when young, and as the manager of

low-skill assistants when old.21 For example, young lawyers and doctors start out assisting

more senior colleagues, performing tasks that are only moderately sensitive to skill.         In the

process, they profit from the wisdom of their elders.       Later, when human capital accumulation

is less important, most take positions of higher rank and supervise less-skilled      subordinates.

It is relatively cheap to provide training in this way if there are tasks that are suited to




Low-skill workers would also self-match and earn a wage of .5-- less than what they would
have earned in the absence of pressures for equity within the firm.


     21This is not to deny that there are also learning environments in which people maximize
learning by performing a high-skill job, even if their co-workers are of lower skill.
                                                                                                        48

workers of medium skill, as in law or medicine.22

         These examples suggest that increases in segregation will spur future inequality of

skill by reducing opportunities     for low-skill workers to learn from high-skill co-workers.

This raises the possibility   that exogenous increases in either segregation or skill inequality

may spur a vicious cycle of ever-rising inequality and segregation,

         Besides its implications   for income distribution   and the evolution of the skill

distribution,   the pattern of matching may have political and social implications.      A society in

which high- and low-skill workers match together in firms is likely to have a more

homogeneous culture than one in which people match with others of their own skill.

Language, customs, and fashions are likely to be more similar if there is more interaction

between groups.      Societies with wide distributions   of skill, such as the contemporary    United

States, Brwil, and India, are more likely to develop separate subcultures and perhaps to

experience political and social conflict between these subcultures.       On the other hand, a

pattern of matching in which groups of people always play the same role (manager or

assistant) may develop into a caste-like system, in which participants       work together, but in a

rigid hierarchy.    There may be advantages to matching patterns in which over wide ranges

people are indifferent between being the assistant to a higher level manager or the manager of

a lower level assistant, so that they play different roles in different situations.




     22Of course, this condition does not always obtain. For example, young baseball players
would presumably learn a great deal from playing in the major leagues, but the production
function makes it important to match the best players together, and so young players train in
the minor leagues, probably less effectively.
                                                                                                49

        It is possible to construct a confidence interval for the segregation index under the

assumption that the sampling errors in the estimates of the variances of q within and between

firms are independent.   This will be the case if the variance of q within the firm is

independent of the average q within a firm or is a linear function of the average q within the

firm.

        Given that s2#/02W and s2~J/02~are distributed as independent ~2 variables with N-Y

         This derivation assumed that the variance of q within a firm was independent               of, or

linear in, the firm’s average q. If the variance of q within firms is convex in the average q in

a firm, then when a sample of firms is picked that has a high variance of average q, it will

also tend to have a high variance of q within firms, which will make the estimate more

precise than the calculations     below would indicate.       The variance of q within firms will be

convex in average q, for example, if the standard deviation of q within the firm is

proportional   to the average q within the firm.        On the other hand, if the variance of q within

firms is concave in average q, then the formulas above will understate the width of the

confidence interval.    Note that this will be the case for dichotomous           variables, such as race or

production worker status, because the variance of the characteristic            within the firm equals p(l

- p), where p is the share of people with the characteristic.          However, when this share is

close to one or zero, the variance within firms will be approximately             linear in average q, and

the estimated confidence intervals should not be that far off.

Proof of Lemma&:          Consider n< An*(0). Suppose arm-worker              ismatched    with some skill

n’ >   An”(e). From Lemma 1, an n worker cannot be matched with n’ 2 n*(0). Hence

consider n’     ●   [n1(6), n*(0)). Given that, from Lemma 5, w(n’;e) = n’(n*(f3))2 - (n*(e) )3/2,

we have



 (A.3)       v(n,n’;e)   = n(n’)2   - w(n’ ;6) = n(n’)2    - n’ (n *(0))z +     (~“(6))3_

It suffices to show that, on the interval [n,(e), n“(e)], H(n’) is maximized at n’ = nl(e).                   To

establish this, note that the derivative of H(”) is 2nn’ - (n*(f3))2. Now at n’ = n1((3), 2nn’ <

2A2(n*(6))2 < (n*(0))z, and so the derivative is negative at this point.             Suppose there exists p >

n1((3) (not necessarily an integer] such that H(p) =       H(nl(0)).     In fact, let p be the smallest

such number.        Then dH(p)/dn’ 20.      Moreover, because 2nn’ - (n*(9))2 is increasing in                n’,


dH(n’)/dn’ >0, for all n’ > p. Since H(p) = H(n1(f3)),

But if   n   is matched with n’ in equilibrium,     then Zf(n’) 2 H(n’(e)), a contradiction            of (A.4).

We conclude that there is no p such that H@) = H(n1(9)), and so H(n’) is maximized at n’

= n,(e) as claimed.

Moreover, for any n < nl(0), Lemma 8 implies that an n-worker is matched with another

worker in S,. Finally from Lemmas 1, 3, and 4, an nl(0)- or nl-worker is matched either with

and so from         (A.8) and the fact that RI’ c RI(0) we conclude that (38) holds.

         From Lemma 3, a worker in the set consisting of Sz of workers of skill no less than nz

must be matched either with another worker in Sz or with a worker of type                    n’~ [n*((3),n2-1].



                                                                       E
Hence the sum of wages in of workers in Sz, i.e., R2(e) = ~                     w(n’;e)p(n’;9),    equals
                                                                      n’ ml

From Lemma 2,

From Lemma 7, (35), and the fact that                nz < &n     ●
                                                                 (o),



                                                                                 (n “(0))3
                            v(n,    n’; e)      = n’n2   – n*((3)(n’)2       +
 (A.12)                                                                             2’
                                                    if n’e(n*(6), n2) and n          >n2     .




For n 2 nz, the fact that   n2   2(3/2 )1’2n*(l) definition of nz implies that the right-hand side of

(A. 11) is increasing in 0. Similarly, because n’ < nz, the right-hand side of (A. 12) is also

increasing in 8. We conclude that if Pz’ is the program in which (3 = 1 in (A.9) but (3 = O in

(A. 10), the maximized value Rz’ of the corresponding                 objective satisfies RZ’>RZ(0). But from
                                                                                                                  55

(26), the constraints (A. 10) when e=O are proportional                 to (A. 10) when (3 = 1. Hence



                                                          ~P(n;         l)w(n;    l)

This yields (39).

                                                                                                            Q.E.D.




Proof of Pror)osition s: We can decompose (41) as follows.                       Let Be and WObe the

dispersions of wages between and within firms, respectively,                     for those firms that hire only

workers from the interval [n,+ 1,nz-1]. Then



 (A.14)                 Be =          ~                 (v(~s~’)     - ~“(e))’z(~!~’;e)
                               n,n’E[nl+l,     q-l]



and



 (A.15)                   W. =            ~              (?2- p(n,n’))’z(n,n’;e)           .
                                 n,n’c[nl+l,     ~-l]




Similarly, let Be’ and W~’ be the dispersions,             respectively,    between and within all other
                                                                                                      56

firms.    We have:



                       ~,’ = ~                ~              (P(~,~’) - ~*(e))2z(~,~’;e) +
 (A.16)                           n’=n n$[n, +lp%-ll

                              E                 ~             (P(~,~’)   -~”(e))’z(~>~’;e)
                        n’@[nl+l, q-l]    nE[nl+l, q-l]




and




 (A.17)
                           w,’ =         S ~
                                       n’=n   nc[nl+l,~-l]
                                                                (?z-p(n,n’))’z(n,n’ ;(3)+

                                   x
                                                     ~           (n-p(n,n’))’z(?z, n’;e).
                           n’ c[nl+l, ~-l]    ne[nl+l, q-n




          We can rewrite (41) as



 (A.18)




Now, the proofs of Lemmas 5 and 6 imply that if n, n’ c (n1,n2), then z(n,n’;e) >0           if and
                                                                                          57

only if either n = n“(e) or   n’ = n*(6).   But then


 (A.19)                           ]p(n,n’) - n“(e)l      = In - p(n,n’)1,

and so


 (A.20)                                         BO = We.

Moreover, from Lemma 3, if z(n, n’;e) >0 and n s nl, or n 2 nz, then


 (A.21)                           In - p(n,n’) I s] p(n,n’) - n“(e) 1,

with strict inequality unless n’ = n*(9). Hence,


 (A.22)                                         We’ < Be’

From (A.20) and (A.22) we can re-express (A. 18) as


                                                       Be +B6’
 (A.23)                                     p(e) =
                                                     2Be+2B0’ -A

where A >0.    Now, below, we will show that, for r sufficiently big, (40) implies that


 (A.24)                                         B1 < ~BO

and (26) implies that


 (A.25)                             B1‘ = aBO’ and WI’ = aWO’.

Now, the fact that A>O and (A.23)-(A.25)        imply


                                                  ~Bo+aBo’
 (A.26)                                P(l) > ypBo+z~Bo’  -aA
                                                                                                                     58

But because a>          1 >~and           A> O,theright-hand         side of(A,26)    exceeds that of(A.23)   with

9=0, establishing       that p(l) > p(0). It remains to establish (A.24) and (A.25).

          Toderive(A.24),               note that,



                ~,=             ~           (l-l(?z,n’)-n”( l))’z(n,n’;l)
                       n,n’~[nl+l,q-l]



                 =!         ~             (n-n*(l))2z(n,n*(l);l)       from Lemmas 3-7

                  2      nc[n,-l,q-1]

establishing   (A.24).

          To demonstrate            (A.25), note that, for r sufficiently big, v(n, n*(0);O) = v(n, n*(l); 1)

andsofrom      (A.5)to          (A.6)and(A.8)         to(A.8).


 (A.28)                  Z(?z,n’;l) = az(n,n’;O), for n < n’ s nl or n2 s n s n’,
