        Relative Wage Variability in the United States, 1860-1983




                                ABSTRACT



   This paper examines the magnitude of changes in relative wages across

industries between 1860 and 1983 and analyzes the macroeconomic determinants of

such changes at different intervals during this period. The variance across

industries in wage growth was at least four times larger before 1948 than

afterward. Except for smaller year-to-year variability in output growth across

industries after 1948, the macroeconomic factors examined cannot account for

this increased rigidity of relative wages. Increases in average establishment

size and improved communication of wage trends are probably partially

responsible for the observed increase in relative wage rigidity. No single

macroeconomic model was consistent with the year-to-year fluctuations in

relative wage rigidity in every historical period examined.

    This paper examines the magnitude of changes in relative wages across

 industries between 1860 and 1983 and analyzes the macroeconomic determinants of

 such changes at different intervals during this period. By studying the

 magnitude of relative wage changes over such a long period, new light can be

 shed on the old question of whether the wage structure has become more rigid in

 the post-World War II period (or, using the terminology currently popular,

 whether there has been a gradual shift away from spot markets toward long-term

 contracts in the labor market- -a subject pursued in more depth in Kniesner and

Goldsmith (1986)).

     The macroeconomic determinants of changes in relative wages and prices

have received considerable attention over the last 10 years, but all previous

studies have focused on the post-World War II period and have ignored the

question of whether structural changes have taken place. A key factor in any

period should be the magnitude of sectoral shifts within the
                                                               economy.
Hamermesh (1986) has shown how increased dispersion of changes in output across

industries should be positively correlated to changes in relative wages. In

addition he, Fischer (1981), and Cukierman (1984) have pointed out how data on

changes in relative wages and prices can be used to test a variety of models of

aggregate behavior. This paper extends this work by testing these models in

different periods and examining whether structural changes in wage setting

behavior have taken place.



                                   II. DATA

   This study examines five different data sources to trace the long-run

changes in relative wage variability between 1860 and 1983. Clarence Long

(1960) compiled series of daily wage rates in January and July for thirteen
                                      2

manufacturing industries and building for 1860 to 1890 from the Aldrich

report. Only the January to January changes are examined below because all

other series available for this period are annual. He also compiled separate

series by state for seven of the manufacturing industries, with two to seven

states per industry.

   Paul Douglas' (1930) wage series for "payroll" (nonunion) and "union"

manufacturing, building trades, unskilled labor, farm labor, coal mining,

transportation, federal employees, teachers, and ministers are used for the

1890-1926 period. This sample covers a wider range of industries, allowing for

separate estimates of relative wage rigidity in different sectors such as

manufacturing and nonmanufacturing industries and union and nonunion

manufacturing industries.

   The Conference Board published wage data for twenty-one manufacturing

industries for July between 1920 and 1936. This information is of limited

usefulness for regression analysis because of the small number of

observations. Nonetheless, this data set is an extremely interesting one for

the obvious reason that it documents relative wage changes during most of the

Great Depression.

   The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) did not begin to publish industry data

in detail sufficient to gauge changes in relative wages until 1947. Although

Hamermesh has examined this period with considerable care, some new results are

reported below for 20 two-digit manufacturing industries for 1947-1983 to

facilitate comparisons with the earlier periods. The data come from CITIBASE.

   The final data set examined here is the National Income and Product Accounts

 (NIPA) series of wages and salaries per full-time equivalent employee.
                                       3

 Although not a wage series, it is examined here because it covers the period

between the end of the Conference Board series and the beginning of the BLS

 series. Data for 55 two-digit industries in all sectors are used for

 1929-1948; 57 industries, for 1949-1982.



                         III. COMPARISONS ACROSS PERIODS

   Changes in relative wages are defined here in terms of the variance in the

rate of change of wages across industries. A percentage change in the wage in

industry i in period t (dwit), which is greater (less) than the percentage

change in the mean wage across all industries in period t (dw), is defined as

a relative wage increase (decrease). The variance of dwt (VWt) is used to

measure the overall magnitude of relative wage changes, where



                     VW E iI (dw.     â€”
                                           dw)2
                          i Et



and Et equals employment in industry i in period t and Et

   The mean value of W for each of the samples containing wage data are

reported in Figure 1. They show that, on average, relative wages are much more

rigid in the post-war period than in earlier periods. Between 1860 and 1890

relative wages changed 10 times as much each year as they did after 1947.

Annual relative wage changes were 16 times greater between 1890 and 1926 and 12

times greater between 1920 and 1936 than they were after 1947.

   These results are reported in further detail in Table 1. In the 1860-1890

period, the changes in relative wages become even greater once interstate

variation within a subset of industries is taken into account. The mean change
                                      4

in relative wages across states and industries in line 3 is 25 percent larger

than the mean change reported over a larger set of industries in line 2.

   Differences in the magnitude of relative wage changes across sectors in the

1890-1926 period are reported in lines 4 through 7. Relative wages in

manufacturing changed by roughly the same extent as they did in the

nonmanufacturing sector, as can be seen by comparing lines 4 and 5. Relative

wages changed much more within the nonunion sector of manufacturing than in the

union sector, well before the advent of the three-year agreement. The changes

in relative wages between 1920 and 1936 in line 8 are comparable to those

between 1860 and 1926.

   The smaller changes in relative wages in the post-war period are documented

in more detail in lines 9 and 10. Weighting clearly has little effect on the

overall trend in relative wages. One possible source (in a statistical sense)

of the greater rigidity of relative wages in this period can be seen by

comparing the minimum and maximum changes in relative wages in the postwar

period to those of earlier periods. Between 1890 and 1936, the maximum changes

in relative wages (which occur in periods when there are severe shocks to the

economy) are 20 to over 100 times greater than the minimum changes. Since

1947, the maximum changes are only about 10 times larger than the minimum

changes. This shows that the swings in relative wage change behavior have

become much less extreme. This may be attributable to smaller shocks (in terms

of amplitude or duration), stabilization policies, or changes in wage-setting

mechanisms.

   Even though relative wages changed much less since 1947, the average

year-to-year change in the average wage tended to be greater in the most recent

period. Wages rose by 5.6 percent per year between 1947 and 1983, whereas the
                                      5

absolute value of the annual rate of change of manufacturing wages in earlier

periods ranged between 3.4 and 4.3 percent between 1890 and 1936. Despite the

greater mean rate of change, there was much less fluctuation around the mean

after 1947. The standard deviation of the rate of change of wages is .022 for

1947-1983, whereas it ranges between .048 and .098 in the earlier periods.

This suggests that there actually may have been less uncertainty since 1947

about changes in average wages, which may be partially responsible for the

smaller changes in relative wages.

   The heterogeneity of these data sets raises the question of whether relative

wages really have become more rigid, with the alternative hypothesis being that

there is less noise in the BLS data. One reason to doubt the latter is that

the Conference Board data were collected with methods quite comparable to those

used by BLS. A more convincing reason to discount this argument comes from the

NIPA data. The longer span of this data set provides the opportunity to

examine whether there was a noticeable downward shift in relative full-time

income variability after 1936. This would be consistent with a decline in

relative wage variability (unless year-to-year variability in full-time hours

declined over this period, a highly unlikely condition). Such a shift seems to

have taken place around 1948, as shown in lines 12 and 13. Mean relative

full-time income variability before 1948 was nine times greater than after

1948.

   Another problem in interpreting the means in Table 1 is differences in the

level of aggregation across the four data sets. For instance, Long reports

separate series for two different types of metals and two different types of

textile products. In the two-digit SIC code used for manufacturing by BLS,

there is but one series for each of these major sectors. Similar problems
                                      6

arise in Douglas' series and, to a lesser extent, in the Conference Board

series. This aggregation reduces the total variation in the rate of change in

wages. To examine how much of the lower variation in the post-war period is

attributable to aggregation, the post-war series are re-examined at the three-

digit level. The results in line 14 show a slight increase in relative wage

variability results when more disaggregated data are used, but the basic

finding of lower relative wage variability in the post-war period is

unaffected.

   A further difficulty is measurement error in the Douglas data. Douglas had

to impute values for seven of the nonunion manufacturing industries for every

other year after 1914. To the extent Douglas' imputations were erroneous, the

variance in the rate of change of wages in his series is overstated during this

period. The magnitude of this bias cannot be ascertained readily through

pre-and post-1914 comparisons because the variability of changes in output

across sectors is greatest after 1914. One reason to doubt that this bias is

very large is that the ratio of relative wage variability in nonunion

industries to that of union industries actually fell after 1914.

   A final problem in making comparisons across the four data sets is

differences in which sectors are included. For instance, Long includes

brewing, agricultural implements, and carriages and wagons but excludes baking

and knit goods. Douglas does the opposite. A related difficulty is that the

Conference Board and BLS series cover a larger proportion of the manufacturing

sector than the Long and Douglas series. The differences in coverage need not

bias the estimates, but they make comparisons across periods potentially

misleading.

   To standardize for industry mix, a relative wage variability measure was

constructed for four industries from each data set: textile products,

printing, lumber, and primary metal products. Wage data for textiles,

printing, and primary metals in the Douglas and Conference Board samples were

obtained by aggregating wage series within each category (e.g., knits, woolens,

and cotton were used to create the textiles series in the Douglas data). The

following results were obtained for annual changes in relative wages (x 100):



                           Mean       Minimum       Maximum
                          (S.D.)

     1860-1890             .062           .002         .292
                          (.076)
     1890-1926             .115           .001       1.205
                          (.224)
     1920-1936             .103           .004         .756
                          (.188)
     1947-1983             .017        .000            .080
                          (.017)



Standardizing for industrial mix substantially lowers the estimates of relative

wage variability in the prewar period and slightly raises the estimate for the

post-war period. Nonetheless, relative wage variability remains four to seven

times larger in the prewar period.



                         IV. PATTERNS WITHIN PERIODS

   Before turning to a more formal analysis of the determinants of changes in

relative wages, it will be useful to look carefully at the patterns of relative

wage changes within each of the samples under consideration (Figures 2 through

8). In Long's sample for 1860-1890 (see Figure 2), changes in relative wages

were most pronounced during the Civil War. After the war the variance in the
                                      8


rate of change of wages was considerably smaller. The relatively large change

in 1878 took place during a contraction in the business cycle, whereas those in

1871 and 1880 took place in the initial stages of expansions. However,

relative wages changed very little during the contraction of 1870.

   The pattern of relative wage changes in Douglas' series between 1890 and

1926 in Figure 3 shows that relative wages changed very little, on average,

between 1890 and 1915. The large changes shown for 1916 to 1918 probably are

attributable to wartime conditions. The biggest changes took place in 1920 and

1921, a period that coincides with a sizable contraction in output.

   The Douglas and Conference Board (see Figure 4) series overlap between 1920

and 1926. In this period they show the same pattern--large changes in relative

wages during the contraction of 1923-1924 followed by smaller changes through

1926. The trend toward greater wage rigidity continued until the beginning of

the depression, which first becomes manifest in relative wage changes in 1930.

As the contraction continued, relative wages changed at an accelerating rate.

Even after 1934, the changes in relative wages were greater than just before

the depression.

   Annual changes in relative wages since 1947 are reported in Figure 5. The

largest changes took place in the late 1940s and l950s. In the first half of

the 1960s, relative wages hardly changed at all. Over the last twenty years

the largest changes in relative wages took place in 1967, 1971-1972, 1975, and

1983. These periods coincide with either contractions or changes in the

aggregate growth rate. The double-digit inflation rates observed in 1973-1974

and 1979 are associated with relatively small changes in relative wages.

   The year-to-year fluctuations in the NIPA relative full-time income series

are reported in Figure 6 for 1929-1982, with values for 1929-1948 and 1948-1982
                                      9

reported in Figures 7 and 8. Figure 6 shows the dramatic drop in relative wage

variability in the last half of the 1940s. The patterns in the NIPA series

during the depression and in the post-war period are similar to those observed

in the Conference Board and NIPA data. Relative wage variability increased

considerably at the beginning of World War II and again at the end of the war.



                 V. DETERMINANTS OF CHANGES IN RELATIVE WAGES

   Hamermesh (1986) shows the implications of two different models of wage

adjustment for changes in relative wages. In Keynesian models, wages are

assumed to be either downwardly rigid in nominal terms (i.e., nominal wages

don't fall, real wages can fall) or downwardly rigid with respect to the

expected rate of price inflation (i.e., nominal and real wages don't fall). In

the former case, inflation allows firms to cut real wages without cutting

nominal wages. In periods of low inflation, a relatively small proportion of

workers receive wage increases and there is relatively little variation in the

rate of increase among those receiving increases. As the inflation rate rises,

more workers receive wage increases and the range of observed increases becomes

larger. In essence, higher inflation allows employers to avoid the constraint

nominal wage rigidity imposes on real wage cuts. In this model there should be

a positive correlation between inflation (both anticipated and unanticipated)

and changes in relative wages. If the minimum rate of wage increase is the

expected rate of inflation instead of zero, expected inflation has no effect on

changes in relative wages. In this case, only unanticipated inflation leads to

larger changes in relative wages.

  Hamermesh also shows that the variance across sectors in the rate of growth

of nominal output (VQt) should be positively related to changes in relative
                                              10

wages. The intuition behind this result is fairly clear. When there is

greater variation in the rate of excess demand across sectors, there should be

more variation in labor demand. Unless workers anticipate these shifts and

move accordingly across sectors, this results in changes in relative wages.

   Hamermesh tested these propositions for the U.S. after World War II and

found that the data contradict the "Keynesian" propositions --             the variance of
the rate of growth of wages decreases with inflation, especially with

unanticipated inflation (pU). One possible explanation, Hamermesh argues, is

that workers demand more indexing (formal and informal) when there is

uncertainty about inflation. If wage-setting mechanisms throughout the economy

adjust so that more weight is placed on preserving real wages through partial

or complete indexing and less weight is placed on reacting to excess demand for

labor, then one would expect a smaller variance in the growth rate of wages

simply because the CPI is the same for everybody. This rationale can be

further tested by determining whether unexpected inflation reduces VW in other

periods.

   If one admits the possibility of heterogeneity of indexing schemes across

markets, then        can actually increase with pU To see this, rewrite

Hamerniesh's equation (1) as

           â€” pe +   7PU +   c(yit,
where      is now interpreted as an indexing parameter and e =         anticipated
inflation and Yjt      excess demand in market i at time t. In this model,

     VWt     (u)2   Var      +       Var yit +   2pu   Coy (yit,

which means that awt/3pU             0, depending on the signs of ,   u,   and Coy (Yit'
                                      11

   Hamermesh's empirical model did not contain a measure of uncertainty about

inflation. Conceptually, uncertainty about inflation can be interpreted as

variation of e across individuals. The measure which will be used below is

the variance in the rate of change of the CPI over the previous 10 years,

denoted PIIJNCt below.

   Fischer's analysis of the linkages between relative price variability and

inflation points out two other possible rationales for empirical relationships

between inflation and changes in relative wages. The market clearing with

imperfect information approach, developed by Barro (1976) and tested by

Hercowitz (1981, 1982), examines the effect of changes in the money supply on

relative prices in an "islands" model where agents do not know whether observed

price changes are due to inflation or to shifts in relative excess demand.

If supply and demand elasticities vary across markets, misperceptions about

changes in the money supply are translated into actual relative wage changes.

This argument applies equally to unanticipated inflation and deflation- - the

absolute value of the unexpected change in the price level matters, not the

direction of the change. Anticipated inflation and deflation have no effect on

relative wages in this model.

   The adjustment cost approach emphasizes the lump-suni costs of changing

wages, and prices. Under both inflation and deflation, these costs

(e.g., paperwork involved with changing wage rates, costs of reporting worker

performance) call for making changes in wages at discrete intervals. As long

as all firms don't make these changes at the same time, this results in changes

in relative wages. Both expected and unexpected changes in the price level

cause changes in relative wages in this model.

      The empirical implications of each of these models for the effects of

expected and unexpected inflation on relative wage variability are summarized

                                    VI.   EMPIRICAL SPECIFICATION

      The results reported below are obtained from two general nonnested

specifications:



(1)         ln(Wt) o +        l     P +   2     +   3   ln(VQt) + X4 ln(PIUNCt) +   et


(2)         ln(VWt) = fib +   fil    IPI + fi2 IPI + fi3 ln(VQt) +   fi   ln(PITJNCt) +   e

where et and 4 are normally distributed error terms and                    and    are

parameters to be estimated. Models I and II are estimated with (1); models III

and IV with (2). Model II is distinguished from model I by the restriction
                                        13


i=0; model III from model IV,   by   the restriction 131=0. These restrictions are

tested below with likelihood ratio tests and information criteria. The

equations are estimated by maximum likelihood to allow for first-order serial

correlation without dropping the first year in each sample. The logarithmic

form of the equation was chosen to make the results directly comparable to

Hamermesh' s.

   Definitions, means, and standard deviations for each of the variables used

in the regression analysis are reported in Table 2. Expected inflation rates

were generated from rolling AR(3) models estimated over the previous thirty

years. This specification was chosen because of its relatively stable lag

structure and its ability to track changes in the price level throughout each

sample period.

   A different data set had to be used in each sample period to construct VQt.

For 1860-1890 I use the five output series in Frickey (1947) which extend

throughout the period: food and kindred products, textile fabrics and

materials, articles from textile fabrics, iron and steel and their products,

and metals and metal products other than iron and steel. For 1890-1926 I use

Shaw's estimates of the implicit price index and the value of output for five

major sectors: perishable goods, semidurable goods, consumer durables,

producer durables, and construction materials. For 1920-1936 1 use the seven

Federal Reserve Board industry indexes which are available for the entire

period (food, tobacco, textiles, lumber, leather, iron and steel, and stone,

clay and glass). For 1929-1982 and 1947-1983 the national income accounts

provide much more comprehensive coverage than any of these other sources. The

variance in the rate of change of output is calculated over one-digit

industries. The variances for 1890-1926, 1929-1982, and 1947-1983 are Divisia
                                      14

weighted by the share of real output in each industry; the variances for the

other two periods are unweighted because dollar values are not reported.

   The across-industry variance of the rate of change of output is a function

of a number of factors, including the dispersion of industry-specific excess

demand shocks and the magnitude of economy-wide shocks. The impact of

economy-wide shocks on wages will vary by industry unless demand and supply

elasticities are the same everywhere. To the extent that wage shocks have an

immediate impact on excess demand in product markets, it is plausible that VQt

is a function of W. Ideally, one would like to purge VQt of this influence.

Instrumental variables are available for economy-wide shocks, but not for

industry-specific shocks. Without a good set of instruments, it makes little

sense to replace VQt with predicted VQt. Another alternative is to drop VQt

altogether, but this creates omitted variable bias. In my judgment it is

preferable to include VQt because the magnitude of the within-year impact of

    on VQt is likely to be quite small even if the same industry definitions

are used for each variable. Because the industries used to construct VQt never

coincide with those used to construct VWt, there is even less reason to believe

simultaneity bias is a severe problem. The estimates of (1) and (2) are

reported in Tables 3 and 4.



                                 VII. RESULTS

   The Keynesian model with nominal wage rigidity implies    > 0, whereas x1=O

in the Keynesian model with real wage rigidity and Hamerniesh's indexing

rationale. Likelihood-ratio tests of the restriction cx1=0 are distributed x2

with one-degree of freedom:

                          1860-1890          4.26
                          1890-1926          4.22
                                        15

                            1920-1936         2.31
                            1947-1983           .34
                            1929-1982           .29

 The restriction is rejected at the 95 percent confidence level for the

 1860-1890 and the 1890-1926 samples, but cannot be rejected for the other three

 samples. Judge         (1980) and Chow (1983) note that the choice of any

significance level is arbitrary and can be avoided by using information

criteria. The values of Akaike's information criterion (AIC) and the

Schwartz-Bayes information criterion (SBC) in Tables 3 and 4 are multiplied by

-2, so the relevant test is to see which specification gives the smallest value

in the tables. The information criteria point to essentially the same

conclusion as the likelihood-ratio tests in this case. The c10 restriction is

rejected for 1947-1983 and 1929-1982, but cannot be rejected for 1860-1890 and

1890-1926. The information criteria deliver a split verdict for 1920-1936.

   These results show that both anticipated and unanticipated inflation are

positively correlated with changes in relative wages between 1860 and 1926.

This relationship vanishes in the two later samples, where I obtain the same

results as Hamermesh: a negative correlation between unanticipated inflation

and changes in relative wages (albeit at only a 20 percent confidence level).

The notion that inflation lubricates the labor market to permit larger changes

in relative wages seems to hold through 1936, but not afterward. The evidence

is consistent with the indexing rationale in the 1929-1982 and 1947-1983

samples. The difference in the results before and after 1936 is most likely a

response to the sustained inflation of the 1960's and 1970's.

  The market clearing with imperfect information model implies f3l==0, whereas

the adjustment cost model requires 8l>0. Likelihood-ratio tests of the

restriction P1=0 are:
                                         16

                          1860-1890              3.01
                          1890-1926              5.96
                          1920-1936              2.98

                          1947-1983               .38
                          1929-1982               .05

The restriction can be rejected only for the 1890-1926 sample at conventional

levels of significance. Both information criteria indicate that fii=0 can be

rejected for 1890-1926 and 1920-1936. It is also rejected for 1860-1890 under

the AIC but not the SBC. However, /3j     is   negative in this period, which is not

consistent with the adjustment cost model. The restriction cannot be rejected

for the 1947-1983 and 1929-1982 samples under either AIC or SBC. In summary,

the adjustment cost model is consistent with the evidence for the 1890-1926 and

1920-1936 samples, but otherwise it has little explanatory power.

   The evidence for the market clearing with imperfect information model is

fairly weak. Although the estimated values of 2 are positive in every period

except 1947-1983, the hypothesis that 20 can be rejected only for 1860-1890.

It is probably no coincidence that this is the sample period where the

assumption of no current information about prices in other markets is most

likely to hold.

   In summary, the evidence is consistent with the Keynesian model with nominal

wage rigidity for 1860 through 1936, the adjustment cost model for 1890 through

1936, and the market clearing model for 1860 through 1890. The Keynesian model

model does not fare as well as its competitors in terms of goodness of fit

criteria (root MSE, R2 and log likelihood values). One way to test these

models against each other within each of these three sample periods is to

estimate a composite equation containing all explanatory variables and then

test whether         or               The former set of restrictions can be

rejected for 1920-1936; the latter set can be rejected for all three periods.
                                          17

The obvious problem with such "tests" is that the composite model makes little

theoretical sense. Nonetheless, the data seem to be saying that more

explanatory power is lost by dropping the absolute values of e and Pu from the

equation than is lost by dropping e and pUâ€¢ This evidence, along with the

goodness of fit statistics, is more favorable toward the market clearing and

adjustment costs models than the Keynesian models.

   Except for the indexing rationale, none of the models examined here are

entirely consistent with the evidence for the 1929-1982 and 1947-1983 samples.

In these samples VQt and PIUNCt are the only variables which are strongly

correlated with relative wage variability. These variables are also generally

positively correlated with VWt in the other three samples. Although the

negative correlation between pU and W reported here is fairly weak, these

results cannot be viewed in isolation from Hamermesh's findings which are based

on a wide variety of measures of pu



              VIII. WHY HAVE RELATIVE WAGES BECOME MORE RIGID ?

   The macroeconomic sources of increased wage variability can be identified

for the regression model y =   txt,   t   = 0,1 from the identity

                       Eiy   8x0 +    xj30 +    Li3   ix.
The unrestricted specifications in Tables 3 and 4 are used for the

decomposition of the sources of decreased relative wage variability between the

1890-1926 and the 1947-1983 samples. The 1890-1926 sample is used in the

comparison because the wage data seem more reliable than those for 1860-1890

and the sample period is considerably longer than that in the Conference Board

data. The results of this decomposition are reported in Table 5.
                                     18

   There is only one economically meaningful factor in the decomposition based

on (1) that can account for any of the decline in relative wage variability

between 1890-1926 and 1947-1983: a reduction in the variability of output

growth. By itself this accounts for 22 percent of the decline. Changes in all

other independent variables either had little effect on the decline in relative

wage variability (less unexpected inflation and less variability of past

inflation in 1947-1983) or worked to increase relative wage variability

(higher expected inflation in 1947-1983). Changes in the coefficients and

interactions between changes in the independent variables and changes in the

coefficients exactly offset the impact of reduced variability of output

growth. Statistically speaking, the change in relative wage variability can be

"explainedt' fully by the change in the intercept between the two samples.

   The conclusions from the decomposition based on (2) seeni different at first

glance. In this specification, the change in each of the coefficients has a

large impact on the decline in relative wage variability. The biggest

contributor is the growth in the PIUNC coefficient between 1890-1926 and

1947-1983; by itself this accounts for 75 percent of the observed decline in

relative wage variability. The growth in the VQ coefficient and the shrinkage

of the inflation coefficients each account for an additional eleven to fifteen

percent. Yet there is little intuition behind these results; all they say is

that for given values of each independent variable, VQ is smaller in 1947-1983

than in 1890-1926. In fact, these results are more mystifying than those based

on (1) because changes in the means of the independent variables account for a

negligible proportion of the change in the dependent variable.

   What other factors can account for the increasing rigidity of relative

wages? Based on the discussion in Section III, it is clear that some of the
                                      19

 decline in W can be attributed to more accurate measurement of wages and

 changes in the industrial mix. Yet it is equally clear from that discussion

 that factors such as measurement error, aggregation, and industrial mix are not

 the entire story.

    Two possible historical factors behind the drop in W over time are the

 growth of unions and the increase in the average size of establishments. The

 impact of these changes in economic structure on relative wage variability is

examined in Allen (1987) by regressing the wage growth rate in each industry on

the average wage growth rate, a labormarket counterpart to the beta used in

stock market analysis. This measure is called w-beta. The mean value of W

over any period is directly related to the dispersion of w-betas around one.

In Douglas's "union" manufacturing industries, w-beta tends to be less than or

equal to one; in other manufacturing industries, it is generally greater than

one. For unions to reduce VW, the w-beta estimates for industries which are

unionized or become unionized must converge toward one without any similar

adjustment in nonunion industries. No such pattern is evident in the data;

the estimates of w-beta converge toward one in practically every industry. The

hypothesis that w-beta equals one can be rejected in only two cases in the BLS

data. Thus, union growth does not seem to be a key factor.

   The impact of the growth of average establishment size can be evaluated in

an analogous fashion. In the Long data, the mean value of w-beta for

industries with average establishment size of 50 or smaller is .736; whereas it

is 1.146 in all other industries. In the Conference Board data, the mean value

of w-beta is .694 in industries where average establishment size is 100 or

below. In industries with 101 to 500 employees, the mean value of w-beta is

.969; 501 or more, 1.084. A reduction in the employment share of smaller
                                     20

establishments would reduce the variation of w-beta around one, but because of

the extreme difficulties in comparing average establishment size across these

different data sets it is by no means certain that this has occurred.

   A final possible explanation of the drop in t is improved communication of

wage information. Today BLS does monthly surveys of large samples of

establishments to gauge wage trends. This information is released with a

relatively short lag and is widely disseminated. In contrast wage studies done

in earlier periods were usually limited to particular industries or geographic

areas and were not released in enough time to be of more than academic

interest. Better information should reduce the odds that wages will be set at

levels where markets do not clear.



                                IX. CONCLUSION

   This paper has documented a large decline since World War II in the

magnitude of changes in relative wages across industries. The reasons for this

increase in wage rigidity are not yet clear. Except for greater variability in

output, the macroeconomic factors examined here do not seem to have had much

effect on the rise in relative wage rigidity. Increases in average

establishment size and improved communication of wage trends are probably

partially responsible for the observed drop in relative wage variability.

  Across all periods examined, no single macroeconomic model explained

year-to-year fluctuations in the rate at which relative wages change. Rational

expectations models are consistent with the evidence for 1860-1890 and the

adjustment cost model is consistent with the results for 1890-1926 and

1920-1936. The Keynesian model with nominal wage rigidity is also consistent

with the results for these three samples, but it has less explanatory power.
                                     21

In the post-war samples, the results are consistent only with the indexing

rationale developed by Hamermesh.
