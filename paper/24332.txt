The Impact of Education on Family Formation: Quasi-Experimental Evidence from the UK

JEL No. I26,J12,J13

                                           ABSTRACT

We examine the impact of educational attainment on fertility and mating market outcomes. Using
a regression discontinuity design, we exploit an extension of the compulsory schooling age from
15 to 16 in 1972 in the UK. The change was binding for a quarter of the population. Simple plots
of the raw data show substantially lower teen fertility rates across the threshold of the reform, but
no impacts on abortions and no impact on completed fertility by age 45. In the mating market, the
reform induced both men and women to marry more educated mates, consistent with positive
assortative mating. We show that timing of the teen fertility reduction coincided with the timing
of the extra induced schooling and that the probability of marrying a peer in the same academic
cohort rose. These results suggest that school attendance may have important direct effects, in
addition to and separate from the human capital effects of education.

I        Introduction

The inclusion of education in models of family formation (fertility and mate choice) has a long

history. The early theoretical literature emphasized education’s role in family formation via impacts

on the opportunity cost of a woman’s time (Becker, 1960, 1965; Mincer, 1963; Willis, 1973); on the

quantity-quality margin of child investment (Becker and Lewis, 1974); on discount rates (Becker and

Mulligan, 1997); and on knowledge of contraception (Rosenzweig and Schultz, 1989). More recent

theoretical contributions on positive (Becker, 1981; Chiappori, Oreffice and Quintana-Domeque,

2012) and negative (Chiappori, Iyigun and Weiss, 2009) assortative mating in marriage markets have

acknowledged educational attainment and marriage as part of a joint decision process, complicating

the notion that correlation between educational attainment and family formation outcomes reflects

a causal effect of education.1 The recognition that education, marriage, childbearing, and labor

force participation are likely to be tied together in a forward-looking choice framework echoes

the concern from the wage returns literature (e.g., Card, 2001) that OLS estimates of returns to

education may be significantly biased due to sorting on preferences and ability.

        Understanding the causal impact of education on family formation is important—not only

because forming partnerships and bearing children are among the most important economic choices

individuals make over their lifetimes, but also because the early theoretical literature on education

and family formation continues to be widely invoked today, for example to explain patterns of

female labor force participation and fertility delay. These models of family formation were mainly

predicated on simple correlations, such as between completed education among women and the total

fertility rate, with comparisons identified by comparing different cohorts of women or by looking

cross-sectionally within cohorts (Willis, 1973). The relevant endogeneity concerns were noted at

the time of these early studies, even if the data and econometric techniques were not yet advanced

enough to confront them.2

        In this paper we examine how education (specifically the length of schooling) affects fertility

and mating market outcomes. To do so, we exploit a powerful quasi-experiment that extended the
    1
      Willis (1973) also explicitly recognized that educational investment, labor force participation, mating market
outcomes, and childbearing may be jointly determined in a forward-looking decision process.
    2
      As Willis (1973) wrote: “Although all of the effects of education except its effect on the market earnings capacity
of the wife have been ruled out by assumption, it is recognized that education may well have a systematic effect on
tastes, efficacy of fertility control, or efficiency in household production.”

compulsory schooling age in Britain by one year. Beginning with the September 1957 birth cohort,

individuals had to stay in school through the term in which they turned 16 years old, whereas

individuals born before September 1957 had to remain in school through the term in which they

turned 15 years old. As these compulsory schooling laws were binding for many (roughly 35 percent

of the population dropped out at the minimum schooling age), this reform had a profound effect on

the school leaving decisions of many. The way this large quasi-experiment was implemented allows

us to leverage regression discontinuity comparisons based on month × year of birth comparisons.

Such comparisons overcome some of the identification concerns pointed out in the prior literature

(Black, Devereux and Salvanes, 2008; Stephens and Yang, 2014) regarding the difficulty of isolating

the effects of educational reforms from coinciding trends when using difference-in-differences designs.

The institutional context here also allows us to sidestep critiques (e.g., Lang, 1993; Card, 2001) that

in some settings, the local average treatment effect of compulsory schooling reforms are identified

off of a small and potentially non-representative group of individuals. Given that the share of the

affected population in our context was sizable, our estimated treatment effects are likely to come

closer to estimating an average treatment effect (Oreopoulos, 2006).

   We combine this research design with rich administrative and survey data on a range of fam-

ily formation outcomes: conceptions, abortions, births across ages, and mating market outcomes

that include effects on spouse characteristics. Simultaneously examining these various margins is

important for understanding the underlying channels: For example, examining abortions gives in-

sight into whether changes in observed births imply any changes in sexual behavior, and examining

effects on the composition of women’s spouses may be important for understanding fertility out-

comes if the partner’s preferences over children matter. We supplement the administrative data

with in-depth contextual panel data from the National Child Development Study (NCDS). The

NCDS followed a cohort of individuals born in March 1958 who were one of the first cohorts sub-

jected to the new compulsory schooling age of 16. The NCDS allows us to do something that is—to

our knowledge—unique in the economics literature: directly identify the individuals for whom the

compulsory schooling was binding (i.e., the compliers). The study asked respondents about when

they would have left school if, counter to fact, the compulsory schooling age had remained set at

age 15. We use these data to contrast stated and revealed preferences towards partnership and

fertility between always-takers and compliers. We observe these respondents during the period of

                                                  2
the extra schooling at age 16, which is useful in unpacking the mechanisms behind the effects we

estimate.

    Using administrative data on the universe of UK births, we find that the extra year of compul-

sory schooling led to a 30 percent decline in fertility at ages 16 and 17, with effects clearly visible in

simple regression discontinuity plots. We provide the first evidence in the literature of education’s

impact on abortions, finding at most a negligible effect on abortions. This implies that the observed

teen fertility reduction reflects primarily a decline in conceptions. This holds despite the fact that

abortions were an important part of the fertility process in this context. Both in 1975 and in 2015,

15 to 20 percent of conceptions ended in abortion in England and Wales.3 Beyond the teenage

years, we show that the fertility effects of the schooling reform are essentially zero. The 95 per-

cent confidence interval for our IV estimate of a year of schooling’s effect on completed family size

excludes effects larger than one tenth the size of the OLS relationship. These precisely-estimated

zeros stand in stark contrast to the robust cross-sectional associations between completed fertility

and education that motivated the opportunity cost and quantity-quality tradeoff models and are

still widely cited today.

    At the same time, we show significant impacts on the mating market. Affected individuals (both

men and women) have more educated spouses, consistent with theories of positive assortative

mating. Our estimates imply that completing the basic high school credentialing in our setting

leads to a 14 percentage point increase in the probability of a partnering with a male spouse with

a credential (for women) and a 25 percentage point increase in the probability of partnering with

a female spouse with a credential (for men). This change in educational sorting is not entirely

explained by men and women marrying the same set of partners they would have in absence of the

reform but who are now themselves more educated as a result of the reform. Simulations show that

such a ‘mechanical’ effect would generate partner credential effects two orders of magnitude smaller

than the effects we estimate. Additionally, as further evidence against a purely mechanical effect,

we find that the compulsory schooling reform caused both men and women to have spouses closer

to themselves in age—particularly someone in the same academic cohort.4 Our data also allow us
   3
     This statistic has remained relatively constant over time since abortion legalization. The calculation of the ratio
of abortions to conceptions is based on the ratio of abortions to births plus abortions and thus ignores miscarriages
which are heavily misreported. For teenagers, the ratio of abortions to conceptions is even higher.
   4
     However, changes in the age gap are not completely accounted for by increases in marriage within the same
academic cohort.

to show that teen “shotgun” marriages, where a conception precedes the wedding, dramatically

declined as a result of the schooling reform.

       The family formation literature typically focuses on education affecting behaviors through

changing economic opportunities or tastes, but our results point to an additional important factor

in these decisions: the role of schooling itself. Examining the specific month-by-month timing of

when the extra schooling occurred, we show that conceptions were reduced only during the time

period when 15 and 16 year old females were newly constrained to remain in school. From the

NCDS, there is suggestive evidence that compulsory schooling was likely a binding constraint on

the peer group and tended to encourage teen females to delay cohabitation with older men. In

this way, our paper expands a small body of work that has shown direct effects of being in school

(Berthelon and Kruger, 2011), and connects to a broader literature considering “incapacitation”

effects when juveniles are subject to increased supervision, or their time use is otherwise constrained

(Lefgren and Jacob, 2003).5

       Taken together, the evidence suggests that schooling has a direct effect on the probability of

conceptions during school, in addition to and separate from the human capital effects of education,

which we show play out in marriage markets over the longer term. In this way, we view our paper

as contributing to an expanding the notion of what a “treatment” consists of when considering

compulsory schooling; schooling has impacts beyond the standard productivity and signaling stories.

       This paper also contributes by extending the recent literature on family formation in several

important ways. First, much of the literature focuses on either fertility effects in isolation or

assortative mating in isolation despite that these two processes are inherently intertwined. Papers

in this literature include Currie and Moretti, 2003; Lefgren and McIntyre, 2006; Black, Devereux

and Salvanes, 2008; Monstad, Propper and Salvanes, 2008; Lavy and Zablotsky, 2015; McCrary and

Royer, 2011; Silles, 2011; Cygan-Rehm and Maeder, 2013; Grönqvist and Hall, 2013; Aaronson,

Lange and Mazumder, 2014; Fort, Schneeweis and Winter-Ebmer, 2016; Güneş, 2016. Second,

the regression discontinuity approach rests on a minimal set of assumptions. In particular, our

methods allow us to overcome the challenges of addressing confounding time and cohort trends

that can confound identification in other IV and difference-in-difference designs. Of the previously-
   5
   Berthelon and Kruger (2011) exploit the lengthening of the time spent in school in Chile from 32 to 39 hours per
week. They conclude from regional and time variation that increasing the time in school reduced teen fertility.



                                                        4
mentioned studies, only McCrary and Royer (2011), which focuses on the infant health effects of

extra schooling and exploits discontinuities in school starting ages, utilizes a regression discontinuity

design.6 Third, the combination of several administrative datasets along with detailed descriptive

panel data allow us to document new facts and to flesh out the mechanisms behind the effects we

find. For example, from the administrative data, we generate the first estimates in the literature of

the impact of schooling on teen abortions, and from the NCDS panel, we provide a window into the

reported preferences and revealed behaviors of compulsory schooling compliers during their teen

years.

       Besides contributing new empirical evidence to a long theoretical literature on education and

family formation, our paper has several concrete policy implications: With the important caveat

that we study only one margin of education, we note that schooling can be a powerful tool to reduce

teenage fertility, which is widely considered bad for both teen mothers (Geronimus and Korenman,

1992; Goodman, Kaplan and Walker, 2004; Chevalier and Viitanen, 2003; Ashcraft, Fernández-Val

and Lang, 2013) and their children (Royer, 2004; Painter and Levine, 2004). Importantly, we find

that although schooling reduced teen births, it led to no reduction in completed fertility, implying

that increasing educational attainment at the population level need not imply reductions in future

levels of completed fertility.7 This is a particularly relevant implication for Western Europe, where

low fertility is a major concern in light of growing strains on pension systems and public health

systems. Indeed, low fertility motivates significant policy intervention across Europe (see Kalwij,

2010 for an overview). Finally, we show that the compulsory schooling intervention had a multiplier-

type effect in that it increased in expectation the average education of affected individuals’ spouses.

Thus, further increases in the compulsory school age, including those that have taken place very

recently in the UK, may have the distributional effect of raising the economic wellbeing of the

individuals at the bottom of the educational attainment distribution (who are most likely to be

impacted by such policies) beyond the direct effects on own education and earnings.
   6
     Fort, Schneeweis and Winter-Ebmer (2016) use an empirical strategy focusing on comparisons across yearly birth
cohorts, similar to a flexible difference-in-difference design. In the context of our data, which show strong trends even
across different month of birth cohorts of the same cohort year, such a strategy would fail to adequately control for
coinciding trends.
   7
     Our results here are estimated in the context of a modern developed country, though we note that teen fertility
reduction is often cited as an important motivation for increasing educational attainment among women in developing
countries.

II        Compulsory Schooling Laws

A        The Background of 1972 ROSLA

Compulsory schooling laws in the UK are set at the national level.8 They include a maximum

age by which children must start school and a minimum age at which children can leave school.

Officially, children must be age 5 when they enter school; this has been the same since the late

1800’s. September 1st is the standard school entry cutoff.9 In the UK, most students are kept

on track (i.e., are in their predicted school grade given their date of birth) as students rarely skip

grades and are rarely held back (Bono and Galindo-Rueda, 2007).

        In 1947 and 1972, the UK increased the compulsory schooling age, in a policy action commonly

referred to as ROSLA (Raising of the School Leaving Age). The first of these changes increased

the minimum leaving age from 14 to 15 and the second extended it further to age 16.10 We focus

exclusively on the 1972 ROSLA because fertility data are not available for the women affected by

the 1947 ROSLA.

        The 1972 ROSLA applied to students in England, Wales and Scotland. We focus on England

and Wales because we do not have fertility data for Scotland. The exact timing of ROSLA was

a surprise, although the discussion of increasing the school exit age spanned many years. During

World War II, the government passed the 1947 ROSLA and further recommended a school-leaving

age change to 16 when feasible.11 Later, the Crowther Report and the Newson Report (reports

of the Central Advisory Council for Education in England) both recommended changing ROSLA

to 16 in 1959 and 1963, respectively. Finally in 1964, action was taken to implement the change.

The slated date was 1970-1971. But by 1968, the British government postponed ROSLA for two

years. In March 1972, it was officially announced that the school-leaving age would increase by

one year. The new school leaving age became effective on 1 September 1972. For identification

purposes, it is beneficial that the compulsory change was implemented when the impacted cohorts
    8
     Some of this discussion is adapted from Clark and Royer (2013).
    9
     Local educational agencies (LEA) have the option of having multiple school entry cutoff dates (i.e., one for each
of the three school terms) although at the time, LEAs were shifting towards having only one entry point (Woodhead,
1989).
  10
     Several papers exploit the 1947 change to understand the effects of education on wages, happiness, crime, and
health (e.g., Harmon and Walker, 1995; Oreopoulos, 2006; Devereux and Hart, 2010; Machin, Marie and Vujic, 2011;
Clark and Royer, 2013).
  11
     These details come from Woodin, McCulloch and Cowan (2013).

were teenagers. There is no possibility that parents selectively timed the birth of their children

(who are the mothers, wives and husbands in our study) to avoid the compulsory schooling change.

      The effect of the policy change was that students who turned 15 before September 1972 (born

August 1957 or earlier) were subject to a compulsory schooling age of 15, and students who turned

15 after this date (born September 1957 or later) were subject to a compulsory schooling age of 16.

It is this comparison between the August 1957 birth cohort and the September 1957 birth cohort

that our regression discontinuity exploits. The September/August contrast also coincides with the

annual school entry cutoff and thus, any age-in-grade effects would confound our ROSLA effects,

absent appropriate controls. As we discuss later, we address this via the inclusion of calendar

month-of-birth dummies.

      In the Appendix, we discuss in more detail some important aspects of the 1972 ROSLA. Ap-

pendix Figure 1 gives the maximum and minimum years of full-time education attained by those

leaving school at the minimum school leaving age, which varies slightly depending on calendar

month (season) of birth. As discussed further in Clark and Royer (2013) and described in more

detail later, although the standard measure of educational attainment in British data is the age

at which one leaves full-time education, we can interpret the differences in the age of terminating

full-time education as differences in years of education.

      A detail particularly relevant for our study is the treatment of pregnant females within the

schooling system. Both before and after ROSLA, females who became pregnant during the period

of compulsory schooling were required to continue with education through their pregnancy. They

attended school until the later months of their pregnancy, after which they received an in-home,

state-provided tutor. Thus a teen pregnancy did not result in a waiver from the compulsory

schooling requirement.

      Finally, unlike the 1947 reform, the 1972 ROSLA affected the acquisition of educational cre-

dentials. Much of this is due to the structure of the schooling system. At the completion of grade

eleven, the last grade of enrollment for ROSLA compliers, students could sit for the O-level exams

on various subjects.12
 12
      The exam system has subsequently changed.

B       The Impacts of the 1972 ROSLA

How could the 1972 ROSLA impact family formation? The literature suggests several possibil-

ities. First, an increase in a woman’s education could impact tastes for childbearing directly.

Second, education could alter labor market opportunities—through occupation choice or through

wages—which could change the demand for children and the desired timing of childbearing. Third,

education could influence the rate of time preference. Fourth, the extra schooling could impact

health and thereby affect fertility at both the intensive and extensive margins. Fifth, it could

influence the choice of mate, either through the mechanisms described above or directly through

tastes.

       Prior research, albeit limited, gives us some insights as to which of these channels may be

operating as a consequence of the 1972 ROSLA.13 There were wage effects of the 1972 ROSLA for

both men and women (Grenet, 2013). Thus, the long-noted mechanisms related to the opportunity

cost of child bearing could be at play. The affected cohorts were also less likely to receive welfare and

more likely to report being happy (Oreopoulos, 2007). Health impacts of the additional education

were minimal (Clark and Royer, 2013) although more recent work (Barcellos, Carvalho and Turley,

2017) suggests that there are effects in the tails of the health distribution with reductions in

body size and increases in blood pressure.14 No prior study in this context examines underlying

preferences over childbearing, marriage desiderata, or time preferences, though we provide some

self-reported survey evidence related to each of these preference parameters below.



III       Data

Our study uses several datasets. We describe each of these in turn. The common variables linking

our datasets are the month and year of birth of women whose education, fertility, and partnership

outcomes we examine. Our analysis is at the level of month × year of birth cohorts, as we describe

later.15 A summary of the data sources and the relevant variables we extract from each is provided
  13
     Most of the literature using the UK compulsory schooling laws focuses on the 1947 ROSLA, not the 1972 ROSLA.
  14
     It should be noted that only Clark and Royer (2013) and Barcellos, Carvalho and Turley (2017) use month ×
year of birth regression discontinuity comparisons; the other studies either use year-of-birth regression discontinuity
comparisons (Grenet, 2013) or difference-in-differences contrasts using Northern Ireland (Oreopoulos, 2007).
  15
     Many of these measures come later in life (e.g., 2001 Census) after many years have lapsed since the required
schooling. Clark and Royer (2013) find no impacts of ROSLA on survival to these later years, alleviating concerns
about survival bias.

A    UK Labor Force Survey

Information on educational attainment comes from the 1975-2002 UK Labor Force Survey (LFS).

The LFS samples a large number of households to provide information on labor force participation,

employment, and training. Around 60,000 households are interviewed in each wave. Between 1975

and 1983 the LFS was conducted biannually. Between 1983 and 1992 the LFS was an annual survey

of a similar number of households. Since 1992, the survey has been a rotating quarterly panel, with

the same households interviewed for five consecutive quarters. In the analysis, we include multiple

observations per person when available, and cluster all results at the year of birth by month of

birth level. Respondents’ year and month of birth are available in public release LFS datasets up

to 2002.

    Since its existence, LFS respondents have been asked about the age at which they first left full-

time continuous education. We use these data primarily to validate the first stage, the existence

of which has been established elsewhere using different data sources (Clark and Royer, 2013). As

argued in Clark and Royer (2013), we can interpret our first-stage estimates of effects on the age

at which respondents left full-time schooling as effects on years of schooling. Our pooled sample of

1975-2002 LFS gives us a large sample of over 300,000 respondents born between 1954 and 1962.


B    Live Birth Records

Live birth data were supplied by the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS). The records cover

every birth between 1970 and 2008 in England and Wales to mothers born in England, Wales,

or Scotland—roughly 600,000 to 900,000 births per year.16 Since teen fertility is a relatively rare

outcome, it is crucial to have a census of births. The births data are birth counts by mother’s

month and year of birth and child’s month and year of birth but do not include parity information.

Given that we rely mainly on across-cohort variation in education, it is not problematic that we do

not observe individual-level birth data. Specifically, our regression framework, described later, does

not require the inclusion of covariates aside from controls for cohort trends. Any pre-determined
  16
     The birth records from England and Wales do not distinguish between mothers born in England and Wales and
mothers born in Scotland. This poses minimal problems for our study, since only a small fraction of the women living
in England and Wales during this time were emigrants from Scotland (<1 percent).


                                                         9
covariates, in principle, should be similar for individuals born immediately prior to September 1957

and individuals born immediately following September 1957 because sorting around this threshold

would be impossible (as ROSLA was announced when the first affected cohorts were teenagers).

    The structure of our data implies that we can recover cohort-specific fertility rates but not

individual-level fertility rates. For instance, our data cannot distinguish between a scenario in

which one woman bears her first child at age 20 and another woman from the same cohort bears

her first child at age 24 and a scenario in which one woman bears her first child at age 20 and then

her second at age 24. In practice, since we find that the reform only impacts fertility among females

aged 16 and 17, who are very likely to have been first-time mothers, the missing parity information

is of little consequence. Moreover, under the assumption that education affects fertility behavior

mainly in one direction (i.e., either increasing it or decreasing it), the inability to distinguish parity

will not cause us to mischaracterize the results.17

    For each cohort of women, we construct age-specific and total fertility rates according to stan-

dard practice (Preston, Heuveline and Guillot, 2001). The numerator in the age-specific rate for

birth cohort c is the number of births to women of cohort c covering a particular age range (e.g.,

[16, 17)). The denominator is the number of women alive in that age range. It is not possible to

know exactly how many women are alive at each point in time. Thus, we generate the denomi-

nator by multiplying the size of the female cohort at birth (obtained from the Registrar’s Annual

Reports) with a succession of age- and calendar year-specific survival rates for the UK (obtained

from the Human Mortality Database). We validate these denominator estimates by comparing our

predictions for each cohort size in 1991 and 2001 with cohort size as measured by the 1991 and 2001

Censuses. Our estimates and these numbers line up very closely. This correlation ranges between

0.93 and 0.95.

    The total fertility rate (TFR) aggregates the age specific rates. Cohort TFR reflects the average

number of children that women in the cohort bear over their lifetime, conditional on surviving
   17
      For example, counter to this assumption, suppose that the reform influences one woman to increase her fertility
from 2 to 3 children and influences another to reduce her fertility from 1 child to being childless. In this case, the
total number of children born is unchanged but this overall effect masks important heterogeneity. In studying the
effects of education quality on fertility among blacks, Aaronson, Lange and Mazumder (2014) argue that there could
be positive effects along the extensive margin increasing the probability of having at least one child and at the same
time negative effects along the intensive margin due to the quality and quantity tradeoff. However, in the British
Household Panel Survey, the correlation of age left full-time schooling with the probability of having any children and
the correlation of age left full-time schooling with the probability of having more than 1 child conditional on having
at least 1 child are both negative.

through their fecund years.


C      Abortion Records

Detailed abortion records come from the UK Office of National Statistics. Like the live birth

records, these data are counts by women’s month and year of birth. Unlike the live birth records,

these are limited to a narrower range of cohorts born around the reform threshold. They also cover

only abortions performed in the teen years (the only years for which we find any fertility effect).

These data allow us to construct teen (15-19) abortion rates for cohorts of women born within a

36-month window of the ROSLA threshold.

      The context of the 1972 ROSLA is uniquely suited to examining the role of abortions; the quasi-

experiment we exploit occurred in the era of modern fertility when abortion and contraceptives (e.g.,

the birth control pill and intrauterine devices) were available. The 1967 Abortion Act legalized

abortion in the UK. This Act covered abortions for teenagers, did not require parental consent

or notification, and incurred no out-of-pocket costs. Oral contraceptives became available in 1961

through the National Health Service.18 Moreover, abortions were and are an important part of the

fertility picture; the ratio of abortions to births in our sample varies from 1.7 abortions per birth

for 15 year olds to 0.3 for 19 year olds. The teenage abortion rates experienced by the near-ROSLA

cohorts were even higher than those experienced by cohorts in the US and UK today.19


D      UK Census Extracts

We commissioned several extracts of the 2001 Census that are useful for understanding the mating

market effects of the extra education. These extracts allow us to track the age difference between

partners as a function of each partner’s month × year of birth and the educational credentials of

each spouse in relation to their own month × year of birth. In addition, we can quantify how

ROSLA affected own educational credentials.

E    National Child Development Study

Finally, we use data from the National Child Development Study (NCDS). This is a panel dataset

for which survey administrators attempted to track 100 percent of babies born in Great Britain in

one week of March 1958 into adulthood. This cohort was one of the first to be subject to the 1972

ROSLA. Information collected at ages 7, 11, 16, 23, 33, and 41 offer insight into cohort members’

school activities and stated and revealed preferences over fertility and partnerships during the extra

year of compulsory schooling and beyond. Because the NCDS covers just a single post-ROSLA

cohort, we cannot use our main regression discontinuity strategy.

    However, these data contain a unique feature that allows us to directly identify compliers and

always takers. When participants were 16, the study asked the cohort members when they would

have dropped out of school had the 1972 ROSLA not been in place. Responses to this question,

which we validate as informative, allow us to examine whether compliers are different from always-

takers in their stated preferences at 16, conditional on being exposed to exactly the same years of

schooling at the time of stating those preferences. This analysis, which reveals significant sorting on

tastes for early family formation, provides context for our precisely estimated null effect of education

on completed family size, despite a large cross-sectional correlation. We also use these data to

provide deep context regarding relationships in the teen years, shedding light on the mechanisms

behind our teen fertility and mating market findings.



IV     Empirical Strategy: Regression Discontinuity Framework

Our empirical strategy leverages the difference in the minimum school exit age resulting from the

1972 ROSLA. Specifically, we use a regression discontinuity framework to compare individuals born

immediately on either side of the September 1st 1957 cutoff, who we argue are similar except for their

relevant compulsory schooling exposure. Our analysis proceeds in two steps: first, documenting

that the 1972 ROSLA did indeed change educational attainment as intended, and second, examining

the subsequent effects of ROSLA on fertility and family formation.




                                                  12
A       Educational Impacts of the 1972 ROSLA

To estimate the first-stage educational impacts of the 1972 ROSLA, we follow the fuzzy regression

discontinuity setup (Imbens and Lemieux, 2008; Lee and Lemieux, 2010). That is, we estimate

local linear regression equations of the following form using data near the September 1957 cohort

threshold:

                                    Ec = γ0 + γ1 Dc + γ2 Rc + γ3 Dc Rc + uc ,                                        (1)

where Ec is an average educational attainment measurement for month × year of birth cohort c

(e.g., the fraction leaving school at age 15 or the average age at school exit), Dc is an indicator for

whether the cohort is affected by the 1972 ROSLA (equal to 1 for cohorts born September 1957

and later and 0 otherwise), Rc is the running or forcing variable (the month × year of birth relative

to September 1957) centered such that R = 0 is the September 1957 cohort, and uc is the error

term.20

       While the Labor Force Survey data on education would allow us to estimate this regression

using the individual-level micro-data, all of our outcomes (births, abortions, education and age of

mate) are measured as averages at the month × year-of-birth level, so we aggregate the LFS data to

the month × year-of-birth level. We weight these regressions by cohort size calculated as described

in the data section. The inclusion of Rc captures cohort trends, and the inclusion of Dc Rc allows

the cohort trends to differ on either side of the September 1957 cutoff. We know no a priori reason

why they should differ, other than that these cohorts experienced their later teen years during a

time of rapidly-changing fertility trends throughout the OECD.

       Our regression discontinuity estimator effectively contrasts outcomes for September and August

cohorts born in the same year. The parameter of interest (γ1 ) can be thought of as the “jump” in

the dependent variable at the program threshold. This is the sense in which our research design

exploits the comparison of cohorts “just unaffected” and “just affected” by the reform. However,

to the extent that relative age or age at school entry affects the outcomes of interest, our estimates

of γ1 will be confounded. We can net out this potentially confounding variation via the inclusion

of month-of-birth fixed effects, which can be separately identified from cohort trends because the
  20
    In this context, for most individuals educational attainment can be derived from age at school exit with little error
because retention rates are low (<5 percent). See http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/education/eurydice/documents/
thematic_reports/126EN_HI.pdf



                                                           13
regression samples include cohorts born in the same calendar months across several birth years. We

report all results with and without these month of birth controls. In practice, for most outcomes,

the addition of these fixed effects has little impact on our estimates of γ1 .


B    Fertility and Mating Market Impacts of the 1972 ROSLA

To evaluate the effects of ROSLA on our main outcomes of interest—fertility and assortative mating

outcomes—we estimate regressions of a form very similar to that of equation (1) except that our

dependent variable is different. That is,


                               Yc = β0 + β1 Dc + β2 Rc + β3 Dc Rc + vc ,                        (2)


where Yc is an outcome of interest (e.g., fertility rate at age 17), and β1 is the estimate of the

ROSLA impact on that outcome. Note that our information on educational attainment and on

fertility and mating market outcomes come from different datasets. Thus, to derive the return to

an extra year of schooling on any of our outcomes Yc , we can estimate β1 /γ1 , the standard Wald

IV estimate using a two-sample instrumental variables strategy (Angrist and Krueger, 1992).


C    Choice of a Bandwidth

Estimating these equations requires deciding on how close to the September 1957 threshold to re-

strict attention. We follow the cross-validation procedure of Ludwig and Miller (2007) to determine

the appropriate bandwidth. The method minimizes the square of the prediction errors from the

local linear model. Because we estimate a variety of effects (births at 16, 17, 18, 19, etc.), we

choose one bandwidth for each similar set of outcomes (e.g., education or marriages or births). For

example, when looking at teenage fertility, we find the strongest visual evidence of effects at age

17. We then choose the bandwidth that performs best in the cross-validation statistic for the age

17 outcome and use it for all of the other teenage fertility outcomes.

    In principle, the bandwidth should not matter too much with a convincing design. To demon-

strate robustness, we estimate models with both narrower and wider bandwidths than what the

Ludwig and Miller (2007) cross-validation suggests. There are other several bandwidth selector

algorithms (Imbens and Kalyanaraman, 2012; Calonico, Cattaneo and Titiunik, 2014). Calonico,


                                                  14
Cattaneo and Titiunik (2014) argue that traditional bandwidth estimators choose bandwidths that

are too large for the distributional assumptions invoked and as a result introduce a non-negligible

source of bias. Calonico, Cattaneo and Titiunik (2014) consider the case with a continuous running

variable whereas we have a discrete running variable (i.e., month × year of birth). For this reason,

we do not use their selection algorithm for our main set of estimates. Nonetheless, we present

estimates following the procedure of Calonico, Cattaneo and Titiunik (2014), which are similar to

our main results.


D    Identifying Assumptions

A key advantage of the regression discontinuity approach is the minimal set of assumptions needed

for identification. We must assume that individuals born immediately prior to and immediately

following September 1957 are otherwise identical except for their educational attainment. Ex ante,

this assumption seems plausible as the policy change was not pre-announced. Moreover, it is

testable, at least in terms of observables. For each observable characteristic that should be pre-

determined, one can test whether the characteristic has a discontinuity at the September 1957

threshold. Clark and Royer (2013) perform this analysis, for example examining the number of

births and stillbirths among the birth cohorts that grow up to be the students, wives, husbands,

and parents in our data, and find no evidence of discontinuities in these outcomes.

    In order for our IV estimates to measure the causal effect of a year of additional schooling at

age 15, we must assume that the 1972 ROSLA does not affect fertility through channels other

than its effect on the probability of experiencing a year of full-time education at age 15. This

exclusion restriction would be violated, for instance, if the law was accompanied with a change in

the accommodations for pregnant students. As we discuss above, the policy environment did not

change along this dimension.



V     First Stage Effect on Education

A    Age Left Schooling

We begin by reporting estimates of the impact of ROSLA on educational attainment. Figure 1

shows the impact of the 1972 ROSLA on age at school exit for women and men. Specifically, each

                                                15
point in this figure represents the average outcome for a cohort defined by month and year of birth.

The three sets of points trace the fraction who left school by age 15, by age 16, and by age 17. The

lines are local linear regression fits to those underlying points using the chosen bandwidth.

   ROSLA affected schooling decisions exactly as the policy was designed. The reform had an

immediate impact on age at school exit as there is a clear drop in the fraction leaving by 15,

starting with the September 1957 cohort. This drop is on the order of 25 percentage points.

Estimates are similar for men and women. The extra year of required schooling at age 15 did

not induce students to stay much beyond what was mandated by ROSLA as there were minimal

impacts on the probability of leaving school by age 16 or 17.

   While Figure 1 suggests that most students complied with the new law, there is a non-negligible

share of individuals who report not complying (<8 percent for most cohorts). The apparent lack

of compliance is particularly high among cohorts born in June, July, and especially August. This

is because school was not in session when these individuals turned 16. School ends in late May for

15/16 year-olds, and according to the 1972 ROSLA rule, summer-borns are considered to have met

the schooling requirement if they leave at the end of the grade. For non-summer borns, it appears

that some of the reported non-compliance is measurement error. The LFS is a panel, so we can

look at the various responses given by the same respondent about the age at which he or she left

school. Over 10 percent of respondents who report leaving school at age 15 also report leaving

school at 16 in a different survey wave. (All waves were reported as adults and close in time to

each other.) Further, the NCDS, which interviewed the March 1958 cohort when the respondents

were 16 years old and recall error would be lower, shows that less than 1 percent of respondents

reported leaving school before age 16.

   In Table 1, we quantify the patterns observed in Figure 1. In Panel A, we report discontinuity

estimates of γ1 (see equation 1) for different educational outcomes. The estimation sample includes

48 months of birth cohort data on either side of the ROSLA threshold (i.e., 96 months in total).

The reported mean of the dependent variable is for the August 1957 birth cohort. ROSLA led to

a 27 and a 25 percentage point reduction in the fraction of individuals leaving schooling by age 15

for women and men, respectively.

   As evident in Figure 1, ROSLA did not induce large fractions of cohorts to stay in school beyond

the extra year. Specifically, the effects on leaving at age 16 and 17 are -2 and -1 percentage points.

                                                 16
The overall effect on age at which respondents left full-time education is 0.31 years for women and

0.38 years for men, which are highly statistically significant with t-statistics exceeding 5. Figure 2

displays the corresponding regression discontinuity plots for age leaving full-time education.

    These results are extremely robust to the inclusion of different seasonal controls. In Panel B of

Table 1, we control for any cohort seasonality and age-in-grade effects by re-estimating regression

equation (1) with a full set of month-of-birth dummies excluding the September month-of-birth

dummy.21 Given the consistency of the month-of-birth pattern across cohorts, calendar month-of-

birth dummies are likely to adequately control for these patterns. Nonetheless, to further demon-

strate robustness, in Panel C we exclude the summer borns (i.e., those born in June, July, and

August) from the sample, instead of adding calendar month-of-birth dummies. The results in all

cases are similar to those from Panel A, demonstrating the strength of this research design and first

stage. These first-stage estimates are also essentially identical to those of Clark and Royer (2013)

who utilize different data.22

    In Appendix Tables 2 & 3, we show that the results are not very sensitive to the selected

bandwidth. In Appendix Table 2, for each outcome, we provide the estimates using the Calonico,

Cattaneo and Titiunik (2014) bandwidth selector and estimation procedure. In Appendix Table

3, we show how our estimates vary under other bandwidths. For both of these tables, we include

month-of-birth fixed effects in addition to the standard regression discontinuity design variables.

However, in a few cases, the Calonico, Cattaneo and Titiunik (2014) chosen bandwidth is smaller

than 12 months. In these cases, we drop the month-of-birth fixed effects from the Calonico, Cattaneo

and Titiunik (2014) estimation procedure. The outcomes for which we consider this alternative

specification are denoted with an asterisk in these appendices.


B    LATE, Credentialing, and Human Capital

While these regressions verify the existence of a clear first-stage relationship, several other points

from Panel A are worthy of discussion. First, the size of the impacted population is considerable.
  21
     We have also estimated models where we allow the effects of month of birth to differ on either side of the
September 1957 threshold. The results are similar.
  22
     For a point of reference, Clark and Royer (2013) use the General Household Survey and the Health Survey of
England. For women, their first-stage estimate on age at which respondents left full-time schooling is 0.31 and on
leaving by age 15 is -0.27 when calendar month-of-birth fixed effects are included. For men, the analogous statistics
are 0.36 and -0.25.



                                                         17
Over a quarter of the post-reform population had its school leaving age impacted by the 1972

ROSLA. As such, the estimated local average treatment effects (LATE) may be closer to the average

treatment effect (ATE) in this context (Oreopoulos, 2006). In comparison, difference-in-differences

designs exploiting compulsory schooling changes in other contexts have been identified off of only

about 5 percent of population in the US (Lleras-Muney, 2005) and only about 12 percent in Norway

(Black, Devereux and Salvanes, 2008). Second, the set of compliers for whom we identify the effect

of a year of education is a policy-relevant subpopulation. Because we exploit a policy change, rather

than some other type of natural experiment, the compliers in our context are the marginal types

whose behaviors can be altered by policy. Third, we do not have to worry about weak instruments

given the strength of the first stage; the F-statistic on the first-stage estimates for exiting school by

age 15 exceeds 150. Such worries have hindered analysis of compulsory schooling in other countries

(see Black, Devereux and Salvanes, 2008 for a discussion of this).23 Finally, and somewhat unique to

this institutional context, the strength and robustness of the first stage combined with the manner

in which the reform was implemented allows us to use regression discontinuity methods rather than

difference-in-differences methods; the regression discontinuity design may be preferable given the

relatively weak assumptions needed for identification.

       As in any identification scheme based on schooling reforms, compliers take on the extra schooling

only when required to, and there may be a concern that compliers acquire little human capital in

that extra year. There are several reasons to believe this is not the case in our context. First, there

was significant investment in teachers and physical infrastructure leading up to the reform, which

was necessary to accommodate the larger student body. The student-teacher ratios, a crude measure

of education quality, were essentially unchanged across the reform, as we show in Appendix Figure

2. As long as the trend in educational investment does not change discretely, starting with the

September 1957 cohort, our identification strategy is still valid. Second, Grenet (2013) estimates

a 6-7 percent hourly wage return to a year of schooling from the 1972 ROSLA. Finally, using

our own data we can provide some additional insight on what the ROSLA treatment entailed by

examining an alternative measure of education: performance on high stakes exit exams. For this,

we use information from the 2001 Census, which included retrospective responses about the highest
  23
    Black, Devereux and Salvanes (2008) show in the context of US data that difference-in-differences estimates
of compulsory schooling’s effects on education lead to weak first-stage estimates with the inclusion of state-specific
trends along with the appropriate calculation of standard errors.

credentials attained during secondary schooling.

       During our study period, students took O-level and A-level subject-specific exams. Passing

O-level exams at the end of grade 11 (age 16) conferred a “qualification” credential, and these

O-level qualifications served as the standard credential awarded at secondary school-leaving. A-

level exams were used for university admissions.24 Table 2 displays the regression discontinuity

estimates for women (left side) and men (right side) where the dependent variables across columns

are these qualification outcomes. For both genders, there is a substantial drop in the fraction with

no qualifications: -25 percent for females and -16 percent for men. There is a coinciding shift to

having 1 or more O-level exam credential or 1 A-level.25 There is also a drop in the fraction having

other qualifications (which include other more vocational degrees), so part of the shift to O-level

exams appears to be a movement from vocational credentials to academic credentials.26 However,

there is no effect of having a higher level of credential beyond 1 A-level exam. This is consistent

with the visual evidence in Figure 1, since more than 1 A-level exam would indicate intentions to

attend college, and Figure 1 shows no large spillover effects to educational attainment beyond age

16.

       Before moving on to our main findings, we note that it is plausible that ROSLA had general

equilibrium effects in the sense of changing the environment to which “control” (pre-ROSLA)

cohorts were exposed. This is because treatment and control cohorts were living in the same

communities and competing with each other in the same labor markets and mating markets. If

so, then our research design identifies the differential impact of ROSLA on post-ROSLA cohorts

(who experienced the new equilibrium and the education treatment) and pre-ROSLA cohorts (who

experienced only the new equilibrium). It is important to understand that identification here does

not require assuming there are no general equilibrium effects on mating markets—much the same

as estimating the wage returns to education using schooling reforms does not require assuming that

there are no general equilibrium effects of such reforms on labor markets. In short, the comparison

of outcomes between pre- and post-ROSLA cohorts is valid in the presence of general equilibrium
  24
     A levels continue to exist in the UK. O levels were eventually replaced with the General Certificate of Secondary
Education. O-level exams are the lower level exams taken at the end of grade 11. A-level exams are used in university
admissions.
  25
     The 2001 Census we received are aggregated such that 1+ O-levels and 1 A-level groups are combined together.
  26
     The other qualification category includes City and Guilds which awards vocational qualifications, Royal Society
of Acts or Oxford, Cambridge and RSA which is a professional typing credential, and BTEC or Edexcel which are
privately-administered academic, vocational, or work-based credentials.

effects, though one might expect effects to differ from what would be estimated in the partial

equilibrium setting of changing educational attainment for just a small group of individuals.



VI        Fertility Results

Having established the strength of the first stage, we now shift to the main focus of the paper -

family formation. We start here by examining the effects of the ROSLA reform on fertility before

turning to the mating market in Section VII.27


A       Teenage Fertility

ROSLA extended compulsory schooling during the teen years. Figure 3 presents plots of age-specific

fertility rates across cohorts over the teen years in a format analogous to that in Figure 2. These

fertility rates are calculated according to age-last-birthday. Thus, the age 16 rate captures births in

the exact age range [16,17), and the age 17 rate captures births in the exact age range [17,18). The

figure shows declines across the policy threshold for fertility at 16 and 17, but no visually obvious

effects at later ages. The magnitude and significance of these ROSLA effects are explored in Table

3, which presents reduced-form estimates (unscaled by the first stage).28,29

       Table 3 shows that ROSLA led to significant declines in fertility at age 17. The age 17 effects

range from -0.0031 to -0.0034, depending on the inclusion of month of birth fixed effects. These

magnitudes are economically meaningful. A reduction of 3.1 births per thousand 17-year-old women

corresponds to an 8 percent decline. Scaling by the first stage effect on years of education (0.31)

generates a Wald IV estimate equal to a 26 percent decline.

       The age 16 estimates are similarly large, though somewhat sensitive to specification. This is

likely because a birth at age 16 is a rare event. The Panel A estimate on age 16 fertility is −0.0018,
  27
     General fertility patterns in the UK and Europe during our sample period are discussed in the Appendix and
help to give some context to the underlying cohort trends we observe here.
  28
     Our data do not allow us to examine fertility at ages below 15. The administrative birth records begin in 1970,
which means that the first cohort for whom we could calculate an age 14 birth rate is January 1956. This leaves us
with too small a pre-reform sample to do meaningful estimation. However, little is lost by this limitation. Fertility
at age 14 is a rare event, even in our dataset of the universe of births. Thus any age 14 estimates would have been
associated with large standard errors and driven by just a handful of births nationally.
  29
     The Table 3 teen fertility estimates are based on a narrower data window than the Table 1 education estimates.
These different windows are those suggested by a cross-validation procedure. Intuitively, the fertility window is
narrower because, around the ROSLA threshold, fertility trends are more rapidly changing than education trends.
In suggesting a narrower window, the cross-validation procedure implicitly takes account of this feature of the data.



                                                         20
which is statistically significant at p < 0.05. The Panel B and C specifications yield estimates that

are indistinguishable from zero. Since the age 16 effects are sensitive to specification, it helps to

view these estimates in the context of Figure 3. Declines in both age 16 and 17 fertility are visually

apparent in the figure. In terms of size, the middle-range estimate for the age 16 fertility effects

of −0.0018 (Table 3, Panel A) corresponds to a 10 percent decline. After scaling by the first stage

effect, this represents a 32 percent decline.

       Beyond age 17, we observe no ROSLA impacts on teenage fertility. Consistent with the visual

impression of Figure 3, the estimates for age 18 and age 19 fertility are small (2.6 percent and 0.3

percent of their means, respectively) and statistically insignificant.30 To explore channels behind

these teen effects, we examine below how the timing of reductions in teen conceptions aligns with

the timing of the new schooling. We defer this discussion until Section E because it requires

reorganizing the data to define implied conception dates as relative to the dates of new schooling.

       Finally, we note that there appears to be a significant change in the slope of the age 19 fertility

trend near the policy threshold. Upon closer inspection the timing for this change would have been

1976-1977. This 1976 effect, which occurs in the age 19 plot among cohorts born in late 1957, is

also apparent in the age 18 plot among cohorts born in late 1958, in the age 17 plot among cohorts

born in late 1959, and in the age 16 plot among cohorts born in late 1960. In Appendix Figure

3, we draw on fertility data from France and Germany and show that these countries similarly

experienced this trend break in 1976. Because these other European countries shared the same

trend break, and because the trend break was year-specific rather than cohort-specific, it seems

safe to conclude that this has nothing to do with ROSLA and instead reflects general trends in

fertility in Europe at that time.


B       Births by Marriage Status

We can separate in-marriage and out-of-marriage births in the administrative birth records. Ap-

and estimation procedures.

       Appendix Figure 4 clearly shows that the overall fertility impacts we see for ages 16 and 17 come

from a decline in in-marriage fertility. The magnitudes of the regression discontinuity estimates for

in-marriage births are similar to those in Table 3 for fertility overall. Because marriage itself may be

affected by ROSLA, it is not immediately apparent whether the drop is due to a change in marriage

or a change in fertility conditional on marriage. However, aggregate national statistics describing

births within 8 months of marriage can shed some light on this: In this population and time period,

essentially all marriages among 16-17 year-old females were preceded by a conception.31 Because

essentially all births in-marriage were indicative of a “shotgun” marriage (i.e., conception, then

marriage, then birth), the observed drop in in-marriage births has a near one-to-one correspondence

with a drop in “shotgun” marriages. In contrast, there is no fall in birth rates for out-of-marriage

fertility. Our identification strategy cannot be used to determine whether the overall decline in

births reflects substitution only from in-marriage births to no births, or if there was substitution

from in-marriage towards out-of-marriage status that exactly cancelled a substitution from out-of-

marriage births to no births. What is clear, however, is that ROSLA caused a decline in “shotgun”

weddings.


C       Abortions and Conceptions

A crucial element missing from past economic studies is how abortion may mediate the impact of

education on fertility. Usually abortion data are difficult to obtain. In the United States, abortions

are not universally reported across states. In the UK, due to the existence of the National Health

Service, which provides universal healthcare including abortions, the corresponding administrative

abortion micro-data are more reliable and comprehensive.

       Information on terminations allows us to better understand how education affects conception

and sexual behavior, rather than inferring these behaviors by observing births alone. For example,
  31
     The UK’s Office of National Statistics (ONS) reports summary statistics on births taking place within 8 months
following a marriage, implying that the conception preceded the wedding. In 1972 there were 2,767 such births to
16-year-old married women. Our main births dataset show that in 1972 the total number of births to 16-year-old
married women was approximately 2,887. (The number depends slightly on what one assumes about the mother’s and
baby’s exact date of birth within their birth months.) Therefore, essentially all in-marriage births among 16-year-olds
followed the pattern of: conception, then marriage, then birth. In the same time period, 87 percent of in-marriage
births to 17-year-olds followed this same “shotgun” pattern. Appendix Table 5 shows a complete listing of these
statistics by age and year.



                                                          22
the education-related reductions in fertility among 16 and 17 year olds would be consistent with a

reduction in conceptions and no effect on abortions or consistent with no effect on conceptions and

an increase in abortions.

     In Table 4, we present the reduced-form regression discontinuity estimates for abortions at ages

15 through 19. Figure 4 shows the analogous figures. Across all of the ages, all of the specifications,

and alternative bandwidths (see Appendix Tables 2 and 3), there is no strong evidence of an impact

of ROSLA on abortion rates. Most of the reduced form point estimates range from 1 to 3 percent

of the mean abortion rates. The exception is the age 15 effect, which implies a 6 to 9 percent

reduction in abortion rates relative to the mean, but because the mean incidence is so low, the

estimates are imprecise.

     Rather than examining abortions and births separately, we can combine these data together to

estimate effects on conceptions. To do this, we adjust the timing of abortions to be consistent with

that of births. For example, an abortion in September 1974 would have likely resulted in a birth

in the first half of 1975 if the abortion had not occurred. To align the timing, we age abortions

forward by 7 months (most abortions occur before 12 weeks of gestation) and add abortions and

births together to form our “conception” rate. Of course, this measure misses miscarriages.

     Appendix Table 6 presents the ROSLA effects on this measure of conceptions. The increase in
                                                                                  −0.33
school exit age reduces the conception rate at ages 16 and 17 by 12 percent (=     2.75 )   and 9 percent
     −0.50
(=   5.48 )   in the reduced-form estimates in Panel A. These effects are statistically significant at

the 1 percent level, though again the significance of the age 16 result is sensitive to specification.

These magnitudes align with those for birth rates. And like the age 18 and 19 effects on birth rates,

conception effects for ages 18 and 19 are much smaller and statistically insignificant.

     In summary, the abortion and conception results indicate that 15- through 17-year-old teens

changed behavior primarily by reducing the probability of a conception rather than by increasing

abortions, despite the high baseline abortion rates in this context. Further, the negligible effects

of education on fertility for the older teenagers were not due to changes in conceptions that were

merely counteracted by matching changes to abortion decisions.




                                                   23
D     Cumulative Fertility

Since the earliest of the ROSLA-impacted cohorts have completed their fertility by the early 2000’s,

we can also examine the impacts on completed family size. Figure 5 plots the regression disconti-

nuity figure for cumulative fertility from ages 16 to 45 (inclusive).32 This cumulative fertility rate

is constructed as the sum of each cohort’s age-specific rates up to age 45. Because of the nature of

our births data, we do not observe completed fertility at age 45 at the individual level. However,

the cumulative rate we calculate would exactly equal the average completed family size found in

individual data provided that all women in the cohort survived through their childbearing years.

Since the probability of survival from 16 to 45 among these cohorts was above 98 percent, we view

our cumulative fertility measure as a good measure of average completed family size.33

    Figure 5 suggests that there was no effect of increased schooling on completed fertility. The scale

of the vertical axis is measured in average births per cohort woman, and the apparent null effect of

the reform is contained within a very narrow band of births per woman. Table 5 presents regression

discontinuity estimates corresponding to Figure 5, as well as an expanded set of cumulative fertility

outcomes. Cumulative births between 16 and 25, 16 and 30, 16 and 35, 16 and 40, and 16 and 45

are considered as outcomes. The reduced form effects implied by Figure 5 and the last column of

Table 5 range from -0.0055 to 0.0073 children. Even after this reduced form effect is scaled by the

ROSLA effect on years of schooling, this range is only -0.018 to 0.023 children.

    To put this effect size in context, note that for cohorts of women born near the reform threshold,

an additional year of education at age 16 is associated with a decline in total fertility of 0.248

children in the cross section (see Geruso, 2010). Our IV estimates are an order of magnitude

smaller. The finding of no completed fertility effect is robust to alternative regression specifications

and bandwidths (see Appendix Tables 2 and 3).
   32
      Cohort-specific cumulative fertility is often referred to as the cohort total fertility rate (TFR). Cohort TFR,
which is derived from age-specific rates for a fixed cohort, differs from period TFR, which is derived from age-specific
rates for a fixed point in time.
   33
      It should be noted that measurement error in the denominator of fertility rates (i.e., the number of women alive)
cannot explain our results. In particular, our regression discontinuity estimate in the presence of this measurement
                    ∗
error is equal to DD ×(true regression discontinuity effect) where D∗ is the true denominator and D is the denominator
with measurement error. To derive this, we assume that the regression discontinuity estimator is the difference in
fertility rates for nearby cohorts and further assume that the number of women in the nearby cohorts is the same.
                                              ∗
Using Census data, we can approximate DD well since these Censuses are intended to be 100 percent samples. For
the 1991 and 2001 Censuses for the cohorts we study, this ratio ranges from 1.044 to 1.069. This means that the true
regression discontinuities are slightly smaller than what we estimate but not appreciably so.




                                                          24
    We can also compare our estimates to the most relevant studies within the existing literature.

Black, Devereux and Salvanes (2008) and Monstad, Propper and Salvanes (2008) utilize educational

reforms in Norway that extended the length of compulsory schooling by 2 years, standardized cur-

riculum, and increased access to schools. Fort, Schneeweis and Winter-Ebmer (2016) exploit several

different compulsory schooling reforms across Europe. Our estimated effect on total fertility is not

far from the estimate of Monstad, Propper and Salvanes (2008) of −0.009 but is much smaller than

that of Fort, Schneeweis and Winter-Ebmer (2016), who find that an additional year of schooling

changes fertility by −0.28 in the UK using the 1947 reform and a positive estimate for continental

Europe of 0.21 children using the 1947 compulsory schooling reform.34 Besides addressing different

time periods and educational margins, a plausible explanation for the differences in estimates is

methodology. These prior studies exploit difference-in-differences or yearly birth cohort comparison

designs. As fertility trends are uncommonly strong during this period (see Appendix Figure 3),

our regression discontinuity approach may be particularly well-suited to controlling for time and

cohort trends.

    Finally, we note that although at first glance it may seem that our findings of large negative

teen fertility effects and small or zero completed fertility effects imply positive “catch up” effects

beyond the teenage years, this is not necessarily true. Instead, because teen fertility is such a small

component of average completed family size, the confidence intervals on our fertility effects include

both this catch-up story and the polar opposite story under which the teen fertility effects lead to

a permanent (albeit tiny) reduction in completed fertility.

    These possibilities can be seen in Figure 6, which aggregates information from 30 separate re-

gression discontinuity estimates.35 Each point in the plots represents an estimate of the cumulative

fertility effect between age 16 and the indicated age. The first point in the left panel, for example,

represents the cumulative effect from 16 to 16, and corresponds to the ROSLA effect on the age

16 fertility rate from Table 3, Panel B, column (2). The last point in this plot represents the

cumulative effect from 16 to 45, corresponding to the Table 5, Panel B, column (5) estimate. The

left panel in the figure displays estimates for which cumulative fertility is measured in levels, while
  34
     As for teenage fertility, our estimate on teenage fertility is one-third the size of the Black, Devereux and Salvanes,
2008 study.
  35
     These follow the Panel B specifications from Tables 1 through 5, and are based on local linear regressions that
include month of birth dummies.



                                                            25
the right panel presents estimates for which cumulative fertility measured in natural logs. Fertility

rates vary considerably with age, and the right panel estimates can be interpreted as percentage

changes. Examining percentage changes this way makes the increasing cumulative fertility denom-

inators more apparent. Panel B of Figure 6 shows that the cumulative effects begin at age 16 and

then fade away, as the averted teen births become swamped by the larger number of births at older

ages.


E    “Direct Effects” on Fertility versus Human Capital Channels

The difference between the teenage fertility effects and the cumulative fertility effects seems to

contrast with the predictions from the classic theoretical literature on fertility decisions (Becker,

1960; Willis, 1973; Becker, 1965; Becker and Lewis, 1974). This literature emphasizes human capital

effects operating on fertility decisions in many ways, including altering time preferences, altering the

opportunity cost of non-labor market activities such as child rearing, and altering the equilibrium

mating outcomes such as spouse’s income and education. These types of human capital effects

are expected to impact the timing of childbearing and number of children.36 Note that under any

such theories, one would expect the influence of education to be permanent, with potential fertility

impacts throughout the life cycle. In contrast, we document fertility effects that are short-lived

and only appear in the teen years.

    On the other hand, some recent empirical work has suggested a more direct role of spending

time in school, possibly due to more intense monitoring of activities or exposure to different peers

(i.e., classmates in school versus coworkers out of school). For example, in Chile the lengthening

of the school day was associated with fertility reductions (Berthelon and Kruger, 2011). It is also

plausible that spending time in school could directly impact mating outcomes by changing peers,

and that these mate effects could play a role in the observed fertility outcomes (a theme we return

to in Section VII).

    To begin to untangle the various possibilities, we classify the many potential channels from
   36
      Classical theories linking fertility and education emphasize the role of opportunity costs and the tradeoff between
quantity and quality of children (Becker, 1960; Willis, 1973; Becker, 1965; Becker and Lewis, 1974). Increases to a
woman’s education raise the opportunity cost of her time and lead to the combination of income and substitution
effects influencing fertility in opposite directions. To explain the strong cross-sectional correlation between education
and fertility, Willis (1973) argues that the substitution effect trumps the income effect. Becker (1965) and Becker
and Lewis (1974) discuss a substitution from quantity towards quality with ambiguous effects on family size.



                                                           26
education to fertility into two broad categories: the human capital effects and the “direct effects”

of schooling. We begin in Figure 7 by reorganizing the data to examine in finer detail the timing of

fertility effects relative to the timing of the new compulsory schooling period. Doing so allows us

to test the conjecture that the reduction in pregnancies carried to term is coincident in time with

current school attendance.

       Students in the UK could only leave school at a small set of allowed leaving dates, corresponding

to the end of school terms. Thus the exact ages over which the new schooling takes place varied

depending on the month of birth of the woman. For example, for the September cohort, this extra

schooling would have happened between the ages of 15 years and 7 months and 16 years and 7

months. For January-borns the new schooling occurs between 15 years and 3 months and 16 years

and 3 months.

       For each calendar month, we calculate the woman’s age range (at the the resolution of months)

for the period over which the extra schooling would have occurred. This equals the actual period

of new required schooling for post-ROSLA cohorts and the counterfactual period of new schooling

that pre-ROSLA cohorts were not actually exposed to. We subtract 9 months from the birth

dates to calculate a conception date. Using this re-organization of the data, we construct the

implied conception rates for the 12 month period before the extra schooling (labeled “before new

schooling”), for the 12 months during the extra schooling period (“new schooling period”), and for

the 12 months after the extra schooling period (“post new schooling period”). Returning to our

example of the September-born women, the conceptions during new schooling for the September-

borns would correspond to fertility rates for ages in the range of 16 years and 4 months to 17 years

and 4 months.

       Figure 7 shows our regression discontinuity estimates, along with 95 percent confidence intervals,

of the effect of the 1972 ROSLA on ln(fertility rate) for each of these three relative-to-school-

attendance time periods.37 With the caveats that we cannot account for preterm births or the

exact day of birth of the mother—both of which add noise to our estimates—the fertility effects

line up remarkably closely with the new period of compulsory schooling. The only statistically

significant effect on fertility is the one corresponding to the new period in school. Effects for the
  37
    Because each of these estimates combines fertility at different exact ages, we use ln(fertility rate) as the dependent
variable. This facilitates comparing fertility rates at different ages, because fertility rate levels rise rapidly with age
during the teenage years.


                                                            27
other periods are smaller and statistically insignificant.

       To explain these effects that occur only during the period of new schooling, we must explain

why females were less likely to become pregnant during the new compulsory schooling period, but

not before or after.38 An obvious explanation is that they had fewer opportunities to become

pregnant: less contact and less time with older men that they might have met in other contexts,

such as the workplace. Aggregate national statistics from the UK from this period reveal that the

vast majority of teen marriages and among 16- and 17-year-old females and a large share of their

pregnancies were associated with matches to older men.39 This suggests that exposure to older men

may be an important factor for teen pregnancy. This leads us in the next section to examining the

mating market to provide a more complete picture of the ROSLA effects. Although mating and

fertility are likely to be linked, most prior empirical work on the effects of education has examined

one or the other outcome in isolation.



VII        Mating Market Outcomes

In this section, we examine how the schooling reform impacted the mating market outcomes for

affected cohorts.40 We analyze effects on two dimensions of mate characteristics: spousal education

and age gaps between spouses. The aggregate patterns of assortative mating along educational

attainment and age have long attracted the interest of economists and other social scientists (e.g.,

Qian and Preston, 1993; Qian, 1998; Lewis and Oppenheimer, 2000; Greenwood et al., 2014), and

there is some prior econometric evidence of how one’s own education impacts the educational attain-
  38
     One counterpoint to our argument that schooling has an incapacitation effect is that for teenagers, conceptions
are fewer during the summer. Under incapacitation, we would expect that summer conceptions would be higher when
women had more free time. Incapacitation may work differently in these two settings—given that leaving school for
the summer is different from leaving school permanently.
  39
     Although there are no available micro data that indicate date of marriage, aggregate national statistics reveal
that female teenagers who were marrying must have been marrying older men. In 1972 there were 8,295 married
16-year-old females compared to just 629 married 16-year-old males. In the same year, there were 17,967 married
17-year-old females and 3,044 married 17-year-old males. These facts, combined with the observation from our main
dataset that more than half of births to 16- and 17-year-old women were in-marriage, suggest that partnering with
older men was an important component of the teen fertility picture.
  40
     Schooling could impact the characteristics of one’s mate in several ways. A theoretical literature (e.g., Becker,
1973; Konrad and Lommerud, 2000; Iyigun and Walsh, 2007; Chiappori, Iyigun and Weiss, 2009) emphasizes the
return of education in the marriage market in addition to the labor market. These returns may operate through
several mechanisms; increases in education may change preferences over spouses directly; the acquisition of additional
education may alter one’s share of the marital surplus by strengthening one’s bargaining power in the marriage; or,
through changes in occupation or employment status, extra schooling may affect opportunities to meet more-educated
potential mates.



                                                         28
ment of one’s partner—using within-twin pair variation in schooling levels (Behrman, Rosenzweig

and Taubman, 1994) and using discontinuities in university admissions criteria (Kaufmann, Mess-

ner and Solis, 2015). There is no prior empirical work of which we are aware estimating impact

of education on the age difference between spouses, despite that this age gap is often noted as an

object of interest in studies of marriage (e.g., Stevenson and Wolfers, 2007), is used as a measure

of marital bargaining power (e.g., Casterline, Williams and McDonald, 1986), and is interpreted

in mating models as being informative of the gender-specific division of marital surplus between

spouses (Bhaskar, 2015; Brandt, Slow and Vogel, 2016).


A       Assortative Mating by Education

We find that the educational reform significantly affected spousal educational attainment. In Fig-

ures 8 & 9 and in the corresponding Table 6, we report ROSLA’s impacts on the partner’s educa-

tional outcomes. Figure 8 shows, as a function of the wife’s date of birth, the probability of the

male spouse having: no qualifications, 1 or more O-level exam or 1 A-level exam, and 2 or more

A-level exams or higher.41 O- and A-level exams are sets of high-stakes national exams covering

different subjects. O-level exams happen after grade 11 (the grade in which most will turn 16).

A-level exams are administered two years later and are used for university admission. Figure 9

presents the analogous results for men. It is important to keep in mind that we observe these

individuals in the 2001 Census, many years after the 1972 ROSLA. As such, we interpret these

effects as the long-run impacts on mate choice. Conditioning the analysis on marriage is valid in

this case because we find there is no effect of ROSLA on the probability of marriage.42

       Both women and men affected by ROSLA were less likely to marry partners with no qualifi-

cations. The regression discontinuity estimates are similar for men and women—a statistically-

significant reduction of 1.0 to 1.4 percentage points across specifications in Table 6. Figures 8 & 9

visually confirm these estimates, which are remarkably stable across specifications and bandwidths

(see Appendix Tables 2 and 3). When scaled by the first stage effect on own years of schooling,
  41
     These categories are mutually exclusive, and the category divisions were chosen by the UK Census.
  42
     For men, the regression discontinuity point estimates on an indicator for married are a statistically insignificant
-0.0004 and -0.0006 for the 1991 and 2001 Censuses (off of bases of 0.69 and 0.66 for those years, respectively).
For women, the effects are -0.0086 and 0.0001 for the same years off of bases of 0.66 and 0.74—also statistically
insignificant despite large samples. Using educational variation resulting from quarter of birth, Lefgren and McIntyre
(2006) also find no impact of a woman’s education on the probability of marriage.



                                                          29
                                        −0.0123                     −0.0143
these effects amount to a 22 (=        0.237×0.24 )   and 28 (=    0.187×0.30 )   percent reduction for women and

men, respectively, in the probability of marrying an individual with no educational qualifications.43

Alternatively viewed, these results imply that a 10 percentage point drop in one’s own probability
                                                  0.10×−0.0123
of having no credentials leads to a 1.8 (=            −0.07    )   percentage point decline in the male spouse
                                         0.10×−0.0143
having no credentials and a 3.6 (=           −0.04    )   percentage point decline in the female spouse having

no credentials.44 These effects are comparable in magnitude to estimates derived from within-twin

pair variation in educational attainment. Behrman, Rosenzweig and Taubman (1994) estimate that

a year of additional schooling for a male translates into marrying a wife with 0.3 to 0.4 more years

of schooling.45

       Our results on spousal educational attainment, considered alongside the 6-7 percent own wage

returns to the 1972 ROSLA documented by Grenet (2013) for both men and women, suggest

the potential for important impacts of ROSLA on the household’s overall economic wellbeing.

In particular, our results illustrate how educational attainment can have multiplicative effects on

household wellbeing by changing mate quality and mate earnings. This accords with work by

Lefgren and McIntyre (2006), who document in the US that an important part of the return to

schooling for women operates through the husband’s earning capacity.

       Despite these effects on own and partner’s earning potentials, the large assortative mating

results we find stand in clear contrast to our null findings with respect to completed fertility, creating

somewhat of a puzzle.46 In principle, the income and substitution (opportunity cost of time) effects

associated with additional schooling could exactly cancel, but perhaps a more plausible explanation

behind the null fertility findings is that—unlike the assortative mating patterns—the cross-sectional

association between childbearing and female education is driven largely by underlying heterogeneity

in preferences over family size. Below we shed some light on this issue by turning to self-reported

survey data collected at age 16, with which we show that in the absence of ROSLA, women from the

affected cohorts would have sorted themselves into educational paths in a way that was correlated

with their stated fertility preferences.
  43
     See the Panel B specifications of Tables 1 and 6.
  44
     See columns 1 and 5 of Table 2.
  45
     They do not estimate the effect of a wife’s schooling on her husband’s schooling.
  46
     It would perhaps be unsurprising to find no fertility effects if there were no substitution effects—due to higher
wages—or income changes—such as those generated by matching to a more educated, higher-earning partner (Goldin,
1997). But here we observe the scope for direct income effects through one’s higher wages and indirect income effects
through assortative mating.


                                                           30
    Because ROSLA affected both men and women, it is natural to ask how much of the observed

positive assortative mating results are a consequence of a mechanical effect—i.e., post-reform co-

horts marrying the same individuals as they would have in absence of this policy, but with these

mates gaining additional education because of ROSLA. We address this question in two ways. First,

we simulate the expected magnitude of such a mechanical effect, given the pre-ROSLA spousal age

gap distribution (i.e., assuming no ROSLA-generated effect on the spousal age gap). If the particu-

lar spouses chosen were unaffected by the reform, then the pattern of age gaps would be unchanged.

By multiplying the pre-ROSLA probability of marrying someone of the same age by the effects on

academic credentials from Table 2, we simulate the declines in the probability of one’s spouse hav-

ing no credentials to be -0.00077 and -0.0004 for males and females, respectively. These simulated

effects are almost two orders of magnitude smaller than the estimates presented in Table 6, so Table

6 is not simply reflecting a mechanical effect in which individuals marry the same-aged partners as

before who now have more education due to ROSLA.47 Intuitively, this finding makes sense given

that the probability of marrying someone in a particular month × year birth cohort is small. Un-

der the counterfactual assumption of no shifting of the mate age distribution, a person in the first

post-ROSLA cohort is only slightly more likely to marry a post-ROSLA individual than a person

in the last pre-ROSLA cohort.48

    Second, we can also assess whether the observed assortative mating by educational attainment

is mechanical by testing whether the reform affected the age gaps between spouses. We do so in the

next two subsections. If the effect of ROSLA on marital sorting was entirely a mechanical effect in

which the same partners (each now more educated) paired up, we would expect to see no impact

of ROSLA on the spousal age gap or on the probability of marrying a classmate.


B    Partner’s Age

In Appendix Figure 5, we display the regression discontinuity graphs for the age gap between

spouses. In the left panel we show the husband’s age minus wife’s age as a function of the woman’s

      Note also that this calculation assumes that the trends in educational attainment are zero, though allowing for
such trends in education has little impact on the estimates.
  48
     For example, suppose for simplification that the age gap distribution was such that women had an equal prob-
ability of marrying men 0 to 24 months older than them (i.e., the age gap distribution has 25 points of support).
Thus, the probability of marrying any one month × year birth cohort is 4 percent. Then, pre-ROSLA women who
were born in August 1957 will not be marrying anyone affected by ROSLA whereas only one of the 25 potential mate
cohorts for September 1957 ROSLA women (i.e., September 1957 men) will be affected by ROSLA.


                                                         31
month × year of birth. In the right panel we show the wife’s age minus husband’s age as a function

of the man’s month × year of birth. These plots are seasonally-adjusted by removing month-of-birth

effects.49 The level of the pre-ROSLA means in the plots show that on average, men married women

who were 2 years younger. Appendix Table 7 presents the corresponding regression discontinuity

estimates in columns 1 and 3. Unlike for the previous outcomes, the inclusion of month-of-birth fixed

effects do matter. As seen in raw plots, there is a systematic difference in partner’s age between

August-borns and September-borns related to the school entry date of September 1st. For this

reason, our preferred specification is the set of estimates in Panel B, which include month-of-birth

fixed effects.

    Although estimates are less precise than the effects on academic credentials, for women there

is a decrease in the average age gap at the threshold. That is, women who had to stay in school

until 16 marry men closer in age to them. The corresponding regression discontinuity estimate is

-0.87 months (a 3 percent reduced-form effect and a 12 percent IV effect), which is statistically

significant at the 1 percent level.50 On the other hand, there is not a similar effect for men on the

average age gap, though the results are somewhat noisy. We also examine effects at different points

of the age gap distribution in Appendix Figure 6. A clear pattern from that set of results is that

for both men and women there is an increased probability in marrying someone who is within one

year of age.51


C    Partnering with Classmates

We can also examine in finer detail whether the additional year in high school affected the proba-

bility of marrying someone in the same academic cohort, using marriage outcomes from the 2001

Census. Because we observe only dates of births and not classroom or school assignments, these

mating market results come with the important caveat that we cannot distinguish between teen

partnerships begun in school with actual classmates and mating decisions made later in life with

partners whose exact age implies they could have been a classmate.
  49
     We regress the age gap on a set of month-of-birth dummies, take the residuals, and add back the mean age gap
to obtain these seasonally-adjusted numbers.
  50
     This estimate comes from a local linear regression with month-of-birth dummies.
  51
     In that figure for men (for women), the 0.002 (0.004) estimate at age gap of 0 years implies that men (women)
born in September 1957 have a 0.002 (0.004) increase in probability of marrying someone of the same age compared
to comparable individuals born just before that date.



                                                       32
       In Figure 10, we compute the fraction of individuals within each month-of-birth cohort who

marry someone in their same academic cohort (a potential classmate), and plot our standard

regression discontinuity figure for that outcome. An academic cohort starts with September births

and ends with August births of the following year. Due to clear seasonality in the data by month of

birth, Figure 10 plots the de-seasonalized patterns.52 Both for men and women, the probability of

marrying a classmate increases following ROSLA. The reduced-form regression discontinuity point

estimates for marrying a classmate from the preferred specification which controls for seasonality

are 0.0043 and 0.0032 for women and men respectively (see columns 2 and 4 of Appendix Table 7).

These point estimates correspond to just under a 5 percent increase and are statistically-significant

at the 5 percent level.

       The magnitudes of these effects are slightly larger than the impacts of teen births, though not

directly comparable, since these partnership outcomes likely reflect the decisions of many women

who were never at risk for a teen pregnancy. Another way to put these estimates in context is

to ask what fraction of the changes in the spousal age gap due to ROSLA could be explained by

effects on the probability of marrying a classmate.53 If we start with the age gap distribution for

pre-ROSLA individuals and then alter that distribution by increasing the probability of marrying

someone of the same academic cohort by the estimated effect size while simultaneously decreasing

the probability of marrying someone 2 years older (the mean spousal age gap), the implied effect

on overall age gap would be -0.006 for men and -0.008 for women. These effects are significantly

smaller than the regression discontinuity effects on the age gap of -0.076 and -0.868 for men and

women, respectively.

       In summary, ROSLA’s impacts on the probability that one matched to a peer in the same

academic cohort can at most explain only a small part of the age and education assortative mating

results. The remainder could be attributable to the additional schooling changing preferences over

spouses and to the additional schooling changing the post-school peer group in the workplace, along

with other assortative mating channels (though the precise mechanisms behind assortative mating

are not yet well documented in the literature). With our design, it is not possible to distinguish the
  52
     For women, the oldest in class are less likely to marry a classmate than the youngest in the class (a 0.11 probability
versus a 0.13 probability). For men, the pattern is the reverse with a slightly larger difference between the oldest and
the youngest (a 0.15 probability versus a 0.11 probability). This seasonality is unaffected by ROSLA.
  53
     Here, we can only calculate an upper bound because the age criterion we use does not guarantee that a couple
shared a classroom or a school.


                                                            33
importance of each of these channels. This stands in contrast to the teen fertility effects, the timing

of which is completely consistent with ROSLA affecting conceptions only when teens were newly

enrolled in school. For this outcome in particular, one possible explanation is that the increase in

required schooling affected teen fertility by influencing which men women partnered with at age

16. We further explore this possibility next.


D     Further Insights from the National Child Development Study

The administrative data we have exploited thus far, while extensive and comprehensive, offers little

context about the lives of the men and women we study. The NCDS is much better suited for

this purpose. It follows a cohort of individuals born in March 1958—one of the first post-ROSLA

cohorts. The panel includes survey waves at several ages, including at age 16. This allows us

to observe stated and revealed preferences over fertility and partnerships (including non-marital

sexual partnerships) while these individuals were still in school. A unique benefit of the NCDS is

that we can use it to identify the complier population, as the study asked respondents about their

desired school-leaving age.


i   Direct Identification of Compliers

Because the NCDS covers just a single post-ROSLA cohort, we cannot use our main regression

discontinuity strategy. However, at the time they were 16, respondents were asked: “Do you wish

that you could have left [school] when you were 15?” Adopting the classic instrumental variables

language, we call respondents who wished to leave school at 15 but stayed on until at least 16 the

compliers, and call the respondents who didn’t wish to leave at 15 and who stayed on until at least

16 the always-takers.54,55

    These hypothetical responses are remarkably informative. The fraction of self-identified com-

pliers in the NCDS (0.31) is very close to the fraction of LFS respondents among the pre-reform

cohorts born between 1954 and 1957 who report actually leaving school at 15 (0.33). We can further
   54
      Below we display statistics separately for the always-takers who left at 16 and for the always-takers who left at
17 or later.
   55
      We primarily rely on respondent self-identification as a complier. In the case of missing or “uncertain” responses
to this question, we use the interviewed parent’s answer to a question regarding the parent’s preferences over their
child leaving at age 15. Parents were asked whether they, “wish that [the child] had been able to leave school at
fifteen?” These parent replies account for 23 percent of our observations, though the pattern of results reported below
is not sensitive to how these cases are handled.


                                                          34
assess the validity of these responses by exploiting regional variation within England and Wales in

these statistics. The scatterplot in Appendix Figure 7 shows that the fraction of NCDS respondents

stating a wish to leave school at age 15 in each region strongly correlates with the fraction of LFS

respondents actually leaving school at age 15 in that region just prior to the reform. The correlation

between these region-specific actual dropout means and our constructed complier measure is 0.83,

supporting the idea that the self-reports about the counterfactual are informative.56


ii        Preferences and Partnerships at 16 and 17

We use the age-16 and age-23 waves of the NCDS to observe cohort members at the points in time

closest to the new schooling period. We focus on differences in stated and revealed preferences

between the compliers and always-takers. From these comparisons, we obtain two new insights.

First, we find that compliers are different from always-takers in their preferences, even conditional

on being exposed to the same years of schooling. They are more short-sighted and prefer earlier

family formation. Second, even amongst teenagers, there is a substantial age gap between women

and their sexual partners. This consistent with our age gap results above, and suggests that one of

the mechanisms by which ROSLA could have affected teen fertility is by reducing the exposure of

teenage females to older men.

          In Panel A of Table 7, we begin by reporting stated preferences over childbearing and partners.

The table is limited to female respondents in the NCDS. Column (1) lists responses for compliers

(left at 16 but wished to leave at 15). Columns (2) and (3) list responses for always takers (wished

to leave at 16 or later), split according to whether they actually left at 16 or at 17+. In all

cases, responses to preference questions were collected in the spring of the final year of compulsory

schooling, when the entire cohort would have just turned (or would have been about to turn) 16.

The birth outcomes data were collected in a later wave.

          First, it is interesting—but perhaps not surprising given results above—to note that at age 16,

which is during the additional year of schooling, the compliers and always takers differed in their

stated preferences over mates and childbearing. For example, 32 percent of compliers preferred to

have a first child by age 21, while only 17 percent of the always takers in column (2) expressed
     56
   Some error would be present even if all respondents predicted their counterfactual accurately because the LFS
measures region of current (later-life) residence and the NCDS measures region of birth.



                                                      35
that same preference. By significant margins, compliers were also more likely report that marriage

at younger ages is best. Thirty percent of compliers reported that marriage by age 19 is best,

compared to fifteen percent of the always takers who would ultimately exit school at exactly the

same time, and compared to just five percent of the always takers who would ultimately exit

school at 17 or later. These stated preference differences are correlated with actual birth outcomes:

The bottom rows of Panel A show dramatic variation in teen births that is correlated with these

stated preferences and with complier status, taking place in the months and years following these

responses.

   The results here give important context to our finding above of no impact on long-run fertility

outcomes: Preference heterogeneity appears to be a key part of the observed correlation between

educational investment decisions and fertility demand. As another indication of significant educa-

tional sorting on preferences, Panel A also reports student responses to a general question about

forward-lookingness: Students were asked to indicate agreement or disagreement with the state-

ment “I think there is no point planning for the future.” 35 percent of compliers agreed, compared

to 17 percent of always takers in the second column. Differences in the preferences reported in Panel

A cannot be driven by schooling differences, because respondents would have been exposed to the

same length of schooling at the time of the survey. We do not know whether the additional year of

schooling had no effect on the childbearing preferences of the compliers, but we do know from these

statistics that experiencing the additional year of schooling did not cause complier preferences to

converge to those of the always-takers who would also go on to complete their schooling at age 16.

   We can look more closely at certain kinds of partnerships in the NCDS to gain insight into mate

characteristics. Panel B shows that while essentially all women lived with their guardians on their

16th birthday, a substantial minority left home at 16 or 17, many to begin cohabitating with a mate.

Among both compliers and always-takers, the men with whom these women began cohabitation

were substantially older. Among 16 year-old women, the 25th percentile of the partnering man’s

age was 18 and the median was 20. The same data also reveal that a full third of the women

cohabitating at 16 had a birth by 16, and over one half had a birth by 17. Similar patterns are

found for women who began cohabitating at 17. These descriptive statistics show that women who

were in serious relationships at 16 and 17 were uniformly partnering with much older men.

   The fact that both compliers and always-takers lived at home until the end of schooling, after

                                                 36
which a substantial minority began cohabitating with older men, suggests that the reform may have

delayed the initiation of cohabitating partnerships for complier women. Thus one potential reason

that fertility declined at ages 16 and 17 is that the additional year of schooling limited women’s

exposure to older men at age 16. This is consistent with our regression discontinuity results in the

Census data that show a positive effect of the reform on the probability of marrying a similarly-aged

classmate, which could serve as a substitute for an older man.


E    Interpreting the Mating Market Results

We conclude with a discussion of how to interpret marriage results, given that these markets are

two-sided and that the nature of the variation means that “treated” and “control” cohorts were

mixing together in the same pools of potential mates. An important strength of our research design

is that ROSLA impacted a large fraction of the relevant cohorts. As such, our results reflect the

general equilibrium effects of extending schooling to a whole national cohort of individuals. But

this also implies that the mating markets for “control” cohorts could be affected by the reform, as

the flows of potential mates for these control cohorts into and out of the marriage markets change

following ROSLA.

    Even under the assumption that the all UK marriage markets are in this sense treated, our

strategy of contrasting pre and post-ROSLA individuals competing in those markets remains valid.

This is because our identification strategy does not assume anything about the nature of pre-

ROSLA marriage markets relative to post-ROSLA marriage markets. Our regression discontinuity

estimates isolate the differential effect of ROSLA on those born just following September 1957 and

on those born just prior to September 1957, regardless of the structure of marriage markets in

which they jointly participate. Thus, while it is unknowable how a ROSLA-affected woman born

in September 1957 would fare in the pre-ROSLA mating market, what we identify clearly is how

she fares relative to an interchangeable woman seeking a mate among the same pool, but who was

born a month earlier and so not subject to the new compulsory schooling.

    Finally, it is worth noting that the phenomenon of treated and not-treated cohorts competing

against each other in the same markets is not special to the marriage context; the same mixing of

treatment and control individuals in the same market applies to studies of labor market outcomes

that exploit compulsory schooling reforms. What is different here is that the affected and non-

                                                 37
affected cohort members may match with each other, rather than with an outside third party

such as an employer. While there is no policy variation we could imagine that would affect many

individuals but did not have this feature, it means there are limits to what we can infer from

this research design. For example, we cannot know how pre- and post-ROSLA cohorts would

differentially fare in the pre-ROSLA marriage markets.



VIII         Discussion

The long literature modeling a link between education and fertility emphasizes the impact of ed-

ucation on preferences, income, and the opportunity costs of raising children. In our context, the

role of time spent in school itself appears to play a larger role in fertility outcomes. Extending the

length of schooling leads to a decline in teenage births and “shotgun” marriages without a corre-

sponding rise in abortions—plausibly because it kept teen women from socializing with older men.

The extended schooling also made it more likely for affected men and women to marry someone

from their same academic cohort. Fertility effects beyond the teen years are at most small, a sharp

contrast with the cross-sectional associations between education and family size that motivated an

economic theory of the family that continues to be widely invoked today.

      In contrast, long-run impacts on mating market outcomes are large and aligned with the aggre-

gate, cross-sectional relationships. Just as a wide literature in economics, demography, and other

social sciences has documented assortative mating on education, income, and age in the cross sec-

tion and over time, we show that there is a clear causal impact of increasing one’s own educational

attainment on the characteristics of one’s mate. In particular, we find another year of schooling

at age 16 leads to a large decline in the probability of marrying a spouse without a high school

credential.

      Overall, our results reinforce the idea that the value of schooling extends beyond just the wage

returns.57 For countries in which declining fertility rates and the consequent aging populations

are straining budgets for social programs, our findings suggest that reductions in teenage fertility,

which are a widely adopted policy goal, can occur without reductions in overall fertility. In terms

of distributive implications, we show that compulsory schooling has the potential to improve the

wellbeing of the poor, who are the individuals most likely to drop out of school, through the multi-

plicative effects of assortative mating. Such non-wage effects should be considered when evaluating

ongoing reforms of the compulsory schooling laws. Very recent changes to UK compulsory schooling

laws may provide new research opportunities to examine these phenomena as the affected cohorts

now age, enter labor markets, and form partnerships and families.58

Appendix A: 1972 ROSLA

   We define the treatment of interest as experiencing an extra year of full-time education at age

15. We have characterized the 1972 ROSLA as increasing the minimum leaving age from 15 to 16.

It seems natural to suppose that ROSLA did, therefore, push significant fractions of students into

this treatment.

   While this intuition is approximately correct, it is worth noting that the school leaving rules

were slightly more complicated. In particular, there were two possible points at which students

could leave school at the minimum leaving age: Easter (i.e., the end of the spring term) and

June/July (i.e., the end of the summer term). Students born between 1 September and 31 January

were eligible to leave at Easter; students born 1 Febuary to 31 August were required to remain in

school until the summer. For a student born in September 1957, the 1972 ROSLA meant that the

earliest leaving point was Easter 1974 rather than Easter 1973. For a student born in February

1958, the 1972 ROSLA meant that the earliest leaving point was summer 1974 rather than summer

1973.

   Because students born between February and August could leave in June/July, some would

actually leave before the minimum school leaving age (both before and after the 1972 ROSLA).

This can account for some of the apparent non-compliance seen in Figure 1. Because the 1972

ROSLA required students to remain until age 16, this meant the earliest academic year they could

leave was the academic year in which students took O-level and CSE exams. Since these exams

are taken in May/June, this meant that some students, such as those born in early July, would

technically have left at the minimum age under the old system (i.e., age 15) but below the minimum

age under the new system (i.e., also at age 15, albeit almost one year later). This can account for

some of the increased non-compliance that appears to follow the 1972 ROSLA.




                                                45
Appendix B: Fertility Trends in Europe

       It is important to understand the environment in which the compulsory schooling change oc-

curred. Fertility declined dramatically between the mid-1960s and the mid-1970s in the UK. Ap-

pendix Figure 3 displays the trend, along with trends in the US, France and Germany for compar-

ison. In the UK, by 1975, total fertility had fallen to modern, below-replacement levels.

       The post-1972 ROSLA period in the UK, marked by the vertical line, is a period of low and

stable fertility (1972-2002). Modern fertility rates in the UK are quite comparable to those of the

US and France. Given the similarity of fertility today and at the time of the enactment of the

1972 ROSLA, the 1972 ROSLA is almost ideal for studying the education-fertility relationship:

early enough for the affected women to have now completed their fertility, but late enough for

them to be informative about childbearing in a modern setting. Moreover, the cohorts just affected

by the reform have shared the same access to abortion services throughout their fecund lives as

women today. Additionally, at the time, birth control pills were available to all women through the

National Health Services.59

       Aside from total fertility, we examine teenage births, often an explicit target of fertility policies.

As seen in Appendix Figure 3, teen fertility also declined through the 1960s and 1970s, although in

the UK it fell slightly slower and slightly later than total fertility. The timing of the fertility decline

is consistent with a possible effect of the 1972 ROSLA, but all countries depicted in the graph

exhibit a similarly-timed decline, raising the possibility of confounding trends. This highlights the

importance of using a research design that can credibly control for these cohort and time trends.

Teen fertility in the UK stabilized at a level higher than those seen elsewhere in Western Europe

but below that seen in the US. As of 2009, about one in eight females in the UK bore a child before

age 20.




  59
    Intrauterine devices (IUDs) were also obtainable at the time but were not widely used and were quite different
than today’s IUDs.

Notes: The impact of the 1972 ROSLA on cumulative fertility. Each point in the plots represents a regression
discontinuity estimate of the reduced form effect of ROSLA on cumulative fertility from 16 up to and including the
indicated age. The regression discontinuity regressions include the year x month of birth running variable, a dummy
for the post-ROSLA cohorts, and their interaction along with month of birth dummies. Pointwise 95% confidence
intervals are plotted as dotted lines. The left panel plots level effects, which are measured in counts of children per
woman. The right panel plots effects on natural log of cumulative fertility. Cumulative fertility at each age x is the
sum of age-specific fertility rates from 16 to x, inclusive. Since the first point in each panel represents the cumulative
effect from 16 to 16, it corresponds exactly with the regression discontinuity estimate of the reform on the age 16
fertility rate. Robust pointwise standard errors are estimated.

Notes: The impact of the 1972 ROSLA on probability of marrying someone in the same academic cohort; women's
mates are represented by the left panel and men's mates are represented by the right panel. Each point represents the
fraction marrying a classmate for women of the same month and year of birth (left panel) or men of the same
month and year of birth (right panel). Seasonality adjustments are performed by regressing the cohort fraction on a
set of month-of-birth dummies, taking the residuals, and then adding the mean fraction marrying a classmate. The
plotted lines are local linear regression fits to those points over the chosen bandwidth. The vertical line indicates the
ROSLA threshold, with the first post-reform cohort born September 1957.

Notes: Each column and row is the regression discontinuity estimate from a separate regression. Column headers list the dependent variable. Panel A includes
linear controls for cohort trends, interacted with the threshold. Panel B adds dummies for month of birth. Panel C drops summer borns to deal with the fact
that they could drop out of school at the end of May of the year they reached the compulsory schooling age. The mean of the dependent variable is measured
for the cohort born in August 1957, the last pre-reform cohort. Data come from UK Labour Force Surveys, 1975-2002. The sample is restricted those born in
the UK and resident in England or Wales at the time of the interview. Each observation is a cohort-cell mean. Regressions are weighted by cohort sizes. Robust
standard errors are in parentheses. Bandwidth is measured in months. *: p-value < 0.05, **: p-value < 0.01

Notes: Each column and row is the regression discontinuity estimate from a separate regression. Column headers list the dependent variable. Panel A includes linear
controls for cohort trends, interacted with the threshold to allow different pre- and post-reform trends. Panel B adds dummies for month of birth. Panel C drops
summer borns to deal with the fact that they could drop out of school at the end of May of the year they reached the compulsory schooling age. The other
qualification category includes City and Guilds which awards vocational qualifications, Royal Society of Acts or Oxford, Cambridge and RSA which is a professional
typing credential, and BTEC or Edexcel which are privately-administered academic, vocational, or work-based credentials. The mean of the dependent variable is
measured for the cohort born in August 1957, the last pre-reform cohort. Data come from UK 2001 Census. The samples are restricted to those born in the UK and
resident in England or Wales at the time of the interview. Each observation is a cohort-cell mean. Regressions are weighted by cohort sizes. Robust standard errors are
in parentheses. Bandwidth is measured in months. *: p-value < 0.05, **: p-value < 0.01

Notes: Each column and row is the regression discontinuity estimate from a separate regression. Cumulative fertility at each
age x is the sum of age-specific fertility rates 16 to x, inclusive. Column headers list the dependent variable. Panel A includes
linear controls for cohort trends, interacted with the threshold to allow different pre- and post-reform trends. Panel B adds
dummies for month of birth. Panel C drops summer borns to deal with the fact that they could drop out of school at the end
of May of the year they reached the compulsory schooling age. The mean of the dependent variable is measured for the
cohort born in August 1957, the last pre-reform cohort. Data come from live birth records supplied by the UK Office of
National Statistics, containing all births in England and Wales to mothers born in England, Wales, and Scotland, 1970-2008.
These are supplemented with data on cohort sizes generated by registrar reports of cohort sizes at birth and mortality rates
from the Human Mortality Database. Each observation is a cohort-cell mean. Regressions are weighted by cohort sizes.
Robust standard errors are in parentheses. Bandwidth is measured in months. * : p-value < 0.05, ** : p-value < 0.01

Notes: Source is Clark and Royer (2013). The x-axis denotes different birth cohorts. For
example, the first part of the x-axis refers to those between January and August over the
years 1948-1956. The y-axis displays the minimum and maximum years and terms of full-
time education for those who report leaving at the minimum school leaving age. There
exists a minimum and a maximum because students that report leaving at the minimum
school leaving age (e.g., 15) could have left at the first available opportunity or could have
continued for one or two more terms before leaving. For example, people born in January
in the years 1948-1956 who report leaving at the compulsory school leaving age (15) would
have spent 10 years and one term in full-time education had they left at the first
opportunity.

Notes: Total fertility rates in the UK, US, France, and Germany. The vertical line in the top figure
indicates the date of the 1972 ROSLA, which came at the tail end of a demographic transition
among industrialized nations. Women just affected by the reform experienced their childbearing
years (roughly 1972 through 2002) in a period of low, stable fertility. The two vertical lines in the
bottom figure denote the years when those just affected by the 1972 ROSLA would have been at
prime teenage fertility years. UK data come from the UK Office of National Statistics. US, French,
and German data come from the Human Fertility Database.

Notes: The impact of the 1972 ROSLA on in-marriage and out-of-marriage fertility. Each point represents the
fertility rate (number of births/size of age group) for a cohort of women sharing the same month and year of birth.
The plotted lines are local linear regression fits to those points over the chosen bandwidth. The vertical line indicates
the ROSLA threshold with the first post-reform cohort born September 1957.

Notes: The impact of the 1972 ROSLA on age gap of spouses; women's mates are represented by the left panel and
men's mates are represented by the right panel. In the left panel, each point represents the average age gap between
husband and wife for women of the same month and year birth cohort. In the right panel, each point represents the
average age gap between wife and husband for men of the same month and year of birth cohort. Each average age
gap has been seasonally adjusted. Seasonality adjustments are formed by regressing the mean cohort age gap on a set
of month-of-birth dummies and taking the residuals and adding the average age gap back. The plotted lines are local
linear regression fits to those points over the chosen bandwidth. The vertical line indicates the ROSLA threshold
with the first post-reform cohort born September 1957.

Notes: The impact of the 1972 ROSLA on the age gap between spouses; women's mates are represented by the top
panel and men's mates are represented by the bottom panel. Each point represents a regression discontinuity estimate
of the reduced-form effect of ROSLA on the probability of marrying a mate with a certain age gap. The top panel is
age difference between wife and husband for women. The bottom panel is age difference between husband and wife
for men. Regression discontinuity estimates control for seasonality through the inclusion of month-of-birth
dummies. Pointwise 95% confidence intervals are plotted as dotted lines.

Notes: Each column and row is the regression discontinuity estimate from a separate regression. Column headers list the dependent variable. Panel A
includes linear controls for cohort trends, interacted with the threshold to allow different pre- and post-reform trends. Panel B adds dummies for month
of birth. Panel C drops summer borns to deal with the fact that they could drop out of school at the end of May of the year they reached the
compulsory schooling age. The mean of dependent variable is measured for the cohort born in August 1957, the last pre-reform cohort. Data come
from live birth records supplied by the UK Office of National Statistics, containing all births in England and Wales to mothers born in England, Wales,
and Scotland, 1970-2008. These are supplemented with data on cohort sizes generated by registrar reports of cohort sizes at birth and mortality rates
from the Human Mortality Database. Each observation is a cohort-cell mean. Regressions are weighted by cohort sizes. Robust standard errors are in
parentheses. Bandwidth is measured in months. * :p-value < 0.05, ** :p-value < 0.01

Notes: Table compares counts of all in-marriage births by age and year with counts of in-marriage births within 8 months of
marriage. The third and sixth rows calculate the implied fraction of all in-marriage births for which the order of events was
conception, followed by marriage, followed by birth. This calculation assumes gestation of at least 8 months. Source: Main
