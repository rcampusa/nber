I.      Introduction

        Cap and trade systems have emerged as a front-running policy choice to address

climate change in many countries. One of the apparent attractions of this approach is the

ability to achieve hard limits on emissions over a control period. The American Clean

Energy and Security Act of 2009 (H.R. 2454) reported out of the US House Committee

on Energy and Commerce last month, for example, limits emissions among the controlled

sectors to 132 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) between 2012 and

2050.

        The cost of achieving certainty on emission limits is the risk of price volatility.

Responding to the experience with previous cap and trade systems a number of proposals

have emerged to dampen price volatility with cap and trade systems (often referred to in

the policy debate as "cost containment" measures). In the limit proposals to dampen

price volatility become, effectively, carbon taxes. Hybrid cap and trade systems take on

some of the attributes of a carbon tax while maintaining the core features of a cap and

trade system. In this paper I discuss and evaluate various approaches within cap and

trade systems to reduce price volatility focusing on this fundamental trade-off between

certainty of emission limits and price volatility.

        Most discussion has focused on how hybrid cap and trade systems can be

designed to take on some of the desirable characteristics of carbon taxes. In contrast I

discuss how a hybrid carbon tax can be designed to achieve a balance between price

stability and emissions certainty. This hybrid, dubbed the Responsive Emissions

Autonomous Carbon Tax (REACT), combines the short-run price stability of a carbon

tax with the long-run certainty of emission reductions over a control period.


                                                                                              1
       In the next section I review the experience of previous cap and trade systems with

price volatility. The following section surveys approaches within cap and trade systems

to address this issue. Here I focus on the tension between reducing price volatility and

providing certainty over emission caps. Section 4 describes how this tension can be

addressed within a carbon tax framework. Here I describe a hybrid carbon tax that

provides a balance between price certainty and emission limits. Section 5 provides some

preliminary results for a particular specification of a hybrid carbon tax. Section 6

concludes.

II.    Tradeoffs Between Price Certainty and Emission Limits

A.     Optimal Instrument Choice

       Market based responses to environmental externalities fall broadly into one of two

categories: price or quantity instruments. An emissions tax is a price based instrument

while a cap and trade system is a quantity based instrument. In the absence of

uncertainty either approach can be used to achieve a given environmental goal. If a tax is

set on emissions, firms adjust emissions until the emission fee is set equal to the marginal

cost of abatement on emissions. Conversely if a cap and trade system is utilized firms

buy and sell permits. The price of the permits is set by demand and supply conditions.

Demand follows from individual firms' marginal cost of abatement functions while

supply is set by the aggregate cap. In equilibrium each firm sets its marginal cost of

abatement equal to the price of permits. A tax set at rate s that leads to cumulative

emissions equal to Q is observationally equivalent to a cap and trade system that sets an

aggregate cap of Q. Equilibrium permit prices will equal s.




                                                                                            2
       The two systems differ in the presence of uncertainty. Weitzman (1974) analyzed

price and quantity instruments and showed 1) that the two approaches were ex ante

equivalent when the only uncertainty is over the marginal damages of the externality; and

2) that either the price or quantity approach could dominate ex ante depending on the

relative slope of the marginal damage and abatement curves. Price (quantity) approaches

provided higher expected net benefits if the marginal damage curve was less (more)

steeply sloped than the marginal abatement cost curve.

       Greenhouse gases are a stock pollutant and the analysis is a bit more complicated

but the intuition carries over to a large extent. Because this is a stock pollutant that

persists in the atmosphere for a very long time, marginal damages from emissions in any

given year are essentially constant. A flat marginal damage curve favors the tax. This is

borne out by a number of analyses that have found that taxes dominate cap-and-trade

systems for a broad range of parameter values consistent with scientific understanding of

the global warming problem (for example, Hoel and Karp (2002); Karp and Zhang (2005,

Newell and Pizer (2003)).

       The analysis above assumes a linear tax system. Kaplow and Shavell (2002)

argue that the potential superiority of the quantity instrument over the price instrument

only holds under the restriction of linear tax systems. If non-linear taxes are allowed then

the tax is uniformly superior. This follows from the insight of Roberts and Spence (1976)

that a mixture of price and quantity instruments can be more efficient than either alone

since it allows the price schedule to more closely match the marginal damage function.

The superiority of the non-linear tax, argues Kaplow and Shavell, is that firms' responses




                                                                                            3
to the tax reveals information about their marginal abatement cost functions, information

that is not revealed by quantity controls.1

B.                        Price Volatility with Pure Cap and Trade Systems

                          Carbon taxes ensure a given price for carbon emissions while permit prices in a

cap-and-trade system are uncertain. Price volatility for cap-and-trade systems is well

known. The EU ETS illustrated this dramatically in April 2006 when CO2 permit prices

fell sharply on the release of information indicating that the ETS Phase I permit

allocations were overly generous. The December 2009 futures price fell from a peak of

€32.90 on April 20 to €18.90 on May 3. Prices rebounded briefly but drifted downward

for much of the rest of the year (Figure 1). They then gradually rose during 2007 and

reached a peak of €30.53 on July 1, 2008. Since then the price collapsed to a low of

€8.20 on Feb. 12, 2009. Currently they are hovering in the range of €12 per ton.

the marginal damage function (ex ante) reveals information about firm abatement costs globally.

       The permit price volatility experienced in the Europe’s cap-and-trade program is

not unique. NOx prices in the Northeast states' Ozone Transport Commission jumped to

nearly $8,000 per ton in early 1999 before falling back to more typical levels between

$1,000 and $2,000 per ton. They spiked again to similar levels in 2003 before falling

back to roughly $2,000 per ton. Permit prices for the California Regional Clean Air

Incentives Market (RECLAIM) rose abruptly from under $5,000 per ton of NOx to

roughly $90,000 per ton in 2000. Permit prices in EPA's Acid Rain Program rose to

nearly $1,600 per ton SO2 in late 2005 from a price of roughly $900 at the beginning of

the year (see Pizer (2005) for discussions of price spikes in all of these markets).

       Unexpectedly high permit prices have the potential to erode political support for

the program. Regulators in the RECLAIM market, for example, relaxed the permit cap in

response to the high prices. The response in the RECLAIM market should provide a

cautionary note for policy makers. Highly volatile permit prices are likely to create

dissatisfaction with a cap-and-trade program and make business long run investment

planning difficult.

III.   Mechanisms to Address Price Volatility in Cap and Trade Systems

       Price uncertainty is a significant concern with cap-and-trade programs. At the

outset, it is important to distinguish between short-run and long-run price uncertainty.

Short-run price uncertainty (or volatility) can reflect short-term weather conditions,

equipment outages and other temporary phenomena. It is not desirable for firms to face

fluctuating prices on a daily (or perhaps hourly) basis due to these sorts of phenomena.

       Long-run price uncertainty reflects our inability to predict whether and when

various technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions come on line. Considerable



                                                                                           5
uncertainty exists, for example, over the feasibility of carbon capture and storage at scale.

Similarly political and technological constraints on nuclear power could significantly

affect long-run permit prices.

       Provisions to limit short run volatility are viewed as essential to build political

and popular support for any climate change legislation. The first point to make here is

that cost containment provisions are entirely unnecessary under a carbon tax. Second,

while various approaches exist for reducing short run volatility in a cap-and-trade system,

all such approaches come with some degree of complexity and uncertainty over their

ultimate ability to dampen price volatility.

A.     Cost Containment Under Cap and Trade

       One approach to limiting volatility is to include a “safety-valve” provision –This

allows firms to purchase an unlimited number of permits at a set price and thus sets a

ceiling on the price of permits. If the market price for permits is below the safety valve

price, then firms will simply purchase permits in the open market. Once permit prices

reach the value of the safety valve, firms will purchase any needed permits directly from

the government. Safety valve provisions protect against upside price risk at the cost of

loosening the emissions cap. Pizer (2002) provides an early analysis of a hybrid cap and

trade system that relies on a safety valve. Stavins (2007) recently proposed a cap and

trade system with a safety valve set at "twice to ten times the expected level of allowance

prices" (p. 22) with the revenues to be used to finance emission reductions from

uncapped sources. Safety valve proposals are often combined with banking and

borrowing provisions for permits. Banking allows firms to save permits issued on a




                                                                                             6
particular year for use in later years. Borrowing allows firms to use future allowances to

cover current emissions.

          One possible problem with the traditional safety valve approach is that

anticipation of future government policy to reduce emissions creates an arbitrage

opportunity. If a cap-and-trade program with unlimited banking is designed, then

incentives will exist to bank low price permits in anticipation of future tightening of the

cap. While one can require that any permits purchased through a safety valve be used in

the year they are purchased, they can still free up other permits to be banked for the

future thereby achieving the result of substituting low price permits for future higher

price permits.

          Another problem with traditional safety valve approaches is that they remove the

certainty over emission limits provided by pure cap and trade programs. This has made

them unpopular with environmental groups. A straight safety valve has also raised

concerns with some that the expected price of permits is driven down by the safety valve

thereby undercutting incentives for investments in carbon-free technologies. One

response to this concern is to combine a safety valve with a floor price on emissions.2

This combination creates a band within which permit prices may fluctuate and if

constructed appropriately can ensure the same expected price for permits as occurs in a

cap and trade system with no cost containment mechanism.

          The safety valve approach has been modified to address the concern that overall

emission limits may be exceeded with a traditional safety valve. One simple way to do

this is to cap the annual amount of permits that may be purchased at the safety valve

                                                                                                         7
price. This is the idea of a strategic allowance reserve.3 In addition, one can require that

any permits sold for cost containment reasons are simply borrowed from allowance

allocations in future time periods. This is the approach taken under the Waxman-Markey

bill (HR 2454).

        Putting constraints on the number of safety valve permits that may be purchased

may address the arbitrage opportunity raised by the anticipation of future policy

tightening. But it also raises its own issues. Many of the cap-and-trade policies currently

under consideration call for extremely sharp reductions in emissions (more precisely

allowance allocations) by the middle of the century. Various analyses of these policies

suggest that allowance banking will be sizable in the early phase of the program.4

Making more permits available in the present through an allowance reserve that borrows

against future allocations may simply lead to further banking to offset anticipated higher

future prices due to a tightening of the future cap. In other words the reserve may be

ineffective at damping price volatility. 5

B.      How Sure are Emission Caps Under a Pure Cap and Trade System?

        A central argument put forward by many environmental groups for favoring a cap

and trade system over a carbon tax is the certainty of emission limits under a cap and

trade system and the lack of hard limits on emissions under a tax-based approach. A cap

and trade system, so the argument goes, provides certainty over the emission limits while

the tax does not.6 There are three flaws in this argument. First, every cap and trade

   See, for example, Appendix D in Paltsev et al. (2007).
5
  This is an environmental analogue to the Ricardian Equivalence Proposition posited by Barro (1974).
6
  See, for example, the posting by Gernot Wagner and Nathaniel Keohane, "The case for cap-and-trade:
There's certainty in the environmental outcome" posted on the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists Roundtable


                                                                                                        8
proposal under serious consideration has some form of price relief mechanism. A

straight safety valve approach (such as proposed by Stavins (2007) among others) relaxes

the cap if the price exceeds the designated upper limit on prices. HR 2454 provides

limited relief with the allowance reserve program. Permits may be moved forward in

time to address near-term high prices.

        The strategic allowance reserve proposal is designed to address this first concern.

But there is a second flaw in the argument. Even in cap and trade proposals with no

explicit safety valve, Congress serves as the ultimate safety valve. If permit prices rise

too high – perhaps because of a shortfall in permits as permits are shifted forward in time

through the allowance reserve – Congress can relax the cap and so bring the price down.

Above I argued that the allowance reserve may be ineffective because the desire of firms

to bank permits for future use could more than offset any effort of the allowance reserve

to shift permits forward in time to reduce price. But there is another possibility. Firms

may use exceptionally high discount rates to value carbon trading permits. If so prices

might rise even higher than is projected by most analysts.

        To understand why this might happen we need to digress a bit on how permit

prices are expected to change over time. Permits are financial assets. With no binding

limits on banking or borrowing the decision by firms of when to utilize permits depends

on the trade-off between receiving the value of the permit today or in the future.

Consider a permit with a current price of $20. The firm can use it this period or use it in

a future period. If it uses it in this period it foregoes the opportunity to sell the permit and

receive the cash (holding other behavior constant). If it holds on to the permit it has the

                                                                                                          9
opportunity to sell the permit in the future (or use it and obtain the value of avoided

emission abatement). An optimizing firm will hold the permit if the permit price

appreciation exceeds the potential return on the $20 it can invest from the proceeds of

selling the permit today. Conversely the firm will sell the permit if the permit price

appreciation falls short of the potential return on the sale proceeds. In equilibrium the

firm will demand the same return on permits as on other financial assets. Since the return

on permits is entirely driven by the change in price over time we can predict that the price

path of permits will rise exponentially at the firm's discount rate (controlling for any

shocks to the economy). This logic has been used by numerous modelers to predict the

price path for permits over time based on real discount rates on the order of 4 to 6

percent.

        All of these models assume a single type of financial asset to which the return on

permits is compared. In actuality firms hold a wide range of assets with varying degrees

of riskiness. Holding all other things constant firms demand a higher return for holding

riskier assets. A basic tenet in financial economics is that two assets that provide the

same stream of returns over time should be valued equivalently. An implication of this is

that equally risky assets should be discounted at the same rate with the discount rate

rising with the riskiness of the asset.

        Let's return to the proposition that Congress serves as the ultimate safety valve in

a cap and trade system. This creates political risk for holders of permits. If permit prices

rise too high Congress may release more permits thereby subjecting holders of permits to




                                                                                            10
capital losses.7 This risk leads to the use of a higher discount rate which suggests a price

profile that starts out lower and rises more rapidly than is suggested by models that

ignore political risk. In other words firms are less likely to bank permits for fear that

their value will be eroded by unexpected permit creation in the future by Congress. But

this very behavior raises the likelihood that Congress will relax the allowance cap in the

future thereby justifying the use of higher discount rates by firms for permits.

         Finally let me address the argument that cap and trade systems provide greater

certainty over emissions than do price based systems. Just as hybrid cap and trade

systems can be constructed to mimic desirable attributes of price-based systems (e.g.

reduced price volatility), hybrid price systems can be designed to mimic desirable

attributes of quantity-based systems (e.g. certainty over emission limits). I demonstrate

one such hybrid price approach in the next section.

IV.      Price Certainty and Emission Limits Under a Carbon Tax

         A carbon tax provides the greatest degree of certainty over carbon prices as the

price is set by the tax rate. This certainty is one of the attractions of the tax approach to

many. But it provides the least certainty over the policy's ability to keep emissions below

a given target over some control period. Again this is simply the inherent tension

between price and quantity based instruments discussed in section II above. One way to

read the public debate over climate policy in the United States is that a compromise is

developing among different interest groups that addresses environmental concerns for

certainty over emission targets with the business community's interest in stability in


7
  This is analogous to the risk of expropriation of energy reserves by government. Weiner and Click
(2007) find that the discount rate used to value purchases of energy properties varies across countries
depending on the political risk of that country.


                                                                                                          11
carbon prices to assist them in their long-range capital planning. If this is correct, any

carbon tax approach needs to address the desire for greater certainty over long-run

emissions. I turn next to demonstrate how this could be done.

         A hybrid carbon tax could be constructed to ensure that cumulative emission

targets are met over some long-run (e.g. 40 year) control period. I will describe such a

hybrid, dubbed the Responsive Emissions Autonomous Carbon Tax (REACT). REACT

eliminates short-run price volatility while ensuring that long-run emission limits are met.

         The profile of tax rates over time is an essential design provision of any carbon

tax. REACT takes the following approach:

    •    An initial tax and standard growth rate for the tax is set for the first year of a
         control period.
    •    Benchmark targets for cumulative emissions are set for the control period. The
         law could require that the targets be met at annual, five-year, ten-year or some
         other time interval.
    •    If cumulative emissions exceed the target in the given years, the growth rate of
         the tax would increase from its standard growth rate to a higher catch-up rate until
         cumulative emissions fall below the target again.


         With a high enough catch-up rate, we can be reasonably sure that we will meet

emission caps by mid-century in a similar fashion to current cap-and-trade proposals.8

This suggested approach ensures that long-run targets are met while price stability is

achieved in the short run. Given the ability to predict emissions in the short run and the

transparent nature of the tax, firms would be able to predict with considerable certainty




8
   In those instances where marginal abatement costs are sufficiently steep that very high carbon prices are
ineffective at meeting specific emission caps, a cap and trade system with those caps is also likely to fail.
Permit prices will have risen to such a high rate that Congress is likely to relax the cap to reduce permit

what the growth rate of the tax will be in the near term thereby providing greater clarity

for their planning purposes.

           One could, if desired, couple REACT with additional design considerations. In

particular it might contain the following additional elements:

      •    A refundable tax credit for permanently sequestered greenhouse gas emissions.

           This would provide the appropriate incentives to develop carbon capture and

           sequestration technologies as well as to avoid penalizing users of fossil fuels as

           feedstock in applications that permanently sequester carbon dioxide.

      •    A border tax on the embedded CO2 in imported fossil fuels and select carbon

           intensive inputs.9

      •    A rebate of some or all of the revenues from the tax to address distributional

           concerns.10

B.         Additional Considerations

           The previous subsection describes the essential elements of REACT. Next I turn

to a more detailed discussion of key design issues.11 There are two principles, one

physical and one economic, which allow us to substantially reduce the collection and

enforcement costs for a tax on emissions from fossil fuels. The first is that a unit of fossil

fuel will emit the same amount of carbon regardless of when or where it is burned. For

carbon emissions from fossil fuel combustion, there is a perfect correspondence between

input and output. Therefore, we can tax the input – the fossil fuel – rather than the output

– the emission. The exception to this rule is for fossil fuel permanently sequestered, such

     Metcalf (2007b) describes one rebate approach that is both revenue and distributionally neutral.

      This section draws in part from Metcalf and Weisbach (forthcoming).


                                                                                                        13
as fuel used for tar or carbon that is captured and stored. As discussed above, a credit

should be given for carbon that is permanently captured and stored.

           The second principle is that the incidence of a tax (and its efficiency effects) is

unrelated to the statutory obligation to remit the tax. This means that we can impose the

tax (choose the remitting entity) to minimize collection and monitoring costs and to

ensure maximum coverage. In general, imposing the tax upstream (i.e., at the earliest

point in the production process) will achieve these goals as there are (1) far fewer

upstream producers than there are downstream consumers and (2) because of economies

of scale in tax administration, the cost will be lower per unit of tax.

           These two principles lead to the conclusion that the administrative costs a carbon

tax can be reduced through upstream implementation on fuel producers rather than

downstream on fuel users. The tax could be applied at the mine mouth for domestic coal,

and at the border for imported coal. There were 1,438 operating mines in the U.S. in

2006.12 Almost all coal used in the U.S. is produced here and there are very few exports.

Taxing at the mine would capture virtually 100 percent of U.S. coal production.

Moreover coal mines are potential sources of methane, either captured and put into the

pipeline system or released into the air. If it is captured, this source of methane may not

need to be processed Therefore, having mines as taxpayers may create synergy – they

can pay the tax on this source of natural gas or methane as well. If it is not captured, coal

mines should pay a tax on any release. Coal-bed methane emissions were around 58.5

million metric tons of CO2 equivalents, so imposing this tax will be important.

           Natural gas could be taxed at the operator level or on import. Operators already

pay state severance taxes, which means that they have the administrative capacity to pay

                                                                                                 14
the tax and states are already collecting the necessary data. Although there are many

small operators, taxing the top 500 would capture almost all the natural gas produced in

the United States. Imported gas could be taxed at one of fifty-five locations where

natural gas (or liquefied natural gas) can be imported or exported, consisting of six

liquefied natural gas facilities and forty-nine pipeline border points.

       Petroleum products could be taxed on the crude as it enters the refinery or on the

various products produced from crude oil along with refinery process emissions. Again,

the administrative burden is not particularly cumbersome because there are roughly 150

refineries in the United States. In all cases above, the taxed firms are already reporting

data to the IRS and paying taxes. A carbon tax would likely create less of an

administrative burden than creating an entirely new accounting scheme for carbon

allowances.

       Non-energy carbon emissions come from a variety of sources, predominantly

iron, steel, and cement production. These CO2 emissions, along with many other GHGs,

could be taxed either at the point of production or at the point of consumption. Metcalf

and Weisbach (forthcoming) estimate that roughly 90 percent of U.S. GHGs could be

brought into the tax base at relatively low cost.

       With the carbon tax applied at upstream points, it is important to provide tax

credits for carbon capture and storage (CCS) at downstream levels and for fossil fuels

used as feedstocks in manufacturing activities where the carbon is permanently stored.

CCS refers to technologies that remove carbon from the exhaust streams of fossil fuel

burning plants and store it underground – either locally or after transportation to a storage

site – for many centuries. Electric utilities that burn coal in an advanced boiler with CCS,



                                                                                             15
for example, should be allowed a tax credit equal to the tax paid on the carbon that is

sequestered. Since firms that engage in sequestration activities (e.g. coal-fired electric

power plants) may not be the firms subject to the carbon tax (e.g. coal mines), allowing

the permits to be traded would ensure that the credits for sequestration would have full

value. Thus coal companies with carbon tax liability could purchase carbon tax credits

from downstream firms that earn the credits for sequestering CO2.13 Credits for certain

land-use activities, including forestry sequestration, should also be considered for credit

eligibility. This would be a way of allowing sectors not covered by the carbon tax to opt

in to the system and receive payments for approved carbon reducing activities.

IV.      Tax Rate Scenarios Under REACT

         REACT is a hybrid carbon tax that combines short-run price stability (feature of a

carbon tax) with long-run certainty of emission limits over the control horizon (feature of

a hard cap-and-trade system). By adjusting the growth rate of the tax between a standard

growth rate and a higher "catch-up" rate, it can meet long-run emission targets while

providing price predictability. Given the ability to predict emissions in the short run and

the transparent nature of the tax, firms would be able to predict with considerable

certainty what the growth rate of the tax will be in the near term thereby providing greater

clarity for their planning purposes.

         As an example of how REACT could be designed, assume benchmark targets

based on the permit allocations in the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009

(H.R. 2454). Assume that the tax goes into effect in 2012 with a control period running

13
   Alternatively, firms with carbon tax credits could receive a refund from the IRS directly, thereby
obviating the need for tradability. This would be similar to the treatment of zero-rated firms who receive a
credit for a Value Added Tax (VAT) paid at earlier stages of production but pay no gross VAT on their
value added.


                                                                                                          16
through 2050. The standard growth rate for the tax is 4 percent (plus inflation) and a

higher catch-up rate of 10 percent (plus inflation). The catch-up rate is triggered when

cumulative emissions in any year exceed cumulative target emissions.

                         Figure 2 above illustrates two possible paths for the carbon tax between the 2012

and 2050. The smooth path shows a carbon tax that starts at $28 and rises at 4 percent

(real) each year to 2050. The tax rate in the final control year is $125. The less smooth

line illustrates a REACT tax rate that is designed to achieve the cumulative emission

reductions called for in the Waxman-Markey bill. There are a number of years in which

the tax grows at a 10 percent annual growth rate reverting to the 4 percent rate in those




                                                                                                        17
years in which the cumulative emission targets are met.14 The tax rate in 2050 is $245 in

this particular realization. The higher tax rate assures that the cumulative emission cap

over the control period is met.

        To show how the tax might operate in an uncertain economic environment, I ran

simulations of the REACT tax assuming that emissions follow the following stochastic

process:

(1)                         ln Et = β 0 + β 1t + β 2 ln( Pt ) + β 3 ln( Pt )t + u t

where ut is a AR(1) process with autoregressive parameter 0.2 and standard deviation of

the independent shock equal to 0.5. The regression in equation (1) was fitted to the data

from various runs of the carbon tax in Metcalf et al. (2008). Observations from all

carbon tax runs in that paper were included in a single regression.15 Regression results

are shown in Table 1.

14
    This simulated price path checks emissions against the targets in each year. The tax could be modified
to check the targets every five years or some other interval.
15
    Strictly speaking, such a regression is not a valid representation of the emission process given the
differential technology responses that can occur in different tax simulations of the EPPA model. For my
purposes I simply need a reduced form relationship between emissions and price to illustrate how the
REACT tax might operate.


                                                                                                        18
                     The elasticity of emissions with respect to the carbon price in 2012 is -.159 and

declines to -.478 by 2050. This regression is not meant to precisely reflect the response

of greenhouse gas emissions to carbon prices but is suggestive for the purposes of

illustrating the price trajectory of the REACT tax. Based on the response of emissions to

a carbon price as given in Table 1, I simulate 1,000 runs of the REACT tax to provide a

sense of how we might meet the cumulative emission targets described above given

different realizations of emissions. Over the 1,000 runs, the average number of years that

the tax is growing at the higher catch-up rate is 16.1 ranging from a low of 10 years out

of the 38 control years to a high of 22. Figure 3 displays information on the range of tax

rates between 2012 and 2050 based on the stochastic nature of emissions as modeled

above.

         In each year the box and whiskers graph shows the distribution of tax rates across

the 1,000 simulation runs. The box provides the interquartile range (25th percentile at the

lower end of the box and 75th percentile at the upper end of the box) along with the

median value (line inside of box). The "whiskers" show the range of adjacent values and

the dots show any outlying values.16 The lower end of the whisker (or outlying value) in

each year is the value of the carbon tax if no adjustment is made to allow cumulative

emissions to catch up to the targets in each year. The simulation indicates that a "bad"

state of the world (in which emissions were especially high – say due to unexpected and

persistent outages of nuclear power plants or especially hot weather) could lead to a

carbon tax rate as high as $442 based on the responsiveness of emissions to the tax and

the stochastic nature of emissions posited for this example. In the Monte Carlo

simulation, this occurs less than one percent of the time.

         This modeling has not taken into account an important behavioral effect that may

occur. Firms may anticipate cumulative emissions rising to the point where they may

trigger a shift to the high growth rate in the tax and undertake additional abatement

activities to avoid this outcome. Further modeling is needed to understand whether this is

a potentially significant response or not.

         The REACT hybrid tax shares similarities with other carbon pricing systems that

have recently been put forward. Douglas Elmendorf, Director of the Congressional

Budget Office, recently described a managed price approach for a cap and trade system.

Permit prices would be set not by the market but by regulators annually to achieve a

given emissions path over time (see Elmendorf (2009)). Similarly the Clean


16
   Adjacent values are those that are no more than 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR) away from the
25th or 75th percentiles. Outliers are more than 3 times the IQR in distance from the 25th or 75th percentiles.


                                                                                                            20
Environment and Stable Energy Market Act of 2009 (H.R. 1683) introduced by Cong.

Jim McDermott (D-WA). H.R. 1683 establishes federal emission permits that are sold by

the federal government with the price established by the Secretary of the Treasury and

adjusted over time to match a federal emissions allocation over time. The essential

difference between these approaches and the REACT hybrid tax is that the price

adjustment mechanism is built into the law rather than delegated to regulators or the

Treasury Secretary.

       The REACT approach addresses the objection that a carbon tax does not ensure a

hard cap on greenhouse gas emissions over the control period. An overall cap can be

maintained while insulating consumers and businesses from short-run fluctuations in

carbon prices that add volatility to energy prices and undermine support for climate

change legislation. It does this with a transparent mechanism for adjusting the price of

emissions over the control period.


V.     Further Thoughts on Policy Choice

       A hybrid carbon tax has several attractive properties. First, it provides a clear

price signal while committing to cumulative caps over a control period. Setting a clear

price on emissions provides the impetus for emitters to begin to reduce emissions through

process changes and investment. And the commitment to strong cumulative emission

caps provides the assurance many want that the United States will take strong and

decisive action on greenhouse gas emissions. This is important domestically as well as

internationally as major greenhouse gas emitting countries join to construct a new

international agreement for the post-Kyoto era. Finally, administrative considerations

suggest a carbon tax can be put in place more rapidly than a cap and trade system. But



                                                                                           21
why take a hybrid tax approach when the cap and trade approach seems so well accepted?

I discuss a few features of the tax based approach that offset many if not all of the

advantages of the cap and trade approach.

A.     Revenue

       A cap and trade system is built around the instrument of tradable permits. Permits

are valuable assets. They can be auctioned by the government, thus raising revenue. But

historically they have been given away to industry as part of a process of obtaining

support for the system. To be fair, prior domestic cap and trade programs were an order

of magnitude smaller than any potential carbon cap and trade program. Thus, given the

revenues involved, auctioning permits in those programs was simply not that important.

       The stakes are higher with a carbon cap and trade bill and the need for fiscal

discipline that much greater. The debate last year over the Boxer Amendment to the

Lieberman-Warner Bill is instructive. The bill set very specific uses for the freely

allocated permits as well as for spending from auctioning. In effect the bill implemented

a large-scale set of revenue and spending programs that circumvented the normal

committee process.

       The Waxman Markey bill reported out of committee also sets very specific uses

for most of the permits. Table 2 provides an estimate of the allocation over the 2012 –

2030 period. Nearly half of the permits are allocated to offset the higher price impacts on

consumers (allocations to low and moderate income households as well as to local

distribution companies). Energy producers receive just over seven percent of the

allowances and trade affected industries receive nearly twelve percent. Thirteen percent

of the permits are used for technology funding (including carbon capture and storage,



                                                                                          22
clean vehicles, renewable energy and efficiency) and nearly twelve percent for

adaptation. The unallocated permits (roughly seven percent) are used for deficit

reduction through 2025 and for consumer rebates after 2025.

       The Congressional Budget Office recognized these indirect revenue implications

of cap and trade bills with its decision in late 2007 to begin counting freely allocated

permits as revenue and offsetting spending (see the CBO cost estimate of S. 2191

released on April 10, 2008). One could push this point further and argue that any new

major revenue source – such as arises from a tradable permit system whether the permits

are auctioned or freely allocated – should go through the usual Congressional budget

process. This ensures that Congress weighs the best use of funds from the initiative

against all the pressing budget needs. This is precisely the process that would occur with

a carbon tax.




                                                                                           23
       This is not to suggest that proponents of carbon pricing couldn't propose fiscal

constraints on the use of carbon revenue. On the contrary, the constraint to be revenue

and distributionally neutral could be imposed and might provide appropriate fiscal

discipline that would contribute to support for the passage of a climate change bill. Note

though that the incentives for this sort of discipline may be stronger for a tax than a cap

and trade bill. Any tax bill, including a carbon tax, would emerge from the House

Committee on Ways and Means, which initiates all tax legislation in the House, and the

Senate Finance Committee, which controls tax legislation in the upper chamber.

Members of these committees may be able to more easily impose the revenue and

distributional neutrality constraint than can members of the House Committee on Energy

and Commerce or the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, which are

responsible for cap and trade legislation. These committees have a narrower fiscal focus

and the natural incentive for committee members is to spend revenues on programs under

their purview.


B.     Administration

       We have a time-tested administrative structure for collecting taxes that can ramp

up a carbon tax in relatively short order. Firms that would be subject to a carbon tax are

already registered with the IRS and have whole departments within their firms that carry

out the record keeping and reporting for tax payments. Coal producers already pay an

excise tax to fund the Black Lung Trust Fund and oil producers pay a tax to fund the Oil

Spill Trust Fund (see Metcalf (2007a) for a description of these funds). We also have

precedents for refundable credits for sequestration activities in federal fuels tax credits. In

contrast, we have no administrative structure for running an upstream carbon cap-and-



                                                                                              24
trade program. A report by the Congressional Budget Office (2008) details the lead-time

required to establish allocations. All this suggests that we can implement carbon pricing

through a tax more quickly than through a cap and trade system.


C.     Carbon Tax Concerns Don't Apply to Hybrid Tax

       Many of the traditional concerns with a carbon tax are directly addressed with the

hybrid tax described above.

1.     No Binding Cap on Emissions

       A common criticism of carbon taxes is that they do not provide any binding cap

on emissions. The REACT proposal squarely addresses this criticism by building into the

tax code predictable and automatic rate adjustments that keep emissions on target to

significant reductions. The mechanism is transparent and provides firms with clarity for

planning purposes.

2.     Tipping Points

       Tipping points provide an important qualification to the efficiency argument for

taxes that was discussed above. Tipping points are discontinuities in marginal damages

that may arise if critical concentrations of GHGs lead to temperature increases that are

sufficiently high to cause large-scale and abrupt climate change. The existence of a

tipping point, it is argued, favors cap and trade type programs to ensure that we avoid

crossing such a threshold.

       The problem with this argument is that we do not know where the tipping point is

or whether we are close to it. Setting a fixed cap at an inappropriately low level could

lead to unnecessarily large welfare losses. Until our knowledge about climate processes




                                                                                           25
and threshold effects improves we are likely better off setting a gradually increasing price

on GHG emissions and providing clear market signals to firms to reduce emissions.

3.     Efficiency and Political Expediency

       A political realist might argue that it is inevitable that concessions will have to be

made to the energy industry as part of a grand deal on U.S. carbon policy. Proponents of

a cap-and-trade system argue that concessions in a cap and trade system will not bring

about an efficiency loss whereas concessions in a carbon tax regime would be

distortionary. Concessions in a cap and trade system would be given in the form of a free

distribution of permits, which is a lump-sum transfer. The argument goes that with a

carbon tax, the only way to make concessions is to exempt entire sectors or segments of

sectors. This clearly would be distortionary. But nothing precludes a carbon tax from

providing lump-sum transfers similar in impact to lump-sum distributions of free permits.

A carbon tax, for example, could levy the tax on emissions above some threshold. The

similarity between lump-sum distributions made under cap and trade systems and those

made under tax systems has been pointed out by Pezzey (1992) among others.

4.     Interactions with International Systems

       A final argument against a U.S. carbon tax is that it is incompatible with efforts to

bring the developing world into an international agreement. The argument is that we will

need to use monetary transfers and technology transfer programs such as the Clean

Development Mechanism (CDM) to engage the large developing countries in setting

limits on GHG emissions, and that such mechanisms are only compatible with cap and




                                                                                           26
trade programs, where they can be used as offsets to domestic caps.17 However, nothing

about a carbon tax precludes the use of CDM-type projects as offsets. If the United

States so desires it could allow certain offsets like CDM projects to be taken as credits

against the carbon tax. To reduce the administrative burden for firms, the offsets could

be made tradable, in which case brokers would likely emerge to serve as a clearing house

for firms with carbon tax liability to purchase offsets.

        On a related matter, nothing precludes the United States from employing a carbon

tax while other countries rely on cap and trade systems. In the end what matters is that

the international community coordinate on harmonizing carbon prices. Some countries

may choose to do this through a carbon tax while others through cap and trade systems.

So long as the prices are broadly in line across countries, concerns about leakage (i.e.

movements of economic activity from high carbon price to low or no carbon price

countries) should be minimized.18

VI.     Conclusion

        Carbon pricing is widely accepted as a necessary step for addressing the challenge

of global climate change in the United States. One of the main objections to a carbon tax

has been the uncertainty over emissions over the control period. This paper describes an

approach that could be used to ensure cumulative emission caps are achieved over the

control period. The REACT tax ties the change in the tax rate to progress over meeting

cumulative targets. The targets could be met on an annual or less frequent basis. While

   The Clean Development Mechanism was developed under the Kyoto Protocol as a way to allow GHG
reducing projects in developing countries that are not subject to emissions limits to count towards the
targets for countries that are subject to such limits. See Lecocq and Ambrosi (2007) for a history and
analysis of CDMs.

    Nordhaus (2007) discusses the advantages of a tax-based approach in the context of global systems. I
take a more modest position here, arguing that a domestic tax-based approach can be made compatible with
whatever international system evolves elsewhere.


                                                                                                     27
this paper provides results from simulations using annual benchmarks, five year

benchmarks might be more appropriate.

       Hybrid cap and trade schemes have been proposed to achieve the right balance

between certainty over emission limits during a control period and minimizing price

volatility for firms and individuals who will face higher costs of energy and other

products due to carbon pricing. A hybrid carbon tax such as the REACT model sketched

out in this paper can achieve the appropriate balance between price and emission

certainty in a tax-based framework. This provides a number of advantages over the

hybrid cap and trade approach. First it avoids the need for a new administrative structure

to oversee this major new program. Second it avoids the creation of financial assets and

the resultant and costly rent seeking activity to obtain these assets.

       Policy choices inevitably involve trade-offs among competing goals. The key

competing goals in climate change policy are price certainty and emissions certainty. To

date efforts to strike the appropriate balance between these competing goals have focused

on hybrid cap and trade systems. This paper suggests that focusing on hybrid cap and

trade schemes is needlessly limiting. A hybrid tax system can achieve whatever

appropriate balance between price and emission certainty is deemed socially desirable

while building on the administrative and political benefits of a tax-based system.
