                                          ABSTRACT

Using data from Chile and Korea, we find that a larger fraction of aggregate productivity growth
is due to firm entry and exit during fast-growth episodes compared to slow-growth episodes.
Studies of other countries confirm this empirical relationship. We develop a model of endogenous
firm entry and exit based on Hopenhayn (1992). Firms enter with efficiencies drawn from a
distribution whose mean grows over time. After entering, a firm’s efficiency grows with age. In
the calibrated model, reducing entry costs or barriers to technology adoption generates the pattern
we document in the data. Firm turnover is crucial for rapid productivity growth.

1. Introduction

Findings in empirical studies vary widely on the importance of the entry and exit of plants in
accounting for aggregate productivity growth. Consider, for example, two widely cited studies:
Foster, Haltiwanger, and Krizan (FHK) (2001) find that the entry and exit of plants account for 25
percent of U.S. manufacturing productivity growth, while Brandt, et al. (2012), using the same
methodology, find that entry and exit account for 72 percent of Chinese manufacturing productivity
growth. 1 In this paper, we account for the stark differences in the U.S. and Chinese data by
examining data from other countries and by developing a simple model in which we can
understand the driving forces behind those differences.
     The first contribution of this paper is empirical. We apply the FHK decomposition to plant-
level manufacturing data from Chile and South Korea. We find that plant entry and exit account
for a larger fraction of aggregate manufacturing productivity growth during periods of fast growth
in GDP per working-age person. A meta-analysis of the productivity literature, spanning a number
of countries and time periods, supports this empirical regularity. We summarize our findings in
Figure 3, in which we plot growth in GDP per working-age person against the contribution of the
entry and exit of plants to growth in aggregate manufacturing productivity. This empirical
relationship is novel to the literature and suggests that the entry and exit of plants play an important
role in explaining periods of fast growth.
     Our second contribution is theoretical. We develop a dynamic general equilibrium model with
endogenous entry and exit, based on Hopenhayn (1992), that can quantitatively account for the
patterns we document in the data. Our model is simple enough that there are analytical expressions
for the terms in the FHK decomposition. When we introduce reforms that reduce entry costs or
reduce barriers to technology adoption into a calibrated model, we find that the entry and exit terms
in the FHK decomposition become more important as GDP grows rapidly, just as they do in the
data. Our simple model, meant to highlight the forces driving productivity growth, performs
surprisingly well in quantitatively matching the behavior we observe in the data.2

  To calculate that entry and exit account for 25 percent of U.S. manufacturing productivity growth, see Table 8.7 in
FHK and find the average net entry share for the 1977–1982, 1982–1987, and 1987–1992 windows. To find the
contribution of entry and exit in China, see Figure 7 in Brandt, et al. (2012).
2
  Our general equilibrium model is of the entire economy, but, because of data limitations, the productivity
decompositions in both the existing literature and our own work cover only the manufacturing sector. In order to make
comparisons between the model and the data, we assume that aggregate productivity in the non-manufacturing sector
behaves identically to that in the manufacturing sector.
                                                         1
    Chile and Korea are good candidates for our empirical analysis because both countries have
experienced periods of fast and slow growth. Real GDP per working-age person in Chile grew 4.0
percent per year during 1995–1998, slowing to 2.7 percent per year during 2001–2006. In Korea,
real GDP per working-age person grew by 6.1 percent per year in 1992–1997 and by 4.3 percent
per year in 2001–2006 and slowed to 3.0 percent per year in 2009–2014. Studying periods of slow
and fast growth in the same country allows us to avoid cross-country differences and to use
consistent data sets through time, reducing measurement problems.
    Following FHK, we decompose the Chilean and Korean plant-level data into a net entry term
and a continuing plant term. The net entry term is higher if entering plants are relatively productive,
or exiting plants are relatively unproductive, compared to the industry average. The continuing
plant term consists of both within-plant productivity dynamics and the reallocation of market
shares across continuing plants. We find that, in both countries, net entry accounts for a larger
fraction of aggregate manufacturing productivity growth during periods of fast GDP growth.
During periods of slow growth, when GDP per working-age person grows at less than 4 percent
per year, entry and exit account for less than 25 percent of aggregate manufacturing productivity
growth on average, similar to the average contribution of entry and exit in the United States. During
periods of fast GDP growth, however, entry and exit account for a larger fraction of aggregate
manufacturing productivity growth, ranging from 37 to 58 percent. The greater contribution of net
entry during periods of rapid growth is driven mainly by the change in the relative productivity of
entering and exiting plants, rather than by differences in their market shares. Our findings are
robust to using alternative decompositions.
    Our own analysis is limited by the availability of establishment-level data. Fortunately, the
FHK decomposition is widely used in the productivity literature. To get a broader understanding
of the empirical relationship between growth and the role of net entry, we survey papers in the
literature that use the FHK decomposition. We find that continuing establishments—plants in four
of the papers, firms in the other papers—consistently account for the bulk of aggregate
manufacturing productivity growth when GDP per working-age person grows slowly. During
episodes of fast GDP growth, the entry and exit of plants become increasingly important in
accounting for productivity growth.
    Motivated by our empirical work, we build a simple model with three sources of aggregate
productivity growth. First, in each period, potential entrants draw efficiencies from a distribution

                                                  2
with a mean that grows at rate g e  1 . Second, continuing firm efficiencies improve with age. This

efficiency growth depends on an exogenous growth factor and spillovers from average efficiency
growth. Finally, firms choose when to exit production, which induces a selection effect in which
inefficient firms exit.
    The economy is subject to three types of distortions. First, a potential entrant must pay an
entry cost to draw an efficiency. Second, a successful entrant must pay a fixed cost to continue
production in each period. These two costs are partly technological and partly the result of policy.
We think of the policy-related costs as distortions that can be reduced through economic reform.
Third, new firms face barriers to technology adoption in the spirit of Parente and Prescott (1994).
Better technologies exist but are not used because of policies that restrict their adoption.
    We show that the model has a balanced growth path on which income grows at the same rate
regardless of the severity of the policy distortions. Income levels on the balanced growth path,
however, are determined by the distortions: More severe distortions yield lower balanced growth
paths. These results are consistent with the data from the United States and other industrialized
economies, which have grown at about 2 percent per year for several decades, despite persistent
differences in income levels. Kehoe and Prescott (2002) and Jones (1995) provide an in-depth
discussion of these empirical regularities.
    The simplicity of our model allows us to characterize analytically the FHK decompositions of
the model on the balanced growth path. The decompositions highlight the ways that firm turnover,
selection, and the efficiency advantage of entrants affect the contribution of net entry to aggregate
productivity growth. These forces are present in many growth models in the literature, and our
model allows us to understand how they map into empirical decompositions.
    We calibrate the model to the U.S. economy in which entry and exit account for 25 percent of
U.S. aggregate productivity growth. We then create three separate distorted economies to evaluate
reforms to entry costs, barriers to technology adoption, and fixed continuation costs. The spirit of
the exercise is that these distorted economies are exactly the same as the U.S. economy except for
the policy distortion that we are studying. We increase one of the distortions in each economy so
that the balanced growth path income level is 15 percent below that of the United States. In the
balanced growth path, each of these distorted economies grows at 2 percent per year and net entry
accounts for 25 percent of aggregate productivity growth in the FHK decomposition.


                                                  3
    We remove the distortion in each economy and study the transition to the higher balanced
growth path. When we lower entry costs, the GDP growth rate rises to 4.6 percent per year for five
years, and net entry accounts for 60 percent of aggregate productivity growth. Even though net
entry is relatively unimportant in the balanced growth path, the model matches the increasing
importance of net entry in the FHK decomposition during periods of fast GDP growth.
    When we decrease the barriers to technology adoption in the model, GDP growth and the
importance of net entry to aggregate productivity growth along the transition are almost identical
to that in the lower-entry-costs experiment. While both reforms generate the positive correlation
between GDP growth and the importance of net entry that we observe in the data, the underlying
mechanisms are very different.
    Lower entry costs increase the number of potential firms that draw efficiencies. The larger
number of potential firms drives up the efficiency threshold for entry, which increases aggregate
productivity: more entry leads to higher productivity. This mechanism is very much in the spirit of
Schumpeter (1942). Causation in the case of lower barriers to technology adoption runs in the
opposite direction. When it is easier for firms to adopt higher efficiencies, the value of operating a
firm increases. This increase in firm value leads to more potential firms drawing efficiencies:
higher productivity leads to more entry.
    The model in which more entry leads to higher productivity is very similar to the one in which
higher productivity leads to more entry, except in one dimension: the number of potential entrants
is larger in the experiment with decreased entry costs. In both cases—lower entry costs and lower
barriers to technology adoption—reforms increase the value of operating a firm, which leads to
more potential entrants. The lower entry cost also directly changes the cost of entry, which has an
additional effect on the mass of potential entrants.
    Measuring potential entrants in the data raises several challenges. What is the data counterpart
to a potential entrant paying to draw an efficiency but choosing not to operate the technology?
Perhaps failed entrants are people who developed a business idea but either did not follow through
with it or started the business and failed. The latter may be captured in the firm-level data but the
former may not. A related issue is one of duration. If a business fails after one year, is it a failed
entrant? What if it fails after two years? These issues arise not just in our work, but also in the
countless other papers that consider costly firm entry. Hurst and Pugsley (2011) and Choi (2017)
provide some insight into the start-up data and why entrants fail.

                                                  4
    Not all the reforms we consider generate dynamics consistent with the data. When we lower
the fixed continuation cost in the model, GDP growth increases, but aggregate productivity
decreases. A lower fixed continuation cost allows less-productive firms to enter and prevents less-
productive firms from exiting, which results in decreasing aggregate productivity during periods
of fast GDP growth. This is not the case in any of the episodes we study in Chile and Korea, nor
is it the case in any of the episodes we study in the literature. Since we do not observe this pattern
in the data, we do not focus on this reform.
    Closest to our work is that of Garcia-Macia et al. (2016), who derive a model-based
decomposition to measure the fraction of growth in the economy due to incumbents and to entrants.
Their primary finding—that the bulk of growth in the U.S. economy is due to incumbents—is
consistent with our own findings for slow-growing economies.
    In contrast to their work, we use the FHK decomposition. While it is not derived from a
structural model, it is widely used in the literature, allowing us to use the findings from other
papers to complement our study of Chile and Korea. In comparison with Garcia-Macia et al. (2016),
the scope of our study is broader: In addition to the United States, we study many countries and
trace out the importance of net entry in productivity growth in both fast- and slow-growing
economies.
    Our model is related to other papers that attempt to understand how the FHK decomposition
is related to structural models of firm entry and exit. We are the first to characterize analytically
the FHK decomposition along the balanced growth path of a general equilibrium model, but other
papers, such as Acemoglu et al. (2013), Arkolakis (2015), and Lentz and Mortensen (2008), have
used the FHK decomposition to compare calibrated models to the data.
    Our modeling approach builds on the endogenous growth literature in which productivities
are drawn from a distribution that improves over time (see Alvarez et al. 2017; Buera and Oberfield
2016; Lucas and Moll 2014; Perla and Tonetti 2014; Sampson 2016). Relative to these papers, we
take a simplified approach where the productivity distribution from which entrants draw improves
at an exogenous rate, which is similar to Luttmer (2007). The idea that potential entrants in any
economy can draw their productivity from the frontier productivity distribution is related to the
literature on technology diffusion and adoption (see Parente and Prescott 1999; Eaton and Kortum
1999; Alvarez et al. 2017).



                                                  5
    Our empirical analysis is broadly related to the productivity decomposition literature (Baily
et al. 1992; Griliches and Regev 1995; Olley and Pakes 1996; Petrin and Levinsohn 2012; Melitz
and Polanec 2015), which develops methodologies for decomposing aggregate productivity. These
types of decompositions are often used to study the effect of policy reform (Olley and Pakes 1996;
Pavcnik 2002; Eslava et al. 2004; Bollard et al. 2013). Our work is the first to document the
empirical relationship between the importance of plant entry and exit in the FHK decomposition
and aggregate growth in GDP per working-age person. These empirical results suggest that the
entry and exit of firms are important ingredients in fast economic growth. It also provides empirical
facts that can be used to discipline models that study productivity growth in fast-growing countries.
    Finally, our paper is related to a series of papers that use quantitative models to study the
extent to which entry costs can account for cross-country income differences (Herrendorf and
Teixeira 2011; Poschke 2010; Barseghyan and DiCecio 2011; Bergoeing et al. 2011; D’Erasmo
and Moscoso Boedo 2012; Moscoso Boedo and Mukoyama 2012; D’Erasmo et al. 2014; Bah and
Fang 2016; Asturias et al. 2016). Distortions in our model also drive differences in balanced growth
path income levels, but our focus is on the behavior of productivity and entry and exit dynamics
during the transition between balanced growth paths.
    In Section 2, we use productivity decompositions to document the positive relationship
between the importance of entry and exit in aggregate manufacturing productivity growth and the
growth in GDP per working-age person in the economy. Section 3 lays out our dynamic general
equilibrium model, and Section 4 discusses the existence and characteristics of the model’s
balanced growth path. In Section 5, we discuss the measurement of productivity in the model. In
Section 6, we present analytical characterizations of the FHK decomposition of the model on the
balanced growth path. In Section 7, we conduct quantitative exercises to show that the calibrated
model replicates the empirical relationship that we find in Section 2. Section 8 concludes and
provides directions for future research.

2. Productivity Decompositions

In this section, we use the FHK productivity decomposition on Chilean and Korean manufacturing
data to decompose changes in aggregate manufacturing productivity into the contribution from
entering and exiting plants and the contribution from continuing plants. We find that, compared to
periods of slow growth in GDP per working-age person, the entry and exit of plants account for a

                                                 6
larger share of aggregate manufacturing productivity growth during years of fast growth in GDP
per working-age person. We then analyze previous work on plant entry and exit and aggregate
manufacturing productivity. This literature was not explicitly focused on the role of entry and exit
during different kinds of growth experiences. We find, however, that previous studies support our
finding that countries with fast-growing GDP per working-age person also tend to have a larger
share of aggregate manufacturing productivity growth accounted for by the entry and exit of plants
in the FHK decomposition.
     We use manufacturing data because this information is more widely available than data for
services. For example, we are not aware of any plant-level panel data on the service sector for
Chile and Korea. Furthermore, the wider availability of manufacturing data allows us to conduct
a survey of the literature to expand the analysis to a greater set of countries.
     We consider a country to be experiencing fast growth if the growth rate of GDP per working-
age person is at least 4 percent per year. To be clear, we use the terms fast growth and slow growth
only in a descriptive sense to ease exposition. We find it illustrative to categorize countries as
relatively fast or slow growing and make comparisons across the groups. In our final analysis, we
regard both the GDP per working-age person growth rates and the FHK contribution of entry and
exit as continuous (see Figure 3). In our model, we consider a country to be slow growing if it is
on a balanced growth path and to be fast growing if it is in transition to a higher balanced growth
path.

2.1. Decomposing Changes in Aggregate Productivity Growth

Our aggregate productivity decomposition follows FHK. We define the industry-level productivity
of industry i at time t , Z it , to be

                                             log Z it   seit log zet ,                         (1)
                                                         eit


where seit is the share of plant e’s gross output in industry i and z et is the plant’s productivity.

The industry’s productivity change during the window t  1 to t is

                                          log Z it  log Z it  log Z i ,t 1 .                 (2)

The industry-level change in productivity can be written as the sum of two components,

                                      log Z it   log Z itNE   log Z itC ,                   (3)

                                                           7
where  log Z itNE is the change in industry-level productivity attributed to the entry and exit of

plants and  log Z itC is the change attributed to continuing plants.

      The first component in (3),  log Z itNE , is

                log Z itNE     s  log z

where Nit is the set of entering plants and X it is the set of exiting plants. We define a plant as

entering if it is only active at t and exiting if it is only active at t  1 . The first term, the entering
plant component, positively contributes to aggregate productivity growth if entering plants’
productivity levels are greater than the initial industry average. The second term, the exiting plant
component, positively contributes to aggregate productivity growth if the exiting plants’
productivity levels are less than the initial industry average.
    The second component in (3),  log Z itC , is

                       log Z itC         s  log zet    log zet  log Z i ,t 1  set ,

where Cit is the set of continuing plants. We define a plant as continuing if it is active in both t  1

and t . The first term in (5), the within-plant component, measures productivity growth that is
accounted for by changes in the productivity of existing plants. The second term in (5), the
reallocation component, measures productivity growth that is due to the reallocation of output
shares among existing plants.

2.2. The Role of Net Entry in Chile and Korea

We decompose aggregate manufacturing productivity using the FHK productivity decomposition
in two countries that experienced fast growth in the 1990s followed by a slowdown in the 2000s:
Chile and Korea. We plot real GDP per working-age person in Chile and Korea in Figure 1. GDP
per working-age person in Chile grew at an annualized rate of 4.0 percent during 1995–1998 and,
in Korea, GDP per working-age person grew at 6.1 percent during 1992–1997 and 4.3 percent
during 2001–2006. GDP growth in Chile slowed to 2.7 percent during 2001–2006 and, in Korea,
GDP growth fell to 3.0 percent during 2009–2014. Using plant-level data from these periods, we

examine how the importance of net entry in aggregate manufacturing productivity growth in the
FHK decomposition evolves in an economy that has fast growth in GDP per working-age person
and then experiences a slowdown. The benefit of looking across multiple periods in the same
country is that we can avoid cross-country differences and use consistent data sets.

    The Chilean data are drawn from the Encuesta Nacional Industrial Anual data set provided
by the Chilean statistical agency, the Instituto Nacional de Estadística. The panel data set covers
all manufacturing establishments in Chile with more than 10 employees for the years 1995–2006.
For Korea, we use the Mining and Manufacturing Surveys provided by the Korean National
Statistical Office. This panel data set covers all manufacturing establishments in Korea with at
least 10 workers. We have three panels: 1992–1997, 2001–2006, and 2009–2014. The full details
of the data preparation can be found in Appendix A.
    The first step in the decomposition is to compute plant-level productivity. For plant e in
industry i , we assume the production function is

                                         log yeit  log zeit   ki log keit   i log  eit   mi log meit ,          (6)

where yeit is gross output, zeit is the plant’s productivity, keit is capital, eit is labor, meit is

intermediate inputs, and  ij is the industry-specific coefficient of input j in industry i .

                                                                          9
    To define an industry, we use the most disaggregated classification possible. For the Chilean
data, this is the 4-digit International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) Revision 3. For the
Korean data, depending upon the sample window, this is a Korean national system based on the 4-
digit ISIC Revision 3 or Revision 4. To get a sense of the level of disaggregation, note that ISIC
Revisions 3 and 4 have, respectively, 127 and 137 industries.
    We construct measures of real factor inputs for each plant. Gross output, intermediate inputs,
and capital are measured in local currencies, and we use price deflators to build the real series. For
labor, we use man-years in the Chilean data and number of employees in the Korean data.
Following FHK, the coefficients  ij are the industry-level factor cost shares, averaged over the

beginning and end of each time window.
    We calculate the industry-level productivity, log Zit , for industry i in each year using (1) and
decompose these changes into net entry and continuing terms using (4) and (5). To compute the
aggregate manufacturing-wide productivity change,  log Z t , we weight the productivity change

of each industry by the fraction of nominal gross output accounted for by that industry, averaged
over the beginning and end of each time window. We follow the same process to compute the
aggregate entering, exiting, and continuing terms.
    Before we compare the results, we must make an adjustment for the varying lengths of the
time windows considered. We face the constraint that our data for Chile that cover the fast growth
period are three years: The data begin in 1995, and the period of fast growth ends in 1998.
Furthermore, in Section 2.3 we describe how we supplement our own work with studies from the
literature, which also use windows of varying lengths. The length of the sample window is
important because longer sample windows increase the importance of the net entry term in
productivity growth.
    We use our calibrated model (discussed in Sections 3–7) to convert each measurement into 5-
year equivalent windows. To do so, we compute the FHK contribution of net entry generated by
the model (on the balanced growth path) using window lengths of 5, 10, and 15 years. The
contribution of net entry to aggregate productivity growth in the model is 25.0 percent when
measured over a 5-year window, 41.1 percent when measured over a 10-year window, and 53.9
percent when measured over a 15-year window. Using these points, we fit a quadratic equation



                                                 10
that relates the importance of net entry to the window length, which we plot in Figure 2. We use
the fitted curve to adjust the measurements that do not use 5-year windows.

    The contribution of net entry in the FHK decomposition to aggregate manufacturing
productivity growth in Chile during the period 1995–1998, for example, is 35.5 percent. To adjust
this 3-year measurement to its 5-year equivalent, we divide the model’s net entry contribution to
aggregate productivity at 5 years (25.0 percent) by the net entry contribution at 3 years (17.6
percent, the square on the curve at 3 years in Figure 2) to arrive at an adjustment factor of 1.42
(=25.0/17.6). The 5-year equivalent Chilean measurement is 50.4 (=1.42×35.5) percent.
    We summarize the Chilean and Korean manufacturing productivity decompositions in Table
1. We find that periods with faster GDP growth are accompanied by faster manufacturing
productivity growth and larger contributions of net entry to aggregate manufacturing productivity
growth in the FHK decomposition. From 1995 to 1998, Chilean manufacturing productivity
experienced annual growth of 3.3 percent, compared to 1.9 percent growth during the 2001–2006
period. During the period of fast growth for Chile, net entry accounts for 50.4 percent of aggregate
manufacturing productivity growth, whereas it accounts for only 22.8 percent during the period
with slower growth. In Korea, the manufacturing sector experienced annual productivity growth
of 3.6 percent during 1992–1997 and 3.3 percent during 2001–2006, compared to 1.5 percent
                                                                                                    11
during 2009–2014. During the periods of fast growth, net entry accounts for 48.0 percent of
aggregate manufacturing productivity growth in 1992–1997 and 37.3 percent in 2001–2006,
compared to only 25.1 percent in 2009–2014.

        In Appendix B, we consider alternative productivity decompositions described in Griliches
and Regev (1995) and Melitz and Polanec (2015). Our finding that net entry is a more important
contributor to aggregate manufacturing productivity during periods of fast growth in GDP per
working-age person is robust to these alternative methods. We also show that this result is robust
to using the Wooldridge (2009) extension of the Levinsohn and Petrin (2003) methodology to
estimate the production function. It is also robust to using value added as weights, as opposed to
gross output weights.
        We also consider an additional robustness exercise in which we use constant industry weights
to assess whether our results are driven by the changing composition of industries rather than by
within-industry dynamics (Appendix B). Suppose, for example, that some industries have higher
shares of productivity growth that are accounted for by entry and exit and that these shares are
constant over time. If the industries with higher shares of growth due to entry and exit have
increasing shares of output during rapid growth periods, this could account for the empirical
regularity that we identify. The results of our robustness exercise show, however, that the empirical
regularity remains after we use constant industry weights across windows.
        As a next step, we further decompose the entering and exiting terms in (4) to investigate
whether the increased importance of entry and exit is associated with changes in the relative

                                                          12
productivities of entering and exiting plants or their market shares. Appendix C contains additional
details regarding this decomposition. Table 2 reports the results. We find that during periods of fast
growth in GDP per working-age person, we tend to see both the entering and exiting terms
contributing more to aggregate manufacturing productivity growth. It is useful to note that, as
shown in (4), if the exiting term is negative, it contributes positively to productivity growth. We
find that the relative productivity of entering and exiting plants, rather than their market shares,
tends to be the most consistent driver of changes in both of these terms.

2.3. The Role of Net Entry in the Cross Section

In Section 2.2 we studied the contribution of net entry in the FHK decomposition to aggregate
manufacturing productivity growth in Chile and Korea, countries that experienced both fast growth
in GDP per working-age person and a subsequent slowdown. This approach is ideal because we
eliminate problems that might arise from cross-country differences. We would like to study the
determinants of aggregate manufacturing productivity growth in as many countries as possible,
but access to plant-level data constrains the set of countries we are able to consider. Fortunately,
several researchers have used the same methodology that we describe in Section 2.1 to study
countries that are growing relatively slowly (Japan, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the United
States) and countries that are growing relatively fast (Chile, China, and Korea). As mentioned
before, we consider a country to be growing relatively fast if the growth rate of GDP per working-
age person is at least 4 percent per year. These studies are not focused on the questions we ask

                                                         13
here, but their use of TFP as the measure of productivity, gross output production functions, gross
output as weights, manufacturing data, and the FHK decomposition make their calculations
comparable to ours for Chile and Korea.
    Table 3 summarizes our findings as well as those in the literature. The sixth column in the
table contains the contributions of net entry to aggregate manufacturing productivity growth in the
FHK decomposition as reported in the studies, and the seventh column contains the adjusted 5-
year equivalents. In the first panel of Table 3, we gather results from countries with relatively slow
growth rates of GDP per working-age person. In this set of countries, the contribution of net entry
ranges from 12 percent to 35 percent, with an average of 22 percent. In the second panel of Table
3, we gather the results from countries with relatively high growth rates of GDP per working-age
person. In this set of countries, the contribution of net entry to aggregate manufacturing
productivity growth ranges between 37 and 58 percent, with an average of 47 percent.

    In Figure 3, we summarize our findings. On the vertical axis, we plot the contribution of net
entry to aggregate manufacturing productivity growth in the FHK decomposition, and on the
horizontal axis, we plot the economy’s growth rate of GDP per working-age person. The figure
shows a clear, positive correlation: The net entry of plants is more important for aggregate
manufacturing productivity growth during periods of fast GDP per working-age person growth.
                                                                                                    14
Combining our results with those of studies from the literature yields a more complete picture of
the relationship between GDP per working-age person growth and the contribution of net entry to
aggregate manufacturing productivity growth. Note that there is also a positive relationship
between aggregate productivity growth in manufacturing and net entry. This is not a surprise, since
the correlation between growth rates of GDP per working-age person and growth rates of aggregate
manufacturing productivity is 0.73, and if we remove one outlier observation (Portugal 1991–
1994), this correlation rises to 0.88.

3. Model

In this section, we develop a simple dynamic general equilibrium model of firm entry and exit
based on Hopenhayn (1992). We model a continuum of firms in a closed economy. Openness was
undoubtedly important in the growth experiences of Chile and Korea. In this paper, however, we
focus on the simplest possible model so that we can understand how economic forces manifest in
the FHK decomposition. Furthermore, when we look at the reforms implemented in Chile and
Korea during the episodes we study, we do not find major trade reforms. In the conclusion, we
discuss how our model can be extended to an open economy model.
    Firms are heterogeneous in their marginal efficiencies and produce a single good in a perfectly
competitive market. Time is discrete and there is no aggregate uncertainty. As in Parente and
Prescott (1994) and Kehoe and Prescott (2002), all countries grow at the same rate when they are
on the balanced growth path, but the level of the balanced growth path depends on the distortions
in the economy. We incorporate three distortions, a portion of which we interpret as being the result
of government policy. First, potential firms face entry costs. Second, new firms face barriers that
prevent them from adopting the most efficient technology. Third, there is a fixed continuation cost
that firms must pay to operate each period. When the policy-induced barriers are reduced, the
economy transits to a higher balanced growth path.
    The model has three key features. First, the distribution from which potential entrants draw
their efficiencies exogenously improves each period. Second, the efficiency of existing firms
improves both through an exogenous process and through spillovers from the rest of the economy.
Finally, firm entry and exit are endogenous, although we also allow for exogenous exit.
    In terms of linking the empirical work and the model, we make two points. First, firms in the
model are heterogeneous in their efficiencies. These efficiencies are not the same as the
productivity that we measure in the data. When we decompose aggregate productivity growth in
the model, we must compute a firm’s productivity using the same process described in Section 2.2.
Second, our plant-level data do not distinguish between single-plant and multi-plant firms. Given
this lack of data, we treat a plant in the data as being equivalent to a firm in our model. One concern
may be whether the entry of plants is due to the entry of new firms or the creation of new plants
by continuing firms. We find that in the case of the United States, however, the bulk of new plants
are created by new firms: Statistics from the U.S. Census Longitudinal Business Database indicate


                                                  17
that 76 percent of new establishments are created by firms that are less than 4 years old (average
1980–2000).

The representative household inelastically supplies one unit of labor to firms and chooses

where  is the discount factor, Ct is household consumption, Pt is the price of the good, qt 1 is

the price of the one-period bond, Bt 1 are the holdings of one-period bonds purchased by the

household, wt is the wage, and Dt are aggregate dividends paid by firms. We normalize Pt  1

for all t .

3.2. Producers

In each period t , potential entrants pay a fixed entry cost, t , to draw a marginal efficiency, x ,

from the distribution, Ft ( x ) , whose mean grows exogenously by g e  1 . This entry cost is paid

by the household, entitling it to the future dividends of firms that operate. After observing their
efficiencies, potential entrants choose whether to operate. We refer to potential entrants that draw
a high enough efficiency to justify operating as successful entrants. Potential entrants that do not
draw a high enough efficiency are failed entrants. Firms that operate may exit for exogenous
reasons (with probability  ), or may endogenously exit when the firm’s value is negative.
     We first characterize the profit maximization problem of a firm that has chosen to operate. A
firm with efficiency x uses a decreasing returns to scale production technology,

                                                         y  x ,                                 (8)

where  is the amount of labor used by the firm and 0    1 . Conditional on operating, firms
hire labor to maximize dividends, d t ( x ) ,

                                     d t ( x )  max x t ( x )  wt  t ( x )  f t ,            (9)
                                                     


                                                             18
where f t is the fixed continuation cost, which is denominated in units of the consumption good.

The solution to (9) is given by
                                                                         1
                                                              x 1
                                                  t ( x)        .                               (10)
                                                             wt 

Notice that labor demand is increasing in the efficiency of the firm. An important mechanism in
our model is the increase in the wage that results from an inflow of relatively productive new firms.
    At the beginning of each period, an operating firm chooses whether to produce in the current
period or to exit. If the firm chooses to exit, its dividends are zero and the firm cannot re-enter in
subsequent periods. The value of a firm with efficiency x is

                            Vt ( x )  max{d t ( x )  qt 1 (1   )Vt 1 ( xg c ,t 1 ), 0} ,     (11)

where gc,t 1 is the continuing firm’s efficiency growth factor from t to t  1 . This efficiency

growth factor is characterized by

                                                       g ct  ggt ,                                (12)

where g is a constant, gt is the growth factor from t  1 to t of the unweighted mean efficiency

of all firms that operate in each period, and  measures the degree of spillovers from the aggregate
economy to the firm. These spillovers are not important for our theory, but they are important for
our quantitative results. We assume that g  g 1e , which ensures endogenous exit in the balanced
growth path.
    Since d t ( x ) is increasing in x , Vt ( x) is also increasing in x , and firms operate if and only

if they have an efficiency above the cutoff threshold, xˆt , which is characterized by

                                                      Vt ( xˆt )  0 .                              (13)

It is useful to define the minimum efficiency of firms in a cohort of age j , xˆ jt . For all firms age

j  1 , we have that xˆ1t  xˆt since firms only enter if the firm’s value is positive. For all firms age
j  2 , xˆ jt is characterized by

                                            xˆ jt  max xˆt , xˆ j 1,t 1 gct  .                 (14)


                                                             19
If there are firms in a cohort that choose to exit, then xˆ jt  xˆ t . If no firms in the cohort choose to

exit, then the minimum efficiency evolves with the efficiency of the least-efficient operating firm
adjusted for efficiency growth, xˆ jt  xˆ j 1,t 1 g ct .


3.3. Entry

Upon paying the fixed entry cost, t , a potential entrant draws its efficiency, x , from a Pareto

for x  g et /  . The parameter  governs the shape of the efficiency distribution. We assume that

 1     2 , which ensures that the firm size (employment) distribution has a finite variance. In

the spirit of Parente and Prescott (1994), the parameter  characterizes the barriers to technology
adoption faced by potential entrants. When   1 , potential entrants draw their efficiencies from a
distribution that is stochastically dominated by the frontier efficiency distribution. The mean
of (15) is proportional to g et /  , so increasing the barriers to technology adoption lowers the mean

efficiency of potential entrants.
     We assume that both the entry cost,  t   g et , and the fixed continuation cost, f t  fg et , grow
at the same rate as the potential entrant’s average efficiency. In the next section, we show that these
assumptions imply that the fixed costs incurred are a constant share of output per capita and thus
ensure the existence of a balanced growth path. Our formulation is similar to that of Acemoglu et
al. (2003), who assume that fixed costs are proportional to the frontier technology. In Appendix F,
we consider an alternative model in which fixed costs are denominated in units of labor, which has

                                                                                     

The first,  , is technological and is common across all countries. The second,  k  0 , is the result

of policy. The fixed continuation cost is defined analogously as f  f T (1   f ) .

     The mass of potential entrants, t , is determined by the free-entry condition,

4. Balanced Growth Path

In this section, we define a balanced growth path for the model described in Section 3 and prove
its existence. We also conduct comparative statics exercises to show how the output level on the
balanced growth path depends on entry costs, fixed continuation costs, and barriers to technology
adoption.

4.1. Definition and Proof of Existence

Definition: A balanced growth path is an equilibrium, for the appropriate initial conditions, such
that the sequences of wages, output, consumption, dividends, and entry-exit thresholds grow at
rate ge  1 , and bond prices, measures of potential entrants, and measures of operating firms are

constant. In the balanced growth path, for all t  0 and j  1 ,

                                    wt 1 Yt 1 Ct 1 Dt 1 xˆ j ,t 1
                                                                    ge ,                                                                    (23)
                                    wt     Yt    Ct    Dt     xˆ jt

and qt 1   / ge , t   , t   .


Proposition 1. A balanced growth path exists.

Proof: On the balanced growth path, the profitability of a firm declines over time because of the
continual entry of firms with higher efficiencies. Thus, once a firm becomes unprofitable, it exits,
                                                                    22
which implies that the cutoff efficiency is characterized by the static zero-profit condition,
dt ( xˆt )  0 . Furthermore, firms of every age endogenously exit each period, so xˆ jt  xˆ t for all

j  1 . The mass of operating firms is

                                                                  (1   )  1

where   , f ,    g et / Yt  , f ,   , which is constant in the balanced growth path. Thus, the entry

cost is a constant share of output per capita,
                                                                       t
                                            , f ,                          .                            (25)

An analogous argument proves that the fixed continuation cost is also a constant share of output
per capita. The mass of potential entrants is
                                                                    

where  and  are positive constants. The cutoff efficiency to operate is given by
                                                                                          1

at rate ge  1 ,

    How does the improving efficiency distribution of new firms generate growth? Each entering
cohort of firms has a higher average efficiency than the previous cohort. These more efficient firms
increase the demand for labor, as seen in (10), increasing the wage and the efficiency needed to
operate. Thus, inefficient firms from previous generations are replaced by more efficient firms.
    The balanced growth path has the interesting feature that, although there is efficiency growth
among continuing firms, long-run output growth in the economy is solely determined by the
improving efficiency of potential entrants, ge . This is due to endogenous selection: Because
inefficient firms exit, the remaining incumbents are more efficient than the previous cohort of
incumbents by a factor of ge . Furthermore, if two economies have the same ge , they grow at the

same rate, regardless of their entry costs, barriers to technology adoption, or fixed continuation
costs. The cross-country differences in these parameters map into differences in the level of output
on the balanced growth path.

4.2. Comparative Statics

We conduct comparative statics to understand the mechanisms through which lowering distortions
raises output. Three points are worth mentioning. First, as seen in (28), income can rise because of
an increase in the mass of operating firms or an increase in the efficiency cutoffs. Second, each
policy change has both direct and indirect effects. The indirect effect is summarized by changes in
  , f ,   , which relates the size of fixed costs to output, as shown in (25). Finally, it is useful

to know that  ,  , and  are positive constants that do not depend on  ,  , or f , whereas

  , f ,   is increasing in each of its arguments.

    We now show that each reform operates through different channels. We focus on the direct
effect and thus hold   , f ,   fixed. First, consider an economy that decreases its entry cost,  .

Lower entry costs lead to an increase in the mass of potential entrants in (26), which increases the
cutoff efficiency in (27). The increase in the cutoff efficiency results in an increase in output in
(28). Second, when a country lowers the barriers to technology adoption,  , there is an increase
in the efficiency threshold in (27), which increases output. In contrast to the decline in entry costs,
the mass of potential entrants remains unchanged. Rather, efficiency thresholds increase because
firms have access to a better efficiency distribution. Finally, consider a reduction in the fixed
                                               24
continuation cost, f . Equation (24) shows that this leads to an increase in the mass of operating
firms. There are two opposing effects. On the one hand, the increase in the mass of operating firms
lowers the efficiency cutoffs in (27), which lowers output in (28). On the other hand, the increase
in the mass of operating firms raises output in (28). We can show that the latter effect dominates.
Thus, lowering fixed continuation costs raises output and, in contrast to reforms to entry costs and
barriers to technology adoption, lowers the efficiency cutoffs.
    All of the reforms we discuss above have the same indirect effect through changes in
  , f ,   . A reduction in entry costs, barriers to technology adoption, or fixed continuation costs

has the indirect effect of decreasing the fixed costs relative to output. This increases both the mass
of operating firms in (24) and the mass of potential entrants in (26). The increase in the mass of
operating firms results in an increase in output in (28). Note that these indirect effects have no
impact on the efficiency thresholds. To see this, substitute (24) and (26) into (27).

5. Measurement

We need to define the capital stock of firms in the model so that we can measure productivity in
the model in the same way we measure it in the data. When a new firm is created, the firm invests
 t  f t units of consumption to create  t  f t units of capital. We assume that, in each period, the
capital stock depreciates by ft  ( t 1   t ) and, if the firm continues to operate, it invests ft 1 .

This implies that the firm’s capital stock in t  1 is

                           kt 1   t  f t   f t  ( t 1   t )  f t 1   t 1  f t 1 .          (32)

This formulation implies that all firms have the same capital stock, which keeps the model
tractable. The complete details are available in Appendix E. In Appendix G, we also report the
quantitative results from an alternative model in which labor is a composite of variable labor and
variable capital. We find that the results are qualitatively similar but the contribution of entry and
exit to aggregate productivity growth during periods of fast GDP growth is larger.
    The productivity z of a firm with efficiency x is measured as

                        log  z t ( x )   log  y t ( x )    t log   t ( x )    kt log  k t  ,   (33)

where t  wt / Yt is the labor share, kt  Rt Kt / Yt is the capital share, Rt  1/ qt  1   kt is the

rental rate of capital, K t is the aggregate capital stock, and  kt is the aggregate depreciation rate.

                                                               25
Note that Pt has been normalized to 1 in our model, which implies that yt ( x )  Pt yt ( x ) . This is

identical to the way productivities and factor shares are computed in Section 2, with the exception
that we do not have intermediate goods in our model. In Appendix E, we provide the derivation of
the aggregate depreciation rate, which is constant in the balanced growth path but not in the
transition. Once we measure firm productivity, we calculate aggregate productivity and the FHK
decompositions using the model-generated data as described in (4) and (5).
    It is useful to discuss how measured productivity is related to efficiency in the model. We
substitute the production function in (8) into (33) and use the fact that t   to obtain

                                   log  zt ( x )   log x   kt log  t  f t  .                    (34)

Thus, measured productivity and efficiency are tightly linked, the only difference being the last
term, which is common across all firms. It follows that, in the balanced growth path, the aggregate
productivity growth rate is smaller than the GDP growth rate, ge , because of the growth of capital.
In particular, we have that

                                             log Z it  1   k  log g e .                            (35)


6. Analytical Characterizations of the FHK Decomposition

A strength of our modeling approach is that we can recover analytic expressions for the FHK
productivity decomposition on the balanced growth path. This allows us to understand how the
parameters of our model are connected to the terms in the decomposition. In the balanced growth
path, the decomposition is
                                                                                       

                                                               26
where  log Z Entry is the entering component in (4),  log Z Exit is the exiting component in (4), and

 log Z C is defined in (5). The contribution of net entry to aggregate productivity growth in the

FHK decomposition is ( log Z Entry   log Z Exit ) /  log Z . To generate endogenous exit in the

balanced growth path, we assume that g  g e1 , which implies that g c  g e . Thus, the contribution

of entry is bounded between  and 1.
    Before we discuss the relationship between model parameters and the importance of net entry
in the FHK decomposition, note that, in the balanced growth path, the FHK decomposition of
aggregate productivity growth, like the GDP growth rate, does not depend on the policy distortions
 ,  , and  . Any country on a balanced growth path, regardless of its levels of distortions, has
            f



the same FHK decomposition.
    The analytic decompositions in (36)–(38) highlight the three fundamental forces that drive
aggregate productivity growth in the model: firm turnover, related to  ; firm heterogeneity and
selection, governed by  ; and productivity growth in incumbent firms relative to entrants,

determined by ge and gc . We turn to comparative statics to demonstrate these relationships.
    To understand the ways in which firm turnover shapes the decompositions, first consider the
case in which  , the exogenous death probability, is one: All firms die at the end of each period.
In this case, all aggregate productivity growth in the FHK decomposition is attributed to entering
firms. The contribution of the exiting term is zero because it depends on the difference between
the productivity of exiting firms and the overall productivity in the prior period when these firms
were active, which, in this case, is zero, since the two sets of firms are identical.
     As  falls, more firms remain in operation from one period to the next and the fraction of
productivity growth attributed to continuing firms in the FHK decomposition increases. The
contribution of firm exit also increases. The larger mass of incumbent firms implies a larger mass
of firms that endogenously exit. Finally, since a smaller  implies less exit and thus less entry, the
contribution from entry to aggregate productivity growth falls.
    Firm heterogeneity in the balanced growth path is a function of the heterogeneity in the
underlying distribution of entrant productivity, which is governed by  . To see how firm
heterogeneity affects the FHK productivity decomposition, consider the limiting case in which 

approaches infinity. Since gc  ge , the entry term accounts for all of the aggregate productivity

                                                  27
growth in the FHK decomposition. When  approaches infinity, there is no heterogeneity within
each cohort. The lack of heterogeneity in each cohort, along with the fact that entrants have higher
productivities, implies that entrants will displace all of the continuing firms. In this case, even
though the incumbent firms exit endogenously, they do not contribute to aggregate productivity
growth because their productivity is the same as the average productivity in the previous period.
If there is no selection, exit does not contribute to aggregate productivity growth in the FHK
decomposition.
    As  decreases, heterogeneity within each cohort increases. As a result, the entry term
becomes less important in the FHK decomposition. Greater heterogeneity implies that there are
high-productivity incumbent firms that do not exit. This also implies that the continuing
component becomes more important, as more firms from previous cohorts remain. The importance
of the exiting component also increases, as the larger mass of continuing firms induces selection,
forcing out firms that are relatively inefficient compared to continuing firms.
    How does the difference in entrant and incumbent efficiency growth rates shape the
productivity decomposition? Suppose gc  ge . This implies that the efficiency distributions of
entering and continuing firms are the same. To see why, consider a cohort of firms that enters in
period t . In period t  1 , the efficiency distribution of the cohort has increased by a factor of gc .

Since gc  ge , the distribution of efficiencies of the cohort of entering firms is the same as that of
the cohort that entered in the previous period. In this case, once a firm enters, it will only exit
through exogenous death. The reason is that the firm cutoffs grow at ge , which is the same growth

factor as the efficiencies of continuing firms. Since the efficiency distributions are identical, the
contribution of entering firms in the FHK decomposition is equal to their market share, which is
given by the exogenous death probability of existing firms,  , and the contribution of continuing
firms is characterized by their market share, 1   . Exiting firms do not contribute to productivity
growth, since their productivity is the same as the average productivity in the previous period.
    In the general case in which gc  ge , the entering term in the FHK decomposition always

decreases with gc . We can similarly show that the exiting term is decreasing in gc whenever

                                          g             1

                                                    28
In Section 7, we find that this condition is satisfied with the calibrated parameters. Thus, in the
range of parameters we consider, the importance of entry and exit declines with gc .

    The balanced growth path analytics make it easy to see how firm turnover, selection, and the
entrant productivity advantage shape the contribution of net entry to aggregate productivity
growth. We cannot analytically characterize the decompositions off the balanced growth path, but
the intuition we have developed here will carry over.

7. Quantitative Exercises

We now take our model to the data. We begin by calibrating the model so that it replicates key
features of the U.S. economy. We think of the U.S. economy as being distortion-free,  f     0
and   1 , so the calibration identifies the model’s technological parameters. A period in the model
is five years, the same length as the time window for the productivity decompositions.
    After calibrating the model, we create three separate distorted economies with income levels
that are 15 percent below that of the United States. The first distorted economy is the same as the
United States except that entry costs are higher. Similarly, the second and third distorted economies
are the same as the United States except for higher barriers to technology adoption and higher
fixed continuation costs, respectively. We then introduce a reform into each of these distorted
economies to determine whether the reforms can quantitatively match the relationships we observe
in the data regarding GDP growth and the importance of entry and exit.
    We find that the reforms to entry costs and barriers to technology adoption result in growth in
GDP and aggregate productivity. Furthermore, we find that both of these reforms induce similar
transition dynamics, including the importance of entry and exit in productivity growth in the FHK
decomposition, during the reform. One important difference between the two reforms is that the
mass of potential entrants increases more in the reform to entry costs. Even though the efficiency
distribution of the potential entrants remains the same when entry costs are lowered, the increase
in the mass of potential entrants increases the efficiency threshold. Thus, we find that lowering
entry costs is almost equivalent to improving the efficiency distribution of potential entrants
through the lowering of barriers to technology adoption. Finally, we find that the reform to the
fixed continuation cost causes an increase in GDP but results in a decline in aggregate productivity,
which is not consistent with the data on Chile and Korea or with the evidence of other episodes
from the literature.
                                                 29
    It is worth noting that Yt in the model is real GDP. Equation (21) shows that Yt is the sum of

all consumption and investment in the economy. Furthermore, because the labor endowment is
constant in the model, growth in Yt is the same as growth in real GDP per working-age person.


7.1. Calibration

We report the calibrated parameters in Table 4. We set the fixed continuation cost, f T , so that the
model generates an average establishment size of 14.0 employees, which is the mean during the

period 1976 to 2000 as found in U.S. Census Bureau (2011). We set  so that the ratio of the
                                                                   T


entry cost to the annual fixed continuation cost,  T / ( f T / 5), is 0.82, which is consistent with the
findings of Barseghyan and DiCecio (2011), who survey the empirical literature on entry and
continuation costs. We calibrate the tail parameter,  , to match the standard deviation of
establishment employment, which has an average value of 89.0 between 1976 and 2000 according
to U.S. Census Bureau (2011). The exogenous death rate,  , is set so that exiting plants destroy
19.3 percent of employment every five years, which is the average between 1976 and 2000
according to U.S. Census Bureau (2011).
    Our empirical work studied the manufacturing sector, but our model is of the entire economy.
To make the two comparable, we assume that net entry is as important for productivity growth in
non-manufacturing as it is in manufacturing. We are not aware of any work that calculates the FHK
productivity decomposition for the entire U.S. economy. The paper by Garcia-Macia et al. (2016),
however, is one of the few papers that use data for the entire U.S. economy to study the relative
importance of incumbents and entrants in accounting for productivity growth. They find that
incumbents account for the bulk of productivity growth in the economy. Although their results are
consistent with the results of FHK for the manufacturing sector, we should be cautious in
comparing the two results, since Garcia-Macia et al. (2016) do not use the FHK decomposition but
rather use a decomposition derived from their model. We set g , which determines the efficiency
growth rate of continuing firms, to match the contribution of entry and exit to U.S. aggregate
manufacturing productivity growth, which FHK find to be 25 percent.

    We next pin down  , which characterizes the relationship between continuing-plant and
aggregate efficiency growth. In the data, we observe an increase in the productivity growth of
continuing plants when there is an increase in industry-level productivity growth. Ideally, for this
exercise we would like to use data for all U.S. plants, but without access to these data, we use data
for Chilean and Korean manufacturing plants. To quantify this relationship, we take the logarithm
of (12)

                                           log g ct  log g   log g t ,                                     (40)

to arrive at an equation that we can estimate using plant-level data. Using ordinary least squares,
we estimate,

                                         log g ct ,i   0   log g it   it ,                              (41)

where g ct ,i is the productivity growth of continuing plants of industry i (weighted by the gross

output of plants), g it is the aggregate productivity growth in industry i , and it is an error term.

In the data, a continuing plant is one that is present at both the beginning and the end of the sample
window. Although  governs the growth rate of continuing-firm efficiency, we use productivity
data to estimate (41). The estimated  is correct, however, since log productivity is a linear
transformation of log efficiency. The constant term in the regression is not an estimate of g .

     Table 5 reports the results of the regression across the five windows that we study. We find
that the regression coefficient ranges from 0.38 to 0.70 for Korea and from 0.72 to 0.83 for Chile.
We use the average over the five estimates to find that   0.64 . One concern is that we are not
measuring spillovers but rather an unrelated factor that affects the correlation between plant
productivity growth and industry productivity growth (e.g., Manski, 1993). Another concern is that
although we are calibrating the model to an economy that is on the balanced growth path, we
estimate  using plant-level data for countries that are not on a balanced growth path. However,
we do not see any systematic relationship between the regression coefficient and whether the
economy is in a period of fast growth. In Appendix H, we explore the robustness of our quantitative
results to changing  . The quantitative results show that the model matches the positive
correlation between fast growth and the contribution of net entry for  ranging from 0.38 to 0.83.
If we eliminate spillovers in the economy by setting   0 , then the net entry term during a reform
to entry costs or barriers to technology adoption would increase by more than our baseline results.
     We now compare the efficiency growth rates of continuing and entering firms in the calibrated
economy. As mentioned before, the efficiency distribution of entering plants has a growth factor
of g e  1.02 5 . We use (12) to compute the efficiency growth factor of continuing firms and arrive

at g c  1.0195 , using the fact that average efficiency grows by ge in the balanced growth path.

Note that condition (39), which is the condition under which increases in gc lead to a decline in

the importance of entry and exit in the FHK decomposition, is satisfied under the calibrated
parameters.

7.2. Policy Reforms in Chile and Korea

In Appendix I, we summarize the key reforms conducted in Chile and Korea during the periods of
fast growth. For Chile, we consider reforms in the 1993−1997 period, affecting the 1995−1998

                                                         32
window. For Korea, we consider reforms in the 1990−1995 period and the 1998−2004 period,
affecting the 1992−1997 window and the 2002−2007 window, respectively.
    We attempt to map these reforms to changes in the policy variables in our model, which are
entry and fixed continuation costs and barriers to technology adoption. We find that the types of
reforms that Chile and Korea undertook are mostly consistent with the lowering of entry costs and
barriers to technology adoption. For example, we find that both Chile and Korea relaxed
restrictions on foreign direct investment (FDI), which reduces the barriers to technology adoption,
since it improves access to foreign technologies. Similarly, both of these countries made reforms
to the financial system, making it easier for firms to finance large up-front costs and, in that sense,
lower barriers to technology adoption and entry costs. Midrigan and Xu (2014) use a model of
establishment dynamics with financial frictions calibrated to Korean manufacturing plants and find
that financial frictions primarily distort entry and technology adoption decisions. Finally, the
Korean government instituted pro-competitive reforms to allow for greater competition, which
lowers entry costs.
    We do not find that either Chile or Korea implemented major trade reforms during the periods
of fast growth. It is worth noting, however, that the literature on trade and productivity emphasizes
improvements in the efficiency distribution of firms resulting from a trade reform. In that sense,
reforms to barriers to technology adoption in the model have features that resemble the efficiency
gains emphasized by this literature. For instance, Sampson (2016) builds a model in which
potential entrants draw efficiencies from a distribution that is related to the efficiency of incumbent
firms. In this model, trade reforms lead to the exit of unproductive firms, which results in the
improvement of the efficiency distribution that entrants draw from. Perla et al. (2015) and Buera
and Oberfield (2016) also build models in which trade reforms lead to an improvement in the
efficiency distribution that firms draw from.

7.3. Policy Reforms in the Model

In this section, we consider policy reforms that move the economy to a higher balanced growth
path by lowering either entry costs, barriers to technology adoption, or the fixed continuation costs.
The goal of these experiments is to determine whether these types of reforms can quantitatively
account for the contribution of entry and exit to productivity growth in the FHK decomposition
during periods of fast GDP growth. Although the reforms that Chile and Korea conducted over this

                                                  33
period are most similar to reducing entry costs and barriers to technology adoption, we also
examine the quantitative results of reductions in the fixed continuation costs.
    We first create three separate distorted economies. Each economy is parameterized as the U.S.
economy, with one exception. In the first distorted economy, we increase the policy-related portion
of the entry costs,   , so that GDP on the balanced growth path is 15 percent lower than in the
nondistorted economy. In the second and third distorted economies, we raise the barriers to
technology adoption,  , and the policy-related portion of the fixed continuation cost,  f , so that
GDP on the balanced growth path also declines 15 percent, respectively, in each of these
economies. This requires setting   0.74 and   1.12 and f  4.48 .
    We institute a reform by eliminating the distortion in each economy and then studying the
transition to the new balanced growth path. We begin by reporting the results of the reform that
reduces entry costs. In Figure 4, we plot GDP. The transition of the economy is quick, and within
two model periods, the economy is very close to converging to the new balanced growth path.
GDP grows 4.6 percent annually in the initial 5-year period after the reform and quickly falls to 2
percent.

    To understand the mechanisms at work in the model, we plot key economic variables during
the transition. The smaller entry costs lead to a permanent increase in the mass of potential entrants,
as seen in Figure 5(a). The increase in the mass of potential entrants leads to an increase in the
efficiency threshold needed for an entrant to successfully operate. There is also an increase in the
mass of failed entrants. In Figure 5(b), we plot the efficiency threshold, normalizing the first period
value to 100. The series has been detrended by dividing the threshold by get so that the detrended
efficiency threshold is constant when the economy is on the balanced growth path. Note that we
have exit in each cohort, so the threshold efficiency level is the same for all incumbents and
successful entrants.

    In Figure 6, we plot firm entry and exit. The reform leads to a spike in firm turnover during
the transition, and firm turnover is permanently higher on the new balanced growth path. We also
see that during the transition, relatively inefficient firms exit and relatively efficient firms enter,
which drives the increased importance of entry and exit for productivity growth during periods of
fast growth in GDP.

    Other model variables exhibit patterns similar to the neoclassical growth model. We plot
consumption and interest rates in Figure 7. To understand their behavior, recall that creating new
firms is investment: The household forgoes consumption to create long-lived firms that increase
future income. Decreasing entry costs leads to an increase in the demand for potential entrants. As

                                                                                                                         36
a result, there is an increase in the interest rate during the reform and a decline in consumption
growth. As the investment boom subsides, consumption rises to its new balanced growth path
value.

    Table 6 reports the GDP and productivity growth rates and the contribution of net entry to
productivity growth in the FHK decomposition when we decrease entry costs in the model. Before
the reform, the calibrated economy is on a balanced growth path in which GDP grows at 2 percent
per year and net entry contributes 25 percent of aggregate productivity growth. During the reform
period, GDP grows at an annualized rate of 4.6 percent and there is a surge in the contribution of
net entry to 59.6 percent. Note that increases in the aggregate capital stock imply that productivity
growth is smaller than GDP growth.

    Our second reform, lowering the barriers to technology adoption ( ) , generates outcomes
similar to those from lowering entry costs. For example, when a reform to  takes place (period 4),
                                                 37
GDP growth and the FHK contribution of net entry are the same up to the first decimal place as
those reported in Table 6, while aggregate productivity growth is a little lower (2.7 percent). The
figures that characterize the key economic variables for the reform to barriers to technology
adoption are similar to those in Figures 4–7.
    The only substantial difference between the two reforms is that the mass of potential entrants
increases less after the reform to  . In Figure 8, we plot the mass of potential entrants under both
reforms. Note that after the reform, both economies converge to the same nondistorted economy,
so the reform to entry costs generates a larger increase in potential entrants. The change in entry
costs generates more potential entry because, as seen in (26), lowering  directly affects the mass
of potential entrants. This is in addition to the indirect effects that operate through  . Lowering
 , however, does not have a direct effect on the mass of potential entrants, only an indirect effect.

    We now evaluate the effect of reforms to the fixed continuation cost. We report the results of
this reform in Table 7. A surge in GDP growth occurs immediately after the reform. However, this
reform leads to a decline in aggregate productivity. Note the contrast between lowering entry costs
                                                38
and lowering fixed continuation costs. The former generates more potential entrants, thereby
raising the efficiency threshold needed to operate. The latter discourages unproductive firms from
exiting once they are operating. In the data, we observe that periods of higher GDP growth are
associated with higher productivity growth, which is not consistent with reforms to the fixed
continuation cost in the model. Given this counterfactual implication, we do not further study
reforms to the fixed continuation cost.

    Our findings are robust to alternative modeling choices. In Appendix F, we consider a model
in which the fixed costs are denominated in labor rather than the consumption good. When we
calibrate this model and perform the same reform exercises, we find quantitative results similar to
those in the baseline case. In Appendix G, we use the same model as in Appendix F but reinterpret
labor to be a composite input of labor and capital. In the calibrated model, we find that the new
quantitative results yield similar patterns to those from the baseline model, but have a larger
increase in the contribution of entry and exit relative to the baseline.

7.4. Net Entry in the Model and the Data

In this section, we examine the extent to which reforms to entry costs and barriers to technology
adoption quantitatively match the contribution of net entry to aggregate productivity growth in the
FHK decomposition that we observe in the data during periods of fast growth. In Table 8, we report
growth in GDP per working-age person and the contribution of net entry to aggregate
manufacturing productivity growth in the data. Since Table 3 has multiple observations for
countries that are experiencing fast and slow growth, we report the average GDP per working-age
person growth and the contribution of net entry to productivity growth over all the fast-growing
economies and all the slow-growing economies. We also report the equivalent statistics from the
                                           39
model. Recall that the labor endowment is fixed in the model, which implies that growth in GDP
is equivalent to growth in GDP per working-age person.

                      Table 8: Contribution of net entry, model and data.

    During periods of slow growth in GDP, which correspond to the balanced growth path in our
model, the model is calibrated to generate the GDP growth rate and the FHK contribution of net
entry that we observe in the U.S. data. We have not used any of the model’s transition path behavior
in the calibration, so the net entry contribution following reform is informative about the model’s
performance. The model successfully matches the patterns we find in the data. GDP in the model
grows at 4.6 percent during the reform, compared to 5.8 percent in the data. The contribution of
net entry during this period is 60 percent in the model, compared to 47 percent in the data.
    We further analyze the model’s outcomes by decomposing the entering and exiting terms
in (4) into components that correspond to the relative productivity of entrants or exiters and their
gross output shares. In Table 9, we report the decomposition from our model as well as a summary
of the data found in Table 2. Overall, the model matches these nontargeted moments well. In the
data, changes in the entering and exiting terms were driven mainly by changes in the relative
productivities of entrants and exiters. During periods of fast growth, entrants in the model are 14
percent more productive than the average firm in the previous period, compared to 17 percent in
the data. During periods of slower GDP growth, the relative productivity of entrants falls to 6
percent in the model, compared to 2 percent in the data. Similarly, during periods of fast growth,
exiting firms are 10 percent less productive than the average firm in the model, compared to 12
percent less productive in the data. During periods of slow growth, the model also generates exiters
that are 2 percent less productive than the average firm, compared to 5 percent in the data.

Notes: The entering and exiting terms are the components of the net entry term in (4). The relative productivity term
is the average entering (or exiting) firm productivity at t (or t  1 ) relative to the average productivity of all firms in
 t  1 . Since each component is averaged over several observations, the multiplicative decomposition may not hold in
the data exactly.


     The decomposition of the entering term in the data does not completely match that in the
model. In particular, changes in shares play an important role in the model but not in the data. In
the model, the entrants’ market share increases from 20 percent in periods of slow growth to 42
percent in periods of fast growth, whereas there is no such corresponding increase in the data.
Similarly, the exiter market share in the model increases from 19 percent in periods of slow growth
to 27 percent in periods of fast growth, qualitatively matching the increase in exiter market share
in the data. Our simple model of firm dynamics captures the relative productivity of entering and
exiting firms reasonably well. This is important because Table 2 indicates that changes in the
contribution of entry and exit in the FHK decomposition are mainly driven by changes in the
relative productivity of entering and exiting plants. A more nuanced model of firm growth may be
able to better capture the behavior of market shares, but our model performs well along many
dimensions and is simple enough to retain analytic tractability.



8. Conclusion and Direction for Future Research

Our work suggests three areas for future research. First, this paper, as well as most of the literature
that studies aggregate productivity growth, has focused on the manufacturing sector. Because of
this limitation, we have assumed that the fraction of productivity growth accounted for by entry

                                                            41
and exit in the FHK decomposition is the same in manufacturing as it is in the entire economy.
Decomposing productivity for an entire economy, especially an economy that has experienced
both fast and slow growth, would be useful to understand better the importance of entry and exit
during periods of fast and slow growth. We are not aware of any study that has calculated the FHK
decomposition for the entire economy using firm- or plant-level TFP as the measure of
productivity.
     A second area of future research is to extend our model to an open economy setting. In a model
with international trade, a trade reform generates incentives to attempt entry and will affect the
importance of entry and exit in the FHK decomposition. If the economy is open to international
capital flows, then it would not see an increase in the interest rate after a reform. In our economy,
the rising interest rate slows down the transition. An economy that is open to capital flows will see
a faster transition.
     A final area of research is to understand how being a potential entrant (an entrepreneur who
has taken an efficiency draw), a failed entrant (a potential entrant who does not have an efficiency
high enough to operate), and a successful entrant (a potential entrant who has an efficiency high
enough to operate) maps to the data. For example, a longitudinal study of business creation, the
Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics, documents the different stages of creating a new
business (Reynolds and Curtin, 2011). After 72 months, 30 percent have begun production, 48
percent have quit, and 22 percent are still in the start-up process. Do we consider a potential entrant
to be a start-up, a failed entrant to be a start-up that quit, and a successful entrant to be a start-up
that began production? An alternative interpretation is given by Bartelsman et al. (2013), who in
their calibration interpret failed entrants as businesses that do not survive the first five years.

Appendix A: Data Appendix

Data Description for Chilean Manufacturing Productivity Decompositions

We use the ENIA (Encuesta Nacional Industrial Anual) data set provided by the Chilean statistical
institute INE (Instituto Nacional de Estadística). The data set is a panel of all manufacturing
establishments in Chile with more than 10 employees covering 1995–2006. The data use the 4-
digit ISIC Rev. 3 industry classification system. To give a sense of the level of disaggregation, we
note that ISIC Rev. 3 has 127 industries.
    The first step is to compute plant-level productivity. We assume that plant e in industry t
operates the following production function:

                         log yeit  log zeit   ki log k eit   i log  eit   mi log meit ,     (A1)

where zeit is the plant’s productivity, yeit is gross output, keit is capital, eit is total labor measured

in man-years, meit is intermediate inputs, and  ij is the coefficient of input j in industry i .

      We construct gross output and factor inputs in the same manner as Liu and Tybout (1996)
and Tybout (1996). Gross output is the sum of total income (sales of goods produced; goods
shipped to other establishments; resales of products; and work, repairs, and installations for third
parties), electricity sold, buildings produced for own use, machinery produced for own use,
vehicles produced for own use, goods produced that go to inventory (final inventory of goods in
process plus final inventory of goods produced minus initial inventory of goods in process minus
initial inventory of goods produced). For intermediate inputs, we include the purchases of
intermediates (materials, fuels, goods purchased for resale, cost of work done by third parties,
water, greases, and oil), electricity, and the materials used from inventories (initial inventories
minus final inventories). We use gross output and intermediate input deflators at the 4-digit level
(ISIC Rev. 3) to convert these variables into 1995 pesos. These deflators were created by the INE
to be used with the ENIA plant-level data. For the labor input, we use man-years, adjusted for labor
quality (between blue-collar and white-collar workers) using relative wages.
    In constructing the real capital stock, we consider three types of capital: buildings, machinery,
and vehicles. We use the book value of capital reported by firms and use an investment deflator to
arrive at the real stock of capital in 1995 pesos.



                                                          48
       To find the parameters  ki ,  i , and mi of the production function, we use nominal industry

cost shares for each input. The cost shares we calculate are at the 4-digit industry level for each
input, averaged over the beginning and end of the period. For cost of labor, we use total employee
remuneration. For intermediate input usage, we use the nominal value constructed to create the
real intermediate input usage.
       We do not have a direct measure of the user cost of capital to use in computing the cost share
of capital. We use the no-arbitrage relationship to find the user cost of capital, j ,

where R jt is the user cost of capital, Pt is the price level of the aggregate economy, PtjK is the

price of a unit of capital type j in period t , and rt is the real interest rate. For rt we use the

economy-wide real interest rate, for Pt 1 / Pt we use the GDP deflator, and for Pt K1, j / PtjK we use

the aggregate investment deflator.
       Given real input factors and cost shares, we determine the productivity of plant e in industry
i as

                        log zeit  log yeit    k i log keit   i log  eit   mi log meit  .   (A3)

We can thus calculate the industry-level productivity Z it for industry i for all years using (1).
Furthermore, we decompose these changes in industry-level productivity using (2), (3), (4), and
(5). To compute the changes in aggregate productivity, we weight the productivity growth of each
industry by the fraction of nominal gross output accounted for by that industry, averaged over
beginning and end. We follow the exact same process to compute the aggregate contribution of
continuing firms and net entry.

Data Description for Korean Manufacturing Productivity Decompositions

We use the Mining and Manufacturing Survey purchased from the Korean National Statistical
Office. This data set is a panel that covers all manufacturing establishments in Korea with at least
10 workers. We have three panels: 1992–1997, 2001–2006, and 2009–2014. Each plant’s industry
is given at the 5-digit level using the Korean Standard Industrial Classification (KSIC Rev. 6 for

                                                           49
1992–1997, Rev. 8 for 2001–2006, and Rev. 9 for 2009–2014).3 As in the Chilean data, we use 4-
digit KSIC industries as the main unit of industry analysis.
     The first step is to compute plant-level productivity. We assume that plant e in industry i
operates the following production function:

                           log yeit  log zeit   ki log k eit   i log  eit   mi log meit ,           (A4)

where yeit is gross output, zeit is total factor productivity, keit is capital, eit is labor, meit is

intermediate inputs, and  ij is the coefficient of input j in industry i .

     For gross output, we use the production value reported in Korean won. We use producer price
indices (obtained from the Bank of Korea, henceforth BOK), broken down at the 4-digit level, to
put this series into real 2010 Korean won. For labor, we use the number of production workers
plus a quality-adjusted estimate of nonproduction workers. As in Baily et al. (1992), the adjustment
is made using the relative earnings of nonproduction workers, calculated separately for each plant.4
For the capital stock, we consider three types of capital: buildings and structures, machinery and
equipment, and vehicles and ships. We use the average reported book value of each type of capital
at the beginning and end of each year, deflated by the GDP deflator for gross fixed capital
formation (BOK). Once we have computed the real capital stock series, we sum the value of
buildings and structures, machinery and equipment, and vehicles and ships to obtain the total
capital stock of the plant,

                                                     k et   k eitj .                                       (A5)
                                                              j


For intermediate inputs, we use the total value of materials, electricity, fuel, and water usage, and
outsourced processing costs reported by the plant in Korean won. We use intermediate input
deflators constructed using the input-output matrix (BOK) to convert this series into real 2010
Korean won. We build three sets of deflators: one based on KSIC Rev. 6 using the input-output
matrix for 1995, one based on KSIC Rev. 8 using the input-output matrix for 2003, and one based
on KSIC Rev. 9 using the input-output matrix for 2011. We obtain the matrix of intermediate
deflators, D , by

  KSIC Revs. 6 and 8 are comparable to the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC Rev. 3), and KSIC
Rev. 9 is comparable to ISIC Rev. 4.

  For the 2009–2014 window, in which employees are reported as full-time and temporary workers, the analogous
adjustment is made for temporary workers.

where rt is the real interest rate,  j is the depreciation rate for capital of type j , Pt is the price

level of the aggregate economy, and PtjK is the price of a unit of capital type j in period t . For rt

we use the economy-wide real interest rate, for Pt 1 / Pt we use the GDP deflator, and for

Pt K1, j / PtjK we use the aggregate investment deflator. Following Levinsohn and Petrin (2003), we

use depreciation rates of 5 percent for buildings and structures, 10 percent for machinery and
equipment, and 20 percent for vehicles and ships.
      Given these estimates, the productivity of plant e in industry i at time t is

Appendix B: Sensitivity of Empirical Results

Alternative Decompositions for Chile and Korea

To check the robustness of our findings for Chile and Korea, we consider alternative
decompositions proposed by Griliches and Regev (1995) and Melitz and Polanec (2015),
henceforth GR and MP, respectively. In particular, we decompose aggregate manufacturing
productivity growth over the same windows using the GR and MP decompositions to see if the
contribution of net entry is higher during the period of fast growth. Furthermore, we decompose
productivity growth using model output to examine the contribution of net entry in the balanced
growth path and during the transition.
      It is informative to see that the net entry term,  log Z itNE , and the continuing term,  log Z itC ,
can be rewritten using aggregate statistics of entering, exiting, and continuing plants as described
by Melitz and Polanec (2015). To do so, we first rewrite the end-of-window productivity of
industry i at time t as

                                           log Z it  sitN log Z itN  sitC log Z iCt ,                             (A9)

where sitN is the share of gross output accounted for by entering plants in industry i at time t , and

Z itN is the aggregate productivity of entering plants at time t , and likewise for continuing plants

(C) . In the same manner, we rewrite the beginning-of-window industry productivity at time t  1
as

                                     log Z i ,t 1  siC,t 1 log Z iC,t 1  siX,t 1 log Z iX,t 1 ,             (A10)

where siX,t 1 is the share of gross output accounted for by exiting plants at time t  1 . Notice that

an entrant is only active at time t , and an exiting plant is only active at time t  1 .
      Second, we rewrite (4) and (5) of the FHK decomposition as

                      log ZitNE  siNt  log ZitN  log Zi ,t 1   siX,t 1  log ZiX,t 1  log Zi ,t 1      (A11)
                                                                                      
                                                    entering                                    exiting


and

                      log ZitC  sitC  log ZitC  log Zi ,t 1   siC,t 1  log Z iC,t 1  log Zi ,t 1  .   (A12)



                                                                   52
Equations (A11) and (A12) show that the only statistics needed to calculate the net entry and
continuing plant components of the FHK decompositions are the share of output and the weighted
productivity of continuing, entering, and exiting plants.
    The MP decomposition rewrites the continuing and net entry terms as

                    log ZitC  log ZitC  log Z iC,t 1
                                                                                                              (A13)
                    log ZitNE  sitN  log Z itN  log ZitC   siX,t 1  log ZiX,t 1  log ZiC,t 1  .

Notice that the reference group for new plants is the productivity of continuing plants at time t ,
and the reference group for exiting plants is the productivity of continuing plants at time t  1 . The
change in reference group would affect the net entry term.
    Lastly, we can write the GR decomposition as

                                                                             
                      log ZitC  sitC log ZitC  log Zit  siC,t 1 log ZiC,t 1  log Zit         
                                                                                                              (A14)
                                                                                 
                      log ZitNE  sitN log ZitN  log Zit  siX,t 1 log ZiX,t 1  log Zit ,          
where

                                                             log Z it  log Z i ,t 1
                                                log Z it                             .                       (A15)
                                                                       2

In the GR decomposition, the reference group for all plants is the industry-level productivity,
averaged over the beginning and end of the window. GR decomposition may be less prone to
measurement error in output and inputs because of the averaging over time.
    The results from the three decompositions can be found in Table A1 and Table A2. We see
that the pattern of high contributions of net entry during the fast growth years, followed by lower
contributions of net entry, still holds under all of the decompositions. For Chile, the contribution
of net entry goes from 23.8 percent to 10.8 percent using GR and 22.4 percent to −50.9 percent
using MP. The GR net entry contribution has been adjusted using the model so that the 1995–1998
window is comparable to other 5-year windows. The MP net entry contribution does not depend
on the window length used. In the case of Korea, the contribution of net entry goes from 43.1
percent to 31.5 percent and then to 25.6 percent using GR. The contribution of net entry goes from
3.9 percent to −2.7 percent and then to −16.5 percent using MP.




                                                                 53

    We calculate these decompositions using output from the model. The results can be found in
Table A3. The decompositions for the “reform” use model output from the 5-year window
immediately after the reform. We find that the results for GR are very similar to those of FHK.
This finding is consistent with FHK, who find that the contribution of net entry to productivity
growth is similar under both FHK and GR in U.S. manufacturing data. We find that both the MP
and GR decompositions show an increase in the net entry component after the reforms.

Alternative Method to Determine Production Function: Wooldridge-Levinsohn-Petrin

In our baseline specification, we use industry-level cost shares to remain consistent with FHK. As
a robustness check, we use the Wooldridge (2009) extension of the Levinsohn and Petrin (2003)
method (WLP) for estimation of the production function. With the new elasticities of the
production function, we find the plant-level productivities and compute the FHK productivity
decompositions. The contribution of net entry and aggregate manufacturing productivity growth
                                              54
is reported in Table A4. As before, we find a similar pattern in which the contribution of net entry
is higher during periods of fast growth.

Alternative Weighting across Plants

In our baseline specification, we use gross output as weights to calculate industry productivity and
then to aggregate changes in industry productivity. This methodology is consistent with that of
FHK. As a robustness check, we redo the exercise using value added as weights. The results,
reported in Table A5, show that the pattern still holds: The contribution of net entry is higher during
periods of fast growth.

      Table A5: Net entry in manufacturing productivity decompositions (VA weights).

    Another concern is that the results may be driven by the changing composition of industries
across time — industries that consistently have a higher fraction of productivity growth accounted
for by entry and exit in the FHK decomposition could also be the ones that increase their output
share during periods of rapid growth. For this reason, we redo the decomposition using the same
output shares across windows. Specifically, we use the average weight across windows for each
industry. The results are reported in Table A6. Using these alternative weights, we find that entry
and exit still account for a larger fraction of aggregate productivity growth during periods of rapid
GDP growth.

net entry term in (A11) in the following manner:

Thus, we have the following decomposition:

derive

which is constant in the balanced growth path. The labor market clearing condition gives

Substituting (A18) into (A20), we obtain the expression for the mass of operating firms:

Using      equation       (18)     and            applying                    the           balanced            growth               path   conditions

Appendix E: Measuring Capital in the Model

We construct a measure of capital at the firm level in order to estimate productivity using the model
output in the same manner as we did with the data, which is described in Section 2.2.
     When a firm enters at time t , its investment is f t   t . Subsequently, its investment each

period is the fixed continuation cost. Capital, kt , evolves as follows:

                                                    k t 1  (1  kt ) k t  I t ,                                       (A30)

where kt is the depreciation rate and I t is investment at time t . When a firm enters at time t , its

capital stock is kt   t  f t . If the depreciation rate is

                                                              f t   t 1   t 
                                                    kt                           ,                                      (A31)
                                                                    t  ft

then the subsequent capital stock is

                                                             kt  kt  ft ,                                                (A32)

for all t after entry. Note that the total depreciation in a given period is

                                             kt  t  f t   f t   t 1   t  .                                   (A33)

This expression implies that the total depreciation of capital at the firm level is the fixed
continuation cost minus any increase in the fixed capital stock. The fact that all firms have the
same capital stock is counterfactual but allows us to keep the model analytically tractable.
     We now define the aggregate depreciation rate and the aggregate capital stock. Aggregate
investment is t t  t f t , and the aggregate capital stock is t ( t  f t )   t  1t   t . The

depreciation of capital is the sum of the capital of firms that die, entry costs of failed entrants, and
ft  (t 1  t ) for continuing firms as discussed above. We find that the aggregate depreciation
rate is

                             t 1 ( t 1  f t 1 )   t 1  1t 1   t 1            t t  t f t
                 kt  1                                                                                             .   (A34)
                                    t ( t  f t )   t  1t   t              t ( t  f t )   t  1t   t

Notice that this depreciation rate is constant on the balanced growth path but not in the transition.

Appendix F: Fixed Costs Denominated in Terms of Labor

In this section, we change our baseline model so that the fixed costs are denominated in terms of
labor. We then calibrate the new model and redo the quantitative exercise in Section 7.
    All of the equations that characterize the model in Section 3 remain the same except for the
equations that we now characterize. Potential entrants pay an entry cost,  , which is denominated
in units of labor to draw a marginal efficiency, x . The condition in (9) becomes

                                  d t ( x )  max x t ( x )  wt  t ( x )  wt f ,                                                  (A35)

As before, the efficiency cutoffs, real wages, and output grow at rate ge  1 . The mass of potential

entrants,  , and the mass of operating firms,  , are also constant on the balanced growth path.
     As in our baseline, we treat fixed costs as investment. When a firm enters at time t , its nominal
investment is wt  f    . The firm’s real investment is I t  w0 g et  f    , where w0 is the base

year wages, and get reflects improvements in the quality of capital. After a firm enters, nominal

investment each period is the fixed continuation cost wt f and its real investment is I t  w0 g et f .

Real capital, kt , evolves as follows:

                                            kt 1  (1  kt ) kt  I t 1 ,                     (A46)

where kt is the depreciation rate and I t 1 is real investment at time t  1 . When a firm enters at

time t , its real capital stock is kt  w0 g e t  f    . If the depreciation rate is

                                                                ge
                                                kt  1           ,                             (A47)
                                                               f 

then the subsequent capital stock is

                                              kt  w0 g e t  f    ,                           (A48)

for all t after entry. As in the baseline model, the fact that all firms have the same fixed capital
stock generates a clean relationship between efficiency and productivity.
     To calibrate the model, we follow a similar strategy as before. The calibrated parameters are
reported in Table A7. One thing to note is that firm size is measured in units of variable labor, as
in the baseline calibration.

    As before, we create distorted economies in order to study the transition dynamics when we
remove distortions. We only report the results for the quantitative exercise that involve lowering
entry costs, since reducing barriers to technology adoption yields similar results. In the distorted
economy, we raise the entry cost to 1.53 so that income is 15 percent lower on the balanced growth
path. We report the results of the reforms to entry costs in Table A8. We find that, as before, GDP
and productivity growth rates increase immediately after the reform. We also see an increase in
the contribution of net entry. The results are quantitatively similar to our baseline.

Appendix G: Model with a Composite of Variable Labor and Capital

In this section, we recalibrate the model presented in Appendix F in which fixed costs are
denominated in terms of labor. We reinterpret labor in the model to be equipped labor. Equipped

                                                       63
labor is created by a bundler that uses a Cobb-Douglas technology to combine variable labor and
variable capital, both of which are owned by the household. The bundler operates under perfect
competition.
    The new interpretation of  is the span-of-control parameter in Lucas’s (1978) model. We use
a value of   0.85 , which is consistent with Gomes and Kuehn (2014) and Atkeson and Kehoe
(2005). Given the new value of  , we recalibrate all other parameters as described in Table A9.
Most targets are similar to the baseline calibration. One point to make is that after normalizing the
labor and capital endowments, we can calculate the targets that use employment statistics in the
model, such as the average establishment size. We also set the coefficient of variable labor in the
bundler’s Cobb-Douglas technology so that the model matches a labor share of 0.67.

    We create a distorted economy by raising the entry cost so that income on the balanced growth
path is 15 percent lower. We then conduct a reform by reducing entry costs and study the
subsequent transition to the new balanced growth path. Table A10 summarizes the new results. We
find that the results are qualitatively the same as before. The main difference is that the contribution
of net entry in the period of reform is higher than in the baseline case (74.0 vs. 59.6). Notice,
however, that the model can still account for the positive correlation between GDP growth and the
contribution of net entry.

Appendix H: Sensitivity Analysis of Spillover Parameter, 

In this section, we report the sensitivity analysis when we use alternative values of the spillover
parameter,  . We redo the quantitative exercise using  values of 0.38 and 0.83, which are the
minimum and maximum values that we found in the Chilean and Korean data as reported in Table
5. For each  , we recalibrate all of the parameters using the same targets as in Table 4. In both
cases, all of the parameters remain the same as in the baseline calibration except for g . We then
use each calibrated economy to create a distorted economy that has higher entry costs. Income is
15 percent lower on the balanced growth path in these distorted economies. As can be seen in Table
A11, when we conduct a reform, we find that there is an immediate increase in the net entry term,
which ranges from 46.9 to 73.9 percent (vs. 59.6 percent in the baseline case). We conclude that
the model can quantitatively account for the positive correlation between output growth and the
contribution of net entry for a wide range of empirically relevant values of  .
