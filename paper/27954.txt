                                         ABSTRACT

This study investigates empirically how managerial practices have affected macroeconomic
adjustment during the Great Recession after the 2008 economic crisis. We start by constructing a
country*industry balanced panel data over the 2007-2015 period for eighteen industries in ten
OECD countries, and complementing it by two indicators: an indicator of management quality at
the country level based on the managerial practices categorical scores at firm level from Bloom et
al. (2012); and an indicator at the industry level for the shocks stemming from the 2008 economic
crisis. We then rely on the local projection method pioneered by Jordá (2005) to estimate the
direct impacts of country management quality indicators and industry economic shocks as well as
their joint impacts, on five variables of interest: value-added, employment, labor productivity,
wage per employee and labor share during the Great Recession. We find that, in countries where
management quality is higher, production and employment are more resilient during the Great
Recession, with less production losses and employment damages, no effects on productivity,
wage moderation and a slight increase in the labor shares. It appears, moreover, that this
resilience is increasing with the size of industry shocks.

1.      Introduction

          The Covid-19 crisis has highlighted the importance of swift reorganisation of tasks and

logistics in cushioning economic shocks. For instance, the ability to rapidly implement

teleworking, reorganise supply chains and resort to online services to meet social distancing

rules and disruptions in deliveries of intermediate goods is crucial in lessening the negative

effects of lockdowns on OECD economies. Managerial talent plays a key role in enabling and

promoting such reorganisation, contributing to the ability of firms to weather the storm during

crises by preserving skills, production and market shares. Aggregating up, the average quality

of management in a country can therefore potentially contribute to increasing economic

resilience to shocks at the sectoral and aggregate levels as well.

          While it is too early to study the effects of managerial talent on resilience to the Covid-

19 crisis, useful insights can be drawn from the experience of the Great Recession. In this paper

we study the way in which average managerial quality has shaped the response of OECD

economies to the financial crisis focusing on its effects on employment and related economic

outcomes at sectoral level.

          Research has shown that managerial practices vary a lot not only across firms in an

economy but also across countries. For instance, Bloom and Van Reenen (2007) and Bloom et

al. (2009, 2012, 2016) have collected, via firm-level surveys, data on the quality of management

for 35 countries which show that the dispersion of managerial quality across countries and

across firms within countries is wide. Their approach has been applied by government agencies

for collecting management information or benchmarking purposes (see World Management

Survey). 1 Using a different approach, the OECD (2019) has gathered survey data on cognitive



1
    For instance, the US Census Bureau MOPS collects data on managerial practices on a continuous basis
and New Zealand, Australia, Canada and Ireland have been using the approach to benchmark managerial
practices against those of other countries.

                                                    3
abilities of adults by occupation (including managers) in 33 countries, which also suggests a

wide variability across and within countries in the talent of managers. 2

          Several studies have shown the effect that managers can have on firm-level and sectoral

productivity outcomes in the medium to long-run (Bloom et al., 2012, 2014, 2016; Syverson,

2011; Giorcelli, 2019). Another strand of research has highlighted the role of managers in

efficiently allocating tasks in a firm in ways that preserve, develop and use efficiently human

capital and workers' skills, including by maintaining workers' incentives and satisfaction

(Bandiera et al., 2007; Burgess et al., 2010; Friebel et al., 2017; Amodio and Martinez-

Carrasco, 2018).

          However, there has been relatively little research to date on the effects of managerial

practices on macroeconomic outcomes during a crisis. Does the response of value-added,

employment, productivity and wages to a deep downturn differ across countries depending on

prevailing managerial practices? More specifically, are countries that have on average better

managers able to preserve employment levels and the associated human capital in the wake of

a temporary demand shock? If so, what are the trade-offs managers can leverage upon, such as

wages or productivity, in weathering the shock and ensuring a rebound during the recovery

period?

          In this paper we focus on these issues using the Great Recession (GR) as an exemplary

case study. We rely on a country-industry panel covering 18 industries in 10 OECD countries

over the 2007-2015 period and adapt the local projection approach developed by Jorda (2005)

and Teulings and Zubanov (2014) to study the covariation of average managerial quality,

measured by the World Management Survey indicators, with the response of employment,

value-added, wages, productivity and the labor share. In other words, we estimate the extent to

which country-industry differences in managerial quality are correlated with differential

responses of employment and other variables to the intensity of the demand shocks induced by

the 2008 Great Recession.

          We find that the quality of management practices was significantly associated with

employment dynamics during the Great Recession. On average, countries that had better

management levels suffered less employment losses. The difference in cumulated job losses

between countries at the top and bottom management quality quartiles has been significant. In

better managed countries, employment losses have been contained by limiting declines in

production, implementing wage cuts and maintaining productivity levels. As a result, in these

countries labor shares have not declined. Moreover, these positive cushioning effects of good

management on employment appear to increase with the depth of the shock suffered at sectoral

level.

          Our paper contributes to three main strands of literature. First, it adds a dimension to the

macroeconomic research looking at the interactions between institutions and shocks (Blanchard

and Wolfers, 2000; Bertola, 2016; Monteiro, 2017). These authors have looked at the way in

which the differential responses of unemployment to demand shocks in European countries

have been shaped by differences in labor and product market institutions, such as employment

protection, collective bargaining regimes and product market regulation. Managerial culture is

closely related to historical and institutional factors, such as industrial structure, the education

system and both labor and product market arrangements. 3 The quality of management can

therefore be affected by policies that address these underlying factors and our study suggests

that this could increase employment resilience during economic crises. Second, it explores the

macroeconomic implications of evidence found at the microeconomic level concerning the link

between management styles and labor reallocation within firms experiencing exogenous shocks



3
    For instance, Bloom et al. (2010) and Van Reenen (2011) show that managerial practices are affected
by the competitive environment in which firms operate.

                                                    5
(Adhvaryu et al., 2019). Third, it extends research on the way managerial quality affects the

response of economic outcomes to shocks (Wang et al., 2016) by looking beyond the

productivity dimension into the mechanisms that underlie these outcomes.

       The finding that good management may contribute to smooth out the effect of deep

crises on employment is potentially relevant for understanding differences in employment

responses to the Covid crisis during lockdowns across countries, beyond influences exerted by

other institutional arrangements such as reliance on job retention vs unemployment insurance

schemes. It could also be relevant looking forward to gauge the persisting effects of the Covid-

19 crisis on employment upon exiting confinement periods via the emergence of new work

arrangements reflecting the need for social distancing. While there are obvious differences

between the causes and mechanisms underlying the Great Recession and the Covid-19 crises

and the policy responses to these crises, our results suggest that good management could have

positive effects in the recovery process of both crises through comparable channels.

       In the following, we start by describing our empirical approach and regression model

(section 2). Next, we describe our international industry-level data, our proxies for managerial

quality and the cross-country patterns these data unveil (section 3). We then report our

estimation results and robustness tests, focusing on the association of managerial quality with

the time profile of value-added, employment, wages, productivity and the labor share during

and after the Great Recession (section 4). Finally, we use our coefficient estimates to gauge

how raising the average level of managerial quality in countries where this level was low in the

wake of the Great Recession might have enhanced their resilience to the crisis and the speed

and intensity of their recovery (section 5). We conclude by discussing the policy and research

issues raised by our findings (section 6).

         2.        Approach and Model

           2.1.    The local projection method
           The local projection approach, as developed by Jordà (2005), is basically a flexible time-

series (and panel data) statistical method to estimate the dynamic effects of shocks, or precisely

the "impulse responses to shocks", defined as the differences between two forecasts ­ the first

corresponding to a situation with the shock and the second to the same situation without this

shock. 4

           Using Jorda's own words in his introduction:

              -    "Impulse responses (and variance decomposition) are important statistics in their

     own right: they provide the empirical regularities that substantiate theoretical modes of the

     economy and are therefore a natural empirical objective...; computing impulse responses

     based on local projections do not require specification and estimation of the unknown true

     multivariate dynamic system itself"

              -    "The advantages of local projections are numerous: they can be estimated by

     simple least squares with standard regression packages...; they are robust to misspecification

     of the DGP (Data Generating Process); they easily accommodate experimentation with

     highly non-linear specifications that are often impractical or infeasible in a multivariate

     context".

           Our approach is a direct application of the local projection method to analyse the

dynamic effects of the economic shock (noted SH) induced by the 2008 Great Recession. We

look at the size and changes of these effects, over the seven subsequent years (2009-2015)

covered in our sample, focusing on four interrelated economic variables: production measured

by Value-Added (VA), employment (L) measured by the number of employees, wages (W)


4
    In his paper, Jorda shows in details what are the advantages of the local projection approach to compute
impulse responses in comparison to the more usual, but less flexible VAR (or VARMA) approaches.

                                                      7
measured by the average wage per employee, labor productivity (LP) measured as the ratio of

value-added to employees (VA/L), and the labor share (LS) measured as total wage

compensation over value-added (L*W/VA). We are also specifically interested on studying

how and to what extent these effects vary in interaction with the quality of management

practices (noted MQ).

       2.2.    Model
       Following the framework of the local projection method, we posit a system of 35 (=5

variables*7 years) stacked regressions defined as separate linear projections, where the five left

hand side dependent variables are the log-changes of our variables of interest (VA, L, W, LP

and LS) between 2007 and each of the seven years of our study period (2009, 2010, ..., 2015),

and the right hand side regressors are simply measures of the 2008 crisis industry-level shocks

(SH), country indicators of the average management quality (MQ) in a period before 2008 as

well as the interaction between industry-level shocks and country-level management quality

(SH*MQ). Denoting respectively the different countries, industries and years in our sample by

the indices (c), (i) and (t), the system is specified as follows:

(2009, 2010, ..., 2015). The estimated ( ,  ,  ,  and   ) coefficients assess to what extent

the country management quality practices (MQc) can account for country differences in the

impulse responses.

          We introduce the interaction between industry-specific shocks and country-specific

management quality to test whether good managerial practices have a differential impact

depending on the intensity of the shock. If so, they would be overall significant and stronger

for industries more deeply affected by the 2008 crisis. This allows to sharpen our identification

of the impact of management quality on sectoral outcomes via a Rajan and Zingales (1998)

differences-in-differences approach. 7 We measure industry-specific shocks by the fall in output

in US industries and make two assumptions: (i) industries have inherent features that expose

them differently to the crisis, which do not vary significantly across countries; and (ii)

managerial quality is more relevant for industry responses to the crisis in more exposed



5
    Note that the system of 35 (=5*7) stacked regressions is structured as seven yearly blocks of five
equations: Eq_VA(t), Eq_L(t); Eq_W(t), Eq_LP(t), Eq_WL(t), with identical left hand side variables
[  +   +  (   )]. We can thus take advantage of this structure to estimate these five
blocks separately by simple least squares, with no need for heteroscedasticity correction of standard
errors.
6
    Country or industry fixed effects are not introduced in our main specification in order to be able to
estimate the  and  parameters. However, country and industry fixed effects are introduced in our
sensitivity analysis and we find that the estimates of the  coefficients (allowing to test whether the
MQ impact is growing with the size of the shock) are robust to this change. These results are available
upon request from the authors.
7
    In diff-in-diff language, management quality is the treatment, highly exposed industries are the treated
variables and least exposed industries are the control group.

industries. We therefore use variation across industries in their exposure to the GR shock and

variation across countries in their level of management quality to assess the impact of

management quality on industry outcomes.

          The (  ,   ,   ,   and   ) coefficients allow us to test these hypotheses. In other

words, the  coefficients estimate how much the impulse response to the 2008 crisis depends

on the management practices and how much this dependence varies with the size of the shock.



3. Data and descriptive statistics


          We use data from the OECD STructural ANalysis (STAN) database to measure the 2008

shock as well as the subsequent economic adjustment, and data from Bloom, Genakos, Sadun

& Van Reenen (2012) to build our indicator of Management Quality. Merging these sources,

we were able to assemble a cross country-industry panel balanced over the period 2007-2015

period for nine countries: France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Poland, Spain, United-

Kingdom and USA and eighteen industries listed in the following footnote. 8Note that we have

not included Sweden in our main study sample, since the Swedish data was available only until




8
    The market industries are (ISIC Rev. 4 code between parenthesis): `Food products, beverages and
tobacco' (10-12), `Textiles, wearing apparel, leather and related products' (13-15), `Wood and paper
products, and printing' (16-18), `Chemical and pharmaceutical products' (20-21), `Rubber and plastics
products, and other non-metallic mineral products' (22-23), `Basic metals and fabricated metal products,
except machinery and equipment' (24-25), `Electrical, electronic and optical equipment' (26-27),
`Machinery and equipment n.e.c.' (28), `Transport equipment' (29-30), `Furniture; other manufacturing;
repair and installation of machinery and equipment' (31-33), `Electricity, gas and water supply;
sewerage, waste management and remediation activities' (35-39), `Construction' (41-43), `Wholesale
and retail trade, repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles' (45-47), `Transportation and storage' (49-
53), `Accommodation and food service activities' (55-56), `Publishing, audio-visual and broadcasting
activities' (58-60), `IT and other information services' (62-63), `Professional, scientific and technical
activities' (69-82).

2013, but not 2015. A balanced panel is preferable to implement the local projection method;

otherwise, changes in the estimated parameters over-time could be explained by the changes in

the country-industry composition of the sample. However, our estimation results are robust to

the inclusion of Sweden if we restrict our country-industry panel to a shorter balanced 2007-

2013 sample. 9

          3.1.    Measure of the industry specific economic shock
          The autumn 2008 banking crisis in the USA spread out instantly to both the other

industries in the USA, but also in the other countries. A key point of our identification strategy

is to simply choose the industry production loss between 2007 and 2009 in the USA to proxy

for the industry-specific economic shocks in the other countries of our sample. As shown in the

Chart 1, the 2007-2009 production loss between the USA and our estimation sample average

for the other countries is relatively small, whereas the industry-specific 2007-2009 production

loss differs much within countries. This clearly supports our choice of using the 2007-2009

production loss in the USA industries as a reasonable proxy for the industry-specific production

losses suffered in the other countries.

          However, adopting the 2007-2009 industry production losses in the USA as convenient

proxies for the industry-specific economic shocks in the other countries has a drawback: the

risk of simultaneity biases arising from correlations between them and the dependent variables

(VA, L, W, LP, LS) in our system of equations. In order to avoid this possibility, we have

preferred to exclude the USA from our main study sample. However, we have found that our

results remain basically unchanged, even if we include the USA in our study sample. 10,11

          3.2.     Adjustment during the Great Recession

          Chart 2 illustrates the rebound of growth after the 2008 crisis for our variables of interest

(VA, L, W, LP and LS) and the six years 2009 to 2015 as measured in terms of the differences

between the sample averages of their log-values in 2007 and in the current years.

          We see that the value-added loss in 2009 is very large, of 12.8%, but that id decreases

thereafter to a loss of only 3% in 2015. On the contrary, the loss is more gradual for

employment, reaching a maximum of negative cumulated growth level of 12.3% in 2014, with

only a small recovery to 11.4% in 2015. Hence, the labor productivity is down by 7% in 2009,

but recovers thereafter, bypassing its 2007 level in 2011 to reach a 8.5% positive cumulated

growth level in 2015. Part of the rise in labor productivity is likely to originate in workers and/or

jobs selection. Average wage per employee, maybe for the same reason, experiences a positive

cumulated growth, from an initial 0.2% in 2009 to 7.1% in 2015. Last, interestingly, the labor

share cumulated growth evolution is very different from that of wages per employee. The labor

     Two reasons can largely explain this robustness of our results: (i) the linear correlation coefficients
between the 2007-2009 production loss in the USA and the 2007-2009 production losses in the other
countries are very high, above 0.70 (with the exception of Ireland and the United Kingdom where three
industries are not covered); and (ii) variance analysis shows that industry fixed effects account for 48%
of the variance of country-industry 2007-2009 production losses, whereas country fixed effects account

     Note that the rebounds of growth after the 2008 crisis for our variables of interest (VA, L, W, LP and
LS) are captured by year fixed effects in the next Section 4 presenting estimation results. This is
important to keep in mind for their correct interpretation. For instance, positive impacts of management
quality MQ on employment growth over the years 2007-2015 signal higher increases in employment
growth in higher quality countries relative to lower quality countries, but not do not indicate absolute
positive impacts on employment growth.

          3.3.    Management quality

          Management quality (MQ) is particularly hard to measure. It requires to define `good'

and `bad' practices, then to assess the diffusion of these practices among firms. Reliable MQ

indicators were not available until recently, largely thanks to the business surveys initiated and

widely developed by Nicholas Bloom and John Van Reenen. Our empirical investigation here

is largely based on their MQ measures, see in particular Bloom & Van Reenen (2007), Bloom,

Sadun & Van Reenen (2012), and Bloom, Lemos, Sadun, Scur & Van Reenen (2014).

          As management practices may be contingent upon firms' specific environment, the

Bloom and Van Reenen business surveys are focused on some practices that can be deemed

`good' or `bad' irrespective of their environment. 13 Their survey includes eighteen questions

asked to medium- to large-sized manufacturing firms (with 50 to 10.000 workers). 14 These

questions cover four areas: Monitoring: How well do organizations monitor developments

inside the firm, and use this information for continuous improvement? Targets: Do

organizations set the right targets, track the right outcomes, and take appropriate action if the

two are inconsistent? Incentives: Are organizations promoting and rewarding employees based

on performance, prioritizing careful hiring, and trying to keep their best employees?

Operations: Introduction and utilisation of lean production methods.

          All these questions are scored on a scale from 1 to 5, increasing in the quality of

practices. The composite indicator measured as the unweighted average of these scores is our

underlying Management Quality measure (MQf) at the firm level. It is computed for all the

firms (f) which have been surveyed during the pre-crisis period for the years 2003-2007 in our


13
     To assess the soundness of such requirement Bloom & Van Reenen (2007) show that their MQ
indicators are significantly associated with higher firm productivity, sales growth rates, profitability,
Tobin's Q, and survival rates.

ten countries. 15 We then simply obtain our basic Management Quality variable at the country

level (MQc) by taking the median of the firm level measures (MQf) for the firms of each of our

ten countries.

          Three remarks are important to underline. First, while the purpose of our paper is to

investigate the impacts of management on the adjustment to the 2008 crisis during the Great

Recession, it is likely that management practices have been simultaneously affected by the

Great Recession. To avoid this potential source of endogeneity, we have chosen, as already

mentioned, to only rely on the data from the business surveys conducted before the 2008

economic crisis to construct the country level management quality indicators (MQc).

          Second, our main study sample is a balanced country-industry panel, covering both

manufacturing and non-manufacturing industries, while our management quality indicators

(MQc) at country level are based on the management quality measures (MQf) at firm level,

where all the firms surveyed Bond & Van Reenen (2012) are medium- to large-sized

manufacturing firms. When restricting our study main sample to manufacturing industries only,

we have found that the estimates for the direct yearly impacts for the industry specific shocks

and country management quality are robust, but that the ones for their interaction turn out to be

not statistically significant. 16

          Third, based on our management quality composite indicator at firm level (MQf) at the

firm level, we have also considered, in parallel to our basic indicator at country level (MQc),

one at country-industry firm level (MQci), and another one at industry level (MQi), all three

measures being based on the same underlying sample of firms. We have found that the estimates

of impacts for the country-industry level and industry level management quality measures are


15
     Note that Spain was not included in Bloom et al. (2012) survey, and that we used Bloom et al. (2014)
data for this country. When we exclude Spain from our main study sample, we find that our estimation
results are basically unchanged. These results are available upon request from the authors.

both very close to our main estimates of impacts for the country level measures. However the

corresponding estimates for their interaction with the industry specific shocks are not anymore

statistically significant, as when we rely on the country level measure. 17

          Chart 3 shows the distribution of the firms' values of our composite management quality

indicator at firm level (MQf) during pre-crisis period (2003-2008). It documents also in the

legend their median values for each of our ten countries, that is our management quality

measure at country level (MQc), as well as the number of individual firm observations (NbF)

underlying the country (MQf) distributions and their median values (MQc).

17
     These results are available upon request from the authors. An empirical reason why we estimate more
precisely the impacts of interaction variable relying on the country level management quality indicator
is its reduced collinearity with the industry specific shocks. Another reason is probably a smaller
variance of random measurement errors. As already noted in previous footnote 11: "Variance analysis
shows that industry fixed effects account for 48% of the variance of country-industry 2007-2009
production losses, whereas country fixed effects account for 14% only".

                                                    16
         The average country management quality indicator (MQc) and (NbF) respectively

amount to 3.06 (on a scale of 1 to 5, 5 for the best practices) and 425 observations. The countries

with the highest (MQc) are Japan (3.28) and the USA (3.29), and the ones with the smallest

(MQc) are Poland (2.90), Ireland (2.83) and Spain (2.75). The countries with the highest (NbF)

are the United Kingdom (1239) and France (656), and the ones with the smallest (NbF) Japan

(155) and Ireland (89). As can be seen on the Chart and could have been expected, Ireland and

Japan are also the two countries with the most spread out distributions.



4. Estimation results
Our model, as written in sub-section 2.2, is a system of 35 (=5 variables*7 years) stacked

regressions defined as separate linear projections, each of which can be simply expressed as:
                                          
    ln( ) - ln(07 ) =   +   +  (   ) +  + 


where var stands for value-added (VA), labor (L), wage (W), labor productivity (LP) and labor

share (LS), and where the year (t) denotes the seven years of our study period (2009, 2010, ...,

2015 The estimation results for the complete set of regressions are recorded in the Appendix

Table.

         Here, in the first two sub-sections 4.1 and 4.2, we present our estimation results on the
                                                                        
direct yearly impacts ( ) of the industry specific shock intensity and ( ) of country

management quality (Appendix Table Panel A and B). In the sub-section 4.3, we comment our
                                       
estimates of the yearly joint impacts ( ) of country management quality and industry

specific shock intensity (Appendix Table Panel C).

         4.1.   Direct economic impacts of the Great Recession

         Chart 4 shows the yearly evolution of the estimated direct impacts of the Great

Recession on our five variables of interest, which means that a 2008 crisis production loss of

of  % for our five variables in the same industry of the non-USA countries.

        The estimated value of the direct impact is negative and strongly persistent on value-

added and employment. For labor productivity, it appears negative in the first year 2009, and

nil afterwards, which reflects an employment adjustment one year slower that the value-added

adjustment. The estimated impact on the real wage per employee is negative in 2009 and 2010,

and not significantly different from zero after. The estimated impact on the labor share is

positive in 2009, and declines continuously afterwards to become significantly negative after

2013.

       4.2.     Direct impacts of management quality on the adjustment to the

Great Recession

       Chart 5 consists of five graphs of the yearly evolution of the estimated direct impacts of

country management quality, with their confidence intervals, for one of our five variables of

interest, showing that a management quality indicator (MQc) equal to (x) in country (c) in year

(t) results, on average, in an overall change of (
                                                    %), from 2007 to year (t) in each

industry of country c, for the considered variable of interest.

       Management quality has a direct positive impact on value-added and employment, this

impact being nevertheless non-significantly different from zero for value-added in 2009 and

2015. Consequently, there is almost no significant impact on productivity, except a negative

one in 2009. The direct impact of management quality is negative on real wage, nevertheless

non-significantly in 2010 and 2015; and the one on labor share is nil in the first years and

becomes significantly positive from 2012.

For each variable of interest, higher and lower bounds correspond to the estimated value of the
coefficient plus and minus two estimated standard errors.



       One interpretation of these results is that the direct impact of management quality moves

the trade-off between employment and the real wage. Higher management quality preserves

employment at the expense of real wages, which are declining, with positive impacts on labor

shares in the medium run. Positive impacts on employment are matched with positive impacts

on output levels. Thus productive performance does not appear to be directly impacted by

management quality.

       Overall, the detrimental direct impacts of the Great Recession on employment have been

attenuated in countries with good managerial practices, which have leveraged wage moderation

to cushion direct effects of shocks on employment.

                                              20
       4.3.    Joint impacts of management quality and economic shocks on the

adjustment to the Great Recession

       Remembering that we measure country management quality by their values before the

2008 crisis and the economic shocks by size of the shock per industry in the USA in 2008, an

increase of the shock of x% in an USA industry in year(t) the current year corresponds on

average to an overall change of ( + 
                                     )  % % from 2007 to year (t) for our five

variables in the same industry of the non-USA countries.

       The parameters  of joint impacts of management quality and economic shocks are

significantly positive for value-added and employment, but not significantly different from zero

for labor productivity, real wage per worker and labor share. The implication is that the impacts

of managerial practices are higher in industries more exposed to the shocks of the Great

Recession than in the industries less exposed, as assumed in Rajan and Zingales (1998).

       Chart 6 presents these estimation results in terms of two box plots showing what are the

impacts of one standard error increase of country management quality on value-added and

employment changes in the years (2009, 2010, ..., 2015) compared to 2007 for industries where

the specific shocks are ranging from no shock to most important shocks.

       These results confirm that the detrimental medium to long-term impacts of the Great

Recession on industry-specific value-added and employment levels depend on the size of the

shocks, but that at the same time the positive indirect impacts of management quality on these

two variables are related to the size of the shocks. The bigger are the shocks, the larger are both

the direct detrimental impacts and the positive indirect impacts of management quality.

       These results could carry implications for the way countries are able to weather the

economic effects of the Covid-19 crisis, even if they crucially differ in many ways from the

impacts of the Great Recession. In particular, the Covid-19 crisis, combines an initial supply

shock with a later demand shock and it involves specific policy responses, centred on attempts

                                                21
to support employment levels and firms' solvency (e.g. via job retention schemes and state-

guaranteed loans). It remains that management quality could significantly alleviate the

destructive impacts of the Covid-19 crisis on employment and production.

Lecture note to box plots A and B: From our estimated results, the impact of one standard error
increase of the management quality on the value-added change in 2015 compared to 2007 would be -
1.9% in industries where the shock was nil, -0.2% for the first quartile of shock, +3.0% for the median
shock, +5.4% for the third quartile of shock and +8.7% for the most important shock.
From our estimated results, the impact of one standard error increase of the management quality on the

and +18.3% for the most important shock.


5. Country simulations
        Using our estimation results, we have run country simulations to assess the potentially

positive impacts on value-added and employment of a higher quality of management during the

Great Recession and the subsequent recovery. As a benchmark for management quality we took

that of the USA, which is the highest among the eight countries in our main study sample. For

each country, simulation results are thus driven by the country-specific size of the industry

shocks and the country-specific gap in management quality relative to the USA.


                                                   22
       Charts 7 present these simulation results for the year 2015, six years after the start of

the Great Recession, in terms of two plots for value-added and employment only, since

interaction between country management quality and economic shocks are not significant only

for our three other variables of interest.



Chart 7: Simulated impacts on country value-added and employment in 2015 for having
the USA management quality and industry shocks of different size


             A ­ Value-added                                        B ­ Employment




Lecture note to box plots: From our estimated results, the simulated impact of having the USA
management quality on the 2015 Spanish value-added level would have been nil in industries where the
shock was nil or quasi nil, +0.1% for the first quartile of shock, +0.2% for the median shock, +0.25%
for the third quartile of shock and +0.35% for the largest shock.




       According to our estimates, raising management quality in Spain to USA levels in 2007

would have improved the levels of value-added and employment by respectively 0.2% and

0.5% in 2015 for the median industry shock. Unsurprisingly, no improvement would have been

observed in Japan or Germany, where quality of management was very close to USA levels in

2007, and the other countries are in intermediate situations.

       Extrapolating from these results, the long-term impact of Covid-19 on value-added and

employment would depend not only on the importance of the pandemic (the size of the shock)


                                                 23
but also on the current quality of management. Thus Japan could suffer less than the other

countries from these two factors (softer shock and higher quality of the management), while

Spain could suffer more (harder shock and lower quality of the management) than the other

countries.



6. Conclusions
       There is an extensive economic literature on the effects of managerial talent on firm-

level outcomes, but research has been scant on how these translate into macroeconomic

aggregates. Moreover, research has focused mostly on medium to long-run effects, with little

attention to how managerial talent shapes economic resilience over the cycle and during

economic crises. Yet managerial talent is related to important institutional features such as the

competitive market environment, labor market flexibility, education systems and cultural and

historical heritage, which have been shown to contribute to economic resilience.

       This paper takes a first step towards looking at the link between prevailing managerial

practices in a country and its ability to weather serious economic shocks, possibly lessening

persistent effects on labor utilization and, therefore, productive potential. Taking a dynamic

estimation approach, we focus on the macroeconomic impact of managerial practices on

employment and production in a sample of OECD countries over the Great Recession,

measuring resilience by the ability of countries to limit industry level employment damages and

production losses. We show that countries that, on average, enjoyed a higher quality of

management have been able to do better regarding employment and production than other

countries. Interestingly, there is also evidence that this outcome was reached thanks to country

ability to moderate real wage growth and has also resulted in better overall outcomes in terms

of labor shares.




                                               24
       Our results, which are robust to several sensitivity tests, could have implications that go

beyond the Great Recession and inform analysts and policy-makers on the likely comparative

resilience of OECD economies to the current Covid-19 crisis and the importance of raising the

level of managerial abilities in view of possible future shocks. Clearly, the causes, intensity and

features of the Great Recession are crucially different than those of the Covid-19 crisis.

Moreover, the policies implemented to protect jobs and firms during the height of the Covid-

19 pandemic and considered in the context of the recovery plans differ also substantially from

those implemented in the aftermath of the Great Recession, as well as across countries. For

these reasons, the effect of management quality on macroeconomic outcomes could be

quantitatively different in the context of the Covid-19 pandemics and subsequent recovery. Yet,

we would expect them, to be qualitatively similar and act through comparable channels.

       While we consider our results informative and potentially insightful, we are also aware

of their limitations and that we have just scraped the surface of a promising research agenda.

Specifically, our approach to identification goes some way towards establishing potentially

causal links, but given the aggregate level of the analysis and the inherent limits in the data (as

well our treatment of them) more research will be needed to confirm our findings. Also, while

our sample covers countries with large differences in managerial abilities and macroeconomic

outcomes during the Great Recession, extending the country coverage to non-OECD countries

would be useful (once the data are available) to enhance our identification strategy. Moreover,

covering a longer period that includes shocks of a different nature, e.g. both demand and supply

driven, could also increase the external validity of our results. In the same spirit, it would be

interesting to check whether managerial abilities also affect macroeconomic outcomes during

expansionary periods. Finally, in our paper we have unveiled a link between managerial

practices and macroeconomic outcomes, but it would be desirable to go a step beyond and




                                                25
consider how this link is shaped by prevailing institutional settings (e.g. in labor and product

markets). We leave these interesting issues for future research.
