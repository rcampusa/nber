The Stock Market Crash of 2008 Caused the Great Recession: Theory and Evidence

                                              ABSTRACT

This paper argues that the stock market crash of 2008, triggered by a collapse in house prices, caused
the Great Recession. The paper has three parts. First, it provides evidence of a high correlation between
the value of the stock market and the unemployment rate in U.S. data since 1929. Second, it compares
a new model of the economy developed in recent papers and books by Farmer, with a classical model
and with a textbook Keynesian approach. Third, it provides evidence that fiscal stimulus will not permanently
restore full employment. In Farmer’s model, as in the Keynesian model, employment is demand determined.
But aggregate demand depends on wealth, not on income.

1    Introduction
This paper is about the relationship between the stock market and the un-
employment rate. It has three parts. First, I establish that there has been a
high correlation between unemployment and the stock market in U.S. data
since 1929. I use post-war quarterly data to estimate a bivariate time series
model of unemployment and the real value of the stock market and I show
that this model remained structurally stable before and after 1979.
    Second, I compare three simple theoretical models of the economy; a
classical model, a Keynesian model and a “Farmerian model”, based on a
series of recent books and papers (Farmer, 2008, 2009, 2010a,b,c,d, 2011). I
evaluate the ability of each of these models to explain the Great Recession
of 2008 and I argue that the Farmerian model provides the most plausible
explanation of events.
    Third, I explain why I have advocated (Farmer, December 30th 2008) a
policy of asset market intervention to restore full employment rather than a
traditional Keynesian policy of fiscal stimulus. I present some evidence which
shows that the Keynesian consumption function has not remained stable in
the post-war period and I explain that evidence by showing that increases
in government purchases since 1929 have been accompanied by oﬀsetting
changes in private consumption expenditure. The behavior of household
consumption is consistent with the work of Friedman (1957) who showed that
consumers respond to permanent income, or wealth, and not to transitory
income.
    My work explains why high unemployment can persist for long periods
of time. Although my explanation is rooted in Keynesian ideas, it goes
beyond The General Theory (Keynes, 1936) by providing an original micro-
founded explanation for labor market failure. Unlike the new-Keynesian
version of The General Theory, my explanation of recessions does not rely




                                      1
on the assumption that prices are sticky.1
    The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a brief review of
related literature. Sections 3, 4 and 5 present empirical evidence on the rela-
tionship between the stock market and unemployment in U.S. data. Section
6 evaluates that evidence in the light of three alternative economic models
and in Sections 7 and 8 I explain why I favor my approach over alternative
classical and Keynesian models. Section 9 provides a short conclusion.


2         Wealth and Unemployment in the Litera-
          ture
Much recent work in empirical macroeconomics analyzes data that have been
detrended with the Hodrick-Prescott filter (Hodrick and Prescott, 1997). Be-
cause it removes a diﬀerent trend from each series, the HP-filter masks an
important correlation between wealth and unemployment that operates at
low to medium frequencies. In my work, I detrend data by dividing nom-
inal consumption and nominal wealth by the money wage. The resulting
detrended consumption and wealth series are very persistent and highly cor-
related with unemployment. My focus in this paper is on this correlation.
    Empirical work by Lettau and Ludvigson (2004) found a low-frequency
connection between consumption and wealth and, in a recent extension of
their earlier work, Lettau and Ludvigson (2011) provide a statistical model
of consumption, wealth and labor earnings as non-stationary time series that
are cointegrated. In this paper I show that wealth and unemployment have
a similar representation as non-stationary cointegrated time series and I pro-
vide a theory that connects all of these pieces together.
    The connection between stock market wealth and unemployment was
recognized by Phelps (1999) who pointed out that the stock market boom of
    1
        Galí (2008) provides a good introduction to the new-Keynesian paradigm.

the 1990s was accompanied by a reduction in the unemployment rate. Fi-
toussi, Jestaz, Phelps, and Zoega (2000) found a similar correlation between
the stock market and unemployment for a variety of European countries. Fol-
lowing Phelps (1999) and Hoon and Phelps (1992), these authors explained
this connection using Phelps’ (1994) structuralist model of the natural rate of
unemployment. In Phelps’ model, expectations of future profits cause firms
to invest in customer relationships and employee training.
    In contrast, the theory I develop in this paper explains the connection
between stock market wealth and unemployment with a model of multiple
equilibria. In my work, any unemployment rate can be a steady state equi-
librium and changes in aggregate demand have a permanent eﬀect on the
equilibrium unemployment rate.2
    In the model I describe in this paper, labor is continually fired and rehired.
As a consequence of this simplifying assumption, the price of capital and
the value of the stock market are the same variable. In the data (see for
example the paper by Gomme, Ravikumar, and Rupert (2011)), they have
very diﬀerent time-series properties and the stock price is much more volatile
than the price of capital. In the full dynamic version of the model developed
in Farmer (2011), unemployment is a state variable of the firm, similar to
the capital stock. Here, the stock price will diﬀer from the price of capital.
It is an open question as to whether the more general model can replicate
the volatility of the stock price that we see in the data.
   2
     My explanation for persistent unemployment is closer to the models of hysteresis de-
scribed by Blanchard and Summers (1987, 1986) and Ball (1999) than the structuralist
model of Phelps although the theoretical foundation for persistent unemployment in my
work is very diﬀerent from the one provided in those papers. Models based on new-
Keynesian economics (see Galí and Gertler (1999)), cannot account for persistent unem-
ployment.

3       Wealth and Aggregate Demand
Tangible assets in the U.S. are held in the form of factories, machines and
houses. Factories and machines are equal to roughly three times GDP; resi-
dential real estate comprises an additional two times GDP.
    Figure 1 shows the history of these two components of tangible assets
beginning in the first quarter of 1929 and ending in the first quarter of 2011.
The stock market variable is the value of the S&P 500 divided by a measure
of the money wage. When a nominal series is detrended in this way I will
say that it is measured in wage units.3 The measure of housing wealth is my
own estimate, constructed as follows.
    I multiplied Shiller’s historical house price index by the U.S. population
and I divided it by the money wage. I multiplied the data by population
because I do not have a series on the housing stock for the entire period. My
estimate is based on the assumption that the ratio of people to houses was
constant.4
    To construct the wealth index reported in Figure 2, I took 0072 times my
housing wealth variable and I added it to 00052 times the S&P in wage units.
These weights were chosen to give a wealth index that is 25 housing and
35 stocks, and that has a mean of 100 over the period from 1929 through
2011. The proportions of 25 and 35 were chosen to match the proportions
of housing to other tangible assets in Federal Reserve Flow of Funds data.5
    3
     The use of wage units to detrend data is a novel technique that I developed and
explained in my book Expectations Employment and Prices Farmer (2010b). The money
wage increases because of growth in the real economy and because of inflation. Detrending
by the money wage removes both sources of growth and renders nominal series stationary.
   4
     Robert Shiller’s housing data are available quarterly from 1953q1 through 2011. Be-
fore that date I interpolated the annual series to provide quarterly estimates from 1929.
Shiller’s data are available at ‘http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/’.
   5
     I use the S&P as a measure of wealth because it is available back to 1929. My empirical
work is robust to the use of the measure of household wealth held as stocks reported in
the Federal Reserve Flow of Funds data. That measure moves closely with the S&P500 in
the post-war period.

    I want to draw attention to two episodes: the Great Depression and the
Great Recession. Figure 2 plots an index number of the real value of wealth
on the left axis against the unemployment rate on the right axis for data
during the Great Depression. This figure shows a strong correlation (the
correlation coeﬃcient is −088) between wealth and unemployment.
    Figures 3 and 4 illustrate the behavior of wealth and unemployment dur-
ing the Great Recession. I have reported housing and stock market wealth
separately for this period because the collapse of the real value of residen-
tial real estate was an important source of changes in aggregate demand. A
popular, and plausible account of these events, is that the collapse in house
prices caused the recession.
    The evidence in favor of this proposition is based on timing. The value
of residential real estate peaked in the second quarter of 2006 and unemploy-
ment began to increase six months later in the fourth quarter of 2006. The
stock market moved later, peaking in the third quarter of 2007.
    In my interpretation of these events, the values of houses, factories and
machines is determined by business and consumer confidence. In recent work
(Farmer, 2011) I have shown how an explosive asset price path can persist as
an equilibrium. In my view, the house price crash that began in 2006, was
triggered by a shift in beliefs. Households lost confidence in the sustainability
of continued house price increases and the economy shifted from a dynamic
equilibrium in which house prices were growing explosively, to a new steady
state equilibrium in which house prices are lower and unemployment higher.
This new steady state can potentially be sustained for ever.
    The fall in the value of residential and commercial real estate triggered
a secondary collapse in financial assets whose value was collateralized by
real estate wealth. The collapse in financial wealth triggered a stock market
crash and households sustained a large drop in permanent income. They
responded by increasing their savings and reducing consumption demand.
The reduction in demand caused businesses to lay oﬀ workers and it triggered


                                       7
a drop in business income that validated the initial collapse in confidence.
The 2008 financial crisis was a self-fulfilling prophecy.


4    The Stock Market and Unemployment Since
     WWII
The correlations between wealth and unemployment that I have reported
for the Great Depression and the Great Recession are interesting. But a
connection between wealth and unemployment that holds only during certain
decades is not one that provides a sound basis on which to build an economic
theory. We need to investigate more carefully, the connection between wealth
and unemployment over a longer time horizon. That is the purpose of this
section.

  I will focus here on the connection between unemployment and the stock
market. Although housing was an important factor in the 2008 recession,

                                                           8
house price declines did not precede any of the previous ten post-war re-
cessions and it was not until the stock market began to decline in October
of 2007 that the U.S. moved into recession. Stock price movements, on the
other hand, show a stable relationship with unemployment over the entire
post-war period.
    Figure 5 shows the relationship between unemployment and the stock
market from 1953q1 through 2011q1. I have taken the logarithm of the
S&P500, measured in wage units, and the logarithm of a logistic transfor-
mation of the percentage unemployment rate. These transformations lead
to new variables that are unbounded above and below. This an important
property since there is evidence that the two transformed variables are non-
stationary but cointegrated and in order for a series to be non-stationary
it must be able to increase or decrease without limit, independently of its
current value.

rithm of a logistic transformation of the percentage unemployment rate). The
left panel of this table reports regression results for the period from 1953q1
through 1979q3 and the right panel reports results from 1979q4 through
2011q1. Standard errors are in parentheses below each point estimate.
    I broke the data in 1979q3 because there is evidence that many macroeco-
nomic time series behave very diﬀerently before and after this date (Beyer and
Farmer, 2003, 2007; Clarida, Galí, and Gertler, 2000; Lubik and Schorfheide,
2004; Sims and Zha, 2006). Table 1 shows that instability does not extend to
the relationship between unemployment and the stock market. Both equa-
tions of this system display remarkable stability before and after 1979. For-
mal tests reveal that both series can be modeled parsimoniously as integrated
series of order 1, connected by a cointegrating equation.


5    How to Forecast Unemployment Using Stock
     Market Data
The equations describing the dynamics of unemployment and the stock mar-
ket have remained stable for sixty years. This fact has implications for the
ability to forecast future unemployment rates. Forecasts in the period after
1979q3 remain accurate using a forecast equation that was estimated on data
from 1953q1 through 1979q3.

    Equations (1) and (2) report the coeﬃcient estimates for the unemploy-
ment equation and the stock market equation using data from the first sam-
ple. These equations use the information that the series are non-stationary
but cointegrated to estimate equations in first diﬀerences with a cointegrating
equation in levels that enters each equation separately.6
    Equation (1) shows that changes in the unemployment rate are influenced
significantly by the lagged unemployment rate and lagged changes in the
stock market. Equation (2) shows that similar behavior applies to the S&P
500. There is evidence of serial correlation in the growth rate of both series.
Notice that the point estimate of the coeﬃcient on the cointegrating vector in
Equation (1) is significant and equal to −01, implying that unemployment
returns to the linear cointegrating equation,

                                  = 062 + 74                               (3)

at a rate of 10% per quarter. Although unemployment is non-stationary,
movements in the unemployment rate are tied to movements in the real
value of the stock market.

    These equations were estimated in Eviews using the methods developed by Johansen
(1991).

    The same is not true of the stock market which shows no tendency to
revert to the cointegrating vector represented by Equation (3). The coeﬃ-
cient on the cointegrating vector in the unemployment equation is five times
its standard error. In contrast, the coeﬃcient on the cointegrating vector in
the stock market equation is insignificantly diﬀerent from zero. Nevertheless,
Equation (3) constrains the long-run behavior of the system. Random walk
variations in the real value of the stock market cause permanent movements
in the unemployment rate.
    Figure 6 illustrates the importance of the stability of the connection be-
tween the unemployment rate and the stock market over time. This figure
plots the actual and one-step-ahead forecast values of the unemployment
rate.7 The forecast equation, Equation (1), was estimated using data from
1953q1 through 1979q3. Figure 6 demonstrates that the equation from the

over the second period.


6       The Stock Market and Unemployment: Three
        Models Compared
How are we to understand the connection between wealth and unemploy-
ment? In this section I will outline three simple models and use a diagram
that is suggested by The General Theory to explain each of them.


6.1     Classical Economics 101
6.1.1    The Classical Model Defined

Consider a model with a large number of identical representative households,
each of which lives forever. Households maximize the discounted value of
expected utility. Each period the representative household sends a random
fraction of household members to the labor market and each of these workers
finds a job that pays money wage  . I have added some randomness in labor
supply to capture a source of supply fluctuations in employment and GDP.
    Households receive utility from the consumption of a unique produced
commodity that is manufactured from labor and capital using a Cobb-Douglas
technology. There is one unit of non-reproducible capital in the economy.
Capital is owned by households and rented to firms for rental rate  , mea-
sured in dollars. The capital good is traded on an asset market for price 
and the commodity is traded for dollar price  .
    On Figure 7, I have graphed two of the equations of this model. The first
is the equation
                                 = exp ( )                           (4)

which determines employment. By assumption employment is entirely gov-


                                     13
erned by variations in labor supply and it appears on Figure 7 as a vertical
line.

where  is capital’s share of national income. This equation appears on
Figure 7 as an upward sloping line. This is an unusual way of representing
the equations of a classical model but I have chosen to draw this picture
because it enables me to make a direct comparison between classical and
Keynesian economics.
   The concepts of aggregate demand and supply were described by Keynes
(1936, Chapter 3) as two curves that plot the value of GDP, measured in wage
units, on the vertical axis of a graph and employment, measured in labor
hours, on the horizontal axis. Figure 7 makes clear that GDP, measured in
these units, is determined by aggregate labor supply.

                                    14
6.1.2   Implications of the Classical Model for Asset Price Move-
        ments

I would like to draw attention to one more implication of the classical model;
the connection between GDP and wealth. Simple versions of the classical
model imply the following asset pricing equation, where  is a parameter
that depends on the household’s discount rate and on the parameters of
technology,
                                    1  
                                      =                                   (6)
                                       
    I have expressed both sides of this equation in wage units by choosing 
as the numeraire. A similar pricing equation will hold in any model in which
forward looking agents have rational expectations of future prices. But what
are its implications for asset price movements?
    Suppose that we see a big drop in the value of the stock market. The
classical model would interpret that drop as a fall in   . What causes
the market to crash? In the classical model, the stock market falls in re-
sponse to a shock to fundamentals. These include preferences, technology
and endowments. In this simple version of the classical model, technology
and endowments are held fixed and it follows that a depression must be
caused by a fall in  .
    During the Great Depression, the U.S. unemployment rate climbed from
3% to 24% in the space of three years and it remained above 15% for a
decade. It was the implausibility of attributing this situation to a shock
to technology, preferences or endowments that caused Keynes to throw out
classical economics and to write The General Theory.

6.2     Keynesian Economics 101
6.2.1   The Keynesian Model Defined

The Keynesian explanation of the Great Depression breaks GDP,  , into
three components, consumption , investment  and government purchases
.
                             ≡  +  +                           (7)

Here I am measuring GDP and its components in wage units. Using this
normalization,  is equal to .
   In the simplest formulation of Keynesian theory, investment and govern-
ment purchases are taken to be exogenous, as represented by equations (8)
and (9),

                                        ¯
                                     =                                   (8)


                                     = ̄                                 (9)

and consumption depends on income,

                                  =  +                                (10)

Finally, Keynes added an inelastic labor supply curve in which each household
supplies a fixed number of hours, , to the labor market.
   In this simple model, labor’s share of GDP is a constant fraction, 1 − .
Using the definition of  as nominal GDP divided by the wage, this fact
implies the following linear relationship between  and ;

                                        1
                                  =                                      (11)
                                      1−
   In a classical model, equilibrium occurs at the intersection of the short-run
and long-run aggregate supply curves. Keynes dispensed with the classical


                                       16
assumption that households are on their labor supply curves. Removing this
condition implies that the long-run aggregate supply curve is a benchmark
that defines full employment. Equilibrium occurs at the intersection of the
short-run aggregate supply curve with the aggregate demand curve and the
horizontal distance from this intersection to the long-run aggregate supply
curve defines what Keynes called ‘involuntary unemployment’.

6.2.2    The Keynesian Explanation of the Great Depression

Keynesians explain the Great Depression as follows. There was an au-
tonomous drop in investor sentiment, caused by animal spirits, that led ¯
to fall thereby shifting down the aggregate demand curve in Figure 8. This
drop in investment led to an increase in the unemployment rate. The way to
restore full employment, according to Keynesians, is to increase government
purchases to replace the missing investment expenditure.
    Notice that Figure 8 contains three curves to determine the two un-
knowns; employment and GDP. This poses a dilemma which the post-war
Keynesians resolved by arguing that although the intersection of aggregate
demand and short-run aggregate supply determines employment and real
GDP in the short-run, in the long run, price and wage adjustment would
cause all three curves to intersect at the same point.
    The adjustment to full employment, according to the Keynesians, comes
about through an upward shift of the aggregate demand curve caused either
by an increase in investment expenditure or as a wealth eﬀect on consump-
tion.8 In either case, eventually, aggregate demand would intersect the ag-
   8
     The mechanics of adjustment is explained in intermediate economics textbooks, see
for example, Mankiw (2010). In “normal times” it involves a response of investment
to perceived changes in the real rate of interest. In periods when the interest rate is
eﬀectively zero (as it is in the current recession) this mechanism may be ineﬀective. There
is, however, an alternative adjustment mechanism that operates through a wealth eﬀect
on consumption. This eﬀect was pointed out by Don Patinkin in his seminal work, Money
Interest and Prices (1956), but it originated with Pigou’s (1943) article in the Economic
Journal.

gregate supply curve at full employment. I have labeled this as “long-run
aggregate supply” on Figure 8.

                     Figure 8: Keynesian Economics 101
   If the system is eventually self-adjusting then why would the government
need to intervene? The Keynesians argued that the price adjustment required
to restore full employment might take a very long time and would likely
involve considerable lost output if unemployment were to remain high for an
extended period. A more eﬀective remedy would be for government to replace
the lost investment by increasing government expenditure. This would shift
up the aggregate demand curve on Figure 8 and restore full employment
more quickly.


6.3       Farmerian Economics 101
6.3.1     Farmerian Economics Defined

In a series of recent papers Farmer (2009, 2010a, 2011) I have reinterpreted
The General Theory by going back to the classical model and adding an

                                       18
explicit theory of search. In that work I showed that, in a search market,
firms face an externality that alters the production function of an individual
firm. Suppose, for example, that output is produced by many firms each
operating the technology
                                 = 1−                              (12)

where  is output in physical units,  is capital,  is labor and  is a pro-
ductivity parameter. I showed in Farmer (2009), that labor market search
implies that the productivity parameter , is related to aggregate employ-
ment by the following expression,
                                    ¡       ¢1−
                                  = 1 − ̄                                    (13)
       ¡      ¢
where 1 − ̄ is the aggregate unemployment rate. All other aspects of my
model look very neoclassical. Profit maximizing firms take wages and prices
as given, but their productivity depends on aggregate labor market activity.
    Standard models of search assume that, when a firm meets a worker,
they bargain over the wage.9 I see no reason to add this equation to the
model and instead, I replace the Nash-bargaining equation by the assumption
that employment is demand determined. Firms sell as much output as is
demanded. By dropping the Nash-bargaining equation I arrive at a model in
which any unemployment rate is consistent with profit maximizing behavior
and rational forward looking households.

6.3.2   Closing Farmer’s Model with a Belief Function

The model I have developed can be closed in a number of ways. In most of
my work, I have used the representative agent assumption and it is that way
of closing the model that I have depicted in Figure 9.
    Since the asset pricing equation holds in my work, as it does in the clas-
  9
    See, for example, the survey of search literature by Rogerson, Shimer, and Wright
(2005).


                                         19
sical model, there is a connection between the value of asset prices and ag-
gregate GDP. I have depicted that relationship in Figure 9 as a horizontal
line whose position depends on the value of the stock market. Equation (14)
captures that connection.

                     Figure 9: Farmerian Economics 101

    Although Equation (14) is identical to Equation (6) from the classical
model, in my work the direction of causation is reversed. Whereas in the
classical model,  determines  , I assume instead that asset prices evolve
independently and are driven by self-fulfilling beliefs. I model the evolution
of those beliefs with an equation that I call the belief function.
    A simple form of the belief function that is consistent with the estimates
I reported in Equation (2) is described in equations (15) and (16).
                                   ∙          ¸
                                       +1
                                              ≡                            (15)
                                       +1

                     log  = log −1 +  (∆−1 ) +                    (16)

In these equations,  represents beliefs about the future real value of the
stock market. This variable is highly persistent and shocks to  are per-
manent. My formulation of the belief function also allows feedback from the
observed unemployment rate −1 to influence beliefs. The term  repre-
sents a random shock to beliefs that arises from the animal spirits of market
participants.

6.3.3   The Belief Function is Consistent with Rational Expecta-
        tions

It is important to recognize that Equation (15) is not an alternative to the
rational expectations assumption. It is in addition to it. The rational expec-
tations assumption is captured by equations (17) and (18),
                                        ∙      ¸
                                      
                                 = −1          +                       (17)
                                        

                                 −1 [ ] = 0                            (18)

The term  that enters Equation (16) is a fundamental shock to beliefs
whereas  is a non-fundamental forecast error. In a rational expectations
equilibrium,  will be a function of  as shocks to beliefs about the future
value of the stock market cause the  − 1 expectation of   to deviate
from its realization.
    How can beliefs be driven by an independent fundamental mechanism and
yet still be rational? One answer to this question is that the belief function is
an equilibrium selection mechanism that resolves a potential indeterminacy
of equilibrium by coordinating the expectations of agents. It represents what
George Soros has called the “mood of the markets”. Because there are many
underlying equilibria that are consistent with rational expectations, so there
are many possible belief functions that can select amongst these equilibria.

                                        21
I believe that a fruitful start to belief-driven models is to take the belief
function as an object to be determined empirically.

6.3.4      Farmer’s Model Compared to Keynesian Economics

The diagram that I have called Farmerian Economics 101 looks remarkably
like the Keynesian diagram, Figure 8. It diﬀers in two critical respects.
First, I have not represented the vertical full employment line on Figure 9
since it plays no role in my explanation of events. My work explains high
and persistent unemployment as an equilibrium phenomenon. There is an
optimum unemployment rate that is achieved by allocating workers between
the activities of search and production.10 But there is no tendency for the
model to converge back towards this optimal unemployment rate and it does
not make sense to talk about the natural rate of unemployment.
    The second diﬀerence of my model from Keynesian economics is that the
position of the aggregate demand curve does not depend on government ex-
penditure. It depends on the value of the stock market. I have chosen that
way of closing the model because my reading of the empirical evidence is
that private consumption is crowded out by government purchases. When
the government spends more, households spend less. In Farmer’s model, no
amount of government fiscal stimulus can permanently restore full employ-
ment.
    The word “permanently” is an important qualifier. I am not asserting
that fiscal stimulus is always ineﬀective. In joint work with Dmitry Plotnikov
(Farmer and Plotnikov, 2010), we showed that a temporary unanticipated
fiscal stimulus can reduce unemployment in the short run. But it cannot
solve the long-term problem. That requires private agents to revise their
forecasts of the values of houses, factories and machines. The key to restoring
full employment is to increase the real value of wealth and, in my view, that
can and should be achieved through direct government intervention in the

7      Why I am Not a Classical Economist
The fact that there is a relationship between unemployment and the value of
the stock market does not imply that this relationship is causal. It is diﬃ-
cult, if not impossible, to disprove the thesis that the stock market is simply
accumulating the knowledge of market participants. According to one clas-
sical interpretation of events that led to the Great Recession, traders in 2008
foresaw that there would be a big drop in dividend payments to private
companies as a consequence of high future unemployment. The anticipated
increase in unemployment was caused by a change in the regulatory environ-
ment which, it is asserted, became much more hostile to business following
the Lehman bankruptcy.
    That account is implausible. The change in the regulatory framework
since 2008 does not seem large enough to account for a permanent increase
in the unemployment rate of 5%. It is true that politicians in the U.S. and
Europe have added to the uncertainty, but the magnitude of the drop in
employment is hard to square with the explanation that firms are concerned
about possible future tax increases or the fear of an increase in bureaucratic
red tape.
    An alternative explanation of the crisis that is widely held by central
bankers is that firms are liquidity constrained.11 It was the liquidity con-
straint explanation of the recession that caused central banks throughout
the world to flood the financial system with cheap money. As a direct conse-
quence of Fed policy, U.S. businesses are now awash with credit and commer-
cial banks are holding in excess of $2,000b in excess reserves with the Federal
Reserve. In light of these facts, it seems unlikely that the unavailability of
  11
    This view has dominated Fed policy since the inception of the crisis. See for example,
the speech by Chairman Bernanke (2008).

credit is currently constraining U.S. corporations from creating jobs.


7.1    The Stock Market Crash of 2008 Caused the Great
       Recession
I believe that there is an alternative more credible explanation of the connec-
tion between stock market wealth and unemployment in which an apparent
liquidity crisis is a symptom, rather than the cause of the recession. That
explanation involves the shift from a high employment to a low employment
equilibrium as households and firms re-evaluated their beliefs about the value
of U.S. wealth.
    To make the case that a drop in stock market wealth can cause an in-
crease in the unemployment rate, there must be a plausible transmission
mechanism from one to the other. In my work, that mechanism operates
through aggregate demand.

    Keynesians draw attention to Okun’s law; a relationship between de-
trended real GDP and the unemployment rate. Figure 10 depicts Okun’s
law for post-war data. It plots GDP measured in wage units and the log of
a logistic transform of the unemployment rate for the period from 1953q1 to
2011q1.
    In Farmer’s model economics, Okun’s law holds in the data because move-
ments in the unemployment rate are caused by movements in aggregate de-
mand. It is the empirical counterpart of the aggregate supply curve in Figure
9. To construct an explanation of the causes of unemployment we must build
a theory of how each of the components of aggregate demand moves over time.

ernment purchases.12 Although there is some evidence of a high frequency
correlation between the stock market and investment, particularly in the two

   Even a large economy like the U.S. is not closed. But the size of net exports is relatively
small and I will ignore them in this discussion.

most recent recessions, investment fluctuations are not responsible for perma-
nent shifts in the unemployment rate. Investment, measured in wage units, is
a stationary series (Farmer, 2010b). Permanent shifts in the unemployment
rate are closely associated with permanent movements in consumption.
    Figure 11 shows the relationship between consumption and stock market
wealth in post-war data. Formal tests on these data confirm that the log
of consumption and the log of the S&P 500, both in wage units, are each
non-stationary but cointegrated.


7.2     Beliefs Drive Aggregate Demand
In my work, confidence, represented by Equation (16), is an independent
driving force of business cycles. I call Equation (16) a belief function: it
describes the way that households and firms form expectations of the future.13
The belief function is a fundamental that has the same methodological status
as preferences, technology and endowments. As agents revise their beliefs,
shocks to those beliefs influence the real value of wealth. A large negative
shock to beliefs results in a large drop in wealth that causes households
and firms to reduce their consumption expenditures. The drop in stock
market wealth also influences investors who will not purchase new factories
and machines if they believe that the value of their existing capital may fall
further.
    Beliefs are highly persistent and it is this persistence that accounts for
extended periods of high unemployment like the Great Depression and the
Great Recession. After a stock market crash, households reduce their con-
sumption expenditure. The associated fall in aggregate demand causes busi-
nesses to layoﬀ workers and that generates a further wealth eﬀect as newly
unemployed households experience a fall in the value of their expected future
  13
    I have described how a belief function can be used to close a macroeconomic model
in Farmer (2011). In (Farmer, 2010a) I incorporate a belief function into a fully specified
model of inflation, unemployment and interest rates and I estimate the model on U.S.
data.

earnings. There is a multiplier eﬀect, similar to the Keynesian multiplier, but
it operates through wealth and not through income.


8     Why I am not a Conventional Keynesian
      Economist
My skepticism for the Keynesian explanation of the multiplier is based on
empirical evidence. The Keynesian multiplier relies on the existence of a sta-
ble relationship between aggregate income and aggregate consumption. That
is the basis behind the Keynesian explanation of unemployment popularized
by Samuelson in his (1948) textbook. But the facts uncovered in research in
the 1950s and 1960s (Modigliani and Brumberg, 1954; Friedman, 1957; Ando
and Modigliani, 1963) show that consumption depends not on income but on
wealth.
    In their definitive survey of crowding out in macroeconomic models, Carl-
son and Spencer (1975) discuss the possibility that consumption may be
crowded out, in a classical model, as a consequence of the fact that GDP
is fully determined by preferences, endowments and technology. As govern-
ment increases its share of GDP, consumers recognize that the implicit value
of their future wealth has fallen since taxes must eventually rise to pay for
additional interest on the accumulated debt.


8.1    Beliefs are the New Fundamental
The same mechanism is at work in my model. GDP is determined by pref-
erences, technology and endowments. But in my work, beliefs appear as an
additional fundamental. Unless one of the four fundamental determinants of
aggregate demand changes in response to a change in government purchases,
another component of GDP must be crowded out.

    One is tempted to argue that this is an interesting curiosity. But what
is the evidence for crowding out in the data? The upper panel of Figure 12
plots real GDP on the horizontal axis and private consumption expenditure
on the vertical axis. The data is annual from 1929 through 2010 and both
series are expressed in wage units and have been divided by a measure of
the labor force. The regression line through these points has an 2 of 007.
The figure demonstrates that consumption as a function of income has not
remained stable over this period.
    The lower panel of Figure 12 plots real GDP on the horizontal axis against
a measure of consumption plus government purchases on the vertical axis.
The regression line on this panel has an 2 of 07. There is much more sup-
port for the stability of this relationship than for the Keynesian consumption
function in the upper panel.
    How is one to interpret these data? As a matter of definition, one can
attribute the instability of the consumption function to shifts in the intercept;
the parameter ‘’ in Equation (10). The fact that the  +  function on the
lower panel of the figure remains relatively stable, implies that increases in
 are oﬀset by corresponding reductions in ‘’. It is a short step to argue
that consumers chose to increase their saving in response to an increase in
government purchases and it follows that an increase in government spending
is unlikely to be an eﬀective way of restoring aggregate demand.


9     Conclusion
The General Theory was an important book that had a profound impact on
the way that we perceive the role of government in the economy. It intro-
duced the idea that market economies are not inherently self-stabilizing and
it suggested new regulatory mechanisms to help maintain full employment.
In my view, that basic idea is correct. But The General Theory was a work
in progress and the details were never worked out either by Keynes himself


                                       29
or by his successors.
    In the late 1970s the economics profession gave up on Keynesian eco-
nomics. Our disenchantment occurred for a reason. The occurrence of high
inflation and high unemployment together was inconsistent with the way
that post-war Keynesians interpreted Keynesian economics. But that in it-
self would not have been enough to cause the paradigm shift that was ushered
in with the rational expectations revolution (Lucas Jr., 1972). There was a
fundamental theoretical incompleteness in the The General Theory. Keynes
did not provide a microeconomic foundation to his decision to discard the
classical labor supply equation. My work does.
    After WWII, Keynesian economics became synonymous with the idea
that prices are sticky. That view was introduced to several generations of
economists who were schooled on Paul Samuelson’s 1948 textbook. My work
provides an alternative reconciliation of Keynesian economics with micro-
economic theory. My interpretation of Keynesian economics does not rely
on sticky prices. That, in itself, does not invalidate the Keynesian policy
conclusion that deficit spending is the right way to restore full employment.
One could accept my explanation of the reasons for unemployment but still
believe that a large fiscal expansion is the right way to solve the problem.
I have rejected that approach because of my interpretation of the evidence
provided by Friedman (1957) in his work on permanent income.
    Friedman argued that individuals are forward looking in their behavior
and that consumption depends not on transitory income, but on permanent
income or wealth. That fact has important implications for the ability of
fiscal policy to influence economic activity since it implies that government
spending will crowd out an equal amount of private spending. My reading
of the evidence is that crowding out occurs in practice and it is that feature
of the data that leads me to stress asset market intervention as a potential
policy resolution to the problem of high and persistent unemployment.
