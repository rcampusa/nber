                                     Abstract

      The standard result in macroeconomic   models is that an increase in the
stock   of government debt has an ambiguous effect on aggregate demand. Models

which have derived this result have assumed that all assets are gross sub-

stitutes. Some recent work within the framework of mean—variance portfolio

models, however, seems to imply that the assumption that all assets are

gross substitutes is sufficient to determine whether an increase in govern-

ment debt is expansionary or contractionary.

      This apparent inconsistency is resolved by showing that gross substi-

tutability is sufficient to sign the impact of a change in government debt

only when money is riskless.

      To carry out the analysis, portfolio choice and equilibrium asset prices

are   characterized in a new way through the use of a distance function.

I. Introduction
        Two recent articles by Blanchard and Plantes [1977] and Roley
[1979] reach conclusions which, if taken together, appear to be
inconsistent with a large body of literature in macroeconomics on
the impacts of changes in the stock of government debt. A standard

assumption made in macroeconomic models with several financial assets
is that all assets are gross substitutes. Blanchard and Plantes

show that, in an intertemporal capital asset pricing model, a necessary
condition for all assets to be gross substitutes is that the
covariance between the future prices of any two assets be positive.

Roley presents a model in which he demonstrates that the sign of the
change in the price of asset i when the quantity of asset j           is

changed is determined by the sign of the covariance between the future
prices of assets i and j .     Hence, taking these two results
together, the assumption that assets are gross substitutes is, in
Roley's model, sufficient to determine the direction in which the price
of asset i changes when the quantity of asset j     is varied.

        On the other hand, a standard result of macroeconomic models
which assume assets are gross substitutes is that even neglecting
feed-back effects from the real sector we cannot, in general,

determine which way the price of asset i will move if the quantity
of asset j is changed (Tobin [1963], Park [1972], Cohen and
McMenamin [1978]). In particular, the impact of a change in the
stock of government debt on equity prices or long-term bond prices
is ambiguous. This is in apparent conflict with the results of
Blanchard and Plantes and Roley.
                                                                                 2.



          The purpose of this paper is to reconcile these results.

To do so, in Section II the investorTs portfolio choice problem is
formulated in terms of the distance function. This provides a
convenient framework for analyzing changes in asset stocks in terms

of substitution effects.           It is shown that restricting only the

signs of the substitution effects among assets is not sufficient to

determine the sign of                     ,    the change in asset    jt price
when the stock of asset j           is changed. Section III makes use of
the mean-variance approach of Roley to derive the explicit form of

the   distance function and to show that, in general, assuming assets are sub-
stitutes or complements, in the sense defined in this paper, does not impose a restric-
tion on the covariances of their future prices nor does signing the covariances
allow us to sign dp/dq .             In       Section IV, Roley's results are

shown to be an implication of his assumption that money is a riskiess
asset, The intuitive reasoning behind the failure of Roley's
conclusions to generalize to the case in which money also involves
risk due to uncertainty about future inflation is briefly discussed.

Section V summarizes the paper.



II, Asset Stock Changes and Portfolio Equilibrium
          Suppose the problem faced by the individual investor is to

choose a portfolio allocation in order to maximize a continuously
differentiable concave function of the mean and variance of next

period's wealth, U(E(W),cy2(W)).                   If q1 denotes the number of

units   of asset i , i    =   1,   ...,       n,   in the individual's portfolio,
                                                                            3.



we have E(W) =          z         =    .i'q and 2(w) = q'q where
                 =
                      i'"'n           = vector of expected next period   asset prices
           q' =      (q1,...,q)
           E =              = variance   covariance matrix of next period

                             asset prices.
The maximization of u(.) is carried out subject to the wealth
constraint
            to =W0 =pq
           pg
where p' =       (l,p2,...,pfl)        is the vector of current asset prices

normalized on the price of asset 1 , and               q° is the vector of
initial asset holdings.
           Corresponding to this portfolio allocation problem we can
define the distance function (Deaton [1979a], E1979b], Walsh [1980])
           d(u,q) = max fX: U(I"q/x, (q'/?)z(q/x)) > uJ


Given a portfolio q ,           d(u,q)     tells us by how much we must proportion-

ately blow up or shrink q in order to leave the individual with
utility equal to u .            The function d(u,q) is continuous, first

and second differentiable, decreasing in u , and increasing in q
in the neighborhood of the optimal portfolio. Also, d is
homogeneous of degree one in q .               Since we must have d(u,q) a 1
when q is the portfolio actually held by the individual, we can
use the distance function to implicitly characterize the dependence

of utility on asset holdings. This allows us to express the optimal
portfolio allocation as the solution to the following maximization

problem:
(1)        max u + ?.1[l-d(u,q)]                +
                                                     2[p'(q°      -

           u,q
        First order conditions for (1) are given by

Multiplying both sides by q and summing over i yields

(6)      1 = Eqd1             =       - 2dEpq    =   -

where we have used (Li-) and the homogeneity of the distance function.
Substituting (6) into (5):

(7) d = Pt/P to
             q


Equation (7) implies that d1 ,                      evaluated     at d(u,q) =   1,    is
equal    to the price of asset i relative to initial wealth. This
means that given a vector of asset holdings q , we can use (7)
to determine the vector of asset prices relative to initial wealth

which would induce theindividual to hold the portfolio q

equations as


(8) d/di P1
by   using the fact that d1 =      1/p 'q°
      We will now assume that      we can aggregate equation (8) over
all individuals to obtain a similar expression that applies at
the market level. Given the stock of assets in the economy then,
we can use (8) to determine a vector of asset prices which would
induce individuals to hold that stock of assets.

      Suppose now that there is a small change in the quantity of
the kth asset. This will throw portfolios out of equilibrium
and asset prices will have to adjust to re-establish portfolio

equilibrium. The required change in p1 can be found by
differentiating equation (8):

      In order to evaluate equation (9), note that djk is equal
to the change in the marginal valuation of asset i in response
to a change in the quantity of asset k ,            holding     utility
constant. It thus corresponds to a substitution effect, defined
however in terms of quantity changes rather than price changes.
If an extra unit of asset k reduces the value of an extra unit

                             <   0 and i and k are called q-substitutes.
                                       k are q-complenients (Hicks [1956],
Deaton [1979a]).
          The second term in (9) involves the change in the marginal
valuation of an asset as the level of utility changes. This can
be interpreted as a wealth effect arising from the change in
If   preferences   are homothetic, we can write d.(u,q) =
                                                                 g(u)f(q)   in which

case   (d/d) - (di/d1) = 0 and the wealth effect

                                            1

          From equation (9') it immediately follows that even when wealth effects are

ignored,assuming all assets are           q—substitutes   (q—complements), that is, assuming that

all            are negative (positive), is not sufficient to determine
the sign of the change in the ith asset price in response to a
change in the quantity of the kth asset. We need to know the
substitutability of asset i for asset k relative to the
substitutability of asset 1 for asset k in order to determine
the sign of dp1/dq
          For example, suppose p1 is the price of equities,
the quantity of government debt, and asset 1 is money. Then
an increase in government debt is expansionary in the sense of
increasing the price of equity if and only if government debt
and money are closer q-substitutes than are government debt and

equities. This result is usually expressed in terms of substitution
                                                                                       7



effects defined with reference to price, not quantity, changes (for example,

see Tobin [1963], Cohen and McMenamin [1978], Friedman (1978].

       In the next section we will make use of our assumption that utility

depends only upon the mean arid variance of next period's wealth in order

to derive an explicit expression for d. .              Blanchard and Plantes' [1977]
result that positive covariances between asset returns are a necessary

condition for all assets to be gross p-substitutes is shown not to carry

over   to the q—substitutes case. Assuming assets are q—substitutes or

q—complements places no restrictions on the covariances of future asset

prices. Equation (9) for the mean-variance model will be derived to

show that, contrary to Roley's results, the sign of dp./dq. cannot

be determined solely by the sign of a..

From equation (13) it is apparent that an assumption about the sign of

dik imposes no restriction on the sign of Y.k. In Walsh (1980] it was

argued that our standard stories about the transmission process of monetary

policy   are implicitly           based upon the assumption that assets are q—comple—

ments. For example, an increase in the supply of money leaves individuals

with "too much" money in their portfolios. This sets off a substitution

process of portfolio allocation as individuals attempt to increase their

empirical evidence that                  >   0   for bonds and equities; the expected future

price of money is approximately equal to one minus the expected rate of infla-

tion so we might expect elk > 0 where asset k is government debt. A priori,

the sign of            -              cannot be determined. Loosely speaking, government

debt will be expansionary if bond prices are more closely correlated with the

inflation rate than they are with equity prices.

IV.    The Role of Money as a Riskless Asset

       As is well known (Cass and Stiglitz [1970]), mean variance

portfolio models with a riskiess asset have the property that we

can separate the portfolio problem into two parts. In the first,
investors determine the optimal proportions in which to hold the
risky assets. In the second, investors decide how much of their
wealth to invest in risky assets. Market equilibrium requires
that the proportions in which the risky assets are held as
determined in the first part of the portfolio problem equal the

proportions in which the risky assets appear in the market.
Current asset prices adjust in order to insure that this equilibrium
requirement is satisfied. Relative prices of the risky assets
are thus determined independently of the riskless asset. When
money is the riskiess asset then, a change in the supply of money
has no effect on the relative prices of the remaining assets:
                               a11-a.ii.                   -   a.

since lk =        0,     k = 1,    .   ., n   if money is riskiess.
     Equation (16) means that the marginal rate of substitution of
asset i for asset j (i, i = 2,...,n) is independent of the quantity

of money along an indifference curve. This implies that we can write the
distance function in the form d(u,q) = b(u,q1,                 4     ,u)) where
               and the function b is homogeneous of degree 1                in q1 and • while • is

homogeneous of degree one in q .                         Differentiating   the distance

function with respect to the asset stocks we have

             d = b1(u,q.      ,   4>)




(17b)        d b24>(q ,u) ,             i   =       2,...,n,

where        b1 =   b/1           and b2 =                       .   For risky assets, the
marginal rate of substitution between assets             is given              i and j
by                independent of              The marginal rate
of substitution between money and any risky asset is given by
b1/b2
        To find the equilibrium prices of the risky assets, we can

divide equation (im) by                         (   17a) to obtain

 18) p = d / d1           =
                              b2/b1,
The change in p that results from a change in the quantity of
asset        k is then equal to
               =                                                       -
                   (b2/bl)jk            +
                                            (b2/b1)[(b22/b2)               (bl2/bl)Jjk
 19) = (b2/bl)jk
where the bracketed expression is zero by the homogeneity properties
of b
        In   the mean-variance model with money treated as a riskiess
asset, equation (19) is equivalent to equation (15) with                                       =   = 0:

(20)     i'.c        =
                         (b2/bl)jk                   =

Equation (20) is identical to the expression Roley E1979]
derives with the exception that he assumes                           =   I    .     It   follows
immediately that the sign of                                 is uniquely determined by
the sign of
        When there is risk associated with the holding of money, we

can no longer treat money asymmetrically in analyzing the portfolio
allocation problem. Money does retain one unique feature though;
we have normalized asset prices so that p1 = 1.                              It is this

normalization rule, along with the riskiness of money, which

destroys the simple form of equation (20). Suppose for example,
that a rise in                     requires, for equilibrium to be re-established,
that all asset prices rise relative to k •                          Since         p1     is fixed,
       must fall if l'k is to rise. Hence, knowing that
must rise does not imply that p itself will rise. What happens
to          =
                P/P    will depend, in general, upon the correlation

of asset k's future price with asset i's future price relative
to the correlation of asset k's future price with the future

price of money. This is exactly what equation (is ) shows.                                  In

the special case considered by Roley, money is riskless and the
response of asset prices to a change in                            takes a very special
form. For i =          2,...,n,                                =
                                                                         k        where

depends upon ik and                               is the same for all i.          On the other
                                        =          Hence,

             ak   -
                      'k       +
                                   k   ik
and the sign of                        is determined once ik is known.
                                                                13



     Finally, Blanchard and Plantes show that a necessary
condition for all assets to be gross substitutes is that             > 0
for all i, k =      2,...,n.   (They also assume money is riskiess.)
They prove this assertion by considering the relationship between
partial correlation coefficients, but their result follows directly
from the fact that in their model the matrix of substitution

effects among the risky assets is proportional to -V1 where
V is the n-i x n-i subrnatrix of E (the variance covariance
matrix of q) obtained by deleting the first row and column since
money is assumed riskless. If all assets are gross substitutes,
the diagonal      elements of -V1   are negative while the off-diagonal
elements    are   all positive. In addition, the sum of each row is
negative. By an application of Theorem I. in McKenzie [1959],
all the elements of (vY1 = V are positive, and, hence, a
necessary condition for all assets to be gross substitutes is
that Cik > 0 for all assets i and k.


V. Summary
     The analysis in this paper has been carried out largely in
terms of substitution effects defined with reference to quantity
changes    rather than price changes. For studying the impacts of
a change in the quantity of an asset this seems a natural way to

define substitutes and complements. It has been shown that
Blanchard and Plantes' result does not carry over to the case in
which assets are q-cornplements, the assumption implicitly made

in most discussions of the transmission process of monetary policy.

The assumption of q—complementarity does not impose restrictions on the sign of

ik
       was shcn that Roley's conclusion that the sign of °ik
        It

determined the sign of dp/dq holds only when money is treated
as a riskiess asset. In      general, the sign of dp/dq depends
upon    the relative complementarity of assets i, j    money. This

result, unlike Roley's is consistent with standard macroeconomic
analyses     of the impact of changing the size of the government's

debt.
