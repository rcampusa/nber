                                         ABSTRACT

Severe environmental shocks have grown in frequency and intensity due to climate change. Can
policy protect against the often devastating human impacts of these shocks, particularly for
vulnerable populations?We study this question by leveraging data from a situation in which a
tornado tore through an area involved in a double-blind cluster-randomized controlled trial of at-
birth vitamin A supplementation in Bangladesh. Tornado exposure in utero and in infancy
decreased birth size and physical growth, and increased the incidence of severe fevers. But
infants who received vitamin A supplementation, which boosts immune system functioning, were
protected from these effects. Tornado impacts and protective effects were both substantially
larger for boys. Our results suggest that wide-scale supplementation policies would generate
potential health benefits in disaster-prone areas of low-income countries.

1        Introduction

A child’s environment in early childhood shapes her survival and wellbeing in profound ways

(Almond and Currie, 2011; Currie, 2000; Heckman, 2007). Shocks to this environment are all

too common and can create life-long disadvantage in terms of health and economic wellbeing,

especially in low-income contexts (Currie and Vogl, 2013). Natural disasters in particular take an

enormous toll on the survival and wellbeing of children. From 1996 to 2015, natural disasters

were responsible for 1.35 million deaths; the vast majority of this impact was borne by low-

and middle-income countries (CRED/UNISDR, 2016). Can policy intervention effectively protect

vulnerable populations, especially young children, from the negative impacts of these shocks? Can

such intervention help those who have been affected to recover?

        Answering this set of questions rigorously is not straightforward. Governments, international

organizations, and NGOs invest billions of dollars annually to aid recovery efforts in communities

affected by natural disasters (Linnerooth-Bayer et al., 2005). Measuring the effectiveness of these

investments entails identifying both the causal effects of a natural disaster as well as the causal

mitigation effects of a particular investment. While it is plausible that exposure to some types of

environmental shocks is as good as random, measures taken to buffer against negative impacts –

and, analogously, measures to mitigate impacts once shocks occur – are likely not random at all;

they are deliberate choices made by households, communities, relief organizations, and governments.

Comparing outcomes after a shock across different levels of investment would typically yield biased

estimates of the protective or remediating effects of that investment.

        The aim of this study is to identify these effects by leveraging a unique situation in which

a natural disaster affected several areas of northwest Bangladesh that were involved in a large

double-blind cluster-randomized controlled trial (RCT) of newborn vitamin A supplementation.

The RCT was evaluating the public health impacts of a large, one-time oral dose of vitamin A

immediately after birth on infant health and survival.1 As reported previously, this newborn

vitamin A supplementation reduced infant mortality to six months of age by 15% (Klemm et al.,
    1
     The newborn supplementation trial was actually nested into a larger trial evaluating the impacts of vitamin A and
beta-carotene supplementation for pregnant mothers (Labrique et al., 2011). No impacts of prenatal supplementation
on serum retinol (a biomarker of vitamin A deficiency) or maternal or infant health and mortality were found in this
trial (West et al., 2011). The treatment was orthogonal to both the newborn supplementation treatment as well as
to tornado exposure.



                                                          2
2008). The primary biological mechanism for this mortality reduction is vitamin A’s crucial role

in the development and functioning of infants’ immune systems.2

      On March 20, 2005, while the RCT was ongoing, a tornado tore through the study area,

generating substantial property damage in 1007 of the 14893 households with live births in our

sample; killing 56 people; and injuring nearly 4000 (Gunnsteinsson et al., 2010; Sugimoto et al.,

2011). The quasi-random “selection” of localities by the tornado, all of which were participating in

the RCT and thus being longitudinally followed, allows for the assessment of effects on birth size

(for infants exposed to the stress of the tornado in utero) and post-natal stress outcomes such as

growth faltering and severe illness, both of which were being evaluated as part of the ongoing trial.

The overlap in tornado exposure and RCT treatment status – both treatment and control localities

were affected in a balanced way – enables us to estimate the remediating (for infants exposed to

the tornado while in utero) and protective (for infants exposed after birth) effects of vitamin A

supplementation on anthropometric and survey-based outcomes for infants at 0-6 months. We

detail the identification assumptions necessary to obtain unbiased estimates of these effects, and

provide empirical support for each of these assumptions.

      In utero exposure the tornado increased the probability of low birth weight (< 2.5kg) by 8

percentage points (15% on the mean), and decreased birth length by half a centimeter. In control

localities, tornado in the first three months of life had large negative impacts on mid-upper arm

circumference (a reliable correlate of child mortality) and the incidence of severe fevers measured

at both 3 and 6 months. But in treatment localities, in which all infants were dosed with vitamin

A at birth, these impacts are nonexistent. These effects are entirely driven by impacts on boys;

girls are largely unaffected by the tornado, even in control areas. The results are not driven by

differential rates of miscarriage, stillbirth, or attrition from the sample after birth.

      Environmental shocks can have devastating short- and long-run effects (Cas et al., 2014; Currie

and Rossin-Slater, 2013; Frankenberg et al., 2008, 2011; Hornbeck, 2012; Karbownik and Wray,

2016). Moreover, these shocks will likely grow in frequency and intensity due to climate change,

disproportionately affecting climate-vulnerable populations in low-income countries (Burke et al.,
  2
   Vitamin A is vital to the proper functioning of neutrophils, macrophages, and natural killer cells – essential
components of the body’s immune system. It also helps prevent infections by maintaining epithelial integrity
(Thurnham et al., 2000) and restores innate immunity after infection by promoting the normal regeneration of
mucosal barriers (Stephensen, 2001).



                                                       3
2015). Insidious exposures (for example, to air pollution or heat stress) can have sizable long-

run impacts as well – particularly for exposures at critical periods of fetal and early childhood

development – and impacts that are generated early in infancy tend, if not corrected, to persist over

the life cycle (Almond and Currie, 2011; Almond et al., 2017; Currie and Vogl, 2013). Measuring

these early impacts, and evaluating the role for specific interventions that might mitigate negative

effects so that they do not result in persistently poor health stocks, is therefore critically important

from both the academic and policymaking perspectives. Our contribution to this space is to

demonstrate that it is possible to substantially dampen the impacts of exposure to a severe shock

via vitamin A supplementation, which both reduces the probability of early infection and decreases

the extent to which infections translate into slower physical growth.

   We also contribute to the literature on the early formation of health and human capital (Almond

and Currie, 2011; Heckman, 2006, 2007). Learning how to protect children from the negative

consequences of early life shocks is an essential undertaking for academics and policymakers alike

(Currie and Vogl, 2013). The question of protecting infants from shocks via supplementation

relates to the shape of the human capital production function: do early investments (or shocks)

complement or substitute for each other (Almond and Mazumder, 2013; Cunha et al., 2010)? In

line with what we find, several recent studies from diverse contexts suggest that substitution (in

these cases, protection against early life disadvantage) seems to prevail (Adhvaryu et al., 2015;

Bitler et al., 2014; Rossin-Slater and Wüst, 2015).

   Finally, our findings are also relevant in context of the renewed focus on curbing rates of

infant mortality in low-income countries (Bhutta et al., 2013, 2012). Despite significant progress

over the last decade (Lozano et al., 2011), more than 3 million children still die each year from

“preventable” causes (Liu et al., 2015). This study suggests a vital role for vitamin A as protection

against the risk of mortality from the increasingly devastating effects of natural disasters (Field,

2012). Our analysis therefore highlights that differences in natural disaster risk by location may be

an important factor to consider when interpreting the range of estimated impacts from newborn

vitamin A supplementation observed in different contexts. As such, our results suggest that wide-

scale supplementation policies would generate potential health benefits in disaster-prone areas of

low-income countries.

   The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides background on the Bangladeshi

details assumptions needed to identify treatment effects, and reports on tests of those assumptions.

Section 4 reports the main results, and section 5 concludes.



2        Context, RCT, and Tornado

2.1       Vitamin A and Infant Mortality Declines

In vitamin A-deficient contexts, supplementation at birth can reduce infant mortality (Haider and

Bhutta, 2011; Klemm et al., 2008). Multiple randomized trials of infant vitamin A supplementation

in South Asia have found a reduction in infant mortality in excess of 10% (Haider and Bhutta, 2011;

Humphrey et al., 1996; Klemm et al., 2008; Mazumder et al., 2015; Rahmathullah et al., 2003).3

This includes the trial we study, which found a 15% reduction. We hypothesize that this reduction

is due in part to the ability of vitamin A to prevent or mitigate the impacts of shocks that the

infant experiences either in utero or shortly after birth. Vitamin A supplementation in post-infancy

(6 months to 5 years) has been shown to improve child survival based on evidence from a wide

variety of contexts (Keith P. West Jr, 1996).

        Rates of infant and child mortality in Bangladesh have declined dramatically over the last

3 decades. Between 1980 and 2015 infant mortality fell from 137 to 31 per thousand and child

mortality from 198 to 38 per thousand (Wang et al., 2014). Still, the survival and health of

Bangladeshi children lies well below the global mean, with the majority of neonatal and infant deaths

due to treatable causes such as diarrheal disease and pneumonia (Liu et al., 2015). Micronutrient

deficiencies are common in the Bangladeshi setting, and leave infants vulnerable to a variety

of potentially mortal “insults.”      In a recent comprehensive review of the medical and public

health literature, Bhutta et al. (2013) cite the potential gains from large-scale micronutrient

supplementation – in particular, with vitamin A, iron/folic acid, and zinc – in low-income countries.
    3
   Similar effects have not been observed in Sub-Saharan Africa (Bhutta et al., 2013), for reasons that remain
unknown.

2.2   RCT Design

The RCT we study was part of a nested double-blind placebo-controlled cluster randomized trial

of maternal and newborn vitamin A supplementation in Bangladesh, conducted from 2001 to 2007.

In the maternal trial there was also an arm providing β-carotene. These trials and the tornado

survey referred to below were all approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Bloomberg

School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, and the Ethics Committee of the Bangladesh

Medical Research Council. Each of the trials was pre-registered at clinicaltrials.gov; Identifiers:

NCT00198822 (maternal trial) and NCT00128557 (infant trial). These trials are part of the JiVitA

Bangladesh international nutrition research project on maternal and child health. Both trials were

conducted in a contiguous 435 square kilometer area in northwest Bangladesh, in Rangpur Division,

with an estimated population of about 600,000. The study site is typical of rural Bangladesh, lying

at approximately the 35th percentile of the distribution of economic and quality of life indicators

among rural areas in Bangladesh. See Figure A1 for a representation of the study’s location within

South Asia and Bangladesh. We direct the reader to Labrique et al. (2011) for a more detailed

discussion of the study area and how it relates to the context of rural Bangladesh.

   The study area was subdivided into 596 sectors, each of which was populated with 107 to

377 households at baseline. These sectors were randomized using a 3 x 2 cluster randomized

factorial design with three different groups for pregnant women and 2 groups for their newborn

children. The 3-group randomization (maternal trial) used a geographic block randomization, which

is described in detail in West et al. (2011). The 2-group randomization (infant trial) was also done

by geographic block randomization, where each block was defined within one of the three earlier

groups, as described in Klemm et al. (2008).

   All married women in the study area in 2001 (totaling 102,769) and newlywed women (during

the study, totaling 27,711), ages 13-45, were surveilled for pregnancy. In total, 60,294 pregnancies

were identified and, if consent was given (>99% of cases), the pregnant woman was enrolled in

the maternal supplementation study. The infant trial was nested within the maternal trial and

was conducted between January 2004 and December 2006. A total of 15,937 infants received

supplementation or placebo directly at birth or shortly thereafter and were followed until 6 months

after birth.



                                                 6
   The two treatment groups in the maternal trial received the recommended weekly allowance of

vitamin A, either in the form of vitamin A or β-carotene (which the body converts into vitamin

A), as weekly supplements from first trimester through 12 weeks postpartum, while the control

group received a placebo supplement. Live-born infants in each sector were randomized to receive

either 50,000 IU of vitamin A or a placebo once as oral oil drops from a capsule shortly after birth

(International Units: 50,000 IU are equivalent to 15,000 µg retinol (U.S. Department of Agriculture,

2011). Adequate intake, based on a diet of breast milk from a healthy mother, is 400 µg retinol

equivalent per day (Institute of Medicine , US)). For further information on field procedures and

other details, we refer the reader to Labrique et al. (2011), West et al. (2011) and Klemm et al.

(2008).

   In this paper we focus the analysis solely on the newborn supplementation trial. As previously

reported, the maternal supplementation with vitamin A or β-carotene in this context had no

impact on maternal, fetal, or infant mortality (West et al., 2011), nor on gestational length or

birth anthropometry (Christian et al., 2013). The at-birth supplement, in contrast, had substantial

impacts on mortality: mortality at 6 months was 15 percent lower for infants who were supplemented

with vitamin A at birth compared to those supplemented with placebo (Klemm et al., 2008).

Consistent with these overall trial findings, we find that at-birth vitamin A supplementation

promotes resilience in infancy. In a set of analyses not reported here, we do not find any protective or

mitigating effects of maternal supplementation, in line with the lack of main effect of this treatment

on mortality.


2.3   Tornado Event

On the night of March 20th, 2005, a tornado swept through Gaibandha District, affecting about

7% of the study area (Sugimoto et al., 2011) (see top left panel of Figure S3). Between August

and October 2005 each household in the affected areas was visited by a survey enumerator, who

asked questions on mortality and morbidity of household members as well as damage to homes

as a result of the tornado. Based on this survey, the tornado resulted in 56 deaths, injured 3,710

people, and destroyed 3,540 houses (Sugimoto et al., 2011). Out of 596 study sectors, at least one

house was destroyed in 41 sectors, and in 24 sectors more than 20% of houses were destroyed. Our

evidence suggests that the tornado had no effect on the timing of supplementation or anthropometric

                                                   7
measurement and surveying. For instance, among infants in their second or third trimesters in utero

during the tornado, those in the tornado area were supplemented within 24 hours at the rate of

73.5% while those outside of this area were dosed at the rate of 72.5%. Birth anthropometry for

this same population was obtained within 7 days in the tornado area at the rate of 84.5% and

outside this area at the rate of 83.9%. These differences are small and not statistically different

from 0. In Figure S2, we show balance in tornado damage intensity across vitamin A and placebo

areas, statistically confirmed via a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.



3     Research Design

3.1   Defining the Sample, Cohorts and Tornado Exposure

We include all infants in the infant supplementation trial (all infants that the study intended to dose,

whether they were ultimately dosed or not) for whom consent was obtained for supplementation

(> 99%), save for 154 observations for which we do not have data on the date of the last menstrual

period (and are therefore unable to construct our exposure cohorts in the same way as for other

observations). After these adjustments, the final sample is 19,033 live births.

    To define tornado exposure we approximate the path of the tornado based on damages to

homes in the area. We split the study area into 50 even sized vertical bands and calculate the

average latitude of houses destroyed within the band. These coordinates (for bands that have any

damages), along with the longitudinal midpoint of each band creates a series of knots that maps

the approximate path of the tornado. We then define tornado exposed households as those who

are within 1km of one of these knots (depicted in lower left corner of Figure S3). By this definition

459 out of the 467 houses destroyed by the tornado (98%) are within the tornado path.

    Second, we construct dummies for two main time periods of early exposure: the prenatal period

(i.e., the infant was in utero during the tornado event) and early life (i.e., the infant was either 0-3

months or 3-6 months during the tornado). Throughout the paper we define the in utero period

as the time between our best guess of the date of conception and birth. The best-guess date of

conception is determined via a combination of information on the woman’s last menstrual period

(self-reported) and a urine test-based confirmation of pregnancy.

    Third, we use randomized variation in the allocation of vitamin A to newborns by sector.


                                                   8
Accordingly, we construct a dummy for whether the infant was born in a treatment sector, meaning

that he was dosed with vitamin A as opposed to a placebo supplement at birth. As explained earlier,

supplementation at birth in the RCT was cross-randomized with prenatal supplementation and was

balanced across the newborn supplementation trial, and thus we do not need to control for prenatal

supplementation status.


3.2   Identification

This section illustrates the research design and the assumptions required to identify the effect of

the tornado and its interaction with the vitamin A supplementation. Our basic specification is


           Y = α + β1 T + β2 T · E + β3 E + β4 C + β5 C · E + β6 C · T + β7 C · T · E + u         (1)


where T is treatment, E is being in an area exposed to the tornado (whether or not an infant is

in an affected cohort) and C is an indicator for the affected cohort (whether or not an infant is

within or outside the tornado affected area). This equation generalizes easily to multiple cohorts

such as including impact both on the in-utero period and the period after birth. To formalize the

assumptions underlying our double- and triple-difference estimation we describe the research design

in a potential outcomes framework in this section. Let Yitec be the potential outcome for infant

i given treatment (T = t), tornado exposure (E = e) and cohort (C = c), where C is equal to 1

if the infant is part of the exposed cohort (whether he or she is in an area hit by the tornado or

not). Here τi is the causal effect of the vitamin A supplementation on individual i, ωi is the causal

effect of tornado exposure, γi is the causal effect of the interaction of vitamin A supplementation

and tornado exposure and νi is the causal effect of being part of cohort C = 1 relative to C = 0

due to aggregate changes (e.g., seasonality or other aggregate conditions affecting all individuals in

the study area). We assume that this cohort effect, νi , is independent of location. The potential

outcomes are

   In this 2x2x2 research design we observe 8 moments that map to the OLS parameters:


       E[Yi |T = 0, E = 0, C = 0] =α                            +E[ui |T = 0, E = 0, C = 0]

       E[Yi |T = 1, E = 0, C = 0] =α + β1                       +E[ui |T = 1, E = 0, C = 0]

The treatment was randomized and the path of the tornado was certainly independent of this

treatment (we also show later that the tornado impact, in terms of infrastructure, was balanced

across treatment). Actual exposure to the tornado is independent of treatment aside from possible

sample selection due to the treatment. The RCT was double blind and it is unlikely parents would

be able to deduce from the health of their or neighbors children whether their area was in treatment

or control. The main sample selection is through mortality since the vitamin A treatment reduced

mortality by 15%. The random assignment and independence of the treatment (T ) and living in

            E[χi |T = 1, E = 0, C = 0] = E[χi |T = 0, E = 0, C = 0]                  (I)

            E[χi |T = 1, E = 1, C = 0] = E[χi |T = 0, E = 1, C = 0]                 (II)

Given that we will not observe 3 and 6 months outcomes for those infants that die before that time,

we introduce a fourth variable S that is 1 if infant i is in the sample. We assume that equations

(I) - (IV) hold when conditioning on the observed sample. We examine later evidence for this

assumption. That is, we assume (Assumption 1) that

  Identification Assumption 1 For each χi in {τi , ωi , νi , ui }:


        E[χi |T = 1, E = 0, C = 0, S = 1] = E[χi |T = 0, E = 0, C = 0, S = 1]              (I ′ )

        E[χi |T = 1, E = 1, C = 0, S = 1] = E[χi |T = 0, E = 1, C = 0, S = 1]          (II ′ )

        E[χi |T = 1, E = 0, C = 1, S = 1] = E[χi |T = 0, E = 0, C = 1, S = 1]         (III ′ )

        E[χi |T = 1, E = 1, C = 1, S = 1] = E[χi |T = 0, E = 1, C = 1, S = 1]          (IV ′ )


   We now link the observed moments to the main structural parameters of interest: τi , ωi and

γi . We start with the identification of the causal effect of the vitamin A supplementation (τi ). We

have


  E[Yi |T = 1, E = 0, C = 0, S = 1] − E[Yi |T = 0, E = 0, C = 0, S = 1]

                      = β1 + E[ui |T = 1, E = 0, C = 0, S = 1] − E[ui |T = 0, E = 0, C = 0, S = 1]
                             |                                 {z                                }
                                                       = 0 by Assumption 1 (I’)


Therefore, by (I’),


       β1 = E[α + τi + ui |T = 1, E = 0, C = 0, S = 1] − E[α + ui |T = 0, E = 0, C = 0, S = 1]

         = E[τi |E = 0, C = 0, S = 1]


                                                  11
That is, β1 identifies the causal effect of the vitamin A on infants outside of the tornado affected

area in the pre-tornado period. Similarly β1 + β2 = E[τi |E = 1, C = 0, S = 1] identifies this causal

effect within the tornado affected area in the pre-tornado period.


  Now we consider the identification of the causal effect of the tornado on infant outcomes, ωi . To

identify this structural parameter we use the four moments (among the eight in the 2x2x2 research

design) that are derived from the population that did not get supplementation and we rely on a

standard parallel trends assumption for difference-in-difference estimation. Specifically, we assume

that, absent the tornado the outcomes in the tornado area would have followed the same trend as

the outcomes outside this area:

  Identification Assumption 2


    E[Yi |T = 0, E = 1, C = 1, S = 1] − E[Yi |T = 0, E = 1, C = 0, S = 1]

                         = E[Yi |T = 0, E = 0, C = 1, S = 1] − E[Yi |T = 0, E = 0, C = 0, S = 1]


which, given that by construction E[νi |T = 0, E = 1, C = 1, S = 1] = E[νi |T = 0, E = 0, C =

1, S = 1], is equivalent to


  E[ui |T = 0, E = 1, C = 1, S = 1] − E[ui |T = 0, E = 1, C = 0, S = 1]

                              = E[ui |T = 0, E = 0, C = 1, S = 1] − E[ui |T = 0, E = 0, C = 0, S = 1]


Now we have


        A :=E[Yi |T = 0, E = 1, C = 1, S = 1] − E[Yi |T = 0, E = 0, C = 1, S = 1]

           =β3 + β5 + E[ui |T = 0, E = 1, C = 1, S = 1] − E[ui |T = 0, E = 0, C = 1, S = 1]

        B :=E[Yi |T = 0, E = 1, C = 0, S = 1] − E[Yi |T = 0, E = 0, C = 0, S = 1]

           =β3 + E[ui |T = 0, E = 1, C = 0, S = 1] − E[ui |T = 0, E = 0, C = 0, S = 1]




                                                    12
Computing A − B and re-arranging terms gives


          β5 =E[Yi |T = 0, E = 1, C = 1, S = 1] − E[Yi |T = 0, E = 0, C = 1, S = 1]

               − {E[Yi |T = 0, E = 1, C = 1, S = 1] − E[Yi |T = 0, E = 0, C = 0, S = 1]}
                 h
               − E[ui |T = 0, E = 1, C = 1, S = 1] − E[ui |T = 0, E = 0, C = 1, S = 1]
                                                                                         i
               − {E[ui |T = 0, E = 1, C = 0, S = 1] − E[ui |T = 0, E = 0, C = 0, S = 1]}




           =E[ωi |T = 0, E = 1, C = 1, S = 1]
              h
            − E[ui |T = 0, E = 1, C = 1, S = 1] − E[ui |T = 0, E = 0, C = 1, S = 1]
                                                                                          i
              − {E[ui |T = 0, E = 1, C = 0, S = 1] − E[ui |T = 0, E = 0, C = 0, S = 1]}

           =E[ωi |T = 0, E = 1, C = 1, S = 1] by Assumption 2




The OLS coefficient β5 therefore identifies the average causal impact of the tornado E[ωi |T =

0, E = 1, C = 1, S = 1].


  Finally we link the observed moments to the structural parameter for the interaction of the

vitamin A supplementation and the tornado shock, γi . To identify this parameter we employ all

eight moments defined by the 2x2x2 research design. Taking the first difference of treatment versus

control for the four cases of inside or outside the tornado area factored with cohorts measured




                                                13
before versus affected by the tornado we have:


  C :=E[Yi |T = 1, E = 1, C = 1, S = 1] − E[Yi |T = 0, E = 1, C = 1, S = 1]

     =β1 + β2 + β6 + β7 + E[ui |T = 1, E = 1, C = 1, S = 1] − E[ui |T = 0, E = 1, C = 1, S = 1]

     =β1 + β2 + β6 + β7 by Assumption 1 (IV’)

  D :=E[Yi |T = 1, E = 0, C = 1, S = 1] − E[Yi |T = 0, E = 0, C = 1, S = 1]

     =β1 + β6 + E[ui |T = 1, E = 1, C = 1, S = 1] − E[ui |T = 0, E = 1, C = 1, S = 1]

     =β1 + β6 by Assumption 1 (III’)

  E :=E[Yi |T = 1, E = 1, C = 0, S = 1] − E[Yi |T = 0, E = 1, C = 0, S = 1]

     =β1 + β2 + E[ui |T = 1, E = 1, C = 0, S = 1] − E[ui |T = 0, E = 1, C = 0, S = 1]

     =β1 + β2 by Assumption 1 (II’)

  F :=E[Yi |T = 1, E = 0, C = 0, S = 1] − E[Yi |T = 0, E = 0, C = 0, S = 1]

     =β1 + E[ui |T = 1, E = 0, C = 0, S = 1] − E[ui |T = 0, E = 0, C = 0, S = 1]

     =β1 by Assumption 1 (I’)


Then C − D − (E − F ) = β7 . For the OLS coefficient β7 to map to the structural interaction

parameter γ we need one final assumption, Assumption 3, which is:

  Identification Assumption 3


    E[τi |T = 1, E = 1, C = 1, S = 1] − E[τi |T = 1, E = 1, C = 0, S = 1]

                        = E[τi |T = 1, E = 0, C = 1, S = 1] − E[τi |T = 1, E = 0, C = 0, S = 1]


This is a parallel trends assumption on the causal effect of vitamin A inside and outside the area

that was affected by the tornado. That is, we assume that the causal effect of vitamin A for infants

in the tornado area would have followed the same trend as the causal effect outside the tornado

area in the absence of a tornado. With this assumption, along with Assumption 1, we now have

In summary, under Assumptions 1 - 3, the OLS coefficients β5 and β7 identify the average causal

effect of the tornado, E[ωi |T = 0, E = 1, C = 1, S = 1], and the average causal effect of the

interaction of the tornado and the vitamin A supplementation, E[γi |T = 1, E = 1, C = 1, S = 1],

respectively.


3.3    Evidence on Assumptions 1-3

Assumption 1 refers to three structural parameters, ωi (the causal impact of the tornado), νi

(the cohort effect; or causal impact of changes in the aggregate environment over time) and ui

(unobservables and those observables not included in the estimation). We believe that assuming

that Assumption 1 holds for the cohort effect is reasonable and we do not test it specifically. For the

causal impact of the tornado we only have to worry about the tornado area in the affected period

(A1-IV’). The main worry here is if, by random happenstance, the tornado affected treatment and

control areas with different intensity. Figure S2 in the Supplementary Materials, which graphs


                                                    15
the intensity of the tornado (as measured by the share of houses destroyed by treatment sector)

by treatment status, show that this is not the case. With respect to ui we can test for balance

in observables. In Table 1 we test balance across the four subsamples (tornado exposure versus

cohort) corresponding to parts I’ through IV’ of Assumption 1. These are remarkably well balanced

across treatment and control. The largest difference is in mother’s age at enrollment but the larger

coefficients are not statistically significant and the one significant coefficient means only a difference

of less than 4 months in the mother’s age. Based on this, it appears that Assumption 1 is reasonable.

   In Figure 1 we examine the validity of Assumption 2: that in the absence of the tornado,

outcomes in the tornado area would have followed a similar trend as outcomes outside this area.

We show average outcomes within 20 bins and an associated regression line up to the time of the

tornado for birth outcomes, up to 90 days before the tornado for 3 month outcomes and up to

180 days prior for 6 month outcomes. As the graphs show, there is little evidence of substantial

differences in pre-trends. To formally test these trends and the trends in vitamin A impact we

estimate:


        Yi = α0 + α1 Ei + α2bi + α3Ei · bi + α4 Ti + α5 Ti · Ei + α6 Ti · bi + α7 Ti · Ei · bi + vi   (2)


where bi is the infants birthday coded as number of days since January 1st, 1960, and we limit the

regression to those who were born before the tornado for birth outcomes, and those born more than

90 or 180 days before the tornado for 3 and 6 month outcomes. The top panel of Table 2 shows

the coefficient for the difference in trends in the control group (α3 ) and the second panel shows the

difference in trends of the estimated treatment effect (α7 ). The estimated differences in trends are

in all cases less than 10% of the dependent variable standard deviation with one exception: For

MUAC at 6 months the estimate for α3 (Assumption 2) is 15% of the standard deviation and α7

(Assumption 3) is 23% of the standard deviation. In both cases and for all outcome variables the

estimates are far from reaching statistical significance. Based on this data, Assumptions 2 and 3

seem reasonable, with the possibility of some violation in the case of 6 month MUAC.

3.4   Estimation

To account for the clustered design of the RCT and the spatial correlation in tornado exposure

we implement a randomization inference procedure to construct confidence limits and estimate

statistical significance. Please see details of this procedure in section A1.3.

           This table shows group means and differences of the incidence of severe fever in the
          first 3 months of life, by tornado exposure, birth cohort, and vitamin A treatment
          status, as an illustration of the research strategy. Conventional (OLS) standard errors
          are reported in parenthesis. Significance levels: ∗ < 0.1; ∗∗ < 0.05; ∗ ∗ ∗ < 0.01.


    To illustrate our estimation strategy, in Table 3 we report group means for one of our primary

outcomes, (mothers’) self-reported incidence of severe fevers from 0 to 3 months. In the top panel,

we report means for children aged > 6 months at the time of the tornado. There should be

no impacts of the tornado on outcomes at 3 months for this cohort, since these outcomes were

recorded months before the tornado struck. We report group means for infants born in tornado

areas v. unaffected areas, and in vitamin A treatment v. placebo (control) villages.

    As hypothesized, the results in this first panel show 0 differences in means across these groups.

                                                    19
The mean incidence of severe fevers in all groups is fairly close to 1; differences across infants born

in tornado v. unaffected areas are small and statistically insignificant for both vitamin A and

placebo groups.

   In the second panel, we report the same means but for the cohort of infants aged 0-3 months

at the time of the tornado. For these infants, the group means reveal a very different story from

the results of the slightly older cohort described above. In the placebo group, infants born in

tornado-affected areas had substantially higher incidence of severe fever (1.3 fevers by 3 months

postpartum) compared to those born in unaffected areas (0.84 fevers). This mean difference of

0.45 fevers is statistically significant and large – more than half the mean in unaffected areas. In

vitamin A treatment villages, this difference is much smaller (0.11).

   Below the second panel, we report the difference in differences across cohorts. Consistent with

the results above, the difference in differences is large and statistically significant for placebo villages

(0.55), while smaller and insignificant for vitamin A treatment villages (0.19). The triple difference

(-0.36), reported in the last row of the table, again reflects the same patterns.


4.2   Birth Outcomes

Table 4 reports impacts of the tornado on birth outcomes. The first column in this table reports

impacts on birth weight, measured in kilograms (kg). Tornado exposure in utero had a statistically

significant negative impact on birth weight (dummy for birth weight < 2.5 kg). Infants exposed

in utero were about 8 percentage points more likely to have low birth weight from a baseline of 54

percent among unexposed infants (column 2 results). We observed this effect throughout the lower

end of the birthweight distribution, as can be seen in column 3, which reports that infants exposed

in utero were 7 percentage points more likely to be born less than 2kg (from a baseline of 14%).

   Column 4 in this table reports impacts on length at birth (cm), another summary measure of

newborn health. Again, we find significant negative impacts of the tornado, especially in the second

and third trimesters: exposed newborns were 0.43 cm shorter than unexposed newborns. The last

two columns (columns 5 and 6, respectively) show impacts on prematurity (born before 37 weeks)

and gestational age in weeks, respectively. These panels show that the tornado did not appear to

have large impacts on length of gestation.

4.3     Outcomes Measured at 3 and 6 Months

Next, we estimate the impacts of tornado exposure in utero and in early life on infants’ outcomes

at 3 and 6 months. We estimate these separately by vitamin A treatment status, allowing us to

identify the protective effects of vitamin A supplementation at birth. We show results for mid-upper

arm circumference (MUAC), an early predictor of infant mortality, and for the number of severe

fever episodes as reported by the infant’s mother. Fever in particular is an important potential

mediator of impacts on anthropometry because of the crucial role of vitamin A in maintaining

epithelial integrity (providing barriers to infection) and supporting a healthy immune system. For

example, Tielsch et al. (2007) find that supplementation with vitamin A reduces the case-fatality

rate of fevers and diarrhea.

      Table 5 reports tornado impacts on two key outcomes – mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC)

and the incidence of severe fevers – at 3 and 6 months, for both in utero and early life (0-3 month

and 4-6 month) exposure, by vitamin A (treatment) and placebo (control) groups. In Panel A,

we report results for in utero exposure. Overall, there do not appear to be statistically significant

impacts of the tornado on MUAC or fever episodes at 3 or 6 months, suggesting the tornado did

not have substantial impacts on either group (vitamin A or placebo) for fetal exposure.4 Panel

B shows impacts for 0-3 month tornado exposure. Here, the pattern is clear: for both 3 and 6

month outcomes, the tornado had large deleterious effects on infant health in the control group,

but essentially no impacts whatsoever in the vitamin A group. The difference across these two
  4
   It is worth noting that when exposure is divided by trimester, the results show consistently that second trimester
exposure does seem to generate impacts on early life health, and that vitamin A at birth mitigates this impact. See
Table S2 for these results.

groups is, in general, statistically different from 0 (with the exception of 4-6 month fever). In Panel

C, we report analogous estimates for 4-6 month tornado exposure, again showing little impact of

the tornado in both experimental groups.


                                                  22
        The takeaway from Table 5 is that tornado exposure does not always generate negative effects,

but exposure during the sensitive early period between 0 and 3 months of life had substantial

impacts on infant health. Impacts are quite large – e.g., 0.35-0.37 cm on MUAC, which also

translates to approximately 0.4 SD5 , and between 0.4 and 0.5 additional fevers on a mean of just

less than 1 severe fever episode within each three-month measurement period. Moreover, these

effects were all but mitigated by vitamin A supplementation at birth: in the vitamin A group, we

see no such tornado exposure effects at 3 and 6 months.

        In Tables S3 and S4, we report results on MUAC and severe fever incidence by gender. The

main conclusion from these results is that the tornado had large deleterious impacts on MUAC

and fever episodes for male infants in the control group, especially in the second trimester and in

early life. For male infants supplemented with vitamin A, those negative impacts all but disappear,

particularly for MUAC at 3 and 6 months. In contrast, there are few significant impacts of tornado

exposure on female infants (in fact, MUAC shows no significant effects), and effects are essentially

0 across both treatment and control groups for girls. The substantial heterogeneity in tornado

impacts as well as vitamin A interactions seen in boys v. girls may represent a manifestation of

the “fragile male,” the finding consistent across a wide variety of studies that boys are much more

innately susceptible to insults in utero and in early life than girls (Kraemer, 2000).

        We perform a variety of checks for potential concerns related to on internal validity with

results reported in the A1.5, including discussions of attrition (section A1.5.1), dosing timing

(section A1.5.2), changing the definition of the control group (section A1.5.3), and the changing the

definition of tornado exposure (section A1.5.4). Our results are generally robust to these potential

concerns.



5        Discussion

Our results support a novel role for vitamin A, given at birth as a single large dose, in strengthening

the physiological resilience of infants born to mothers who experienced a devastating tornado, or

experienced themselves the event and stresses that followed. These effects have been observed in

a population where a randomized trial reported an overall reduction of 15% in all-cause infant
    5
    The MUAC measures reported here are in centimeters. The standard deviation of these measures are 1.04-1.06
cm, so an approximate impact in standard deviations can also be read from the figure.

mortality following newborn vitamin A versus placebo receipt, consistent with multiple other trials

showing similar effects in the South Asian region. In one (Tielsch et al., 2007), the design allowed

investigators to discern significant reductions in infant fatality due to diarrhea and, important

for our results here, severe fever. Results on the incidence of fever episodes in infancy reinforce

the findings on anthropometry and shed some light on a potential mechanism through which the

remediating and protective role of vitamin A may operate. We were not able to assess precisely

through what mechanism the observed effects may have occurred, but they may be due to stronger

resistance to infection, or possibly other sources of stress and inflammation that may accompany

severe trauma.

   This study demonstrates, to our knowledge for the first time, that a health intervention at birth

can strengthen resilience to trauma in early life. This is important because improving the health and

survival of infants, particularly in low-income countries, is a primary goal for global health policy.

Moreover, a growing literature in economics shows that in addition to these immediate impacts,

early life insults have far-reaching long run consequences. Disease (Almond, 2006; Bleakley, 2007,

2010; Cutler et al., 2010), natural disasters (Currie and Rossin-Slater, 2013), income shocks (Maccini

and Yang, 2009), and conflict (Akresh et al., 2012) all leave lasting scars on health, human capital,

and wellbeing that persist over the lifecourse. The role of public policy in mitigating these impacts

or protecting against them is widely recognized but poorly understood. In large part, the dearth

of rigorous evidence on policy levers is due to the difficulty in finding overlapping episodes of early

life trauma and orthogonal variation that changes the incentives for investing in children.

   Our study takes a step toward filling this gap. Our results demonstrate strong effects of one-

time vitamin A supplementation at birth. We interpret this as evidence that, at least in very early

life, endowments (as proxied for by tornado exposure) and investments (vitamin A) are substitutes.

Whether this remains true when outcomes are measured in later childhood and adulthood is an

open question. Our results hopefully offer a valuable start and suggest that more research on the

role of micronutrient deficiencies in infants’ resilience to shocks is likely to be important.

   Our results suggest that much of the impact of supplementation, at least on infant mortality,

can be attributed to the large benefits accruing to the most distressed infants (in this case, to

tornado-affected infants). To enhance their impact, supplementation policies should thus target

distressed infants, particularly those living through traumatic experiences – natural disasters,

 Regression models of infant development measured by number of fever episodes and anthropometry at 3 and 6 months of age. The outcome
variables are: In columns 1 and 4, fever episodes in 0-3 months and 4-6 months, top coded at 4 (>4 episodes are coded as 4); In columns 2
and 5, an anthropometric index (AI) that is a standardized (zero mean, unit SD) average of three anthropometric measurements (mid-upper arm
circumference, head circumference and chest circumference) after each has been standardized to zero mean and unit standard deviation. Each
anthropometric variable is winsorized at 1%. ”Vit A” is an indicator that is 1 if infants in the sector were given vitamin A and zero if they were
in the placebo group. ”In Tornado Area” is an indicator for tornado exposure as described in the text. Standard errors are computing using
randomization inference as described in the text.

 This table reports impacts of the tornado using a similar double-difference strategy as in other
parts of the paper except that cohorts are defined in an alternative way from other parts of
the paper (since we can’t rely on birthday). The infant is defined as being in-utero if the
tornado happened after the last menstrual period and before the date of pregnancy outcome.
The three trimesters are defined as the 0-90, 91-180 and 181-270 days after the last menstrual
period, respectively, or up to the date of outcome (whichever comes earlier). The sample for
these regressions includes pregnancies, as opposed to the sample of live births used in other
tables and figures. We limit the sample to pregnancies of mothers who had their last menstrual
period after July 1st, 2003 (before this date the infant is unlikely to end up in the infant trial,
which started in January 2004, and an exact match between the two samples is not possible
given that gestational length determines in part inclusion in the infant trial (around the start
of the trial)). Three percent of pregnancies ended in stillbirth and the remaining possible
outcomes (mom died, multiple births and other) accounted for two percent. Significance: * <

A1.3: Randomization Inference Procedure

To account for the clustered design of the RCT and the spatial correlation in tornado exposure

we implement a randomization inference procedure to construct confidence limits and estimate

statistical significance. To do this we construct “placebo scenarios” where each scenario involves

generating a new vitamin A randomization allocation (according to the original location stratified

randomization procedure) and generating a “placebo tornado” – that is, defining a random area

somewhere within the study area of a similar size and shape as the original tornado. We implement

this by choosing a random house in the study area and a random angle (between 0 and 360 degrees)

from this house. We then define knots along a linear path from the chosen house in the direction

of the chosen angle up to a distance that equals the distance travelled by the original tornado.

The households affected by the placebo tornado are defined (similarly to the original tornado) as

those within a 1km radius of one of those knots. If a placebo tornado lands substantially outside

the study area or substantially overlaps with the original tornado then we exclude it and instead

compute a new one for the given iteration. Technically, if the number of households outside the

tornado area covered by the placebo tornado is less than 90% of the number of houses covered by

the original tornado then this placebo tornado is excluded.

   The middle and right panels of Figure S3 show four examples of these “placebo tornados”.

For each scenario we estimate our main specification using the placebo exposure definitions and

treatment indicators. We repeat this process 5,000 times to obtain a distribution of “placebo”

coefficient estimates for each coefficient in our specification. We use the range of this distribution

(distance between the 2.5th and the 97.5th percentile) as the width of our 95% confidence intervals

and compute p-values by identifying where our original estimate falls on this distribution.


A1.4: Results by Gender

Next, we estimate heterogeneous effects across gender. The manyfold innate physiological differences

across male and female infants, particularly as relate to vulnerability to shocks, suggest that both

the extent of the negative impacts of tornado exposure, as well as the resilience generated by vitamin

A supplementation, might vary across gender. We test this hypothesis by estimating impacts the

same way as above, separately for boy and girl infants.



                                                 41
Figure A3: This figure depicts the houses destroyed in the tornado (top left), the definition of tornado exposed
(bottom left) and four examples of placebo tornados, each in dark gray (other houses in the study are depicted in
light gray).


    The results, presented in Figures S4 and S5 reveal meaningful heterogeneity. The tornado

had large deleterious impacts on MUAC and fever episodes for male infants in the control group,

especially in the second trimester and in early life. But for male infants supplemented with vitamin

A, those negative impacts all but disappear, particularly for MUAC at 3 and 6 months. In contrast,

there are few significant impacts of tornado exposure on female infants (in fact, MUAC shows no

significant effects), and effects are essentially 0 across both treatment and control groups for girls.

We do find that for fever at 3 months, girls in the treatment group actually reported more fevers if

exposed in the first or second trimester. This might be a spurious result due to the small numbers

of girls per cell in the regression, or it maybe real, and related to a finding from previous RCTs

showing that girls sometimes react negatively to early supplementation with vitamin A (Jørgensen

et al., 2013). The corresponding point estimates and errors are reported in Tables S4 and S5.

    The substantial heterogeneity in tornado impacts as well as vitamin A interactions seen in boys

v. girls may represent a manifestation of the “fragile male,” the finding consistent across a wide

variety of studies that boys are much more innately susceptible to insults in utero and in early life

than girls (Kraemer, 2000).


                                                       42
A1.5: Checks

In this section, we check for potential concerns related to internal validity.


A1.5.1: Attrition

We begin with a discussion of attrition. There are two forms of attrition that are relevant in our

study context. First, since we are able to observe and track every pregnancy from its inception, we

can identify attrition from the sample due to fetal death (miscarriage or abortion) and stillbirth.

Second, for live births, there is additional attrition due to loss to follow up (i.e., the household could

not be located at 3 or 6 months following the infant’s birth and thus anthropometry and survey

responses are not recorded) or due to death of the infant. If either of these types of attrition is

affected by tornado exposure or (after birth) by vitamin A interactions with exposure, it is possible

that this differential sample selection could be driving our results. We thus estimate the relationship

between both of these types of attrition and exposure (and vitamin A supplementation) to test for

sample selection bias in our estimates.

   In Table S6, we look at the first type of attrition by studying miscarriages, abortions, and live

births. (Note that we do not separately estimate selection due to stillbirth because less than 3

percent of pregnancies resulted in stillbirth; however, this variation is captured in the “0” category

of the live birth dummy). The main result in Table S6 is that in utero exposure to the tornado

did not significantly affect the probability of miscarriage or abortion, and thus (since the live birth

dummy is nearly collinear with the sum of miscarriage and abortion) live births were also not

significantly affected (there is a marginally significant effect on live birth in the second and third

trimesters but this may be an artefact of the small sample given that almost all pregnancies that

survive into the second trimester result in a live birth; in this case only 3 and 1 pregnancy exposed

in the second and third trimester, respectively, did not result in a live birth, whereas, based on

rates outside the tornado area, we would have expected 7.6 and 4.6, respectively). We have to

cluster standard errors in a slightly different way in this analysis than any of the other analysis in

the paper, because the date of birth is obviously not defined for pregnancies that did not result in

a live birth. Please see the table notes for clarification on clustering in this situation.

   Next, we look at the second type of attrition, namely attrition at 3 or 6 months for live births.



                                                   43
Here we use an identical set of right-hand side variables as in our baseline specification, but use

as outcomes dummies for whether measures were missing, or “missing or late” (where late refers

to measurement 8 weeks or more after the target date), for 3 and 6 month measurements. The

results of this analysis are reported in Table S7. We find overall that attrition of live births is not

significantly different across exposed and unexposed infants, nor is it different by vitamin A group

interactions with tornado exposure.

   Taken on the whole, the evidence on attrition strongly suggests that our estimates are not

affected by sample selection bias.


A1.5.2: Dosing

According to the trial protocol, infants were to be dosed within hours of birth with either treatment

(vitamin A) or placebo. The trial was double blind, so the implementation teams did not know

whether they were dosing infants with treatment or placebo. 41 percent of infants were dosed

within 6 hours of birth. 56 percent were dosed within 12 hours, and 67 percent by 24 hours. The

dose timing distribution has a long right tail: 24 percent of infants were dosed more than 7 days

after birth.

   Table S8 reports results for dummies indicating dosing occurred within 1 day and within 7 days.

Overall, the results in this table show that the distribution of dosing timing was not significantly

different across infants exposed and unexposed to the tornado, and across vitamin A and placebo

interactions with tornado exposure. The fact that there is no difference in dosing timing across

tornado exposure categories is reassuring, given the possible concern that the tornado may have

caused delays in trial administration. The fact that there are no significant interactions with

vitamin A treatment reflects the double-blind nature of the trial: there is no reason to suspect

supplementation.
