1 Introduction
Thanks primarily to the tariff reductions negotiated under the auspices of the GATT and WTO,
international trade is likely as unfettered by restrictions as any other time in history. While the
gains from free trade are widely recognized, it is also well known that openness makes economies
more vulnerable to injury from adverse trade shocks. GATT founders were cognizant that injured
import competing groups might use such shocks as an excuse to renege on GATT agreements; for
that reason exceptions to tariff obligations were provided within the GATT. These exceptions allow
governments to protect the injured sector while not abandoning the tariff liberalization achieved in
other sectors.1
    GATT exceptions allow governments to take actions in response to imports which are deemed to
have harmed the domestic competing industry. If injury is caused by “fair” trade (e.g., an increase
in imports due to tariff reductions), a government can invoke the escape clause to restrain imports; if
injury is caused by “unfair” trade (e.g., dumping or government subsidization of imports), the policy
response is antidumping or countervailing duties. Dam (1970) points out that these exceptions have
been included in every GATT agreement. Moreover, he argues that the inclusion of these exceptions
was crucial for the success of the early GATT rounds. His view is that exceptions greatly increased
the number of sectors where tariffs were liberalized by diffusing domestic political opposition toward
trade liberalization. In a sense, exceptions offered the promise of insurance for sectors injured by
the liberalization.
    Clearly then, for many years policy-makers have taken for granted that trade policy can act
as insurance. However, the notion that trade policy can act as insurance was not formalized until
Eaton and Grossman (1985).2 In their model there is a single import competing sector and single
export sector. The import competing sector is subject to price shocks. The goods are produced
with two factors; one factor (labor) can be allocated after the price shock is realized while the other
factor (capital) can only be allocated before the terms of trade are realized. Eaton and Grossman
(EG) demonstrate that a tariff can raise ex ante welfare if insurance markets are incomplete.
    EG’s insight has spurred a number of other papers, most notably those by Staiger and Tabellini
(1987) and Dixit (1987, 1989a, 1989b). These related papers also assume that markets are incom-
plete and that factors are not completely mobile ex post. Staiger and Tabellini use the basic EG
framework to examine the time consistency of tariff protection. While EG and Staiger and Tabellini
were willing to leave implicit the reasons for the incompleteness of insurance markets Dixit argues
that the source of the incompleteness can be important. For instance, he shows that when the
market failure is explicitly tied to adverse selection or moral hazard the laissez-faire equilibrium
may be Pareto optimal. Following EG’s approach, we will leave the precise source of the market
failure implicit, but note that unobservable actions and outcomes are not the only source of market

economic issues relating to GATT rules and institutions.

     The idea that trade policy might act as insurance was informally discussed for many years, e.g., Corden (1974)
and Baldwin (1982).

incompleteness. Rather, the transaction costs of insuring agents against trade shocks are surely
quite large and will likely preclude complete insurance. In addition, trade shocks may well give rise
to bankruptcy concerns, implying that markets will likely be at least partially incomplete. Finally,
there might be other distortions in the economy that preclude complete insurance.3
       We believe, however, the EG model is not well suited to study GATT exceptions for at least
two reasons. First, GATT MNF tariffs are typically negotiated years in advance and thus are very
difficult to be levied in a contingent fashion. GATT exceptions, on the other hand, are precisely
designed to be levied after the trade shock. Second, and the more troubling concern, exceptions like
antidumping and the escape clause are sector specific protection. With a single import-competing
sector, EG’s model can not adequately characterize the conditions when sector specific protection
is desirable. In their model the tariff is levied on all import competing sectors; therefore their paper
is better interpreted as formalizing the effect of a uniform tariff.
       In this paper we develop a model that allows us to better answer the question of whether GATT
exceptions can act as insurance. With the EG model serving as the foundation for our analysis, we
allow for multiple import competing sectors which are subject to sector specific price shocks. This
allows us to understand and contrast the distortions created across sectors. As in the EG paper, we
assume capital is immobile ex post and markets are incomplete. We show that GATT exceptions
raise welfare by providing insurance.
       In addition, we compare the efficacy of contingent measures with the traditional “across the
board” tariff protection ala EG. We show that these policies dominate uniform tariffs. In contrast
with EG, we find that the optimal uniform policy may involve export taxes. The difference lies in
the fact that in our somewhat more general model only one sector benefits from the imposition of
a uniform tariff while the other sector is worse off. Thus, when it comes to uniform policies we find
that what is good for the goose is not good for the gander.
       Thus, our model provides a theoretical foundation for the notion that GATT exceptions can
provide insurance. Given the unprecedented use of GATT exceptions—in particular antidumping
actions—during the past twenty years, many question whether insurance is the motivation for
many of the actions (Bhagwati, 1988; Finger, 1993; Krueger, 1995).4 Briefly stated, the concern
is that antidumping procedures allow investigations to be conducted when there is little evidence
of injury or unfair actions. Given the apparent capture of antidumping by protectionist interests,
we also examine whether an alternative policy might could also serve as insurance. In particular,
we consider a policy wherein the adversely affected sector is offered a subsidy which is financed by
taxes on the non-affected sectors; we find that this “tax and subsidize” policy also increases welfare.
This suggests that it is possible to design alternative policies that have the beneficial risk-sharing
   3
     Consider the case where insurance against market shocks is expensive, due to the existence of a monopoly in
insurance. The first best would be to eliminate the monopoly, in which case it might not be necessary to have
contingent protection. If this is impossible, contingent protection can be used as a second best way to avoid the cost
of not being able to insure against trade shocks.
   4
     Staiger and Wolak (1994) find that many U.S. antidumping complaints are not primarily aimed at winning
duties, but rather are at hindering the foreign rival during the investigation (in their terminology, many industries
are “process filers”).

properties of current GATT exceptions but without their weaknesses.


2 The Model
We consider a three sector model of a small open economy facing stochastic international prices.5
The goods are X, Y 1 , Y 2 ; all are consumed domestically. We also assume that in all states of the
world all three goods are produced domestically. Following EG we assume that at the time capital
must be allocated between productive sectors the terms of trade are unknown. In contrast, labor
can move between sectors after the uncertainty is resolved and after the trade policy is implemented.
      We assume that good X, the export good, is produced under constant returns to scale using
only labor. We let X be the numeraire good; to simplify we assume that X = G(LX ) = LX , so
w = 1. The other two goods are imported and are produced using a CRS technology with capital
and labor. The outputs of the import competing goods in state s are given by



                                   Y 1s = F 1 (K 1 , L1s ), Y 2s = F 2 (K 2 , L2s ),

where K i and Lis denote the amount of capital and labor employed in the production of good i in
state s. The production functions are quasi-concave and twice differentiable.
      Each household has one unit of labor and k units of non-divisible capital. Each household must
allocate its capital to one sector. We assume that total endowment of labor is one (L = 1) implying
that K = k is total capital. Full employment implies LXs + L1s + L2s = 1 and K 1 + K 2 = K = k.
Let λi ≡ K i /K = K i /k be the proportion of households that allocate their capital to sector i, so
that K i = λi K. Since we can associate the households to the sector in which they invest, it follows
that there are λ1 households in sector 1 and λ2 = 1 − λ1 households in sector 2.
      Let P is be the world price of good i = 1, 2 in state s. The domestic price can be written as
pis = (1 + tis )P is , where tis denotes the ad valorem tariff for good i in state s. Let C ijs be the
consumption of good i by households invested in sector j in state s. The value of imports are
defined as



        M s = P 1s M 1s + P 2s M 2s = P 1s (λ1 C 11s + λ2 C 12s − F 1 ) + P 2s (λ1 C 21s + λ2 C 22s − F 2 ).   (1)

      The return to a household from her capital investment in sector i is



                                               r is = pis FK

where the subscript K indicates partial derivative. The income accruing to the typical household

      The results can be easily extended to the case of n import competing sectors.

                                                       (K i , Lis )k + w + T s ,                                       (2)

where T s denotes tariff revenue in state s. We assume the revenue is distributed equally among
households in a lump sum fashion.
       There are three states of nature. State s occurs with probability π s , s ∈ S = {A, B, C}. In
state A (B) sector 1 (2) receives a negative price shock; in state C neither import competing sector
receives a shock. Throughout much of the paper we will suppress the superscript s unless doing so
leads to confusion.
   The key question we are concerned with is the welfare effects of tariff policy. Given the small
country assumption, free trade is the optimal policy unless there are terms of trade shocks. In light
of the uncertainty trade policy may now act as insurance and hence raise welfare. The desirability
of such a policy depends in part on the nature of the tariff. In section 3 we examine the benchmark
case when the government sets a uniform tariff. In this case t1 = t2 = t and tariff revenue is
simply T = tM . In section 4 we consider sector specific contingent tariffs—such as antidumping
and escape clauses. In this scenario the tariff is levied only on the injured sector, implying case
tariff revenue is T = ti P i M i .
       Letting V is ≡ V (y is , p1s , p2s ) denote the indirect utility function of a type i household in state s
we can define welfare as6


                                         X                 X                          
                                   W ≡          πs W s =         π s λ1 V 1s + λ2 V 2s .                               (3)
                                          s∈S              s∈S

Finally we assume that ex ante an investment in each sector produces the same expected utility,
implying


                                                X                    
                                                      π s V 1s − V 2s = 0.                                             (4)
                                                s∈S


3 Uniform tariff policy
We begin by considering the effect of imposing a uniform tariff in case of a negative shock (and
no tariff if there is no shock). Since we believe that anticipated policies are of greater interest, we
assume that all agents internalize the existence of the uniform tariff.7
   6
     Good X also enters the utility function, but since it is the numeraire good it is convenient if we suppress it in
the indirect utility function.
   7
     The effect of a uniform tariff when the tariff is anticipated is similar. This is somewhat surprising since in general
the tariff alters the return in each of the possible states of nature, which in turn means that the allocation of capital



                                                             4
    For notational convenience we will use dot notation to denote derivatives with respect to the
tariff, e.g., ẏ ≡ dy/dt, Ṁ ≡ dM/dt, etc. The following result will useful in deriving the main
welfare result.

   dt    t=0            t=0


Proof : Consider the effect of a tariff on welfare in state s:
could depend on whether the tariff is anticipated. In the case of a uniform tariff, however, this effect does not exist.
This rather surprising result is explained by the fact that the relative price of the import goods p1 /p2 , remains the
same with or without the tariff. Given that ex ante investment in each sector provides the same expected utility, we
find that anticipated and unanticipated protection has the same effect on income.

            M − P 1 C 11 − P 2 C 21 = P 1 [λ2 (C 12 − C 11 ) − F 1 ] + P 2 [λ1 (C 22 − C 21 ) − F 2 ]

and a corresponding expression for M − P 1 C 12 − P 2 C 22 . Substituting these into (8) yields

   Using Lemma 1 note that


                                                       λ2 P 1 F 1 − λ1 P 2 F 2

   Lemma 2 allows us to evaluate the welfare effect of a uniform tariff. Suppose there is a negative
price shock to sector 1 (state A). We have that y 1A < y 2A , hence (Vy1A − Vy2A ) > 0 because of
diminishing marginal utility. We can also sign the consumption terms if the importables are not
inferior (both terms are positive). Note however that the term ẏ 1A − ẏ 2A is negative (from (9)).
Therefore we cannot sign the overall expression (10). The same ambiguity exists in state B. Since
the optimal policy in state C is free trade, we must conclude that

Proposition 1 A small uniform tariff has an ambiguous effect on welfare, i.e.,

                                                 dW
                                                             T 0.
                                                  dt   t=0

   Proposition 1 contrasts with EG’s (1985) finding that a small tariff raises welfare when there
are negative import price shocks. The difference lies in the fact that our model allows for multiple
import competing goods and while a uniform tariff carries benefits to the injured sector (as in EG)
it has a negative effect on the other import competing sector. This result helps explain why we
do not observe countries using uniform tariff policies to safeguard domestic industries from sector
specific terms of trade shocks.


4 A sector specific tariff
We now consider the case when a sector specific tariff is imposed whenever there is a shock to a
particular sector. We will assume that the government reacts by imposing tariff ti on good i when
there is a shock to that sector. All other sectors remain unprotected. Formally, the domestic price
of good i in state s is pis = P is (1 + tis ) and
                             
                             ti > 0 if i = 1 and s = A or if i = 2 and s = B,
                       tis =
                             0      otherwise.

   A sector-specific tariff has two effects: an ex post effect on the allocation of labor once the
state and the applicable tariff are known, and an ex ante effect on the allocation of capital between


                                                        7
sectors. For instance, suppose we are in state A. An increase in the state A tariff raises the
attractiveness of sector 1, since the bad state turns out to be not so bad (since the tariff raises the
expected return to sector 1 capital). This implies that more capital will be invested in sector 1
(and less in other sectors). Hence, a state contingent tariff will have an effect on the capital stocks
in all states, in contrast to the case of a uniform tariff.
   Without loss of generality we will study the welfare effect of a state A contingent tariff (i.e., a
tariff t1 > 0). All the results are directly applicable to a state B contingent tariff. Differentiating
equation (3) with respect to a state A contingent tariff leads to

Proposition 2 A small state contingent sector specific tariff increases welfare; i.e.,


                                               ∂W
                                                               >0
                                               ∂tis   tis =0

Proof : As above, we will proceed by analyzing a state A contingent tariff. Recall that

                                   ∂V iA
                                         = VyiA ẏ i + V1iA P 1A , i = 1, 2,
                                    ∂t1

and that


                                                                           
                         M 1A − P 1A C 11A = P 1A λ2 (C 12A − C 11A ) − F 1 ,
                                                                           
                         M 1A − P 1A C 12A = P 1A λ1 (C 11A − C 12A ) − F 1 .

Using Lemmas 3 and 4 we have


 ∂W A                  ∂V 1A     2 ∂V
                                      2A
                = λ1         + λ

                = λ1 Vy1A ẏ 1 + V11A P 1A + λ2 Vy2A ẏ 2 + V12A P 1A

                = λ1 Vy1A ẏ 1 − P 1A C 11A + λ2 Vy2A ẏ 2 − P 1A C 12A
                                                                                         
                = λ1 Vy1A P 1A F 1 /λ1 + M 1A − P 1A C 11A + λ2 Vy2A M 1A − P 1A C 12A
                                                                                                        
                = λ1 Vy1A P 1A F 1 λ2 /λ1 + λ2 (C 12A − C 11A ) + λ2 Vy2A P 1A λ1 (C 11A − C 12A ) − F 1
                = P 1A F 1 λ2 (Vy1A − Vy2A ) + P 1A λ1 λ2 (C 12A − C 11A )(Vy1A − Vy2A ) > 0

The last expression is positive. To see this, note that y 1A < y 2A ; hence the first term in the right
hand side is positive because of diminishing marginal utility of income. The second term is positive
because whether or not y 2 > y 1 , the terms C 12A − C 11A and Vy1A − Vy2A always have the same sign.
   The only remaining step is to show that dW s /dt1 = 0 for s = B, C. But this is simple enough,
since we have shown in Lemma 3 that ẏ is = 0, i = 1, 2 for all states s = B, C. Since a state A
contingent tariff has no direct effect on prices in the other states it follows that

5 Specific taxes and subsidies
An alternative policy instrument are specific taxes and subsidies to the sectors. We consider an
ad valorem production subsidy σ is to sector i in state s. To fix ideas, producers receive price
pis = (1 + σ is )P is where
                            
                            σ i > 0 if i = 1 and s = A or if i = 2 and s = B,
                         is
                        σ =
                            0       otherwise.

In other words, producers in sector i only receive the subsidy when i receives a negative shock. We
assume that consumers continue to face world prices and that the subsidy is paid by lump sum
taxation, so that taxes in sector i are τ is ≡ λi σ is P is F is .
    Consider for instance when state A is realized and sector 1 receives the negative price shock.
In the rest of the section we will we omit the superscript denoting the state unless doing so leads
to confusion. Let ρ1 ≡ P 1 F 1 ; therefore the total value of the subsidy is σ 1 ρ1 . The income received
by type i household is



                                     y i = w + pi FK
                                                   i

Using hat notation to denote derivatives with respect to the subsidy to sector 1 (i.e., ŷ ≡ dy/dσ 1 ,
we can show

Lemma 5 The change in income due to a state A contingent subsidy cum tax is

                                            ρ1

Recall that consumers face world prices, so the subsidy does not change the prices they face. Hence
dV i /dσ 1 = Vyi ŷ i , and the total change in welfare in state A due to a small contingent production
subsidy is

Note also that dW B /dσ 1 = 0, as in the previous section. The negative shock implies that Vy1A >
Vy2A and hence the effect of the subsidy is always positive. Hence we have that

Proposition 3 A small state contingent subsidy is welfare improving; i.e.,

6 Conclusions and Extensions
Using a general equilibrium model with incomplete insurance markets, we have shown that con-
tingent protection on a sectoral basis will increase welfare when the economy is subject to sector
specific price shocks. Our model thus provides theoretical basis for the long held notion that GATT
exceptions can act as insurance. Trade negotiators have long argued that the inclusion of the most
popular sector specific tool—antidumping actions—is a pre-condition for the approval of any trade
agreement. The main result of the paper affirms this intuition by showing that there is an insurance
role for antidumping that had not been considered in the theoretical literature.
   We also show that there exist alternative instruments that also lead to improvements in welfare,
such as a set of lump sum taxes on all sectors coupled to a subsidy to the sector that receives the
shock. However, we believe there are two reasons why taxes and subsidies are not generally used
as insurance against price shocks. First, political economy reasons which make the imposition of
selective taxes non-attractive. Second, over the past twenty years there is considerable support for
the view that antidumping regulations have been captured by protectionist interests (Bhagwati,
1988; Krueger, 1995). Hence, from a protectionist viewpoint, the value of antidumping regulations
lies not only in its insurance aspects, but also in the fact that it can be manipulated.
   One limitation of this paper is that it does not show why exceptions are needed in order to
sign trade agreements. If protection is what is desired, why is that not included in the original

                                                             12
agreements? Another caveat is that out results should be interpreted as second best arguments for
contingent protection. As a first best, policy should always be directed at removing the sources of
distortion, if possible.
