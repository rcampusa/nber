                                         ABSTRACT

The welfare contributions of the digital economy, characterized by the proliferation of new and
free goods, are not well-measured in our current national accounts. We derive explicit terms for
the welfare contributions of these goods and introduce a new metric, GDP-B which quantifies
their benefits, rather than costs. We apply this framework to several empirical examples including
Facebook and smartphone cameras and estimate their valuations through incentive compatible
choice experiments. For example, including the welfare gains from Facebook would have added
between 0.05 and 0.11 percentage points to GDP-B growth per year in the US.

GDP-B: Accounting for the Value of New and Free Goods in the Digital Economy                2




“The welfare of a nation can scarcely be inferred from a measure of [GDP].”
                      – Simon Kuznets, 1934.


1. Introduction

We develop a new framework for measuring welfare change and real GDP growth
in the presence of new and free goods 1. The increased proliferation of such goods
is a key characteristic of the digital economy. New, sometimes very specialized,
goods appear with increasing rapidity, 2 and free goods (such as information and
entertainment services) are increasingly available at zero price, reflecting the very
low marginal costs of digital replication and distribution. Even when free goods
have an implicit price, 3 this price is not usually observed so a price of zero is
applied. Thus, the positive quantities of these goods that are consumed have a
measured price of zero and measured value of zero in the conventional national
accounts. Hence, they are not reflected in standard statistical agency reports for
GDP or related metrics like productivity, which are typically defined in terms of
GDP. Furthermore, despite GDP’s widespread use as a proxy for welfare, it is not
the correct metric for this purpose, at least as conventionally measured.


Our framework provides a means by which to understand the welfare
contributions from these goods and the potential mismeasurement that arises from
not fully accounting for them. We use this framework to derive an explicit term
that is the marginal value of a new good on welfare change, providing a means for
estimating welfare change mismeasurement if the good is omitted from statistical

  Goolsbee and Klenow (2018, Table 3), using Adobe Analytics data on online transactions for
millions of products across many different categories, find that roughly half the sales volume
online for 2014-2017 is for products that did not exist in the previous year.

agency collections. This can shed light on the debate regarding the potential of the
digital economy to generate productivity, economic growth and welfare gains. 4 If
measurement is lacking, through methodological challenges, statistical agency
budgets or data availability, then we are severely hampered in our ability to
understand the impact of new technologies, goods on the economy, and
consequently the prospects for future productivity, economic growth and
welfare. 5


A problem in assessing the full impact of the introduction of a new good on real
GDP growth is that we would really need national statistical offices to recalculate
their estimates of real GDP including the new goods with, for example, estimated
Hicksian reservation prices for the period before they are sold in positive
quantities; the reservation price of a good is the price which would induce a utility
maximizing potential purchaser of the product to demand zero units of it. 6
However, we are able to use our framework to derive a close approximation to the
addition to real GDP growth that would be required to account for the welfare
gains from the introduction of a new good, without having to recalculate the
official GDP numbers published by national statistical offices.


Free goods are addressed through generalizing the standard microeconomic model
of household cost minimization. It is then possible to re-work our welfare change
and real GDP growth adjustment terms to allow for there to be free goods. Our

new metric is labelled GDP-B, as it captures the benefits associated with new and
free goods and thus goes “beyond GDP”. 7 In addition, our calculations of GDP-B
make it easy to calculate a corresponding productivity metric, Productivity-B
which simply uses GDP-B as its numerator.


We provide several empirical examples of free digital goods where we quantify
these welfare and GDP growth adjustment terms. Specifically, we draw on the
work of Brynjolfsson, Collis and Eggers (2019) who developed an approach to
directly estimate consumer welfare by running massive online choice experiments.
They explored both hypothetical and incentive compatible choice experiments to
estimate willingness to accept values for giving up access to a good. While
hypothetical choice experiments might suffer from hypothetical bias, incentive
aligned choice experiments, which make choices consequential, have been shown
to be externally valid (Ding, Grewal and Liechty 2005; Ding 2007; Carson,
Groves and List 2014; Bishop et. al. 2017). We therefore constructed incentive
compatible discrete choice experiments to estimate the potential impact on
welfare growth by Facebook, a free social networking service which had rapid
diffusion and quickly accumulated many diverse users. We ran our experiments
on a representative sample of the US internet population recruited through an
online survey panel. We use the results to provide estimates of the adjustments to
welfare change and real GDP-B growth from Facebook’s launch in 2004 through
2017.




7
 See e.g. Jones and Klenow (2016), Coyle and Mitra-Kahn (2017), Corrado et al. (2017) and
Jorgenson (2018). Some national statistical offices are considering producing a spectrum of
expanded GDP measures. Heys (2018) presented options being considered by the UK Office of
National Statistics, which include incorporating welfare adjustments for private and publically
provided free goods. Our approach in this paper provides a way of doing this.
GDP-B: Accounting for the Value of New and Free Goods in the Digital Economy               5




In a laboratory setting in the Netherlands, we also ran incentive compatible choice
experiments to estimate the consumer welfare created by several other popular
digital goods, including Instagram, Snapchat, Skype, digital Maps, LinkedIn,
Twitter as well as Facebook. Although we did not have a representative sample of
the population in the laboratory, our results are indicative of the approximate size
of the adjustment term to real GDP-B growth which would need to be added to
account for the welfare gain from these digital goods.


We also show the need for properly adjusting for quality changes in calculating
GDP-B growth so that welfare changes are properly inferred. This issue is
particularly acute for smartphones which have substituted (to varying degrees) a
panoply of other devices including cameras, GPS, landline phones, gaming
consoles, ebook readers, personal computers, video and audio players,
maps/atlases, alarm clocks, calculators and sound recorders, 8 as well as numerous
new capabilities that previously were unavailable at any price like real-time traffic
and various types of social networking and messaging applications. What is more,
new features are added frequently and quality of existing features changes rapidly.
In fact, application developers conduct thousands of A/B tests every day and
tweak features to improve user experience. Groshen et al. (2017) discuss how the
US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) adjusts for quality changes using hedonic
methods. However, they mention that this approach is ruled out for smartphones
since the set of relevant characteristics for the hedonic models constantly keep on
changing. While there has been a subsequent development in that the BLS
commenced hedonic quality adjustments for smartphones from January 2018, 9

such explicit hedonic quality adjustment is still very limited internationally, with
the UK being a standout early adopter of this approach for smartphones,
commencing in 2011 (see Wells and Restieaux (2014)).


Hence, to advance understanding of the consumer benefits from quality change,
we conduct an incentive compatible BDM lottery study (Becker, DeGroot, and
Marschak 1964) in a university laboratory in the Netherlands to elicit consumers’
valuations for smartphone cameras. We find that there is a large difference
between the contribution of smartphone cameras towards conventionally-
measured GDP and the welfare generated by these cameras for consumers as
reflected in GDP-B. As a result, not accounting for quality adjustments in
smartphones leads to a significant underestimate of GDP-B growth.


The rest of the paper is organised as follows. The next section sets out some
preliminary definitions that will be used in the subsequent sections. Section 3
looks at the problem of new goods, and shows how the impact of new goods on
welfare change and real GDP growth can be estimated to a high degree of
approximation. Section 4 extends this framework to the case of free goods and
introduces our preferred measure, GDP-B. Section 5 provides the empirical
examples of Facebook and other popular free digital goods to quantify
adjustments to welfare change and GDP-B growth for not accounting for these
goods. Section 6 presents results from the smartphone camera laboratory study to
highlight potential biases due to not performing quality adjustments. Section 7
concludes with a summary and some implications.


2. Preliminaries
GDP-B: Accounting for the Value of New and Free Goods in the Digital Economy                        7




We assume that a consumer has a utility function, f(q), which is continuous,
quasiconcave and increasing in the components of the nonnegative quantity vector
q ≥ 0 N . For each strictly positive price vector p >> 0 N and each utility level u in
the range of f, we can define the dual cost function C as follows:


(1) C(u,p) ≡ min q {p⋅q ; f(q) ≥ u}.


We are given the price and quantity data, (pt, qt) for periods t = 0, 1. We assume
that the consumer minimizes the cost of achieving the utility level ut ≡ f(qt) for t =
0, 1 so observed expenditure in each period is equal to the minimum cost of
achieving the given utility level in each period; i.e., we have


(2) pt⋅qt = C(f(qt),pt) for t = 0, 1.


Valid measures of utility change over the two periods under consideration are the
following Hicksian equivalent and compensating variations (Hicks, 1942): 10


(3) Q E (q0, q1, p0) ≡ C(f(q1), p0) − C(f(q0), p0) ;
(4) Q C (q0, q1, p1) ≡ C(f(q1), p1) − C(f(q0), p1) .


The above variations are special cases of the following Samuelson (1974) family
of quantity variations: for p >> 0 N , define: 11

10
   These are Hick’s original definitions of equivalent and compensating variations. Hicks (1946,
331-332) appears to provide an alternative definition of the equivalent variation as C(f(q1), p1) −
C(f(q1), p0) and the compensating variation as C(f(q0), p1) − C(f(q0), p0). The existence of
alternative definitions has caused significant confusion in the literature; see Diewert (1992, p. 567,
footnote 10).
11
   These measures of overall quantity change are difference counterparts to the family of Allen
(1949) quantity indexes in normal ratio index number theory. The Allen quantity index for
reference price vector p is defined as the ratio C(f(q1), p)/C(f(q0), p).
GDP-B: Accounting for the Value of New and Free Goods in the Digital Economy                     8




(5) Q S (q0, q1, p) ≡ C(f(q1), p) − C(f(q0), p) .


Hence there is an entire family of cardinal measures of utility change defined by
(5), with one measure for each reference price vector p.


The variations defined by (3) and (4) are not observable (since C(f(q1), p0) and
C(f(q0), p1) are not observable) but the following Laspeyres and Paasche
variations, V L and V P , are observable:


(6) V L (p0, p1, q0, q1) ≡ p0⋅(q1 − q0) ;
(7) V P (p0, p1, q0, q1) ≡ p1⋅(q1 − q0) .


Note that V L and V P are difference counterparts to the Laspeyres and Paasche
quantity indexes, Q L = p0⋅q1/p0⋅q0 and Q P = p1⋅q1/p1⋅q0, respectively. Hicks (1942)
showed that V L approximates Q E and V P approximates Q C to the accuracy of a
first order Taylor series approximation; see also Diewert and Mizobuchi (2009;
345-346). The observable Bennet (1920) variation or indicator of quantity change
V B is defined as the arithmetic average of the Laspeyres and Paasche variations in
(6) and (7):


(8) V B (p0, p1, q0, q1) ≡ ½(p0 + p1)⋅(q1 − q0)
                      = p0⋅(q1 − q0) + ½(p1 − p0)⋅(q1 − q0)

                      = VL ( p 0 ,p1 ,q 0 ,q1 ) +           ( p n1 − p n 0 )( q n1 − q n 0 ) .
                                                    1 N
                                                    2
                                                      ∑ n=1
GDP-B: Accounting for the Value of New and Free Goods in the Digital Economy                       9




Thus the Bennet variation is equal to the Laspeyres variation V L (p0, p1, q0, q1)
plus a sum of N Harberger (1971) consumer surplus triangles of the form
(1/2)(p n 1 − p n 0)(q n 1 − q n 0).


An alternative decomposition of the Bennet variation is the following one:


(9) V B (p0,p1,q0,q1) ≡ ½(p0 + p1)⋅(q1 − q0)
                          = p1⋅(q1 − q0) − ½(p1 − p0)⋅(q1 − q0)

                          = VP ( p 0 ,p1 ,q 0 ,q1 ) −            p 1 − p n 0 )( q n1 − q n 0 ) .
                                                            n=1 ( n
                                                        1 N
                                                        2
                                                          ∑

Thus the Bennet variation is also equal to the Paasche variation V P (p0, p1, q0, q1)
minus a sum of N Harberger consumer surplus triangles of the form (1/2)(p n 1 −
p n 0)(q n 1 − q n 0).


It is possible to relate the observable Bennet variation to a theoretically valid
Samuelson variation of the form defined by (5). However, in order to do this, we
need to assume a specific functional form for the consumer’s cost function, C(u,
p). If the cost function has a flexible, 12 translation-homothetic normalized
quadratic functional form, then Proposition 1 in Diewert and Mizobuchi (2009;
353) relates the observable Bennet variation, V B (p0, p1, q0, q1) defined by (8) or
(9) to the unobservable equivalent and compensating variations defined by (3) and
(4); i.e., we have the following exact equality:


(10) V B (p0, p1, q0, q1) = ½Q E (q0, q1, p0) + ½Q C (q0, q1, p1).


12
  Diewert (1974) defined a flexible functional form as one that provides a second order
approximation to a twice continuously differentiable function at a point.
GDP-B: Accounting for the Value of New and Free Goods in the Digital Economy                    10




That is, with certain assumptions on the functional form for the consumer’s cost
function (and using normalized price vectors), the observable Bennet variation
can be shown to be exactly equal to the arithmetic average of the unobservable
equivalent and compensating variations. 13 Hence, there is a strong justification
from an economic perspective for using the Bennet quantity variation. Also, it has
a strong justification from an axiomatic perspective (Diewert, 2005).


Finally, we can note that value change can be decomposed into Bennet quantity
and price variations, as follows:


(11) p1⋅q1 – p0⋅q0 = V B (p0, p1, q0, q1) + I B (p0, p1, q0, q1),


where V B (p0, p1, q0, q1) ≡ ½(p0 + p1)⋅(q1 − q0) and I B (p0, p1, q0, q1) ≡ ½(q0 +
q1)⋅(p1 − p0). Equation (11) can thus provide a decomposition into quantity and
price components for any value change, including a change in nominal GDP.


3. The New Goods Problem


We can now apply the above results to measure the benefits of the introduction of
a new good to a consumer who cannot purchase the good in period 0 but can
purchase it in period 1. First, we have to make an additional assumption. We


13
  Normalized prices are needed for this result to be true: “If there is a great deal of general
inflation between periods 0 and 1, then the compensating variation will be much larger than the
equivalent variation simply due to this general inflation, and an average of these two variations
will be difficult to interpret due to the change in the scale of prices. To eliminate the effects of
general inflation between the two periods being compared, it will be useful to scale the prices in
each period by a fixed basket price index of the form α·P, where α ≡ [α1, . . . , αN] > 0N is a
nonnegative, nonzero vector of price weights.” Diewert and Mizobuchi (2009, 352-353). They
recommend choosing α so that a fixed-base Laspeyres price index is used to deflate nominal
prices (footnote 34, page 368).
GDP-B: Accounting for the Value of New and Free Goods in the Digital Economy                          11




assume that there is a shadow or reservation price for the new good in period 0
that will cause the consumer to consume 0 units of the new good in period 0. This
type of assumption dates back to Hicks (1940; 114). 14


Let the new good be indexed by the subscript 0 and let the N dimensional vectors
of period t prices and quantities for the continuing goods be denoted by pt and qt
for t = 0,1. The period 1 quantity of good 0 purchased during period 1 is also
observed and is denoted by q 0 1. The period 0 reservation price for good 0 is not
observed but we make some sort of estimate for it, denoted as p 0 0* > 0. The period
0 quantity is observed and is equal to 0; i.e., q 0 0 = 0. Thus the price and quantity
data (for the N+1 goods) for period 0 is represented by the 1+N dimensional
vectors (p 0 0*, p0) and (0, q0) and the price and quantity data for period 1 is
represented by the 1+N dimensional vectors (p 0 1,p1) and (q 0 1, q1). We adapt our
first expression for the Bennet variation, (8), to accommodate the new good. We
find that our new Bennet variation is equal to the following expression:


(12) V B ([p 0 0*, p0], [p 0 1, p1], [0, q0], [q 0 1, q1])
        = ½(p0 + p1)⋅(q1 − q0) + ½(p 0 0* + p 0 1)(q 0 1 − 0)
        = p0⋅(q1 − q0) + ½(p1 − p0)⋅(q1 − q0) + p 0 1(q 0 1 − 0) − ½(p 0 1 − p 0 0*) (q 0 1 − 0)
        = p0⋅(q1 − q0) + ½(p1 − p0)⋅(q1 − q0) + p 0 1q 0 1 − ½(p 0 1 − p 0 0*)q 0 1.


From the last equation on the right hand side of (12), we see that the first term,
p0⋅(q1 − q0) is simply the change in consumption valued at the real prices of period


14
   There is now quite a literature on this topic and for alternative approximate welfare gain
estimates; see Hausman (1981) (1996), Feenstra (1994) and Diewert and Feenstra (2017), and the
references in these publications. Diewert has been applying the above Hicksian reservation
analysis in the ratio context (i.e., in the context of the true cost of living index) for a long time; see
Diewert (1980; 498-505), (1987; 378) (1998; 51-54). A weakness in these theories is the difficulty
in determining the appropriate reservation prices.

0, a Laspeyres variation as in (6); the second term, ½(p1 − p0)⋅(q1 − q0), is the
sum of the consumer surplus terms associated with the continuing goods; the next
term, p 0 1q 0 1, is the value of consumption of the new good in period 1, valued at
the price for good 0 in period 1 (this is the usual price times quantity contribution
term to the value of real consumption of the new good in period 1 which would be
recorded as a contribution to period 1 GDP); and the last term, − ½(p 0 1 − p 0 0*)q 0 1
= ½(p 0 0* − p 0 1)q 0 1 is the additional consumer surplus contribution of good 0 to
overall welfare change, which would not be recorded as a contribution to GDP.
Note that the first two terms are a measure of the welfare change we would get by
just ignoring the new good in both periods. Thus the last two terms give the
overall contribution to welfare change due to the introduction of the new good.


If we assume that the reservation price for the new good in period 0, p 0 0*, is equal
to the observable price for the new good in period 1, p 0 1, then the last term in (12),
the consumer surplus term for the new good, vanishes. However, it is likely that
the reservation price for period 0, p 0 0*, is much higher than the corresponding
actual price for good 0 in period 1, p 0 1. 15 Thus if we assume that p 0 0* = p 0 1 and
evaluate (12), then the downward bias in the resulting Bennet measure of welfare
change will be equal to a Harberger-type triangle, − ½(p 0 1 − p 0 0*)(q 0 1 – 0) =
½(p 0 0* − p 0 1)q 0 1.


It is of interest to gauge the extent to which GDP growth is underestimated by not
fully capturing the introduction of the new good. As comparisons may be made
between periods far apart (e.g. before the introduction of the good and the most
recent period), we will now be explicit about the point raised in footnote 13 of
section 2; value change comparisons are difficult to interpret if the values are not
15
  Hausman (1996) argued that for cereals, the reservation price was about twice the price at the
introduction of the new good, whereas Feenstra (1994) takes it to be infinity.
GDP-B: Accounting for the Value of New and Free Goods in the Digital Economy                      13




expressed in comparable units. Hence, we recommend using real prices where, for
example, the base period’s prices are inflated by using the Consumer Price Index
(CPI) to put them into comparable units with the current period’s prices. 16


Let γ denote one plus the rate of growth of the CPI between periods 0 and 1
(which may not be adjacent periods). 17 Then, adapting a result from Diewert
(2005; 335), value change can be expressed as follows, where P and Q are price
and quantity indexes, respectively, that satisfy P x Q = p1⋅q1/p0⋅q0. 18


(13) p1⋅q1 – γp0⋅q0 = γp0⋅q0[p1⋅q1/ γ p0⋅q0 – 1]
                       = γp0⋅q0[PQ/γ – 1]
                       = ½ γp0⋅q0[ 2PQ – 2] where P ≡ P/γ,
                       = ½ γp0⋅q0[(1+Q)( P –1) + (1+ P)(Q – 1)]




16
   Alternatively, we could deflate current prices to put them into the same units as the earlier
period. Having units in a distant past period is, however, typically more difficult to interpret than
using current period units. We recommend putting values into comparable units for both welfare
and GDP growth adjustments, especially in high inflation environments or if periods are far apart
in time. Similarly for spatial comparisons.
17
   We prefer to use the CPI rather than the GDP deflator for adjusting for general inflation, as the
GDP deflator behaves perversely if import prices change. This is because the immediate effect of
e.g. a fall in import prices is to increase the deflator; see Kohli (1982; 211). Also, Diewert (2002;
556, footnote 14) noted the following: “An example of this anomalous behavior of the GDP
deflator just occurred in the advance release of gross domestic product for the third quarter of
2001 for the US national income and product accounts: the chain type price indexes for C, L, X
and M decreased (at annual rates) over the previous quarter by 0.4%, 0.2%, 1.4% and 17.4%
respectively but yet the overall GDP deflator increased by 2.1 %. Thus there was general deflation
in all sectors of the economy but yet the overall GDP deflator increased. This is difficult to explain
to the public!”
18
   That is, the formulae for the indexes P and Q are such that the product test from the axiomatic
approach to index
numbers is satisfied.
GDP-B: Accounting for the Value of New and Free Goods in the Digital Economy            14




We can see that (13) can be decomposed into two components, a price change
indicator, I E , and a quantity change indicator, V E : 19


(14) I E = ½ γp0⋅q0 (1+Q)(P – 1);


(15) V E = ½ γp0⋅q0 (1+ P)(Q – 1)


If P (in P ≡ P/γ) and Q are replaced by superlative indexes, 20 such as the Fisher or
Törnqvist, then the resulting indicators in (14) and (15) can also be called
superlative. A corollary of Proposition 9 of Diewert (2005; 338) is that the
Bennet indicator of quantity change approximates any superlative indicator to the
second order at any point where the two quantity vectors are equal and where the
two price vectors are equal.


The U.S. uses the superlative Fisher quantity index (the geometric mean of the
Laspeyres and Paasche indexes given in section 2) for constructing real GDP, so
we consider the following expression for the Fisher superlative quantity change
indicator, V E F:


(16) V E F ≡ ½ γp0⋅q0 (1+ PF)(QF − 1) ≈ ½( γp0 + p1)⋅(q1 − q0) = V B ,


where PF ≡ PF/γ, where PF ≡ [(p1⋅q0/p0⋅q0)(p1⋅q1/p0⋅q1)]1/2 is the Fisher price index,
or GDP deflator in our context, γ is one plus the growth rate of the CPI between
periods 0 and 1, and QF ≡ [(p0⋅q1/p0⋅q0)(p1⋅q1/p1⋅q0)]1/2 is the Fisher quantity index,


19
   Diewert (2005; 333-337) derived these indicators in introducing the economic approach to
indicators of price and quantity change, and called them “economic” indicators. Hence, the
subscript “E” stands for “economic”.
20
   See Diewert (1976) on superlative index numbers.
GDP-B: Accounting for the Value of New and Free Goods in the Digital Economy                    15




or real GDP growth in our context, and V B is the Bennet quantity indicator where
the price weights have been adjusted for general inflation. 21 Recall that the
Bennet indicator of quantity change is the symmetric arithmetic average of first-
order approximations to the Hicksian equivalent and compensating variations of
equations (3) and (4). Alternatively, under the Diewert-Mizobuchi (2009)
assumptions on the functional form for the consumer’s cost function, the Bennet
indicator is exactly equal to the arithmetic average of the equivalent and
compensating variations. Hence, the Fisher superlative quantity change indicator,
V E F in (16), can be interpreted as an approximation to a welfare change indicator,
VB.


Re-arranging (16), we get an expression for an approximation to the Fisher
quantity index:


(17) QF ≈ [(γp0 + p1)⋅(q1 − q0)]/[ γp0⋅q0 (1+PF)] +1


Note that the numerator is two times the Bennet variation, V B . Allowing for new
goods, from (12) we have the following:


(18) 2V B = 2γp0⋅(q1 − q0) + (p1 − γp0)⋅(q1 − q0) + 2p 0 1q 0 1 − (p 0 1 − γp 0 0*)q 0 1




21
  If real GDP growth is not constructed using a superlative index such as the Fisher, but rather
using e.g. a Laspeyres index as is standard in many countries, there will still be an approximation
as in (16), but it may not be as accurate.
GDP-B: Accounting for the Value of New and Free Goods in the Digital Economy                    16




Then replace the numerator in (17) with (18). If QF omits the new good in period
0, then the (approximate) amount missing from QF is (γp 0 0* − p 0 1)q 0 1/[γp0⋅q0
(1+PF)], which can simply be added to QF if p 0 0* is known or can be estimated. 22


Real GDP growth can then be adjusted, to a second-order approximation, for not
fully capturing the introduction of a new good as follows:


(19) GDP-N = QF + (γp 0 0* − p 0 1)q 0 1/[γp0⋅q0 (1+ PF))


where GDP-N denotes GDP growth adjusted for the introduction new goods.


4. The Free Goods Problem


Consider a household whose preferences over N market goods and M goods that
are available to the household with no visible charge can be represented by the
utility function f(q, z) where q ≥ 0 N and z ≥ 0 M are vectors which represent the
consumption of market goods and of free goods respectively. We assume that f(q,
z) is defined over the nonnegative orthant in RN+M and has the following
properties: (i) continuity, (ii) quasiconcave in q and y and (iii) f(q, z) is increasing
if all components of q increase and increasing if all components of z increase.


We define two cost or expenditure functions that are dual to f. The first cost
function is the consumer’s regular cost function, C(u, p, w), that is the solution to
the following cost minimization problem which assumes (hypothetically) that the

22
  Note that this assumes that we are either able to adjust the GDP deflator, PF, and the CPI, γ, for
the price changes in new goods, or that such goods have negligible net impact on these inflation
measures. This may depend on how these respective indexes have been constructed. See Diewert,
Fox and Schreyer (2018) for expressions of biases in Laspeyres, Paasche, Törnqvist and Fisher
indexes arising from not appropriately accounting for new and disappearing goods.
GDP-B: Accounting for the Value of New and Free Goods in the Digital Economy         17




household faces positive prices for market and free goods so that p >> 0 N and w
>> 0 M in (1): 23


(20) C(u, p, w) ≡ min q, z {p⋅q + w⋅z: f(q, z) ≥ u, q ≥ 0 N , z ≥ 0 M }.


We also define the household’s conditional cost function, c(u, p, z), which is the
solution to the cost minimization problem defined by (21) below, where the
household minimizes the cost of market goods needed to achieve utility level u,
conditional on having the vector z ≥ 0 M of free goods at its disposal:


(21) c(u, p, z) ≡ min q {p⋅q: f(q, z) ≥ u, q ≥ 0 N }.


It can be shown (using feasibility arguments) that c(u, p, z) has the following
properties where u∈Range f, p >> 0 N , and z ≥ 0 M : (i) for fixed u and z, c(u, p, z)
is nonnegative and linearly homogeneous, concave and nondecreasing in p and
(ii) for fixed u and p, c(u, p, z) is nonincreasing and convex in z. If in addition, f(q,
z) is linearly homogeneous in q and z (the homothetic preferences case), then c(u,
p, z) is linearly homogeneous in u, z for fixed p.


If the household faced positive prices w >> 0 M for its “free” goods, then the
regular cost function minimization problem defined by (20) could be decomposed
into a two stage minimization problem using the conditional cost function c; i.e.,
we have, using definition (20):


(22) C(u, p, w) ≡ min q, z {p⋅q + w⋅z: f(q, z) ≥ u; q ≥ 0 N , z ≥ 0 M }
                  = min z {c(u, p, z) + w⋅z: z ≥ 0 M }.

23
     We assume u is in the range of f(q, z).
GDP-B: Accounting for the Value of New and Free Goods in the Digital Economy    18




Suppose z* ≥ 0 M solves the cost minimization problem that is defined in the
second line of (22) and suppose further that c(u, p, z*) is differentiable with
respect to the components of z at z = z*. Then the first order necessary conditions
for z* to solve the cost minimization problem imply that the following first order
conditions hold:


(23) ∇ z c(u, p, z*) = −w .


With z = z*, we can go to the cost minimization problem defined by (21) and find
a q solution which we denote by q*; i.e., q* is a solution to:


(24) min q {p⋅x: f(q, z*) ≥ u, q ≥ 0 N }.


It can be seen that (q*, z*) is a solution to the regular cost minimization problem
defined by (20) so that:


(25) C(u, p, w) ≡ min q, z {p⋅q + w⋅z: f(q, z) ≥ u, q ≥ 0 N , z ≥ 0 M }
              = p⋅q* + w⋅z*.


Thus the imputed marginal valuation prices w ≡ −∇ z c(u, p, z*) ≥ 0 M are
appropriate prices to use when valuing the services of free goods in order to
construct cost of living indexes or measures of money metric utility change.


Note that due to the fact that c(u, p, z) is decreasing and convex in the
components of z, the marginal price for an additional unit of z m , w m (u, p, z) ≡
GDP-B: Accounting for the Value of New and Free Goods in the Digital Economy                   19




−∂c(u, p, z)/∂z m , will be nonincreasing in z m ; i.e., it will usually decrease as we
add extra units of z m to the household’s holdings of free goods. 24


We define “global” willingness to pay measures for free goods using the
conditional cost function. Consider a household that holds no free goods, has
utility u* = f(q*,0 M ) where q* is the observed market goods consumption vector
and the household faces the vector of market goods prices p. We assume that the
household minimizes the market cost of achieving its utility level so that p⋅q* =
c(u*,p,0 M ). Now suppose that the household acquires the vector of free goods z* >
0 M . Since c(u*, p, z) is decreasing in z, the amount of income that the household
would require to attain the same level of utility u* is reduced to c(u*,p, z*) <
c(u*,p,0 M ). Thus in theory, the consumer should be willing to pay c(u*,p,0 M ) −
c(u*,p, z*) to acquire the bundle of free goods z*. Thus define the “global”
willingness to pay function for the acquisition of z* as follows:


(26) W P (u*,p, z*) ≡ c(u*,p,0 M ) − c(u*,p, z*).


If the household holds the amount z** > 0 M of free goods, then we can develop an
analogous willingness to accept measure as follows. Let q** denote the
household’s observed market goods consumption vector and we again assume that
the household faces the vector of market goods prices p. Let u** ≡ f(q**,z**). We
assume that the household minimizes the market cost of achieving its utility level
u** so that p⋅q** = c(u**, p, z**). Now suppose that the household disposes of its
vector of free goods z**. The amount of income that the household would require


24
  If consumers can have the free good in unlimited amounts, then its price will be zero. However,
even if the price is zero, if quality improves, the marginal willingness to pay for the improved
quality will be positive, hence wm(u, p, z) will be greater than zero. We thank Marshall Reinsdorf
for this point.
GDP-B: Accounting for the Value of New and Free Goods in the Digital Economy                     20




to attain the same level of utility u** is increased to c(u**,p,0 M ) > c(u**,z**). Thus
in theory, the consumer should be willing to sell its free goods for the amount
c(u**, p, 0 M ) − c(u**, z**), i.e. the amount that they would accept for giving up the
free goods. Thus define the “global” willingness to accept function, for the
disposal of z** as follows:


(27) W A (u**, p, z**) ≡ c(u**, p, 0 M ) − c(u**, p, z**).


For welfare measurement purposes, it is useful to define marginal willingness to
accept functions. Thus let e m be a unit vector of dimension M with a 1 in
component m and zeros elsewhere for m = 1,...,M. Assume that the household
holds z ≥ 1 M units of the free goods, faces market prices p, has q > 0 N units of
market goods and p⋅q = c(u, p, z) where u = f(q, z). Define the mth marginal
willingness to accept function, W m (u, p, z) as follows:


(28) W m (u, p, z) ≡ c(u, p, z−e m ) − c(u, p, z) ; m = 1,...,M.


Survey, experimental or indirect methods can be used in order to obtain
approximate measures for these marginal willingness to accept functions. Let W(u,
p, z) denote the vector [W 1 (u, p, z),...,W M (u, p, z)]. It can be seen that W(u, p, z)
is a discrete approximation to the marginal valuation price vector w ≡ −∇ z c(u, p,
z) that was defined earlier by (23). 25


Assuming that we have valuations for the free goods, we can extend the Bennet
welfare change variation of (12) to include these goods. Following the set up for


25
  If zm = 0, then we need to change the definition of Wm(u, p, z) ≡ c(u, p, z−em) − c(u, p, z) to the
corresponding marginal willingness to pay function, Wm*(u, p, z) ≡ c(u, p, z) − c(u, p, z+em).
GDP-B: Accounting for the Value of New and Free Goods in the Digital Economy                    21




regular goods in the previous section, let a new “free” good be indexed by the
subscript 0 and let the N dimensional vectors of period t prices and quantities for
the continuing goods be denoted by wt and zt for t = 0,1. The period 1 quantity of
good 0 purchased during period 1 is also observed and is denoted by z 0 1. The
period 0 reservation price for good 0 is not directly observed but we make an
estimate for it, denoted as w 0 0* > 0. The period 0 quantity is observed and is equal
to 0; i.e., z 0 0 = 0. Thus the price and quantity data (for the N+1 goods) for period
0 is represented by the 1+N dimensional vectors (w 0 0*, w0) and (0, z0) and the
price and quantity data for period 1 is represented by the 1+N dimensional vectors
(w 0 1,w1) and (z 0 1, z1).


Then, in an extension of (12), welfare change including both new and free goods
can be written as follows, where we again adjust period 0 prices by the one plus
the growth rate of the CPI between periods 0 and 1, γ:


(29) V B = γp0⋅(q1 − q0) + ½(p1 − γp0)⋅(q1 − q0) + p 0 1q 0 1 − ½(p 0 1 − γp 0 0*)q 0 1
         + γw0⋅(z1 − z0) + ½(w1 − γw0)⋅(z1 − z0) + w 0 1z 0 1 − ½(w 0 1 − γw 0 0*)z 0 1,


where the second line gives the contribution of the continuing and entering “free”
goods.


If the concern is that real GDP omits the contribution from continuing free goods,
then we can use the results of the previous section and re-write (19) to adjust real
GDP growth, QF, as follows to reflect the welfare effects of free goods: 26




26
  Welfare change in (29) should also be adjusted for general inflation, especially if inflation is
high or if the periods being compared are far apart in time, and similarly for spatial comparisons.
GDP-B: Accounting for the Value of New and Free Goods in the Digital Economy                     22




(30) GDP-F = QF + [2γw0⋅(z1 − z0) + (w1 − γw0)⋅(z1 − z0) + 2w 0 1z 0 1]/[ γp0⋅q0 (1+
PF)),
where GDP-F denotes GDP growth adjusted for free goods. 27


Including both regular and free new goods, we get the following expression for
our adjusted real GDP growth:
(31) GDP-B = QF + (γp 0 0* − p 0 1)q 0 1/[γp0⋅q0 (1+ PF)]
                           + [2γw0⋅(z1 − z0) + (w1 − γw0)⋅(z1 − z0) + 2γw 0 1z 0 1] /[γp0⋅q0
         (1+ PF)]
                           + (γw 0 0* − w 0 1)z 0 1/[γp0⋅q0 (1+ PF)),
where the first line of (31) is the adjustment arising from the entry of a new good,
the second line is an additional contribution from accounting for continuing free
goods, and the third line is the adjustment term arising from the entry of a new
free good. 28 Thus GDP-B denotes GDP growth adjusted for new and free goods. 29
As GDP-B in (31) nests GDP-N from (19) and GDP-F from (3), we propose this
as the generic term for these types of measures.


An alternative, simpler, approach to adjusting GDP for free goods is as follows.
Using equation (25), we can define total income (T) as follows:


(32) T ≡ C(u, p, w) = p⋅q* + w⋅z*,




27
   Note that this assumes that we are either able to adjust the GDP deflator, PF, and the CPI, γ, for
the price changes in continuing free goods, or that such goods have negligible net impact on these
inflation measures.
28
   Obviously, (31) can easily be generalized to the case of multiple new regular and free goods.
29
   The “B” in GDP-B can be thought of as standing for the “benefits” arising from new and free
goods, or “beyond”, as in the literature promoting broader measures of economic wellbeing
“beyond GDP”.
GDP-B: Accounting for the Value of New and Free Goods in the Digital Economy                       23




where (q*,z*) is a solution to the cost minimization problem with positive prices w
>> 0 M for the “free” goods. Hence, (32) gives the total income required so that a
certain level of utility can be attained through the consumption of market and free
goods. Then w⋅z* is the amount a consumer should be willing to pay to acquire the
bundle of free goods z*; see the willingness to pay function of equation (26).
Alternatively, w⋅z* is the amount of income needed to compensate for giving up
the consumption of free goods, while maintaining the same level of utility; see the
willingness to accept function of equation (27). Deflating the resulting nominal
total income growth between periods 0 and 1, T1/T0, by the GDP deflator, P, gives
real total income growth, GDP-B T :


(33) GDP-B T ≡ (T1/T0)/P


The GDP deflator will typically be the wrong deflator, as it does not take into
account new (and disappearing) goods, which would usually mean that the
deflator is too high. 30 The resulting quantity index then provides a lower bound
estimate on the actual real growth rate. 31


This total income approach has the advantage of not needing the period 0
reservation price for any new good, as the quantity consumed of the good in this
period is 0 so that T0 = p0⋅q0.



30
   This is because new goods typically fall in price after their introduction. Also, note that by using
the GDP deflator here, there is an implicit assumption that an appropriate reservation price for the
free good is the price observed in period 1 carried back to period 0. This is the carry-backward
method discussed by Diewert, Fox and Schreyer (2018).
31
   Diewert, Fox and Schreyer (2019) have subsequently generalized this Total Income approach to
consider non-free new goods. They show that, under some assumptions, the difference between
GDP-B in (33) and standard GDP can be interpreted as the amount by which a maximum overlap
quantity index (as typically calculated by national statistical offices) understates an approximate
“true” Fisher index calculated using reservation prices for the new goods.
GDP-B: Accounting for the Value of New and Free Goods in the Digital Economy     24




To summarize, GDP-B describes the extension of GDP to incorporate consumer
benefits arising from digital goods, as measured through experiment evidence.
Our first method (equation 31) uses this experimental evidence on consumer
valuations to derive an extension of GDP which is consistent with standard
Hicksian concepts of welfare change. Our second (“total income”) method
(equation 33) extends GDP by including the extra income needed to achieve the
same level of utility without the digital goods as with the digital goods.


Just as our approach makes it possible to calculate GDP-B in a way that accounts
for new and free goods, it is straightforward to calculate an alternative measure of
labor productivity by dividing GDP-B by hours worked. To distinguish it from
conventionally-measured productivity, one can label this new metric Productivity-
B.


5. Empirical Examples of GDP-B Applied to Free Digital Goods
In this section we apply our methodology to study the welfare gains generated by
free digital goods. First, we consider the case of Facebook, using online choice
experiments to elicit user valuations. Then we consider the valuation of a broader
range of digital goods, using laboratory experiments in the Netherlands.


a) Valuing Facebook in the US
To estimate the consumer welfare created by Facebook, we conducted incentive
compatible discrete choice experiments on a representative sample of the US
internet population. Specifically, we set quotas for gender, age, and US regions to
match US census data (File and Ryan 2014) and applied post-stratification for
education and household income to obtain our sample. Because our focus is on
Facebook users, we disqualified participants who did not use Facebook in the
GDP-B: Accounting for the Value of New and Free Goods in the Digital Economy                   25




previous twelve months (but we can account for the overall number of Facebook
users using secondary data).


In the experiment, each participant was asked to make a single discrete choice
between two options: 1) keep access to Facebook or 2) give up Facebook for one
month and get paid $E. We allocated participants randomly to one of twelve price
points: E = (1, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 1000). Before participants
made the decision, we informed them that their decisions were consequential such
that we would randomly pick one out of every 200 participants and fulfil that
person’s selection (Ding, Grewal and Liechty 2005; Ding 2007; Carson, Groves
and List 2014). We also informed them about how we can monitor their Facebook
online status remotely. In order to check if the selected participants gave up
Facebook and qualified for the payment, we monitored their online status on
Facebook for 30 days. 32


We recruited respondents through an online professional panel provider, Research
Now, 33 during the year 2016-17. 34 A total of 2885 participants completed the
study including at least 200 participants per price point. We targeted consumers
that were 18 years or older and lived in the US. We further asked consumers to
select all online services they have used in the last twelve months from a list of 14
options, including a non-existent online service which we used as an attention
check. We selected Facebook users for this study and disqualified users who
selected the non-existent service. Participants were randomly allocated to one of

34
   These experiments are also reported in Brynjolfsson, Collis and Eggers (2019). In this paper, we
combine the studies conducted in summer 2016 and summer 2017 to come up with estimates for
the year 2016-17.
GDP-B: Accounting for the Value of New and Free Goods in the Digital Economy                      26




the price points and we combine responses from all participants to estimate the
demand curve.


We fitted a binary logit model to the participants’ decisions using the monetary
values (in log scale) as predictors. Figure 1 shows the observed shares of
participants willing to keep Facebook and the fitted line according to the logit
model. According to the model, the median willingness-to-accept (WTA) price
for giving up Facebook for one month is $42.17 (bootstrapped 95% confidence
interval = [$32.53; 54.47]). 35


Next, we provide an empirical illustration of the theoretical framework for free
goods provided in Section 4. We consider the period from 2003 to 2017;
Facebook was founded in 2003-04 and hence became a new free good that year.
In our notation of the previous section, 2003 is then period 0 and 2017 is period 1.
Assuming a simple linear relationship, the median WTA for Facebook in 2017
($42.17/month), translates to (w 0 1=) $506.04/year ([390.36; 653.64]). 36 Note that
this is price for giving up the 2017 version of Facebook, which includes all its
attributes at the time, including the number of users, or size of the social network.
We also need to determine the reservation price for Facebook in 2003 (w 0 0*);
recall that the reservation price is the price which would induce a utility
maximizing potential purchaser of a good to demand zero units of it. Here the
good which is having its demand reduced to zero is the 2017 version of Facebook.


35
   This “willingness to accept” price corresponds to the global willingness to accept function in
equation (27) of Section 4. That is, it is the income needed in compensation for giving up the free
good if the same utility level is to be maintained.
36
   Brynjolfsson et al. (2019), find that the relationship between valuation and time period is
roughly log-linear and not linear, i.e. valuation for 1 year is a less than 12 times valuation for 1
month. Using hypothetical choice experiments, we find that it is closer to 10 times the valuation
for 1 month. Here we assume a linear relationship for simplicity since it is not feasible to do a one-
year incentive compatible study for Facebook.

Following Hausman (1996), we could consider a reservation price of twice the
median WTA (deflated to 2003 dollars); the reservation price for before the 2004
launch of Facebook is a then (w 0 0*= 2w 0 1/γ ≈) $780. This is likely to be a very
conservative estimate. Note that the observed demand curve in Figure 1 reflects a
much higher reservation price. In fact, there is a significant portion of the sample
(>20%) which values Facebook at more than $1,000 per month. Apple-Cinnamon
Cheerios, the product considered by Hausman, can be regarded as quite different
to Facebook; it is a new variety of breakfast cereal with plenty of close substitutes,
whereas Facebook can be characterized as a novel product. 37 In contrast to the
low reservation price from applying Hausman’s estimate, the approach of
Feenstra (1994) uses a CES framework which requires that all reservation prices
are infinity. This seems unreasonably high in our context. 38




37
   Reinsdorf and Schreyer (2017, p. 5) note the following regarding the consequences for
consumer price inflation of delaying the price measurement of such products: “…novel products
may initially exhibit distinctive price change behaviour. The most common pattern is for prices of
truly novel products to decline quickly at first, so the bias is upward.”
38
   “Thus the CES methodology may overstate the benefits of increases in product availability.”
Diewert and Feenstra (2017, p.3).

                     Figure 1: WTA demand curve for Facebook




Hence, we focus on an alternative approach and estimate the intercept term in a
linear regression of WTA on the corresponding share of users who keep Facebook,
as plotted in Figure 1; this is the estimate of the monthly WTA that gives a share
of zero. Our estimate is from a regression that omits the two extreme observations,
for E = $1 and E = $1,000 (p-value = 0.0000, R2=0.88). 39 At extreme values, even
a small number of noisy responses will disproportionately affect the reservation

39
  We also estimated a regression using all observations. This resulted in a poorer fit (p-value =
0.0038, R2=0.52) and a much higher estimate of the reservation price ($8,126 in 2003$). Using
this higher estimate, we would find that the contribution to welfare change over the period 2003-
17 is $1,013 billion (in 2017$) which translates to an average of $72 billion per year. Per user, the
welfare change over the period 2003-17 is $5,018 which translates to $358.48 on average per year.
GDP-B: Accounting for the Value of New and Free Goods in the Digital Economy                      29




price. Multiplying the estimate by twelve yields the 2017 annual reservation price
and deflating, using the CPI, yields the reservation price in 2003 dollars. Using
this approach, we estimate the reservation price (w 0 0*) to be $2,152 in 2003
dollars.


The estimated contribution to welfare due to Facebook in the U.S. over the period
2003-17 is $231 billion (in 2017$) which translates to $16 billion on average per
year. 40 The per user welfare gain over the period 2003-17 is $1,143. Considering
that this is a single new service, this estimate is substantial. 41 At the same time,
given that the definition of users is that they access their Facebook account via
any device at least once per month and the average user is Facebook for more
than 40 minutes per day, 42 then this estimate does not seem excessive.


Next we turn to GDP-B growth to get an idea of the change that would result from
extending the usual definition of GDP to include a free service such as Facebook.
From the last line of equation (31) of Section 4, we have the following:

41
   Note that we are not accumulating benefits from the years in between 2003 and 2017. We are
simply comparing the welfare change between two periods: 2003 when Facebook did not exist and
2017 when the 2017 version existed. The comparison between these two years, as opposed to any
of the intervening years, is of interest as there was no close substitute to any subsequent version of
Facebook in 2003. In the intervening years, if each version of Facebook, with increasing network
size, is treated as a new good then we would need to also model the impact of the exiting versions
of Facebook. We do not have the valuations required to do such a study.

Adjustment to real GDP-B growth from accounting for Facebook over 2003-2017
        = (γw 0 0* − w 0 1)z 0 1/[γp0⋅q0 (1+ PF)]
        = (γw 0 0* − w 0 1) x No. of Facebook users in US in 2017 / γ(Nominal GDP
        in 2003)(1+ PF)


The GDP adjustment is a lower bound on the amount to add to GDP-B growth
using this approach because we use official estimates of γ and PF (which are
unadjusted for the introduction of new goods) in the denominator. Normally, γ
and PF would be lower if we account for the fact that the price of the new goods
typically fall following their introduction. 43


From Table 1, for the reservation price of w 0 0* = $2,152 in 2003, accounting for
Facebook would increase real GDP-B growth by 1.54 percentage points from
2003 to 2017 (or, using the 95% CI estimates of w 0 1: [1.44, 1.62]). In other words,
this amounts to an increase in real GDP-B growth of 0.11 percentage points on
average per year over this period and an identical increase in Productivity-B. Real
GDP grew by 28.82% and real GDP-B grew by 29.16% including the contribution
from Facebook. Average real GDP growth over this period was 1.83% per year.
Adding the contribution of Facebook means that GDP-B grew by 1.91% per
year. 44 Considering that this is for just one product, including the benefits from
Facebook results in a large impact on such an encompassing measure of economic
activity as GDP-B and productivity-B.

the intercept from a linear regression of monthly WTA on the corresponding share of users who
keep Facebook, dropping the observations for the two extreme observations, E=$1 and E=$1000
(p-value = 0.0000, R2=0.88). “Per year” estimates are calculated using the arithmetic mean of the
percentage point difference over the period. “Growth per year” estimates are calculated using
geometric means.


Next we consider the total income approach of equation (33) in Section 4. We
need the total nominal income (T) for both 2003 and 2017, which we calculate as
follows:


T0 = nominal GDP in 2003 + w 0 0*z 0 0 = $11.51 trillion + 0 ≈ $11.51 trillion
T1 = nominal GDP in 2017 + w 0 1z 0 0 = $19.39 trillion + $506.04 x No. of
      Facebook users in US in 2017 ≈ $19.49 trillion.


That is, total nominal income using GDP-B T is higher by $102 billion in 2017
since the value of Facebook to consumers is taken into account. Recall, from
Section 4, that this can be interpreted as the amount that consumers in aggregate
would need in compensation in order to attain the same level of utility if access to
Facebook foregone in 2017. This is for the 2017 version of Facebook, including

all its characteristics, such as the size of the network. Hence, the result is
independent of the changes in the characteristics of Facebook over the intervening
years since its launch.


From equation (33), in our case GDP-B T = (T1/T0)/PF = (19.49/11.51)/1.31 ≈
1.295. Thus GDP-B grew by 29.50% between 2003 and 2017 using the total
income approach, whereas conventionally-measured real GDP grew by 28.82%,
giving a percentage point difference of 0.68 over the entire period, or 0.05 per
year on average. 47


Compared with conventionally-measured real GDP growth of 1.83%, our
estimates of average GDP-B growth per year range from 1.87% for the total
income approach to 1.91% for the approach using our estimate of the reservation
price.


b) Valuing Free Digital Goods Using Participants in a Laboratory


We conducted similar incentive compatible discrete choice experiments in a
university laboratory in the Netherlands in order to evaluate additional free digital
services. 48 While the online status on Facebook can be monitored remotely to
make sure that participants did not use this service, other digital goods do not
offer this functionality so that we needed another approach to make the decisions
consequential. For services that require a password-protected login, we informed
the participants that, if selected, they will have to change the password to a
computer-generated code that would be kept in a sealed envelope afterwards. If


47
   Recall that this is can be thought of as an underestimate of the additional growth from using
GDP-B, as the deflator is not adjusted for the impact of new goods prices.
48
   These valuations are also reported in Brynjolfsson, Collis and Eggers (2019).
GDP-B: Accounting for the Value of New and Free Goods in the Digital Economy      33




the seal was still intact and the password remained valid (not reset), we concluded
that the participant in fact did not use this service. Additionally, we informed that
we would check the usage statistics of the apps on the selected participants’
devices. Therefore the laboratory setting was necessary in order to be able to
contact participants in person after the study and make their decisions
consequential.


We tested the valuation of the services Instagram, Snapchat, Skype, WhatsApp,
digital Maps, Linkedin, Twitter as well as Facebook. We varied the monetary
amount that we offered to participants to leave these services for one month
within the range of €1 to €500. The respondents had to make decisions regarding
each of these services, i.e., each respondent had to make eight decisions. One out
of every fifty participants who completed the study got the chance to have their
decision fulfilled. The specific service was determined randomly in this case.


The data collection took place at a large Dutch university in February and October
2017. Overall, 426 participants were available for the analysis, meaning that there
were over 400 decisions for each digital service. The resulting estimated demand
curves are given in Figure 2. The corresponding median WTA valuations and
confidence intervals are given in Table 2.


We observe very high valuations for WhatsApp which all of the participants were
using. No one was willing to give it up for €1, and the relative insensitivity of
demand to price resulted in an estimated monthly median WTA of €535.73, far
higher than for the other services. We interviewed participants after the study
period to better understand these high valuations. They told us that WhatsApp had
become a nearly indispensable focal platform for communicating with peers, co-
workers and others in their community, leading to enormous disutility from lack
GDP-B: Accounting for the Value of New and Free Goods in the Digital Economy                    34




of access. 49 Of course, the disutility for an individual would likely be much less
if all members of the community could coordinate on switching to an alternative
communications platform and the values should be interpreted accordingly. Such
network effects are observed with many other goods as well, and do not mean that
the valuations should be discounted but it may affect the value of other substitute
goods. 50 Hence, the net contribution to welfare should account for changes in both
the value on the focal good, and such substitutes.


Facebook was used by almost all of the participants and had the next highest
median WTA monthly valuation of around €100. The valuation for Facebook in
this sample was thus significantly higher than that found for the US in the
previous section ($42.17 ≈ €34.76). Maps (including Google, Bing, and Apple
maps) were also highly valued, with WTA median values of almost €60 per
month, followed by Instagram, Snapchat and LinkedIn.


For Skype and Twitter, we found very low median valuations of less than €1.
Although 71% of the participants were using Skype, the majority were willing to
give it up for one month for just €1, likely because other services offered very
similar (video) calling possibilities and was not frequently used. Note that
although Skype effectively provides access to a portion of the same network for
71% of sample, the valuation is massively different; €535.73 for WhatsApp and



49
   Some quotes from our interviews: 1. “Whatapp is the only communication tool I use to contact
my friends here. Without it, I can do nothing.” 2. “WhatsApp is crucial. I use the app every hour
of the day to keep in touch with friends and family but also to discuss group projects or things
about my work. I really need to keep access to this app. There is also not a very suitable
alternative.”
50
   The fact that most people now use telephones to communicate rather than telegrams does not
mean that the price people are prepared to pay for calls should be discounted in any way. That said,
the value is partly due to network effects and partly due to intrinsic differences between the two
goods.
GDP-B: Accounting for the Value of New and Free Goods in the Digital Economy     35




€0.18 for Skype. This suggests that it is not simply a valuation of the network that
is being captured.


Twitter is only used by 33% of the sample which explains the low value for the
median user, i.e., the utility maximizing strategy for those who do not use Twitter
is, of course, to accept any money that was offered, and this encompasses the
majority of users in our sample.


These WTA estimates are converted to annual figures by simply multiplying by
twelve to get the annual estimates, as per the previous section, and these figures
are then used to calculate annual GDP-B growth for the Netherlands. We use the
total income method of equation (33), and hence avoid having to estimate a
reservation price for each good. The results are reported in Table 3. 51 Since our
sample for these laboratory experiments is not representative of the national
population of Netherlands, we provide these figures solely to gauge the
approximate magnitude of potential underestimation in welfare inferred from
conventional GDP growth figures from not accounting for popular free digital
services.

Notes: Two alternative user populations are considered, 10 million and 2 million. The population

Quarterly data are used. 52 For products launched in the first half of the year, the period 0 values
are taken to be those from quarter 4 of the preceding year. For products launched in the second
half of the year, period 0 values are taken to be those of quarter 4 of the launch year. Per year
estimates are calculated using arithmetic means of the percentage point difference in growth over
the period that the respective goods were available.

GDP-B: Accounting for the Value of New and Free Goods in the Digital Economy                   38




From Table 3 we can see that WhatsApp, Facebook and digital maps contribute
significantly towards GDP-B growth and hence conventional GDP estimates miss
a great deal of value by not accounting for these goods. According to our
estimates, if WhatsApp is used by only 2 million people in the Netherlands (the
approximate population in the 15-24 years old age group in 2017 and the age
group of our laboratory sample), its gross contribution to GDP growth over 2003
to 2017 would be 0.82 percentage points per year. This is large, especially when
considering that (i) this is just one digital good, and (ii) that the actual using
population of WhatsApp is likely to be much larger than 2 million. The actual
Dutch number of users has been reported to be closer to 10 million, for both
WhatsApp and Facebook. 53


Hence, in Table 3 we report also report results for a user population of 10 million
and find that, if accounted for, the annual average gross contribution of WhatsApp
to GDP-B growth would have been a substantial 4.10 percentage points according
to the total income method. It is important to note that if WhatsApp partially
replaces conventional telephone calls and texting, then the traditional GDP
captures the fall in disappearing value of these telephone services but misses the
gains from WhatsApp. In contrast, the adjustment term to GDP-B growth due to
WhatsApp could be very high because it captures these benefits from the
introduction of WhatsApp relative to the counterfactual of lower valued telephone

Given definitional uncertainty about what constitutes a “user”, and the potential for rapid change
in user numbers, we consider potential bounds of 2 million to 10 million users out of a population
of 17 million.
54
   In other words, in an alternative world without WhatsApp, the counterfactual GDP-B would
drop by somewhat less than our estimate because users would probably have relatively higher
valuations for telephone services.

become increasingly severe as more and more free digital goods are used as
substitutes for traditional paid goods, such as Wikipedia replacing encyclopedias
and various smartphone apps replacing a variety of traditional goods.


6. Applying GDP-B to adjusting for new features in smartphone cameras


Smartphone cameras are now the primary devices for taking photos. From the
1997 to 2017, the dominant photographic technology shifted from analog cameras
to digital cameras to smartphone cameras. The total number of digital cameras
shipped worldwide dropped from 121 million units in 2010 to 24 million units in
2016, 55 while worldwide smartphone sales increased from 297 million in 2010 56
to 1.5 billion in 2016. 57 Moreover, the marginal cost of taking a photo has fallen
to approximately zero with smartphones, compared with up to 50 cents per photo
for developing film in the analog era. Just between 2010 and 2017, the number of
photos taken worldwide has increased from 350 billion to an estimated 2.5
trillion. 58 Furthermore, a photo taken on a smartphone today is typically superior
to a photo taken on an average camera twenty years ago, including its ability to be
stored, shared or repurposed far more easily.


To illustrate the problem this change creates, we consider a simple case of two
goods, each available in two periods: a digital camera and a feature phone 59 in
period 0, and a smartphone with a digital camera in period 1. 60 Suppose that the
value of the camera to the consumer is v c , the value of the simple feature phone is

   A feature phone is a phone defined as a phone with no camera for the purposes of this example.

   We thank Hal Varian for sharing his notes on GDP and welfare which contained a version of
this example.
GDP-B: Accounting for the Value of New and Free Goods in the Digital Economy        40




v f , and the value of the smartphone is v c +v f . Assume that a device fully
depreciates in a time period, i.e., a consumer has to purchase new devices each
period. Also assume that a consumer buys both the camera and the feature phone
in period 0 and only the smartphone in period 1, and there are a total of x such
consumers. Suppose that the price of the camera is p c in period 0, the price of the
feature phone is p f in period 0, and the price of the smartphone is also p f in period
1. Then we have the following consumer surplus measures, CS0 and CS1, for
periods 0 and 1, respectively:


(34)   CS0 = (v c − pc)x + (vf − pf)x ≥ 0,
(35)   CS1 = (vc+vf − pf)x ≥ 0.


Then the change in consumer surplus between periods 0 and 1 is CS1 – CS0 = pcx.
This is the cost saving of not buying the digital camera in period 1 because its
functionality is now included in the smartphone. However, the contribution of
these goods towards conventionally-measured GDP (i.e., the market price of final
goods) is (pc + pf)x in period 0 but only pf x in period 1. Hence the change in
conventionally-measured GDP from period 0 to period 1 is –pcx, which is exactly
the opposite of the change in consumer surplus. Therefore, while conventionally-
measured GDP goes down due to people not purchasing the digital camera,
consumer surplus and GDP-B go up. The measured decrease in conventional GDP
occurs because, even though it has the same market price (pf) as the feature phone
in this example, the smartphone is a higher quality product. That is, there is an
implicit fall in price in shifting from the feature phone to the smartphone which is
not being captured.


Hence, it is clear that GDP statistics should account for quality improvements in
smartphones, including the introduction and improvements in smartphone
GDP-B: Accounting for the Value of New and Free Goods in the Digital Economy                     41




cameras. While GDP-B does this, until January 2018, the BLS only incorporated
quality adjustments for data plans offered by mobile network operators in the
CPI. 61 Starting from January 2018, there is now quality adjustment of the CPI for
telephone hardware, calculators and other consumer information items using
hedonic modelling of the value of characteristics; 62 this is used by the Bureau of
Economic Analysis (BEA) to deflate Personal Consumption Expenditures for
telephone and facsimile equipment in constructing real GDP; see BEA (2014,
Chapter 5, Table 5.A). Therefore, even though GDP statistics capture paid goods
such as smartphones, they have failed for many years to completely capture
quality adjustments in the US, and most countries still do not make any quality
adjusts for smartphones; see e.g. Wells and Restieaux (2014, Table 1). Even when
they do attempt to adjust for quality improvements, Groshen et al. (2017) state
that hedonic techniques are not suitable for products such as smartphones when
                                                                        63
the set of relevant characteristics frequently change.                       Note that quality
improvements, such as the addition of a camera feature to a smartphone, can also
be thought of as additions of new goods as described in our framework.


To demonstrate the importance of quality change as can be captured by GDP-B,
we elicit the value generated of smartphone cameras for participants in a
university laboratory in the Netherlands and compare that with the approximate
price paid for them.




61

62
   The methodology and characteristics used for the hedonic modelling are currently not published.
https://www.bls.gov/cpi/factsheets/telephone-hardware.htm
63
   If we consider software features (including operating system and various apps) as part of the set
of relevant characteristics for hedonic quality adjustments, then it is impossible to perform
hedonic modelling because firms do A/B testing continuously and seek to improve these features
as frequently as daily.
GDP-B: Accounting for the Value of New and Free Goods in the Digital Economy        42




Specifically, we applied an incentive compatible BDM lottery (Becker, DeGroot,
and Marschak 1964) in order to estimate the consumers’ valuation of their
smartphone camera. We asked participants to state the minimum amount of
money they would request in order to give up their smartphone camera (both main
camera and front camera) for one month. Participants were informed that this
amount would serve as a bid in a lottery. If their minimum bid to forego their
camera would be higher than a random price, drawn from a uniform distribution,
they could keep access to their smartphone camera but would not receive any cash.
If the random price exceeded their minimum requested amount, they would be
paid the random price, provided that they would give up using the smartphone
camera for one month. The utility-maximizing strategy of the participants in the
BDM lottery is to provide a bid that matches their true valuation. Accordingly, we
use the bids as measures of WTA to give up smartphone cameras.


In order to induce incentive compatibility and make the answers consequential,
we provided further information that one out of fifty participants would be
selected for the lottery and that if their bid was successful we would block their
smartphone cameras with a special sealing tape (see Figure 3). The sealing tape
would break if the participants tried to peel it off so that it was not possible to re-
apply it. We also signed the tape so that it was not possible to buy the same type
of seal and re-apply a seal. If, after the one month period, the seal was still intact
participants were rewarded with the money and the seal could be removed.


The study was conducted in the laboratory of a large Dutch university in
November/December 2017 (to not cover the holiday season, respondents were
allowed to postpone giving up their camera until January 2018). In total, 213
students participated.
GDP-B: Accounting for the Value of New and Free Goods in the Digital Economy     43




           Figure 3: Sealed smartphone camera (intact and broken)




The sample was relatively balanced in terms of gender (54.5% were female) and
represented the student population in terms of age (87.8% were between 18 and
24 years old). Participants reported that they use their smartphone cameras
frequently and take, on average, 21.7 pictures (median = 10) and 2.3 videos
(median = 1) per week. For 59% of the participants the smartphone camera is the
only camera they possess. Only 16.4% own a separate point-and-shoot camera,
and 18.8% a DSLR camera.


Directly eliciting monetary values in a survey leads to the observation of price
thresholds, i.e., certain values that are stated more frequently. In our results, we
observe that the bids 40, 50, 100, 150, 200 were each entered by more than 5% of
the sample. The median bid that was given for the smartphone camera was €100.
However, this median bid does not account for the price thresholds in the demand
function. For example, the bids imply that 41% of the students would not give up
their smartphone camera for €100, but 54% would at €100.01. To smooth the
demand function, we therefore fitted a (multiplicative) function to the observed
GDP-B: Accounting for the Value of New and Free Goods in the Digital Economy              44




shares of students willing to accept the offer. This function explains 87.7% of the
variation in demand and is depicted in Figure 4.


According to the fitted values, the median WTA for giving up the smartphone
camera for one month is €68.13, albeit having a wide confidence interval (95%-CI
= [€33.53; €136.78]). This implies a median annual WTA of over €800 for
smartphone cameras, at least for the students in our sample, a value that is not
captured in conventional GDP statistics.


             Figure 4: Demand function for the smartphone camera




Analysts have estimated that it costs $20-$35 to manufacture the smartphone
cameras present in current flagship models. 64 Similarly, a modular smartphone

sold in the Netherlands can add front and back cameras for an additional charge to
consumers of €70. 65 This study provides strong evidence that consumers obtain a
significant amount of surplus from using their smartphone cameras and this
surplus is an order of magnitude larger than what they actually pay. 66 Hence,
there has been a large implicit price decline arising from quality change; the
services received from the smartphone have increased due to quality change but
this is not reflected in the measured price. Therefore, even for paid goods such as
smartphones, it is crucial to adjust for quality improvements before estimating
GDP statistics. This might not be an issue if consumers derived an equally large
surplus from what they actually paid for while using digital or analog cameras
previously. However it is hard to reconcile this hypothesis with advancements in
smartphone cameras and the reduction in costs of taking photos.


We can use our total income approach for GDP-B in equation (33), which does
not require calculation of a reservation price for the good in the period before it
appears, to calculate an estimate of the contribution of accounting for value of the
smartphone camera to consumers; we estimate an average contribution of 0.62
percentage points per year to GDP-B. 67

66
   Of course, in a competitive market, most of the benefits from innovation go to consumers, not
producers (Nordhaus, 2004)
67
   This is the arithmetic percentage point difference between the growth in GDP-B and official real
GDP growth. It is calculated by assuming the following: (i) Smartphones with cameras appeared
from July 2008, the date of the launch of the first iPhone in the Netherlands. Consistent with Table
3, period 0 is then taken to be Q4 of 2008. (ii) Based on EuroStat survey information on
individuals who used a mobile or smartphone to access the internet (https://www.cbs.nl/en-
gb/news/2018/05/the-netherlands-leads-europe-in-internet-access), the number of users of
smartphones in 2017 was estimated to be 84% of the population of the Netherlands of age 15 and
above (constituting 83.6% of the population). With a total population of 17 million this translates
to approximately 12 million users in 2017. (iii) The annual median WTA is €817.56, and this is
taken as the appropriate price for valuing the smartphone cameras; the purchase price of the
camera component of the phone is assumed to be very small, so is treated as approximating zero
for simplicity. With these assumptions, total income can be calculated for 2017 as nominal GDP
plus the value of the smartphone cameras. The total income quantity index between the end of

7. Conclusion


This paper has developed a framework for measuring welfare change when there
are new and free goods. This leads to a new measure, GDP-B, as well as its
nested components, GDP-N and GDP-F. These measures provide a means by
which to understand the potential mismeasurement that arises from not fully
accounting for goods which are new, free or both new and free. This is of
increasing relevance in the modern digital economy given the frequent
introduction of new goods and growing presence of free goods.


Appropriately, we drew on both old and new literatures to define a framework for
measuring welfare change. We were able to use this framework to derive an
explicit term that is the marginal value of a new good on welfare change. That is,
we get a measure of the contribution to welfare of a new good, and hence the
extent of welfare change mismeasurement if it is omitted from statistical agency
collections that rely on conventional measures of GDP and productivity.


We also showed how to use GDP-B to derive an estimate of the addition to real
GDP growth that would be required to account for the welfare gains from the
introduction of a new good, without having to recalculate GDP numbers
published by national statistical offices.


We then introduced free goods into a standard microeconomic model of
household cost minimization and re-worked our welfare change and real GDP

2008 and 2017 can then be calculated by deflating by the official GDP deflator, and the difference
with official real GDP calculated: 1.152-1.095=0.0563. That is, the difference with official real
GDP is 5.63 percentage points over the nine years, or an arithmetic average of 0.63 percentage
points per year.
GDP-B: Accounting for the Value of New and Free Goods in the Digital Economy   47




growth adjustments terms to allow for there to be “free” goods (with an implicit
or imputable price). Accounting for new and free goods in GDP gives us a new
metric, GDP-B, which is a contribution to the literature on expanding GDP
beyond the traditional definitions. Two empirical implementations of GDP-B are
proposed. One requires (the estimation of) reservation prices, while the other,
based on the concept of “total income” avoids this necessity.


Hence, we have derived explicit adjustments for both welfare change and
equivalent real GDP growth that account for new and free goods, both of which
are new to the literature. Following Brynjolfsson et al. (2019), we proposed a way
of implementing these adjustments using incentive compatible discrete choice
experiments. We quantify this adjustment for the case of Facebook in the US
using a representative sample of the US internet population. Under different
assumptions, we provide two estimates for the impact of incorporating Facebook
into GDP-B, ranging from 0.05 to 0.11 percentage points per year on average
from 2004. What’s more, since GDP is the numerator used to calculate both labor
productivity and total factor productivity, both of these numbers would change by
the same amount per year when accounting for new and free goods using GDP-B.
These are significant changes, especially considering that Facebook is just one
product in this very encompassing measure of economic activity.


Using laboratory experiments in the Netherlands, we also provide further
evidence for the magnitude of consumer welfare and potential additions to GDP
generated by the most popular digital goods. Finally, using another laboratory
experiment for computing the welfare created by smartphone cameras, we also
make a case for accounting for new features in smartphones and other products, to
capture the reality of rapid quality change in the digital economy. To elicit the
consumer valuations of quality attributes, the experimental approach proposed
GDP-B: Accounting for the Value of New and Free Goods in the Digital Economy     48




here is to block certain features of the goods (e.g. cameras in smartphones), or
even take away the entire good, in exchange for monetary compensation. This
could be an attractive alternative way to estimate the valuations of product
characteristics for adjusting price indexes, as opposed to hedonic techniques,
especially when the set of characteristics of goods changes rapidly.


The high valuations for WhatsApp and Facebook raise a host of interesting
questions that can be explored in further. In future work, it would be insightful to
delve deeper into these individual apps and study the sources of these valuations.
In addition to product quality, network effects and focal point effects are also
contributing factors towards these valuations. Furthermore, many of these digital
goods are also associated with externalities and a parallel stream of research is
needed to explore these issues in greater detail (for example, Allcott et al. (2019)
explore the impact of Facebook on subjective well-being, news consumption and
political polarization).


GDP-B and the related metrics proposed in this paper enable a more thorough
exploration of the impacts of new and free goods on welfare, with significant
potential policy implications. As an example, given that real GDP growth is a key
component of national productivity growth estimates, to the extent that the
adjustments add to GDP growth they may go some way to explaining the much-
documented and debated productivity growth slowdown experienced by
industrialized countries since 2004.
