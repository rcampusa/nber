                 Predation through Regulation:
                  The Wage and Profit Impacts
                        of OSHA and EPA



                              ABSTRACT




      This paper documents the importance of studying the indirect effects

of OSHA and EPA regulations ——   the competitive advantages which arise from

the asymmetrical distributions of regulatory impact among different types

of firms. We argue that if the competitive advantage gained through in-

direct effects is sufficiently large, it can more than offset any direct

costs producing a net benefit for the regulated firm and its workers. The

indirect effects of OSHA and EPA regulations arise in two ways. The first

source is compliance asymmetries, whereby one firm suffers a greater cost

burden even when regulations are evenly enforced across firms. The second

source is enforcement asymmetry, whereby regulations are more vigorously

enforced against certain firms. Earlier research shows that these asymme-

tries do exist and are based on firm size, unionization, and regional loca-

tion. In this paper we empirically document that the indirect effects pro-

duced by these asymmetries mitigate the direct costs of regulations for many

firms. Large, unionized firms in the Frostbelt are clearly gaining wealth

at the expense of small, nonunionized firms in the Sunbelt.

I. Introduction



       A common error in popular expressions of political economy is the

presumption that all firms oppose environmental and safety regulations

because these edicts raise business costs. The flaw in this presumption

arises from an exclusive focus on what we will call the "direct effects"

of regulation --     the   isolated, partial equilibrium impacts of regulation

on single firms or individuals.' Examples of the direct effects of

environmental and safety regulations include increased safety of products

and workplaces, decreased emissions of pollutants, and increased manufac-

turing costs. While direct effects dominate popular perceptions of

regulation, the often pronounced heterogeneity among firms gives rise to

additional, general equilibrium impacts we will call "indirect effects"

--   the   competitive advantages which arise from the asymmetrical distribu-

tions of regulatory impact among different groups of firms and workers.

For example, if the cost burden of certain regulations falls heavily on

one group of firms and lightly on a second group, then an indirect effect

of these regulations is to provide cost advantage to the second group of

firms. It is extremely important to recognize that for many firms and

workers the indirect effects of regulation can outweigh, in terms of

economic importance, the direct effects. If the competitive advantage

gained through indirect effects is sufficiently large, it can more than

offset any direct costs, producing a net benefit for the regulated firm

and its workers. The CPSC swimming pooi slide standard, new source

standards of the Clean Air Act, and the OSHA cotton dust standard are

among the many regulations where indirect effects have been shown to

predominate.2

    As Salop (1981) and others have pointed out, activities which raise

rivals' costs are, in fact, predatory in many circumstances. The three

conditions necessary for activities to be regarded as predation are:

competitor damage, predator benefit, and consumer damage. The first

condition, competitor damage, is very likely to be satisfied by OSHA and

EPA regulations. The national cost of industrial compliance with these

regulations was $3.7 billion for OSHA and $7.7 billion for EPA in 1976

(Weidenbaum and DeFina, 1978) and mounting evidence (discussed below)

indicates that this cost burden is asymmetrically distributed among

various types of firms.3 As regards the second condition, predator

benefit, particular groups of firms may well be sufficiently advantaged

from indirect effects of regulation to experience increased profits (or

wages, or both). The question of whether certain firms actually benefit

from EPA and OSIIA regulations is an empirical issue, and is the focus of

this paper. Herein, we econometrically estimate the nature and extent of

regulatory impact on industry wages and profits in the manufacturing

sector of the U.S. economy.

     In a narrow sense, the third condition for predation, consumer

damage, is also extremely likely to be satisfied by EPA and OSHA   regula-



         the CPSC, see Viscusi (1984); on EPA, see Crandall (1983); and
on OSHA, see Haloney and McCormick (1982).

     3As Salop and Scheffman (1983) note, there are economic conditions
under which these regulatory cost burdens need not damage competitors.
Competitor damage is thus an empirical issue.
                                                                          3



tions. The cost increases and productivity decreases of these regula-

tions raise prices for immediate consumers and reduce consumer surplus.4

From a broader, and probably more correct perspective, however, for U.S.

environmental and workplace safety regulations to entail "consumer

damage,tt these regulations would need to fail a broad test of social

cost-benefit. No such tests of the overall impact of these regulations

is attempted in this paper, and thus in a strict sense, our argument that

these regulations are predatory is incomplete. Nonetheless, a wide range

of recent studies of OSHA and EPA have concluded that the actual benefits

of these regulations are quite limited.5'6

     In the next section, we discuss the impact of indirect effects of

regulation on profits and wages and show how the first two conditions for

predation, competitor damage and predator benefit, may be satisfied by

the enforcement of OSHA and EPA regulations. Section III describes the

empirical specifications and data sources used to test the hypotheses

regarding indirect effects. The results presented in Section IV document

the transfer of wealth between firms that occurs through the enforcement

of OSHA and EPA regulations. Conclusions appear in Section V.




     4Salop and Scheffrin also argue that there are some cases where in
fact consumer surplus may rise after rivals' costs are raised.

     50n OSHA, see DiPietro (1976), Mendeloff (1976), Smith (1976),
Viscusi (1979), and Bartel and Thomas (1985). On EPA, see Lave and Omenn
(1981) and Crandall (1983).

     6Consumer damage is usually the most problematic of the three
conditions. For example, the recently dismissed antitrust case against
IBM contained several controversial allegations of predation against the
computer company. Perhaps an appropriate view is that EPA and OSHA are
at least as predatory as IBN and other industrial corporations.

II. Direct and Indirect Effects of Regulation



     Indirect effects of regulation arise from two possible sources:: a

"compliance asymmetry" whereby one firm   suffers   a greater cost burden per

unit of output even when regulations are equally enforced across firms,

or an "enforcement asymmetry" whereby regulations are more vigorously

enforced against certain firms. There appear to be three principal

sources of compliance asymmetries due to environmental and safety

regulations. First, to the extent that there are economies of scale in

compliance, then smaller firms suffer a larger unit-cost impact and in

fact may be sufficiently disadvantaged as to exit the industry.

Pashigian (1984) has provided evidence of economies of scale in compli-

ance with EPA regulations, Neumann and Nelson (1982) have documented the

exit of small mines resulting from enforcement of the 1969 Coal 1ine

Health and Safety Act, and we have previously documented the strong

economies of scale that occur in manufacturing for compliance with OSHA

regulations (Bartel and Thomas, 1985). Second, to the extent that

unionized firms exhibit higher pre—regulation safety levels, enforcement

of occupational safety regulations can benefit unionized firms by forcing

non-union competitors to match union-dictated safety levels. Regulation

can thus reduce competitive pressure on unionized firms and workers,

transferring wealth to these firms and workers from the non-unionized

segment of the industry. Third, both because their plants tend to be

older and smaller, firms located in Northern and Midwestern states (the

Frostbelt) will tend to have higher compliance costs with OSHA and EPA

regulations than firms in Southern and Western States (the Sunbelt), when

these regulations are evenly enforced.
                                                                          5




     The second source of indirect effects, enforcement asymmetries,

arises from administration of environmental and safety regulations that

are systematically skewed against particular groups of firms or workers,

and thus induce (or aggravate) competitive advantage for these particular

groups. As regards OSHA, our own earlier study (Bartel and Thomas, 1985)

exposed more intensive enforcement (per worker) against small and non-

union firms by the agency. To test for regional enforcement asymmetries

by OSHA, we reran regression analyses from our earlier study now includ-

ing a variable measuring industrial regional location. These new results

are reported in an appendix to this essay and confirm that OSHA enforce-

ment is more intensive against Sunbelt firms. As regards EPA, the

environmental regulations themselves are notoriously riddled with en-

forcement asymmetries. Especially significant are requirements that new

plants meet tighter standards than old plants, and that plants in areas

of the country that are cleaner than national standards must meet tighter

standards than plants in dirty areas (Crandall, 1983). Both these

enforcement asymmetries burden Sunbelt plants, raising their costs

against their Frostbelt counterparts.

     Compliance and enforcement asymmetries are thus probably reinforcing

in the case of plant size and workforce unionization, with large and

unionized plants favored. These asymmetries are, however, offsetting as

regards regional impact. Note that if regional enforcement asymmetries

are pronounced enough to dominate regional compliance asymmetries, then

Frostbelt firms will be advantaged through regulation.

     The impact of EPA and OSHA on industry total rents may thus be

positive or negative. In terms of direct effects alone, the impacts are,

of course, negative --   higher   regulation-induced production costs
                                                                        6




generally lower potential rents.7 But if these regulations sufficiently

disadvantage small, nonunion, or Sunbelt firms in the industry, then the

increase in the industry price that results from the upward shift in the

supply curve, may more than offset the regulatory costs for large,

unionized, or Frostbelt firms.8 Hence, rents for the industry may

actually increase, on average. Figure 1 shows how the impact of regula-

tion on industry rents depends on the firm size distribution in the

industry. (Similar diagrams would hold for the percent workforce union-

ized or for the percent Frostbelt workforce distributions.) It can be

seen in Figure 1 that the effects of EPA and OSHA regulations on indus-

trial rents will be most negative for industries comprised exclusively of

small firms. As average firm size increases, indirect effects become

more significant and the effects of regulation on rents become less

negative. Finally, for industries with the largest firms, regulation may

well increase total and average industry rents through the exclusion of

fringe competitors.

     It is important to realize that the impact of regulation on industry

rents will be shared between wages and profits because much of the

potential increase in windfall profits through regulatory predation may

be expropriated by workers. Salinger (1984) has documented this transfer

to unionized workers for cross-sectional industry profits, and Moore




     7Gray (1984) focused on direct effects when he studied the impact of
OS}IA and EPA on productivity.

     81n other words, the rents of marginal firms will decline and some
may be forced to exit, while the rents of inframarginal firms will rise.
For an extended discussion, see Salop and Scheffman (1983).
                                                                                7




(1978) and others have documented the abilities of unions to force

artificially increased wages for regulated firms enjoying windfall

profits. Ignoring wages and examining only corporate profits would

potentially severely understate the extent of regulatory impact. Our

analysis, therefore, considers the impact of regulation on both profits

and wages.

        To measure the impact of direct and indirect effects of regulation,

we specify the following relationship:

--

                  =   percent   of workers in Frostbelt in industry i

            X =       a vector of other variables that affect profits

A similar equation may be specified for industry wages. The direct

effects of regulation are captured by parameter c, and this parameter is

expected to be negative. A significant negative estimate for               is

sufficient to demonstrate competitor damage by regulation for at least

some firms. Indirect effects of regulation are captured by parameters

          and     and these parameters are expected to be positive. Note
2'
that if the magnitudes of cr2, a3, and           are large enough, then some

firms and workers will enjoy increased wages and profits as a result of

EPA and OSHA regulations, and predator benefit will also be documented.

In the next section of this paper, we specify equation (1) more fully,

and describe the data used for estimation.

III. Empirical Specifications and Data Sources



A. Introduction

     The sections above have shown how regulation can cause transfers of

wealth among rivals in an industry. In our empirical analysis we esti-

mate the impact of OSHA and EPA regulations on the wealth of workers and

firms in three-digit SIC manufacturing industries during the time period

1974-78.



B. Dependent Variables

     The wage variable is measured by the average compensation in the

industry (wages plus fringes/number of employees) and is obtained from

the Annual Survey of Manufacturers.

     The profit variable is "return on assets" defined as value added

less labor costs, all divided by the value of assets, which is the value

of structures and machines. This is also calculated from the Annual

Survey of Manufacturers. While the industry's "return on assets" is a

good proxy for the industry's profits, it suffers several well-known

drawbacks. In spite of these problems this measure is used because of

its ready availability at a level of aggregation that exactly matches the




     9mis time period is chosen because of limited availability of key
variables outside the mid-70s. See Bartel and Thomas (1985) for a
complete explanation.
                                                                         10




level at which industry concentration ratios and other important industry
                      10
data are published.

C. Regulation

     Critical to our analysis is the appropriate method of measuring OSHA

and EPA regulations. In order to document how OSIIA and EPA affect

industry rents, we need, in each case, a variable that captures the costs

imposed on each industry by regulation. In the case of OSHA, data on the

actual costs of compliance are very limited. Between 1973 and 1980,

McGraw-Hill did conduct a survey of capital expenditures related to

worker safety and health but the survey only covered 16 broad industry

sectors in manufacturing. As a better alternative, we proxy compliance

costs by the dollar value of penalties assessed against the industry by

OS11A. These data are collected by OSHA and are available for detailed

industry classifications.

     The OSHA penalty data have two important restrictions. First, they

only refer to violations of safety standards; penalties associated with

violations of health standards are deleted from the data. Because safety

violations constitute about 90% of total penalties, this restriction is

not severe. Second, the OSHA data used for this study are restricted to

the 22 states where workplace safety regulations have been continuously

enforced by OSHA during the 1970s.11 Under provisions of the OSHAct of

1970, states may retain responsibility for the development and enforce-

ment of OSHA standards. In 1979, 64% of inspections and 25% of penalties




     10Freeman (1983) used this measure of profits to study the impact of
unionism on profitability.

     11Those states are Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, District of
Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Massachu-
setts, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Oklahoma,
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Texas and West Virginia.
                                                                          11




were generated by state agencies. Because detailed state data were not

available for study, we use only data on federal enforcement of OSHA

standards.

     To examine the impact of OSHA on workers' wages, we divide the

penalty variable by the number of workers in the 22 states for the

industry and create PENENPL; the number of workers is estimated from the

Census Bureau's Country Business Patterns tapes. When the dependent

variable is the return on assets, the denominator of the OSHA variable is

changed to the value of assets (PENAST). Since in this case the numera-

tor uses data based on 22 states while the denominator uses national

data, we multiply PENAST by the ratio of the number of employees in the

nation to the number in the 22 states, in effect, expanding the numerator

to a national basis.

     For EPA, a good measure of compliance costs is available. Each

year, the Census Bureau publishes, for each SIC category, gross pollution

abatement operating costs, which cover solid waste collection and dispos-

al, depreciation, labor, equipment leasing, materials and supplies, and

payments to governments for public sewage use.'2 Pashigian (1984) has

shown that most of the pollution abatement operating costs incurred from

1974 to 1978 can be considered incremental, i.e., induced by the regula-

tory program. For our analysis of workers' wages, we define a variable

PACEMPL which equals gross pollution abatement operating costs in the




     12Unfortunately, establishments in SIC Group 23, Apparel and other
Textile Products; are excluded from the Census Bureau's Pollution Abate-
ment Expenditures survey because, according to the Census Bureau, these
establishments operate primarily in rented quarters where the abatement
of pollution is generally arranged by the landlord. Hence, we deleted
establishments in that SIC category from our analysis.
                                                                         12




industry divided by the number of workers in the industry using national

data; for analysis of return on assets, we change the denominator to the

value of assets and create PACAST.

     Finally, we interact each of the four regulation variables (PENENPL,

PACEMPL, PENAST, PACAST) with average firm size, percent unionized

employees in the industry, and percentage of employment in the Frostbelt

in order to capture the indirect effects of regulation, or wealth trans-

fers among various firms in the industry. Average "firm" size is calcu-

lated from the County Business Patterns data, and, is really establish-

ment size, although we refer to it as firm size. The union variable is

Freeman and I1edoff's (1979) measure of percent of workers covered by

collective bargaining agreements, based on the Expenditures for Employee

Compensation (EEC) surveys. We chose this measure for two reasons;

first, collective bargaining coverage is the most relevant concept for

analysis of the impact of unionization in the labor market and second, it

is the only measure available on a 3-digit SIC basis, as opposed to the

Census industrial classification. The Frostbelt is defined to include

states in the Northeast and Nidwest; the percentage of each industry's

employment in these areas is calculated from the County Business Patterns

tapes.

     According to the discussion in Part II, while each of the four

simple regulation variables should have a negative sign, each of the

twelve interaction terms should have a positive sign since regulation is

presumed to benefit large firms' unionized firms, and those firms located

in the Frostbelt.
                                                                          13




D. Other Independent Variables

     The wage equation includes the following additional variables.

First, we use a set of variables describing the workers in the industry:

average education (EDUC), average age and its square (AGE and AGESQ),

percentage of production workers (PROD), percentage of male workers

(MALE), and the new-hire rate (N}LR). EDUC, AGE and AGESQ are obtained

from the current Population Survey; the other variables are from the

Employment and Earnings files of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Second,

we add average firm size (FSIZE), the union variable (UNION), and their

squares (FSSQ and UNSQ). Third, we allow for the impact of market

structure by using the four-firm concentration ratio (CONC) which is

obtained from the 1977 Census of Manufacturers. Following Long and Link

(1983), we also interact CONC with UNION. Fourth, we consider the effect

of production demand in the industry by using average overtime hours

(OVER) and the percentage change in shipments during the previous year

(SHPDIF). OVER is from Employment and Earnings and SHPDIF is calculated

from the Annual Survey of Manufacturers. Finally, we add a regional

control, SOUTH, which is the percentage of the industry s employment that

is located in the south (calculated from the County Business Patterns

tapes), and we add four year dummies (D75, D76, D77, and D78).

     The return on assets equation includes the following additional

variables. First, we include a set of variables that measure those

expenses that have not already been deducted from total revenues.'3

These are advertising per unit of assets (ADVERT), which is obtained from




     13As the numerator is defined, only payroll and the cost of
materials have been deducted.
                                                                                            14




the Internal Revenue Service Corporate Source Book, research and develop-

ment per unit of assets (RANDD) which is obtained from Scherer (1984),

the value of inventories per unit of assets (INV), and new capital

expenditures per unit of assets (CAPEXP); the latter are from the ASN.

Second, average firm size (FS1ZE), the union variable (UNION) and their

squares (FSSQ and UNSQ) are added. Third, the concentration ratio is

used because of the widely hypothesized relationship between concentra-

tion and profitability. Fourth, past output growth (SHPDIF) and cost of

materials growth (MATDIF) are used. The latter is used to test for the

impact of increases in fuel and energy costs. Finally, following Weiss

(1972) we test for the role of geographic dispersion by using GIIERF, a

Herfindahl index of employment          across   states, based on the County Busi-

ness Patterns data. A set of year dummies is also used.

where PACAST and PENAST are the appropriate measures of EPA and OSHA

regulation as described in the previous section and Z is a vector of

other variables in the ROA equation. According to these specifications,

five regulation parameters are estimated for each dependent variable;

   -      and 2 5 capture the effect of OSHA while               and       adjust

these parameters for the differential effect of EPA. The reults of

estimating equations (2) and (3) are reported in Tables 1 and 2,

respectively.



B. The Effects of Regulation

        In column 1 of each table, we begin •the analysis by exc1uding the

regulation-interaction terms. This enables us to show the estimated

impacts of OSI-LA and EPA when the role of indirect effects is ignored.             It

can be observed that, in this case, OSHA and EPA regulations have a weak
                                                                              16



positive effect on wages and a negative and significant effect on return

on assets. In column 2 of each table, we allow for the existence of

indirect effects caused by the compliance and enforcement asymmetries we

discussed in Section II. Recall that our model predicted that the

largest firms, the most heavily unionized firms, and those firms in the

Frostbelt would gain competitive advantage from the enforcement of OSHA

and EPA regulations. In column 2 of Table 1, we now observe that the

"pure" effect of regulation on wages, the coefficient on PENENPL, has

become negative arid significant while the interaction terms    with   firm

size,      unionization and Frostbelt (PENSIZE, PENUNION and PENFROST) are all

positive and significant.14 This means that, in industries comprised

almost exclusively of small, nonunionized firms in the Sunbelt, OSHA and

EPA regulations have a significant negative effect on workers' wealth,

while in industries with many large, unionized firms in the Frostbelt,

the regulations significantly increase workers' wealth. In other words,

the wealth of workers in large, unionized firms in the Frostbelt rises

due to the competitive advantage gained from regulatory predation against

their small, nonunionized, Sunbelt rivals. Such predation is accom-

plished by a combination of compliance and enforcement asymmetries as

discussed earlier, but the relative contribution of each type of asymme-

try   is   impossible to determine within the context of this study.




     14Note that quadratic terms on firm size and percent unionized are
included in all of our equations. These are added to insure that the
regulation interaction terms do not capture possible nonlinearities in
the effects of firm size and unionization on wages.

        In column 2 of Table 2, we add the regulation-interaction effects to

the returns on assets equation.'5 We find strong evidence that unionized

firms gain wealth relative to nonunionized firms as a result of the

enforcement of OS11A and EPA. Additionally, firms in the Frostbelt

benefit relative to those in the Sunbelt, and the effect is very signifi-

cant. The hypothesized firm size effect, although of the right sign, is

extremely weak. In column (3) we consider whether this is due to the

hypothesized economies of scale dissipating at very large firm sizes.

PENAST*(FSIZE)2. According to the results in column             (3),   PENASTEF is now

positive, while PENASTEF2 is negative and each is significant at the 10

percent level.16 Economies of scale disappear at an establishment size

of 205. This corresponds to the ninetieth percentile of the establish-

ment size distribution in our sample. Hence, our argument that indus-

tries with many large firms experience an increase in wealth relative to

industries dominated by small firms, as a result of OSHA and EPA regula-

tion, holds true, but the effect dies out very promptly as firm size

increases. In contrast, when PENSIZE2 was comparably added to the wage

equation, no diminution of the firm size effect was found as firm size

increased.




     15Again, note that quadratic terms on firm size and unionization are
included in these equations. See footnote 15.

     16Note that in column (3) of Table 1, we also included an
interaction term with the square of firm size, PENSIZE2, but this vari-
able was not significant.

C. Other Variables

     The regressions in Tables 1 and 2 contain other variables that were

used to properly specify the employee compensation and return on assets

equations. Since the effects of these variables are not our focus and

other researchers have thoroughly discussed their impacts, we do not

discuss them in detail here. The effects of the variables in the

employee compensation equation are all consistent with previous research
                                   17
and there are no surprises here.        In the return on assets equation, one

result is unexpected, namely that R&D does not have a positive effect.

This clearly disputes other research and may be due to the imperfect

matching of the R&D data with the Survey of 1anufacturers data. We are

confident, however, that this does not contaminate the estimation of the

coefficients on the regulation variables. When we restricted the coeffi-

cient on RDAST to be positive, the coefficients on all of the regulation

variables, both simple and interaction terms, increased in the absolute

values of both magnitude and significance.



V. Conclusions



     This paper has documented the importance of studying the indirect

effects of OSHA and EPA regulations --     the   competitive advantages which

arise from the asymmetrical distributions of regulatory impact among

different types of firms. We have argued that if the competitive advan-

tage gained through indirect effects is sufficiently large, it can more

When UNSQ is deleted, UNION is positive and significant in all columns of
Table 1.
                                                                          21



than offset any direct costs producing a net benefit for the regulated

firm and its workers. The indirect effects of OSIiA and EPA regulations

arise in two ways. The first source is compliance asymmetries, whereby

one firm suffers a greater cost burden even when regulations are evenly

enforced across firms. The second source is enforcement asymmetry,

whereby regulations are more vigorously enforced against certain finns.

     Earlier research has shown that these asymmetries do exist and are

based on firm size, unionization, and regional location. In this paper,

we have empirically documented that the indirect effects produced by

these asymmetries mitigate the direct costs of regulation for many firms.

Large, unionized firms in the Frostbelt are clearly gaining wealth at the

expense of small, nonunionized firms in the Sunbelt. While the estimated

regulation-interaction effects were significant in Tables 1 and 2, the

t-values by themselves do not indicate the magnitude of the wealth

transfer. We show this in Table 3 where we evaluate the derivatives of

regulation in both the wage and profit equations. The effect is estimat-

ed by letting firm size, unionization and the Frostbelt employment share

each take on, in turn, a value of zero, the mean, the median or the

maximum, while the other two variables are set to equal to their means.

This exercise enables us to determine the relative importance of the

indirect effects created by each of the variables. The findings in Table

3 show that workers in large, unionized firms in industries that have a

high Frostbelt employment share benefit substantially. The Frostbelt

effect is the largest of the three tested here; evaluating its effect

from minimum to maximum values of FROST at mean values of PENEMPL and

WAGE we find a 5.4% increase in wages. According to the profit equation,

firms in heavily unionized Frostbelt industries also profit from OSHA and
                                                                           22

from minimum to maximum        medium-sized firms, but dissipates beyond this

level. Another surprising result here is that the union effect is the

strongest of the three variables; evaluating its effect, we find a 12.8%

increase in ROA from minimum to maximum values of UNION. One interpre-

tation of why the wages and profits results differ is that workers may be

able to expropriate the bulk of the windfall wealth that is created by

regulation, and hence, relatively weak firm size effects are observed in

the case of profits. Alternatively, we feel that the unusual results

from the profit equation (e.g. weak firm size effect, very large union

effect) are due to admittedly inferior profit data. The difficulties in

measuring profits are well known, and, in our case, our profit measures

probably includes a number of expenses for which we have been unable to

control. Hence, we would argue that the wealth transfer inferred from

the profit equation is subject to potential measurement error, and the

results from the wage equation might be given more attention.

     With this caveat in mind, we feel that our findings are extremely

provocative. We have shown that regulation has become a predatory device

that can be utilized to enhance the wealth of those firms that are best

able to comply and to reduce the wealth of rivals who suffer higher

regulatory cost burdens. Discussions about regulatory reform or deregu-

lation obviously need to incorporate this model of regulation in order to

accurately evaluate the impact of any proposed changes.




     '8The mean of wage is 101.9 in 1972 dollars. The mean of ROA is
.8706, which is so large because of several corporate expenses (including
capital costs, advertising, research, etc.) that are not deducted from
the numerator but rather are controlled for by independent variables.
The mean of PENEMPL is .382 and of PENAST is .344.

                                 APPENDIX

     In   the absence of existing studies of regional enforcement asymme-

tries by OSI{A, we elected to reestimate regression equations from an

earlier study (Bartel & Thomas, 1985). Explanations of specification and

descriptions of data are contained in the 1985 study and are not repeated

here. One feature of the data should be noted, however. For reasons

discussed in the text of this essay, availability issues limited OSHA

enforcement data to a 22 state region of federal enforcement. Other data

used for the regression results below were comparably restricted to this

22 state region. Thus the variables listed below are different from

those used in the text as they are drawn from a different sample. The 22

states are as follows:

     Frostbelt: Delaware, District of Columbia, Kansas, Maine,

                  Massachusetts, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire,

                  Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota,

                   and West Virginia

     Sunbelt:     Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho,

                  Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas.

     Five enforcement variables were examined with OLS results reported

in Table 3. The Target Industry Program (TIP) was the focus of OSHA

enforcement activities in 1972 and 1973. The determinants of the OSHA

decision to include industries in the TIP are examined using data for

1974 only (earlier data for ESIZE and FROST limited to the 22 states were

not available). For 1974 to 1978, pooled cross-section time-series data

are used. Note that enforcement asymmetries against small, nonunion, and

Sunbelt firms are documented. Also note that enforcement asymmetries

against small firms basically disappeared by 1978, while regional en-

forcement asymmetries became more pronounced.

Key to Variables

TIP = zero-one dummy variable (1974 only) for inclusion of industry in
TIP; INSPEMP = OSHA inspections per employee; LOSTDAY lost workdays per
employee; C1PLT = formal complaints to OSHA per employee; FSIZE   average
establishment size; UNION = percentage of employees unionized; FROST =
percentage of employees in Frostbelt. YR =          left
                                                  variable is multiplied
by (year - 1974); D74, etc. = zero-one year dummy variables.

Notes: All variables except TIP, Frost, and year dummies are in
        logarithms.

          All data are restriced to the 22-state region of federal
          enforcement.
