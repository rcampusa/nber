         Unemployment Insurance and Labor Force Transitions

     This paper reports preliminary estimates of an econometric simu-

lation model capable of a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of

unemployment insurance on measured and actual employment, unemployment

and non-participation. The data are longitudinal comprising informa-

tion on 75,000 households sampled in the Current Population Surveys of

March and April 1978. The simulation model is constructed from multi—

nomial logit equations characterizing individuals' labor force transi-

tions. These equations provide estimates of the effects of UI on job

loss, labor force exit, and entry into the labor force, as well as the

effect of UI on unemployment duration and temporary layoffs. The results

are rather inconclusive, but suggest the importance of further research

on UI and transitions in and out of the labor force.

     An unemployment rate above four percent was once regarded

as synonymous with slack in the economy. That view is no longer
widely held. Indeed, some observers today believe that rates
of unemployment below 6 percent place unsustainable inflationary
pressure on the economy. This change in viewpoint has been the
result of both labor market developments and new perspectives on
the causes of unemployment. The apparent upward trend in unem-.
ploytnent has been a source of major concern to policy-makers,
and the focus of research by a number of economists. Central
to most explanations of the rising "natural rate of unemployment"
is the role of government transfer programs.

     The impact of transfers on measured unemployment includes both
real effects on the intensity of search and the willingness to
accept   offers, and a pure reporting effect. Where program

participation depends on registration for possible employment, the
measured rate of unemployment could be higher simply because some
individuals change the way they report otherwise unchanged behavior.
A full evaluation of the impact of transfers on conventional

measures of labor market tightness requires an assessment of
both real and reporting effects. While most analyses of transfer
programs focus on changes in incentives to find jobs, their

effect   on the reporting of constant behavior may also be quite
significant.
    This study reports preliminary estimates of an econometric
simulation model capable of a comprehensive evaluation of the
effects of unemployment insurance on measured and actual employment,
                              —2—


unemployment,   and non-participation. The data are longitudinal,
comprising   information from 75,000 households sampled in the CPS
surveys of March and April 1978. A computer program is developed
                                           t

to impute UI benefits conditional on becoming unemployed to each
individual in the sample. The program uses information on each
state's benefit formula and eligibility rules, as well as inforina—
tion on Federal and state tax codes to calculate a hypothetical

replacement rate for each individual in the March sample.
     The simulation model is constructed from multinoinial logit
equations characterizing individuals' labor force transitions.
These equations express an individual's probability of transiting
between labor force states as a function of his characteristics and
variables reflecting UI benefits (e.g., the replacement rate, and
the potential duration of benefits). This technique makes it
possible to estimate the impact of unemployment insurance on both
the length of unemployment spells and their frequency. The former
depends on UI effects on the probability of exit from employment,
while the latter depends on UI effects on the probability of
transition into unemployment. The model also can be used to examine
the effect of UI reforms on both the level of employment and rate of
non-participation.
      The methodology and data used here have several advantages over

 previous studies of the effects of UI. Most important, they permit
 a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of the program. Previous
 studies have typically focused on the effects of unemployment in-
 suran.ce on just one labor force transition. Our study provides the
                              —3—


first   estimate of UI effects on the rate of job loss, labor force
exit, and labor force entrance into unemployment. The common data
and methods in this study make it possible to combine the
estimates of UI effects on individual transition probabilities to
yield an estimate.of its overall impact. Second, this evaluation
                                                                        1
of UI makes use of data from the CPS. As has been well documented,
measures of unemployment derived from different survey diverge
widely. The use of CPS data means that the results obtained here
can be used as a basis for evaluating the effects of UI on
unemployment as it is officially measured. The focus here on the
"reporting as well as the behavioral effects of UI also improves
the realism of our estimates of the impact of UI on measured
unemployment. Recognizing reporting as well as behavioral effects
is crucial when using CPS data, as almost half of all unemployment
spells culminate in labor force withdrawal. A third advantage of
the approach used here is that it takes account of the effect of UI
on the composition of the unemployed and employed populations. Pre-
 vious studies have been flawed by the failure to take account of the
 fact that UI will affect the mix of persons becoming unemployed. If
 for example, UI induces many short-term layoffs it may reduce the
 average duration of unemployment, even while increasing spell
 lengths for each individual. The transition probability approach
  taken here avoids this difficulty, because explicit account is taken
 of   the effect of UI-on the flow into unemployment.
        Many previous efforts to evaluate the effects of unemployment
 insurance have failed to take account of the taxes which are neces—
                                —4—




sary to finance the system. This study also attempts an exanjna—
tion of the effects of the payroll taxes used to finance unemploy-
ment insurance on levels of employment and unemployment.
       It should be clear at the outset that
                                               estimating the impact
of social insurance programs on the measured unemployment rate
is in no way equivalent to examining their desirability. One
important goal of social insurance is to make it possible for
persons   for whom work is likely to be very burdensome (the aged

or disabled) to subsist without holding jobs. An important

function of unemployment insurance is facilitating the
                                                          mobility
betweenjobs which is necessary to accommodate changing product
demands. This does mean encouraging persons to become unemployed.
Moreover, reporting effects of social insurance programs have
little welfare significance. If unemployment insurance encourages
workers who would otherwise withdraw from the labor force to
engage in nominal search activity and report themselves as
unemployed, there is no real social cost.
       However; an evaluation of the impact of social insurance
programs on the level of unemployment is crucial to interpreting
labor market conditions. If unemployment insurance has induced a
large  increase in the measured unemployment rate, then current high
rates of unemployment are not a warrant for public policies to
promote employment. If the increases in unemployment cannot be
linked to unemployment insurance or other social programs, the case
for policies to combat the increase may be strengthened.

    The first part of the paper outlines a theoretical framework
for examining the interactions between UI and measured employment.
In Part II we describe the sample and the rather elaborate
procedures used to impute benefits. The econometric methods and
estimation results are discussed in the third section. The.
implications of the results for the effects of UI on measured
unemployment, employment and labor force participation are taken
up in Section Iv. A final section of the paper discusses the
implications of the results for interpreting data on unemployiuent,
a number of limitations of the estimates, and directions for
subsequent research.

I.   A Theoretical Framework



     The relationship between UI and unemployment has been

extensively studied.2 Mast previous studies have focused on
the relationship between unemployment duration and UI. This is
only a small part of the story. There may also be important
linkages between UI and the rate of flow into unemployment.

Martin Feldstein has argued that UI encourages temporary layoffs

and irregular work scheduling.3 Daniel Harermesh has suggested
that UI may actually increase the labor force participation of
some workers.4 He points out that labor force entrance is more
attractive  if part of the conDensation for employment includes
the chance to take advantage of unemployment insurance. UI may

also encourage quits in states where job leavers are eligible
for benefits.
     In order to model these various effects it is necessary to

use a framework which takes account of labor market dynamics. The

 where, for example, eri represents the probability that the ith

 worker would be not in the labor force (NILF) in month t+1, condition-

 al on being employed in month t. Since a worker must always be in
 one of the three labor force states, the rows of p sum to 1.

        From the transition probability matrix p'. it is possible
 to calculate the proportion of the time individual i spends in
each of the three labor force states. Let                   be the fraction
of time that individual i spends in state j. We solve for the

third of employment entrances came from outside the labor force,
and 28 percent of employment spells ended in labor force
withdrawal. This suggests the potential importance of UI effects
on reported participation as well as on employment..8
     The approach taken in this paper is to use niultinonjal logit
analysisto estimate the impact of individual characteristics and
UI on individual transition probability matrices p'. These
estimates are then combined using (2) and (3) to generate estimates
of UI impacts on the unemployment and participation rates. This
"transition probability" approach has the virtue of being closely
linked to theories of labor market choice which emphasize the
role ottransition decisions. The use of Markov transition
matrices as is done here involves the assumption that individuals'

transition decisions do not depend on how    long they have been in a
state.     This assumption of no state dependence has been examined in
earlier work with mixed results. Econometric identification of
state dependence is difficult because any heterogeneity among
individuals    in their transition probabilities will lead to apparent
statedependence. The assumption here is necessitated by the
absence of data on how long individuals have occupied their initial
states.

UI and the Unemployed

       The   duration of unemployment spells has been the focus of
most   research on UI and the Unemployed. In terms of the framework

developed here, this is equivalent to studying the relationship
between UI and the transition
                                      probabilities e and p. The
duration of completed spells of unemployment is related to the
transition probabilities             and p by the identity:
                    0
                        i        1

In thinking about the impact of UI on the duration of
                                                                 unemployment
it is crucial to distinguish between individuals who
                                                     are searthing
for work, and those on layoff from jobs to which they are
permanently attached.
    We begin by analyzing the decision problem faced by workers
who are eligible for UI but not attached to permanent jobs.
Dale Mortenson's excellent theoretical study of the decision
problem faced by these workers brings out the crucial
                                                       effects.9           He
finds that the impact of an increase
                                      in the UI benefit level on
the probability of reemployment is likely to be positive but is
theoretically ambiguous. Increases in UI benefits will tend to
increase the length of spells by reducing the opportwiity cost of
both leisure and job search. The consequent rise in the reservation
wage tends to prolong unesnploywent.            However, it is possible that
for   some workers this effect will be          offset by another. Since jobs
are   not permanent, workers will recognize that the sooner they take
a job, the sooner they will again be eligible for UI. This effect
is likely to be particularly
                             important for persons near exhaustion
of benefits.
                               —11—


       Mortenson's analysis does not treat the question of UI's
impact on the probability of labor force withdrawal. Increases in
UI are likely to reduce labor force withdrawal through both real

and reporting effects. By raising the rewards of them working,
increases in UI reduce the incentive to withdraw from the labor

force. In most states, eligibility for UI requires a worker to be
available and actively looking for work. When enforced this will
cause some workers to search for work rather than withdrawing from

the labor force. However this requirement is usually very poorly

enforced. Disqualifications from UI are quite rare affecting
fewer than 0.1 percent of claimants. Nonetheless, knowledge of
the requirement is likely to lead at least some persons to profess
to be looking for work even if they are not in fact seriously

desirous of obtaining a job. This effect may also occur because
workers regard mandatory registration with the state employment
service as a form of job search.

        is important to be clear about the relationship between
       It

this analysis and statements about the impact of UI on the aveiage
duration of unemployment. The question examined here is the
impact of an increase in UI on a given worker's probability of
reemployment. The average duration of imemployment will be affected
by changes in this probability, as well as by changes in the
composition of the unemployed. Even if UI reduced the probabijity
of exiting unemployment for any iven individual, the average length
of   unemployment spells might also be reduced if   persons   with high

reemployment probabilities were encouraged to become unemployed.
This problem would seem to be a serious drawback of previous studies
which hve relied on comparisons of averages of unenplc'ment
durations.
                               —12—

           considerations suggest that increases in the potential
     similar

remaining duration are likely to reduce the probability of
unemployment exit by delaying returns to employment. An additional
complication is posed by those who are waiting to receive benefits.
This group (mostly quitters) will also be sensitive to increases in
benefits, even though benefits are not received contemporaneously.



UI and Exit fran Layoff Unemployment
     Since the influential work of Peldstein the importance
of distinguishing between the behavior of workers attached and     not
attached to permanent jobs has been recognized. In an ex—post
sense the duration of layoff spells is determined by the employer
rather than the employee. In   an ex—ante sense, of course, this
is not the case. Explicit or more likely implicit contracts

will determine the length and frequency of spells of temporary

layoff   unemployment. These contracts will depend on both workers'
tastes and the availability of UI. The nature of these interactions

is discussed in more detail in the next part of this section.

However, in the presence of imperfect experience rating,
increases in .UI at the margin will lead to longer and
more- frequent layoffs.
     A second consideration suggests a positive relationship

between benefit levels and the length of spells of layoff

unemployment. A large fraction, perhaps as great as 50 percent,
                                     —13—


of those in the temporary layoff category do not in fact return
to their original employer. For thiE group, the Considerations
discussed above for ordinary job losers should be relevant. it
does not appear on theoretical grounds that there should be
important effects of UI on labor force withdrawal fran layoff

unemployment.



UI   and the Flow into Unemployment
     Previous research on demographic, cyclical, and regional
differences in unemployment rates has all found that most
variationà can be attributed to differences in the rate of
flow into unemployment rather than the duration of unemployment
spells. This suggests the importance of examining the relation
between UI and the   rate   of entrance into unemployment. While
most of the research in this area has examined the relationship
between UI and temporary layoff unemployment, it is also likely
that there are important effects of UI on permanent separations.

UI and Employment Exit           I



       In order to examine the relationship between UI and
permanent separations, it is necessary to provide a
model for determining the duration of employment. We use the
framework developed by Robert Hall to attack this problem.11 The
optimal separation rate is determined by the interaction of
workers' tastes and employers' cost functions.
     In general it is reasonable to suppose that employers have
some optimal turnover rate. If jobs. are too short, costs of
                                  —14— 15 —

staffing    and training become prohibitive.     If they are too long,
the ability to adjust to changing product market conditions is

likely to be impaired. This suggests that the employers' isoprofit
curves   between wages and separation   rates look like that depicted
byEt in figure 1. Workers also are likely to prefer intermediate
durations. If jobs are too short, they will have to incur exces-
sive    search costs. If they are too long, they lose flexibility.
       The set of tangencies of indifference
                                                 and iso—profit curves
trace   out an expansion   path in wage separation space• The
condition   that the supply and demand for labor be equated determines   -

the level of wages and separations. In        general it is clear from
the configuration of these curves that the optimun or, equilibrium
separation rate can involve either a positive or negative rate of
substitution between wages and separations.
     Consider first the impact of introducing a non—experience—
rated UI system. Employers' isoprofit curves are unaffected.
However, since UI reduces the costs of changing jobs, it is reason-
able to suppose that the shape of workers' indifference curves change

from I to II as shown in figure 1. At any given level of wages and

the separation rate, the introduction of UI reduces the rate of
substitution between wages and    separations.    Graphically, the
associated slope of the indifference curve at each point declines.

This means that the introduction of UI leads to a new equilibrium

with a higher separation rate (S2)      The magnitude of the impact of
UI on the equilibrium level of rates and separations depends on the
shape of the indifference curves. The figure would seem to suggest
                                  —16—

that UI represents a Pareto improvement. This is a consequence of

deferring   consideration of the taxes necessary to finance the
program.
       The basic result that UI raises the equilibriwt separation

rate should not be surprising. Since it subsidizes job search, j

makes separation less costly for workers. This directly encourages

quits.     Employer initiated separations are also encouraged. Since
workers    will demand less compensation for a high risk of layoff,

employers   will find it    profitable to shift to production methods

involving   a   higher risk of separation.
       The UI system considered so far was not experience rated. That

is,   an employer '5 contribution to the system was assumed to be
independent of his own separation experience. Consider now the
extreme opposite case of perfectly experience—rated ui. In this
case, depicted in figure 2, the employers' isoprof it Curve is shifted
in a fashion parallel to the change in workers' indifference curves.
Hence the separation rate at the point of tangency is unaffected.
A fully experience rated system of UI will have no impact on the
separation rate.
         This   result can be seen intuitively. Efficiency considera-

 tions dictate an optimal rate of substitution between wages

 and separation rates. The announcement by the government
 that conditional on separation, the employer must make transfers

 to    the employee will have income effects, but will not affect

 the optimal contract.
         The extent of experience rating in the UI system is examined

 below.     At this point, it is   useful to point out that if waaes

 aretaxed, a fully experience rated system requires that the
 employer pay the full UI costs of ceparations, and that the
 government receive the revenue it would have received if the     UI

 benefits had been paid out as wages. -            If UI benefits are not taxes,
  and        firm is not charged for the government's forgone
            if the

  revenue on those benefits, there will be an inducement toward
  separations. Thus, even if the UI system is. perfectly experience-
  rated       internally, there is still a distortion because of forgone

  tix revenue on benefits.


        .    This analysis suggests that UI is likely to increase
  the separation rate. This conclusion is not affected by taking

  account of additional complexities. In many states, separations
  labeled as quits leSe the worker ineligible for UI.                This will

   tend to reduce the effect considered here, and give a strong

   inducement for quits to be labelled as job loss. If implicit

   contracts can be enorced1 even separations induced by the employee
   will be labeled as quits. If one assumes that implicit contracts
            not enforceable, and that employers are indifferent, to their

   Sputations,. then only quit decisions will be affected by.the level

   of UI benefits. .                                          .


              A final issue is the state occupied by persons exiting from
   employment. The prediction is an unambiguous increase in the.

   probability of transiting from employment to unemployment.. The
   effects of an increase in UI on the rate of transition, from employ-

   ment to NILF is atiguous since w9rkers .:who would .o.thens. enter

              This   analysis suggests that the effect of UI on the permanent

    separation rate is theoretically unambiguous. However, UI may have
    an ambiguous effect on the division of separations between quits

    and job loss.

131   and Permanently Attached Workers
       The relationship between UI and temporary layoff unem-
ployment has been extensively studied. Martin Feldstejn has
presented a theoretical analysis demonstrating that the intro-
duction of an imperfectly experience—rated ux system encourages
this form of uneinployment?2 The nature of long term contract
arrangements has been discussed in detail by Robert Hall)3 He
shows that optimal contracts involve employing workers wherever
their marginal product exceeds their      marginal valuation of time out
of    work. Since UI raises the marqinal valuation
by workers of time out of work, it increases the number of states
of the world where workers are    laid   off. This effect will occur
unless firms are perfectly experience rated, in which case the UI

system    will have no impact on layoff unemployment.

UI and Labor Force Entrance
        As Daniel Hamermesh has pointed out, the entitlement effect

of unemployment insurance is likely to increase labor force entrance.

This effect is similar to the proemployment effects for the

unemployed described above. The ability to collect UI after a
spellof work raises the effective wage and so is likely to
encourage labor force entrance. This entry may be through either
the unemployment or NILF states. Some workers outside the labor
force, may be immediately eligible for benefits if they reenter
the unemployment state. For this group, who have been recently
employed, the impact of UI is likely to be particularly pronounced.
                               —20—




      In   Table 2, the conclusions of this section are summarized.

The theoretical analysis leads to predictions regarding the
effects of UI on all the transition probabilities except
for the movement between nonparticipation and employment. Note
that the effect of UI on total unemployment is almost certain to
be positive, since the transition rate into unemployment from each
of the alternative states is increased.


Financing the UI System
     The unemployment insurance system is financed partially out
of a payroll tax levied at a variable rate on the first six
thousand dollars of income    on a given job. This tax,which reduces
after—tax    wages, will tend to discourage transitions into
employment, and to encourage labor force withdrawal. It will tend
to offset the entitlement effect of UI discussed above. In

considering UI reform, it may be reasonable to assume that the

taxes   arid benefits are changed simultaneously. Alternatively, it
may be appropriate to consider the case where marginal UI funds
come from other expenditure programs so that the tax system is
unaffected. Both cases are considered in the empirical work below.

 II.   Imputing Unemployment Insurance Benefits

     A complete analysis of UI and labor market flows imposes
formidable   information requiremn    We not only require an
estimate of the level and potential
                                        duration of benefits received
by the unemployed, but what the system would provide other
individuals if they were to join the jobless ranks. Furthermore,
theory suggests that the variables affecting economic decisions
are the after tax replacement ratios; thus we require an estimate
of the applicable marginal tax rate. In order to derive these
data, we have designed a computer program embodying federal tax rules
and each state's ui laws and tax codes. The UISIM program determines ni
eliibility, calculates basic and dependent benefits (where available),
establishes the maximum allowable duration of benefits, and estimates
federal and state marginal tax   rates.
       The program has been designed to use information from
the    annual work experience survey conducted in March 1978
as a supplement to the regular Current Population
                                                     Survey.
Federal extended benefits and supplemental assistance were not
in force at that time, so that variation in UI parameters depended

only on differences in state laws. Since information on income
and work experience in the CPS is not as detailed as the law
requires, a number of assumptions underlie our calculations!4
                                   —23—


The UI System: Rules and Definitions

       An individual's participation in the UI System——the level
and   duration   of benefits-—is conditioned by previous work

experience. The specific rules for eligibility, benefit
                                                                amounts,
and duration are determined by each state. Though no two states
are identical, a number of common elements are present. In order
to highlight the basic structure of the system, table 3 presents
key rules for a hypothetical "typical" state.
      Within   limits, the weekly benefit amount in our typical    state
is   defined as 1/26 of the individual's wages in the high quarter

of the base period (i.e., four quarters prior to the quarter in
which the claim is filed); the minimum and maxinjwn benefit limits

are $20 and $110 respectively.15 To be eligible for benefits a
claimant must be available for and actively seeking work, and
must not have left the last job voluntarily, without "good cause."16
In addition, base—period earnings must be at least $800, and must
exceed 125 percent of high quarter wages. Once determined,
benefits are fixed for a period (52 weeks) called the benefit

year.7 Within that period, all eligible claimants receive benefits
for at least 10 weeks; the maximum number of weeks for receipt of

benefits is 26. Actual potential duration is chosen so that total

potential benefits are less than or equal to one—third of base

period earnings.
      While   variations on this theme are legion, the basic structure—-
eligibility    for and level of benefits linked to past work expe-

rience, minima and maxima for benefits and duration, etc.—— is
found in each state. Most of the interstate variations reflect

either different numerical formulas (e.g., 1/23 versus 1/26) or
different reference values (e.g., average weekly instead of high

quarter wages). Actual formulas can be quite complex. In 12
states, for example, the fraction of high quarter wages received
in weekly benefits depends on previous work experience and earnings.
Thereare two variations, however, of a more fundamental nature.
Twelve states provide additional benefits to claimants with
dependents (usually ranging frr $3—5 per dependent per week),
and    16 states allow quitters to receive benefits after a waiting
period has elapsed; the waiting period varies from 5—14 weeks.
Although these provisions are found in a minority of states,
they are potentially applicable to a significant fraction of
the unemployed. In March of 1978, for example, states with
dependents' benefits accounted for 32 percent of all the

unemployed; for quitters' benefits, the figure was 24 percent.


The UISIM Program

      Our model of the UI system incorporates the rules for
eligibility and the determination of benefits and taxes f or each stati
The basic structure of the simulator is outlined in Figure 4.
The program is designed to use information available in the CPS
work experience survey conducted in March 1978. Information
on    family income, marital status, and dependents is used to
calculate    federal and state marginal tax rates, including
social security taxes. 18 Data on weeks worked and wage and salary
income from the previous year provide the basis for determining
eligibility and the level of benefits. For those out of the
                                 —26—




labor   force in March of 1978 who had no work experience in 1977,

we imputed an average weekly wage (described below). The output
of the program consists of a weekly benefit, maximum potential

duration, the quit disqualification period (where applicable),
the marginal tax rate, and weeks of employment needed to qualify
for benefits (NILF only).
    The federal tax module in the program is based- on previous
work conducted at the National Bureau of Economic Research. We
modified the NBER's TAXSIN program to work with CPS data, and to
interact with a new state tax module especially developed for
UISIM. State income taxes have not received as detailed attention
in the public finance literature or the ipirical work     on UI as

taxes at the federal level. While state marginal tax rates are
much lower than the federal rates, they axe not insignificant.
In several states, marginal rates as high as 10% are not uncommon.

Moreover, variation across states and across income classes within
states may be important. In light of these considerations it seems
inappropriate both to ignore state taxes and to apply an average
for each state. DISIM thus includes a nodule with an income
tax algorithm for each state. Both the federal and Etate tax
modules incorporate provisions in force as of March
        Given an individual's basic earnings and employment informa-
 tion, the bulk of the program is a relatively straightforward
 and mechanical application of tax laws and state UI rules. There
 are three parts of UISIM, however, which required a good
 measure of approximation. First, in order to derive marginal tax
 rates we had to determine whether an individual would itemize
                                     —27—

deductions  and how large the deductions would be. Information
fran the CI'S by itself provides no guidance. Our approach to
the problem involved two Steps. We first used tax return informa-
tion from the   NBER TAXSIM   file   to calculate the frequency of
itemization and average deductions for itemizers by income class
                   19
and filing status.    The second step was to calculate two marginal
tax rates, one assuming the standard deduction and the other

assuming  average itemized deductions as estimated from the sample
of returns in ThXSIM. We then computed a weighted average with
weights based on the frequency of itemization.
      The second major area of uncertainty in the design of the
simulator was the calculation of potential duration and the
problem of the benefit year. At the time an initial claim is
filed, weekly benefits and maximum duration are determined and
fixed for a period of 52 weeks called the benefit year. If the
individual files another claim (i.e., begins a second spell of
unemployment) within the benefit year, benefits available for
the second spell are equal to the initial entitlement minus
benefits already paid in the benefit year. For individuals with
no unemployment in   1977 (i.e., the previous year) this presents
no problem, since the current spell of unemployment (captured
in   March) can be taken as the first spell of the benefit year.

For those with previous unemployment, however, the calculation
is more complex. The easiest way to illustrate our approach is
to consider the case of an individual who had just become

unemployed at the time   of   the survey (i.e., March) and who had
one   10—week spell of unemployment in the previous year.
                                       —28—


        In   calculating maximum continuous duration of benefits in
the current spell there are three possibilities20 If last
year's spell of Unemployment began before March, the current
spell marks the beginning of a new benefit year and the fldivjdual
receives the maximum duration consistent with previous work
experience; let this amount be MAX. If last year's spell began
after March (actually after the week of the March survey), one of
two conditions holds. Assume that the survey occurs in week
number 10, and define the critical week (Cw) to be

                      CWaMA)(_u+lo
where          is weeks of unemployment last year (10 in our example) 21
If last year's spell began     after   the critical week, say in
week number 38, the individual is still in
                                           the first benefit
year,   and will exhaust benefits before the beginning of the second
benefit year is reached; maximum potential duration is thus
MAX —
      u_1 (note that we assume in this example that the current
spell has just begun). If U_1 began after March but before ew,
the   individual will reach the end of the first benefit year without

exhausting benefits, and will be allowed to begin a new benefit
year with a new MAX (call it MAX2) and weekly benefit. MAX?

will be conditional on whatever work          experience has been accumulated
during the base period (which now includes some part of the old
benefit      year). If the individual meets eligibility requirements

for the second benefit year, maximum potential duration (continuous)

for   the current spell would be MAX — U_1 + MAX2.22
       Unfortunately, the annual work experience survey does not
tell us when spells of unemployment           occur.   Thus, in order to
                                  —29—




derive an expected maximum potential duration, we compute a
weighted average of.the three possibilities. The weights are
determined under an assumption that the probability of becoming
unemployed is distributed unit ormly across weeks. For the indivi-
dual in our example, the calculation is as follows

          DUR    w1CM.AX) + w2(MAX —     Ut_1) +            -          + M.AX2)

                                 2 ,     and w3 a     - w1 -

     The third major issue in the design of the simulator was
the whole problem of people out of the labor force at the time

of the survey. The CPS provides sufficient information to deter-

mine current eligibility status and, where applicable, to calculate

marginal tax rates, weekly benefits, and potential duration. Thus

some in the Nil! group have enough work experience and previous

earnings to qualify for benefits ininediately. Others would be

eligible for benefits only after some mininnn period of work

experience. For individuals currently ineligible we calculated
taxes and UI benefits assuming that weeks employed just satisfied

minimum requirements. The applicable weekly wages were either
taken from the previous year where available or imputed using an

earnings function. The earnings function was estimated using

data on the employed population from the May 1978 CPS; estimated

earnings were corrected for selectivity bias using Mills' ratio. 23

Simulation Results
    The use of CPS information necessarily entails significa
assumptions in the design of the simulator. it is clear that
sane error is possible because work experience data is not as
detailed as the law requires, and because some tax information
has to be estimated. Furthermore, the raw CPS data, particularly
reported annual income, may not be accurate. With respect to the
parameters of the UI system, however, substantial effort has been
made to ensure their accuracy. We have made extensive use of
internal Department of Labor documents made available to us by
the Employment and Training Administration. We have also
directly verified provisions for a large n*nnber of the states,
and in a few instances have engaged in extensive discussions with
state officials to determine the appropriate specifia•
     The results of the simulation suggest that the program
provides a plausible description of the unemployment insurance
system. Table 4 presents estimates of the disfributjon of
marginal tax rates after—tax replacement ratios and potential
durations for the employed and the unemployed. If we look first
at tax rates for the employed, the results appear to be consistent,
both internally and with estimates generated by existing tax
simulation models. The exclusion of wage income above $50,000
and the underreporting of other incomes appear_to have only
moderite effects on the overall distribution of rates. The fact
that   the bulk of the unemployed are found in the bottczn tax
bracket reflects the marginal income position of many of these
individuals, as well as the use of previous year's income which

may   understate potential earnings.
     The evidence on net replacement ratios accords with previous
estimates. For the unemployed we find that 61 percent receive
no   benefits, while those who do, have an average replacement
ratio of 66.6 percent. This compares with 55 percent reported
            24
in   Peldstein.  It should be noted that the calculations
for the unemployed assume that all leavers are ineligible for
benefits. The calculations for the employed predict what they
would receive if they were to lose their jobs. We find that
19 percent are ineligible for benefits, while 40 percent of the
unemployed would receive benefits replacing 60—80 percent of the
after—tax wage.
     It is instructive to compare the employed and unemployed
groups after adjusting for eligibility. If we look only at
those receiving or potentially receiving benefits, we find that
close   to 15 percent of the unemployed recipients have re-
placement ratios above 0.8; the comparable figure for the

employed is 0.9 percent. The other categories are       quite close
together,    with a greater fraction of the employed in the lower

ranges.     These calculations are suggestive of the disincentive
effects    of UI.

        The distribution of durations for the unemployed and

employed appear quite reasonable. After correcting for eligibility,
we find that more than 34 percent of the unemployed have a

potential duration which exceeds 20 weeks while 7.5
percent are   within 5   weeks of exhausting remaining benefits.
                                     —33-


The remainder of the eligible unemployed are quite evenly
distributed between 5 and 20 weeks. 1nong the employed t
distrjbuUon is skewed toward eligibility for long duratj.
Clearly work of the employed group has accumulated suffjcjtt
wage credits and work experience to qualify for weeks clo to
the maximum (usually 20 weeks).
     As a further check on the Consistency of the program,
we compared predicted benefits with those actually paid
in March. 1978.25 Estimates of weekly benefits are quite close
to the actual values, while the program       overestimates   total weeks
ecinpensated   by about 9 peicent.
                                 Actual        Predicted
     Average weekly benefits $85.45             $83.51
     Total weeks compensated         11.124      13.08
        (millions)

One explanation of the difference is the tendency for only some

leavers to receive benefits, a fact that we have not reflected in
the predicted values. Both the internal checks on consistency and

the actual-predicted Comparisons suggest that UISIM provi&
plausible, relatively accurate values of the principal variables
of interest.

       Empirical Analysis
      Data from the monthly Current Population Zurvey is used in
this section to examine the impact of UI on labor market transitions.
The CPS focuses principally on labor market activity, but also
provides a good deal of information about other personal and
family characteristics. Information on family members is
generally provided by one (presumably knowledgeable) member of
the household. In addition to the regular or basic questionnaire,
the Census Bureau administers short supplementary questionnaires
on a variety of topics. Data on usual weekly earnings, for
example, are obtained in May, while schoól attendance is dealt
with in October. The supplement to the March CPS referred to
earlier covers employment and earnings experience in the previous
year and is the most extensive of the supplementary interviews.
      Our analysis of UI and labor market transitions is based on
the flows between labor market states captured in the March and
April 1978 Current Population Surveys. The -structure of the CPS
allows us to follow individuals through four months of labor market
activity. A given household in the survey is interviewed in four
consecutive months, then is dropped from the survey for eight
months before returning for a final four months of interviews. By
watching individuals and households in successive months, flows
between labor market states can be estimated.
    The probability framework relating UI to transitions assumes
that alternative states of the labor market are clearly defined,
and that changes in status reflect meaningful changes in behavior.
                                  — 35.-




it   is well known, however, that the definitions of unemployment
and not—in—labor—force in the cPS are sanewbat ambiguous. Observed
movements into and out of these states may occur because otherwise
unchanged behavior is reported in a different way. While the
results should thus be interpreted with caution, it is Sr view
that the estimated transition probabilities convey useful
information. Clearly, reporting problems are likely to be less
important   in flows involving employment. Moreover, the available

information   on reasons for unemployment can be used to enhance
the reliability of results. The layoff category, for example, is
likely to be somewhat less affected by arbitrary distinctions.

Variable Definition and Empirical Specification

       The theoretical analysis has treated unemployment insurance
 as an exogenous aspect of the choice set facing individuals and

 firms.  Yet the discussion in Section II makes clear that both
 the level and duration of benefits depend on previous work
 experience and earnings. These factors are likely to have an
 independent   effect on transitions. In order to isolate the effects

 of UI it is necessary to control for the level of wages and weeks

 worked. Transition decisions are also influenced by differences

 in opportunities and   constraints   related to demographic

 characteristics, marital status, education, and local labor market

 conditions. Table 5 presents definitions and mean values of the

 variables in the CPS   which   we use to control for these factors.

      Two specifications are used to estimate the impact of UI on
 transitions between labor market states. The first and
                                                         simplest
 is the linear proSability model given by
                                                n
                 hk =   a   +
                                b1UIEENi   +    I b x1            (5)
                                               j=2
where     is the probability of transition from h to k, and
rc"rcsents te jth c'arzctaristic !cr the it'i iflciVi'ua1. In3
estimation,      takes on the value 1 if a transition occurred
from month t (March) to month t+l (April), and zero otherwise.
The assu.'nption of linearity in equation (4) has significant
limitations. First, the data come in the form of observations
on the labor force states individuals Occupy in It.cceeding months.
Since the dependent variable is essentially trichotomous (movement
into   one of three states), there is no natural scale, and standard

regression techniques are inappropriate.             A linear specificauon
also fails to enforde the constraint that            the   probabilities lie
between 0 and 1.

       Because of these limitations, the linear probability model is

only used to illustrate the effect of alternative specifications.
Inferences about the effects of UI on specific transitions1 and
analysis   of the overall impact of UI on wiemployment and labor
force participation, will make use of estimates based on the
cumultive logistic probability function. In this framework, the
logarithm of the odds of a transition occurring (rather than the
probability) is a linear function of the characteristics of the
individual. Although in the present case there are three possible
                                              38

states, and three transition probabilities for a given base
                                                             period,
the logistic form and the adding up constraint imply that
coefficients for only two of the transitions need be estimated;
the third equation can be derived from the other two.
     In order to illustrate the approach more formally, consider
the case of the transitions out of unemployment. The model is
             26
given by:

                                                             n

            ln(Pun/Puu) =           cx   +         UIBEN + z     •
                                                             j=2


where the x are defined as before, and the g's
                                                 measure the effect
of UI on the odds of a transition relative to remaining unemployed.
Similar models can be written for transitions out of employment
and into the labor force. Estimates of the coefficients in these
models are obtained by maximizing the likelihood function. 27 The
coefficients can be used to derive an estimate of the derivative of
a given   probability with respect to UIBEN. The formula for
for                                                          t'ue, is

     Throughout  the analysis, the effect of UI on the transjtj0
probabiljje5 is captured by the replacement ratio.
                                                      Theory
provides little guidance about the form this variable
                                                       ought to
take. Our use of a linear specification reflects the
                                                       fact that
more complicated nonlinear expression failed to dominate
                                                            the
simple approach. We examined several alternative ui
                                                      variables
including category dmnnjes, a quadratic term, and linear
                                                           splines.
The results were uniform and Consistent;
                                         none of the variants
produced significant value added when compared to the
                                                       linear form.
     In addition to its linearity,
                                     tJIBEN also stands alone in
capturing the effects of UI. We found that maximum potential
duration provided little additional insight or
                                               explanato power.
Moreover, since duration is likely to interact with
                                                       UIBEN, its
presence in the equation significantly
                                          complicates attempts to use
parameterestimates to assess the impact of changes in
                                                       replacene
rates. We did find, however, that other aspects of the UI
                                                               system,
notably   adjustments for weeks of employment needed for
                                                           eligibility,
were important. These will be noted
                                        and reported below.

        The expected impact of UI on the transitions has been
 extensively discussed. Other variables are expected to have a
 significant influence on movements in the labor market. Wide
 variations across demographic groups in the
                                               propensity to leave
 and enter the labor
                       force or employment are well known. For a
given demographic mix conditions in the local labor market as
measured by the state unemployment rate
                                         influence available
opportunities. We expect individuals in states with higher rates
of unemployment to have greater difficulty in finding work
                                                            and to
be at a greater risk of job loss. it is possible that job
finding and labor force entrance will be affected by residential
location. SMSA and CCITY are included to capture the
                                                      possibility
of mismatches between the location of jobs and workers.
     The demographic variables and other personal character-
istics are included to control for differences in preferences
and individual opportunity. As noted above the generosity of UI is
likely to be related to personal factors which themselves are
correlated   with transition   decisions. Two   of   the most important
ofthese variables are weeks worked last year (WXSWKD) and
                                                           average
weekly wage (AWw). The weeks variable is designed to capture two
effects.  First, it is likely to be highly correlated with job
tenure and thus will capture some    of the effects of seniority    on
the possibility of layoff and recall. Second, it should reflect
both attachment to the labor force and
                                       personal stability. If
these are important aspects of individual heter6geneity, wxswxn
may help to isolate the effects of UI which do not depend on
individual quality. The wage plays a similar role.

Transitions from Unemployment

       Table 6 presents the coefficients estimated from a multi-

normial logit model of transitions from unemployment. Estimates

are presented by destination state (e.g. employed, NILF) for the
total    unemployed population, and for each of three unemployment
groups: those on layoff, quitters and other job losers (including
reentrants). In the layoff and loser regressions UIBEN is entered
as calculated by UISIM. In the quit regression, however, an
adjustment was made to reflect the possibility of outright

disqualification    and the effect of the waiting period where
a'plicable. There quitters are disqiialifie we set Un::: to zero.
:or potentially elirible quitters, an adjusted UTBEN is given by:

Average values of ue and p for the entire quit sample were used
 to calculate average k. Variation in UIBEN thus reflects
 variation   in UIBEN and q.
        Looking just at the results for the three categories of
 unemployment, the effect of UI is generally inconsistent with

 expectations, although the large standard errors preclude clear
 conclusions. We do find negative effects among those on layoff,

strong. Among the other groups, however,
                                               the coefficients are
positive though relatively imprecise. When the evidence is pooled
by estimating the model for the total sample, we find very weak

and insignificant effects. In addition to the iDgit coefficients,
we report the derivatives of the
                                 probability for the total sample.
It can be seen that the estimated effects are not only

statistically weak, but substantively small.      In the case of
entering employment for example, the derivative (0.032) implies

that changing the replacement rate by 0.10, would change the

probability of finding a job by 0.003. This compares with an
average job finding probability of 0.33.
 -.   In   light of the strong theoretical arguments and previous
empirical evidence on duration and transitions, the relatively
weak effects of UI are surprising. Furthermore, the positive

effects for losers and quitters remain a puzzle. A possible expla-
nation of the findings for job losers and of
                                             the general irzrecisic-
of UI estimates in Table 6 is individual
                                         heterogeneity. If
unmeasured quality differences are positively correlated with
eligibility   for UI (and the level of benefits), as well as the

likelihood of finding work, then the coefficient of UI would be
biased upward.


      Apossib].e correction for this
                                        heterogeneity problem is to
introduce the duration of the current spell of unemployment
                                                            as a
control variable. The
                          argument is simply that current duration
indicates the degree of
                           success in finding work and is thus an
indicator of individual
                           quality. While this procedure
                                                           apparently
does reduce the upward bias,
                               the general character of the results
is unaffected. The signs
                          remain unchanged, while the size of th
coefficients declines slightly.

     The  heterogeneity argument does not explain the positive
effect of UI on labor force withdrawal by quitters. it would
seem that more able individuals would find work more easily
whether the previous separation
                                  were initiated voluntarily or not.
A somewhat more plausible explanauon is the absence of any controls
for other income, especially the income of the spouse. Since
marginal tax rates are based on family income, secondary earners
may have both high replacement rates and high family income. Without
controls f or other income strong income effects could lead to
individuals with high replacement rates leaving the labor force.
Once again, however, it is not clear why this effect should apply
only to quitters. And indeed adding other income variables has oplv
negligible effects. The impact of 131 on labor force exit by quitters
remains paradoxical.

Transitions from Employment
     In contrast to rather weak results on the urienployed, the
evidence on the impact of UI on employment decisions is quite
strong. Two sets of estimates are presented. We first use the
linear probability model to study the impact of UI on unemployment
transitions, with particular emphasis on subsainples defined by the
reason for becoming unemployed. For comparison, linear probability

 of this   effect   occurs in the layoff group, where the UIBEN
 coefficient is well over half the size of
                                               the average transition
 probability from employment to layoff unemployment.      These
 results are consistent with the evidence
                                              presented by Feldstein.
While the layoff group dominates in the UI effect, we also find

a statistically significant, Positive impact on quit behavior.
The flow of other job losers, however, appears to be unaffected

by rates of replacement.

       The theory suggests that the flow out of employment still
depend on the extent of experience rating of firms. The UI tax

system allows only partial experience rating over a limited range
of tax rates and previous unemployment
                                          behavior. Maximum and
minimum tax rates are built into all the state tax laws. These

have the effect of setting the marginal cost of a layoff to the

firm (net of separation costs) to zero. The experience rating

hypothesis was tested using data on fraction of covered weeks at
the minimum and maximum in each state.     Using various combinations
of minima and maxima, we found experience rating to have no effect
on the flow out of employment. The conclusion
                                                  applied to transitions
into all of the different states of unemployment and Nil!.



       We agrued earlier that UI may raise the gain to labor force
attachment and thus reduce the probability of leaving the labor force
from   employment. The evidence in Table 7 indicates overwhelming
support for this hypothesis. it appears that higher UI benefits
encourage labor force withdrawal. While the direction of the

effect is consistent with the theory, the magnitude of the impact j

the linear probability model is implausible.         The logic of the
connection between UI and labor force withdrawal
                                                        requires an
o±setting flow into unemployment. This is because the decision to
remain  employed is based on the attractiveness of becoming
unemployed at some point in the future. If the negative effect of
U on       were due to the attractiveness of unemployment we would
exoect to see a flow into unemployment of comparable magnitude.
     ?uch of the disparity in the estimates disappears in the
logit framework. There we find that the derivative of UI in the
eu equation is 0.009, while the estimated effect in the en
equation is—0.0l4. Although the en effect is still somewhat
larger, (in absolute value)       the   difference between them is not
statistically significant.28       It   appears that imposition of
linearity distorts the evidence on labor force withdrawal. When
a   more appropriate functional    form is aplied estimates are
obtained which are reasonably consistent with the notion of off—

setting flows. Overall, the evidence points to UI as a major
factor in decisions to leave employment.

Transitions into the Labor Force
     Estimates of the effect of UI on movements into the labor
force are examined in Table 8. Both linear probability
                                                         results
and results from the logit specification are presented.
                                                          The
results are based on an estimate of what benefits would be
available if one were eligible and became unemployed. 29
                                                            We
have also calculated the number of weeks of employment
                                                         needed to
qualify for benefits, and estimated its impact.
     It is evident in both sets of results that UI
                                                     encourages
the flow into unemployment through the benefit structure.
                                                            In
column 2, however; we find that eligibility rules and attachment
tests appear to cut the other way. The results indicate a
negative effect of WKSND, while UIBEN is positive and statistically
significant. The sign of WRSND seems reasonable.. We would
                                                            expect
that individuals with a requirement of a week or two would
                                                           appear
in the unemployment category sooner and more
                                             readily than those
where weeks needed were sizable. This
                                        is particularly true in
light of the fact that an important part of the NILF group (10

percent) has accumulated sufficient weeks and earnings to
                                                          qualify
for benefits. While a large number of those individuals are
likely to have quit their most recent job, it is quite likely that
some significant number are esentially eligible for benefits
immediately.
     The contrast with the flow into employment is symmetric;
higher benefits are associated with reduced movements into employ-
ment while weeks needed has a positive association, it is likely
                                   50


that the signs of these effects are more than coincidence. One

explanation   for the negative effect of    benefits on p     is that
those   with very attractive replacement    ratios choose to enter
unemployment.    Likewise, the weeks needed variable reveals the
eligibility effect——people choosing to enter employment over
remaining NILF or becoming unemployed tend to require more weeks
worked in order to qualify for benefits.
        In   order to simplify later analysis of UI and   rates   of
employment      and unemployment, we have dropped WKSND from the logit
specification. The evidence in Columns (5)—(8) is consistent
with our previous remarks: UI has a positive effect on the flow
into unemployment, and tends to reduce the flow into employment.
As in the case of movements out of employment, we find that
decisions regarding labor force entry are apparently interrelated,
although the orders of magnitude of the derivatives suggest that
unmeasured differences in individuals may be affecting the results.
      In summary, the evidence in Tables 6-8, points to a significant
and consistent impact on the flow into unemployment out of
employment, a strong effect on pen' generally mixed results for
 the unemployed, and some indication that flows into the labor force
 are influenced by Un

      Estimating   the Impact of UI on the Unemployment Rate

      This section uses estimates of the multinominal logit model

to assess the impact of UI on the measured rate of unemployment,
on   the employment ratio arid the non-patticipation   rate. At the
outset   it is important to realize that the estimates here    can
only be regarded as an approximation to a fully dynamic stochastic
simulation.
     The approach we have adopted makes use of the steady state
relationship between transition probabilities and the fraction of
the population in the three labor market categories. If we let p
indicate the 3x3 matrix of probabilities, and use II to represent
the 3x1 vector of proportions then we know that in steady state,
P11=11. The P matrix is not of full rank, but we can use the fact
that the elements of II sum to one, together with the steady state
identity,   to solve for 11 as a function of P.

      The first step in estimating the impact of UI is to obtain
an estimate o 11 using actual values of the independent variables

including UIBEN. A P matrix is estimated for each individual
using the logit coefficients in tables 6—8 (total sample estimates)
and the individual's characteristics. We then solve for the 11
vector associated with each individual (i.e. the fraction of time
the individual could expect to spend in each state) and cumulate
across individuals to get the aggregate proportions.
      In order to gauge the impact of UI, two situations are
examined. In the first, we reduce potential UI benefits by 10
percent, while potential UI benefits are eliminated completely in
                                           —52—

the   second.     In bath cases, a new p matrix and a new        are
calculated for each individual, and new aggregate steady state

proportions are derived. These can be compared to the original
steady state estimates to see the change induced by UI.
     Table 9 presents estimates of the impact of UI on the
                                                           employ-
ment ratio, the unemployment rate and the rate of
                                                            nan—participation
The first line presents average values of these indicators as
measured by the cr's        during    1978. The unemployment rate averaged
6.0 percent in that year, while a little over 59 percent of the
population was employed. The estimated effect of UI is examined
in lines 2—5. In Line 2, the change in UI is applied to the whole
sample, and the difference between the steady state proportions
with and without the change is reported. The first entry in the
employment column, for example, indicates that reducing UI by 10
percent would lower the steady—state fraction of the population
employed by 0.02 percentage point. Unemployment would be reduced
by 0.08 point, and nonpatticipation would increase by a similar
ama un t.

       When UI benefits are eliminated, however, these        magnitudes are
much larger. In the case of unemployment, for example, we estimate
that elimination of UI would lower the unemployment          rate by more
than   half of a percentage point. With the overall rate on the order
of 6 percentage points, the effect is sizable. Coupled with a
decline in the employment ratio of 0.62 point, the unemployment

effect leads to a significant increase in the rate of non—participa-

tion. Indeed, the dominant effect of UI in these data appears to

be its impact on movements into and out of the labor force. As the

coefficient   estimates suggested, it is likely that transitions
into and out of employment play a significant role in the overall
effect.
     The estimates in Table 9 are derived under assumptions about
changes in UI, but no changes in other variables are introduced.
Many of the independent variables would be unaffected, but it is
likely that wages, in particular, would be affected by changes in
UI. Table 10 presents estimates of the UI impact on labor market
states allowing for the effect of taxes on wages. We assume that
the burden of the UI tax falls entirely on labor, so that
reductions in the tax are fully reflected in an increase in the
wage. The tax rate used was 0.86 percent. it was calculated by
dividing total unemployment insurance receipts by total wage and
salary income for 1978. The rate is small both because the UI tax
applies only to a portion of total earnings and because the rate
is not large to begin with.
     The basic algorithm used to identify the effect of UI is the
same, with the only change being an adjustment in the wage in
addition to changes in UI. it is clear from the table that the
tax adjustment has little impact on the estimated UI effect. In
the results for elimination of UI, for example, comparison with
Table 9 shows that employment would fall somewhat less, and non-
participation would rise somewhat less if wages were adjusted for
tax changes. But the differences are trivial. At least    with the
estimated coefficients and tax rates used here, failure to address

the tax issue has a negligible effect on inferences about the Ui
effect.
      Overall,   the results suggest that UI has a sizable impact
on the rates of unemployment and labor force participation.

Taken literally, the estimates indicate that the growth of UI

over the last decade may have played an important role in the

upward trend in participation. However, the estimates also imply
that UI raises employment, a result which probably reflects the
relative size of the UI effect in the         and eu equations.

Since these estimates may reflect errors of measurement, or non-

linearities in the UI variable, further, analysis seems in order.

      In spite of the preliminary nature of the evidence, the

analysis does underscore the importance of studying the effect of
UI on other labor market groups besides the unemployed. Much

empirical work in this area has concentrated on the behavior of
the   unemployed, but the impact of UI   is clearly much broader. It

appears that transitions into and out of the labor market,
particularly in and out of employment, play a central role in the
overall effect of UI.

    Conclusions

        the results in this paper are all based on microeconoTnetric
evidence.     The information used is basically a Comparison of the
behavior    of persons receiving high UI benefits with those receiving
lower    benefits. This approach asswnes that the effect of a
general change in UI would simply be the sum of the individual
effects. Previous experience suggests that
                                            extrapolating micro—
relationships to the macro sphere is perilous. Here we list some
of the biases in our procedure.
      First, the estimates reported here may underestimate the
impact of UI on some of the transition probabilities. Consider,
for example, the relation between UI and temporary layoffs.
Employers can tailor their layoff policy to the UI    situation of
their   typical worker but not to each individual worker.   Hence
increases in the general level of UI will tend to cause greater
increases in layoffs than would be implied by comparisons of
individuals receiving more or less generous benefits. A similar
point applies with respect to permanent separations.
     Second, the calculation described here depends on the assnnption
that the transition probabilities are determined independently.
While this is reasonable in considering cross—sectional variation
among workers, it may not be tenable in assessing policies with
large impacts. Consider, for example, a measure that sharply re-
duced the flow from unemployment to employment.       This would raise
employers' hiring costs, and so would be likely to reduce the optimal

separation rate. A similar point applies to the relation between
the flows from nonparticipation to    unemployment and from unemploy-
ment to employment.
                              —59—


     Third, changes in UI may have important macro effects. The
role of UI as an automatic stabilizer has been discussed
                                                           frequently.
As important may be the program's impact on the extent of wage
rigidity. By making unemployment more palatable UI is likely to
reduce the downward pressure it places on wages. This will tend to
reinforce the stickiness of wages, which according to many
theories is the cause of unemployment. The cross—sectional analysis
presented here has no way of taking account of these effects.
     Fourth, there are strong reasons to believe that the effects
of UI depend on the overall unemployment rate. The rate of
unemployment was 6.0 percent in 1978. The results might be
very different at business cycle troughs and peaks. One would
expect that the effect of UI is most pronounced when the labor is
in excess demand, and least pronounced when jobs are being rationed.
These propositions could in principle be tested by replicating
this study with data sets drawn at different parts of the business
cycle.
      Beyond the difficulties inherent in the microeconometric
approach taken here, there are a variety of ways in which the
results can be refined. The preliminary results regarded here
consider only small variations in theoretical form. Only crude
account is taken of the potential duration of Ut benefits. A
crucial problem is errors in variables. The UI variables used here
necessarily involve some imputation error. Perhaps more
 important, there is evidence that the dependent variables suffer
from significant measurement error. It appears that the rate of
flow between labor force states may be exaggerated by as much as a
                                         —60—



factor of two or three. In future work we hope to address these

issues. It is also hoped that it will be possible to explore a
broader menu of alternative reforms.
        Several   conclusions emerge from our research at this stage.
UI has large effects on the decisions to seek and leave employment.
The possibility of becoming eligible for benefits attracts many
workers into the labor force. The program also encourages persons
leaving employment to enter unemployment rather than the          NILF
state. To some extent this may be a reporting rather than a
behavioral effect. Taken together these results imply that UI has
a substantial positive effect on labor force participation, our
econometric estimates suggest that eliminating the program would
reduce the labor force participation rate by about 1 percent. This
drop—off would come from a decline of about half a percent in the
employment ratio, and about two-thirds of a percent in the employment
rate.                                           -

        Our   results suggest that   a   focusing on unemployment effects
of UI as has been done in most previous research may be very
mis leading. Our estimates imply that the program simultaneously
increases both employment and unemployment. Future research should
concentrate on the direct employment impact of the UI program.
     These results must be used cautiously in interpreting labor
market developments. The effects of the UI program probably
increased somewhat during the 1970's as benefits and coverage levels
were raised. Of equal importance, rising marginal tax rates, due
                                  —61—


primarily to increasing Social Security
                                         payroll taxes, raised
replacement rates. The results suggest that
                                              these developefl
may have contributed to the increase in the
                                             national Unemployrne
rate and participauon rate which were
                                       observed during the decaae,
Since the increase in the level of the
                                       average rep1acent rate
was probably less than twenty percent, it is
                                              doubtful that the
effecth studied here can account for a
                                       large part of the movements
which have taken place. it may be that other
                                               social insurance
programs have contributed to
                               the remaining increase. This guestio
is left for future research

       weeks of benefits already received in the    current spell.

                                       in the program is as follows: if
        The adjustment incorporated
            is weeks in the current spell, cc = MAX
                                                      -     + 10.       Our

        calculation assumes that all weeks of unemployment in the
        previous year were accumulated in one spell. This formula
                                —66—




     assumes no overlap between
                                    benefit years.
                                                The true formula
     is weeks to exhaust + MAX2. We
                                     have no information
                                                         On the
     point at which the spell
                              of unemployme began and therefore
     have ignored the overlap problem. The
                                                 effect is to overstate
     somewhat potential duration.

     The possibility of overlapping benefit years
                                                  may reward some
     individuals who have experienced some unemployment
                                                             in the
     previous  year. Consider the case of two individuals each laid
     off at the same time. Assmne that one has no
                                                       previous
     unemployment experience, while the other
                                                  was unemployed for
     4   weeks 9 months ago. Given sufficient earnings and
                                                           weeks of
     unemployment,   the first individual will
                                                 begin a benefit year
     and have a maximum potential
                                    duration of 26 weeks.    The second
     individual, however, will reach the end of the first benefit

     year in 12 weeks, and subject to
                                      eligibility tests, will receive
     an additional 26 weeks in the second
                                          benefit year. Thus the
     individual with unemployment experience has a potential
                                                             duration
     of 38 weeks, while the first individual has 26.

     The sample used to estimate the earnings function was composed

     of employed individuals who participated in both the March
     and. May 1978 CI'S. The specification included controls for

     years of schooling, race, age, region, weeks worked in the
     previous year, location (S.}1.S.A., central city), sex,
                               —67—




     marital status, and Mills! ratio. The dependent variable was

     the log of usual weekly earnings. Mills! ratio was estimated

     using a probit model of employment status. For Mills' ratio,

     see James 3. Heckman, "The Common Structure of Statistical

     Models of Truncation, Sample Selection and Limited Dependent

     Variables and a Simple Estimator for Such Models," Annals of

     Economic and Social Measurement, vol. 5 (Foll 1976) , pp. 475—

     In the general case, a given probability for the 1th individual
     can be written as




                     +—l x.S
                 1+1 e1
                    j=1


     where j indexes choices, and the Xs are characteristics.

     The likelihood function can be formed as a product of the

     appropriate probabilities, and maximized with conventional

     non—linear techniques.

     Inspection of the data set for left-out variables
                                                           that may
     lie at the foot of the unrealistic
                                       en coefficient suggests
     one possibility. Because of technological differences and

     differences in required skill and ability, an individual's

     occupation and industry may be an important determinant of
     labor force exit. In order to test this possibility we
     estimated a new set of reqressions with broad industry and

     occupation dummies. In doing this we run the risk of

     "overcontrolling" possible effects of UIBEN which may work

     through occupational choice or the decision of where to work.
     The results are instructive. We find that the industry

     and occupation dummies reduce the coefficient of UIBEN on
     from 0.042 to 0.027. All of the impact occurs through the

     occupation variables, suggesting that the omitted variables
     of interest have to do with skills and training, rather than

     conditions of demand or risk shifting through contracts.

     This view is supported in the layoff regression. There we

     find that the industry and occupation dummies have virtually
     no effect on any of the previous coefficients.
