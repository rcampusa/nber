                                        ABSTRACT

The Dow Jones Industrial Average has historically been the most quoted stock index in the
United States. It has several unique features. It uses price weights, it ignores cash dividend
payments, and it also treats stock dividends, rights issues, and other corporate actions
inconsistently. We show that price indices which use alternative weighting methods and more
systematic inclusion criteria perform similarly to the Dow. However, ignoring cash and stock
dividends underestimates the long-run returns earned by stock market investors dramatically. If
the DJIA had consistently adjusted for dividends and other corporate actions since 1928, the
index would have closed at 1,113,047 instead of 28,538 points at the end of 2019.

1. Introduction

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is one of the most quoted stock market indices in the

world. The index is often perceived to reflect the performance of the U.S. stock market. This paper

replicates the DJIA since 1928 and investigates whether the index is indeed representative of the

performance of the U.S. stock market.



Charles Dow, one of the founders of Dow Jones & Co., created the first stock market index in

1884. He began with 11 large stocks, most of them railways. The Industrial Average was first

published on May 26, 1896. It included all 12 industrial companies listed on the New York Stock

Exchange, as industrial and manufacturing firms were increasing in importance relative to the

previously dominant railroads. Its base value was 40.94 points.1 In 1916, the Industrial Average

was increased to 20 stocks, and in October 1928, the number was expanded to 30 securities. Also

in 1928, the index providers began calculating the average with a special divisor to avoid

distortions when constituent companies split their shares or when one company was substituted

for another. In 2012, S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC was launched as a joint venture between S&P

Global, the CME Group, and News Corp. They maintain stock market indices as benchmarks and

as the basis of investable products, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), mutual funds, and

derivatives.2



The DJIA is a price-weighted index that measures the performance of some of the largest U.S.

companies. The 30 companies currently in the DJIA are large, but not necessarily "industrial." The

includes additional information about the methodology and history of the DJIA (www.spdji.com/djia).

                                                      2
companies represent every important sector in the stock market (except transportation companies

and utilities). Membership in the DJIA is not determined by purely quantitative criteria. Instead,

companies are included in the DJIA only if they have an excellent reputation, demonstrate

sustained growth, and are of interest to a large number of investors. Companies should be

incorporated and headquartered in the U.S. and a plurality of the revenues should be derived from

the U.S. Reconstitutions to the index are made as-needed and are relatively rare.3 Table A.1 in the

Appendix lists the companies in the DJIA at the end of December 2019.



The DJIA has several unique features. First, each company in the index is weighted by the price

of its stock. The importance of each company in the index does not depend on the total market

capitalization (a measure of the size) of the company. Instead, a highly priced stock has a higher

weight than a lower priced stock. Each time a company in the DJIA splits, the weight of this

company decreases because the stock price falls by the ratio of the split.



Second, the constituents of the DJIA are not representative of the market as a whole. The 30 firms

are chosen among large-capitalization firms to represent different industries, but they are not

chosen according to fixed pre-determined rules. In particular, the DJIA is not an index of the 30

largest companies in the United States. Furthermore, a more representative index would include a

much larger number of companies.



Third, the index has treated corporate actions, such as stock dividends and rights issues in an

inconsistent way over its long history. While the index has typically adjusted its divisor for stocks

  This characterization is obtained from S&P Dow Jones (2021). The document includes additional information on the
index construction.

splits, it has frequently not adjusted it for stock dividends, which are conceptually identical to stock

splits. For example, the index providers announced in 1947 that they would only adjust the divisor

for large stock dividends that would change the average by more than one point. Similarly, the

index also ignored most rights issues, which were fairly popular in the early part of our sample

period. Although each individual corporate action may not have a substantial impact on the index

on a daily basis, these omissions can create a significant downward bias over the longer term.



Fourth, in the early part of our sample, the DJIA also exhibits some discrepancies due to an

infrequent adjustment of the divisor and due to coarse rounding. For example, stock splits in the

1920s were incorporated in the divisor with a date discrepancy of several months. Furthermore,

the divisor from 1935 to 1947 was rounded to only one significant digit, which could generate

discrepancies due to rounding of as much as 0.4 percent of the level of the DJIA for each divisor

change. These discrepancies will not systematically bias the index as each of these discrepancies

is about equally likely to increase or decrease the value of the DJIA.



Fifth, the DJIA is not a total return index because it excludes dividend distributions, as emphasized

previously by Clarke and Statman (2000) and Shoven and Sialm (2000). Dividends account for a

considerable portion of returns to shareholders in the long run. If a stock index is used to gauge

the return earned by market participants over long periods of time, a total return index would be a

far superior representation. The difference between a total return index and a price return index

becomes noticeable for periods as short as a quarter. Over shorter periods, the two types of indices

are similar. Hence, a total return index dominates a price return index in gauging the returns

experienced by stockholders.



                                                   4
We find that the price weighting and the selection of the index constituents do not have a

significant impact on the long-term performance of large-capitalization stocks in the U.S. For

example, the arithmetic average price return of the DJIA from 1929-2019 amounts to 6.97% per

year, whereas the corresponding average returns are 6.78% for a value-weighted index of the

constituents of the DJIA and 6.68% for a value-weighted index of the largest 30 firms publicly

traded on U.S. stock exchanges (i.e., Big 30 index). The returns for these alternative indices are

not statistically significantly different from the return on the DJIA. We only find reliably superior

performance for equal-weighted indices. For example, an equal-weighted index of the 30 DJIA

constituents with annual rebalancing has an average price return of 7.68% over our sample period.



The inconsistent treatment of stock dividends, rights issues, and other corporate events has a

moderate impact on value of the DJIA. Incorporating these events based on the CRSP stock price

database increases the value of the DJIA by approximately 15.3% over our entire sample period

(i.e., the DJIA would have been at 32,914 instead of 28,538 points at the end of December 2019).



In contrast to weightings and corporate actions, ignoring cash dividends results in a dramatic

under-estimation of the performance of stock markets over the long run. If all cash dividends since

October 1928 had systematically been reinvested in the constituents of the DJIA, the price-

weighted DJIA would have closed at the end of December 2019 at 1,113,047 points instead of just

28,538 points. Thus, the index value would have been almost 40 times higher if reinvested

dividends had been included. The average annual return is 11.28% with dividends and just 7.11%

without dividends (using our replicated index). Since few firms in the DJIA pay dividends on a




                                                 5
typical day, dividends do not play an important role when judging daily index returns. However,

ignoring dividends has a dramatic impact over long horizons.



The literature on the merits and failings of the DJIA is almost as old as the index itself. Comer

(1952), Hartman and Decker (1953), Shaw (1955), Milne (1966), and Rudd (1979) discuss the role

of stock splits, the weighting methods, and the industry composition of the DJIA. Hartman and

Decker (1953) identify a bias in the index due to stock dividends and rights issues. They also

suggest that the weighting should not be adjusted after a stock split since a split occurs "at the time

the particular stock is at the top part of its historical influence on the average" (p. 45). An upward

bias results from the fact that the Milne (1966) computes the performance of alternative indices

based on value, price, and equal weights. He suggests that "the DJIA should take advantage of the

advent of the computer to make the more elaborate calculations necessary for a logical and

consistent stock price index" (p. 83).



The importance of dividend payments for the DJIA has been discussed by Clarke and Statman

(2000) and Shoven and Sialm (2000).4 Both papers compute the value of the DJIA incorporating

reinvested dividends. This paper updates the return of the DJIA including dividend payments

through 2019. We investigate the impact of stock dividends, rights issues, and other corporate

actions. Finally, we are now able to compute daily return indices.5 This allows us to replicate the

DJIA more precisely than earlier studies. The official DJIA is practically useless for gauging the

long-term performance of equity markets. Our total return indices rectify this problem.

dividends and capital gains. They show that investors' perception of performance is biased because major indices
ignore dividends.

2. Index Construction

In this section we discuss the construction of price-, value-, and equal-weighted indices and

demonstrate how indices need to be adjusted after index membership changes and after corporate

actions, such as stock splits, rights issues, and cash dividend payments.



A. Price-Weighted Index

The DJIA is a price-weighted index. The actual value of the index can be determined using the

following formula:

                       , .                                                                       (1)


The price of the stock of company i at time t is denoted by Pi,t, and the divisor is given by dt. The

divisor of the DJIA originally equaled the number of companies in the index. Since 1928, the

divisor has changed each time the composition of the index was modified, or a member stock

splits, or a member pays a large stock dividend. These divisor changes ensure that these events do

not cause a discontinuity in the value of the index. The divisor was 0.14744568353097 on

December 31, 2019. Table A.1 in the Appendix lists the 30 companies in the index at the end of

December 2019. Summing the stock prices in Table A.1 and dividing by the divisor gives the value

of the DJIA on this day, which was 28,538.44 points (i.e., 4207.87/0.14744568353097). Boeing

(BA) had the highest weight and Pfizer (PFE) the lowest weight. Apple's (AAPL) weight in the

DJIA was less than half its relative market capitalization. The DJIA corresponds to the value of a

portfolio that is invested in 1/d shares in each company in the DJIA. As of December 31st, 1/d was

around 6.78, which is the number of shares of each of the 30 stocks that equals in value to the

official DJIA. Investors trying to replicate the performance of the DJIA average would need to

rebalance their portfolio whenever the divisor changes.

                                                 7
B. Divisor Changes

To correctly capture the total performance for investors in a price-weighted index, one needs to

adjust the index for different events: First, the portfolio weights need to be changed whenever the

index provider swaps constituents. The DJIA achieves this by changing the divisor so that the level

of the index at the close on the day prior to the swap with the old constituents (i.e.,                               is

identical to the index with the new constituents (i.e.,    . The new divisor                                    can be

computed based on the following equation:

                                 ,                    , .                                                            (2)




Second, the divisor needs to be adjusted when a stock splits or when a stock distributes a stock

dividend.6 Suppose a company does a two-for-one split of stock i taking place on date t+1 (i.e.,

 ,        2). In this case, the new divisor                can be computed from the following equation:

                                                           ,
                                 ,                             .                                                     (3)
                                                       ,




Third, the divisor also needs to be adjusted after rights issues, spinoffs, and stock distributions.

For example, suppose stock i makes on date t+1 one of these distributions that has a dollar value

of  ,     . In this case, the price of the stock should decrease by  ,                    on the ex day. The new

divisor         can then be derived from the following equation:7



6
  A stock dividend is a dividend that is made in shares rather than in cash. For example, a stock dividend of 5% requires
the firm to issue 0.05 shares for every share owned by existing shareholders, so the owner of 100 shares would receive
5 additional shares. Thus, stock dividends are conceptually identical to stock splits.
7
  This adjustment method allows the index provider to determine the divisor and the index value on the day prior to
the ex-dividend day. It appears that this is the method that the DJIA uses to adjusted for special dividends. An
alternative adjustment would be to use the following formula:                                      ,             ,
            ,   . In this case, one would only be able to compute the divisor at the close on the ex-dividend day.

                                                               8
                                          ,                               ,           ,            .                                             (4)



D. Index Rate of Return

The daily rate of return of the DJIA on dates without events is defined as follows:

                                                            ,                        ,
                                 1                                   1            
                                                                                                   1
                                                            ,                            ,



                         ,           ,
                                                     1        , 1              ,                   1             ,  ,    .                       (5)
                             ,           ,




The divisor cancels out in the first line (i.e.,                                             ) since it does not change when there are no

events. The weight of a stock in a price-weighted portfolio is the relative price of the corresponding

stock (i.e.,  ,       , /   , ). Thus, the return of the DJIA is simply the weighted-average price

return of the index components.



After a composition change, the return of the index only reflects the performance of the new

components:

                                                                ,                                      ,                     ,
                                 1                                       1                                       1       
                                                                                                                                         1
                                                                ,                                          ,                     ,



                                 ,               ,
                                                            1          ,  ,                    .                                                 (6)
                                             ,       ,




However, returns using this alternative method generate total returns that are computed in the conventional way (i.e.,
         ,      ,                                                                                    ,

After a split or stock dividend, the weight of the splitting stock is decreased due to the split ratio,

and the return of the splitting stock is adjusted for the split ratio (i.e.,  ,                                                  = ,     /  , / ,

E. Alternative Weighting Methods

A value-weighted index (VWI) is constructed in the following way:

                                                                                             ,           ,
                         , 1                   ,       , where  ,                         
                                                                                                                    .                               (9)
                                                                                                 ,           ,




The relative market capitalization of company i is denoted with wi,t and Ni,t is the number of shares

outstanding of stock i at time t. A stock split does not affect the value of a value-weighted index

unless it affects the holding period returns of the stock. Apple (AAPL) had, at the end of December

2019, the highest relative market capitalization of the 30 Dow-components of 15.9 percent and

Travelers (TRV) had the lowest weight of 0.43 percent as shown in Table A.1. A value-weighted

index corresponds to a portfolio where each asset is held in proportion to its market capitalization.8


8
 Some indices use float-adjusted market capitalization instead. Float-adjusted indices only count the shares that are
available to investors and exclude closely held shares or shares held by governments or other companies.

                                                            10
The changes of a value-weighted index correspond to the changes of the total market value of all

the companies included in the index. Investors trying to match the index only need to adjust their

portfolio when a constituent company issues new stock or repurchases shares. A price return index

is based on the percentage change in the price (i.e.,  ,      ,    / ,     1), whereas a total return

index includes the impact of dividend payments (i.e.,  ,             ,        ,     / ,     1). The

S&P 500 is a prominent example of a value-weighted price return index.



An equal-weighted index (EWI) gives each of the n companies in the index the same weight:

       W           EW       1       ,                                                           (10)


The number of shares in each company that an investor would need to hold in order to replicate an

equally-weighted index is proportional to 1/Pi,t. Investors need to hold more shares in low-priced

stocks such that the dollar-amount invested in each stock is identical. Investors desiring to

continuously hold an equally-weighted index need to readjust their portfolio continuously by

selling shares in companies that out-performed the index in the previous period and by buying

shares in the companies that under-performed the index. This strategy generates considerable

trading costs and tax liabilities for investments in taxable accounts. Stock splits do not affect the

value of an equally weighted index and do not necessarily require any rebalancing. One way to

reduce the rebalancing costs of an equal-weighted index would be to re-establish the equal

weighting on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis rather than on a daily basis.

The historical values for the DJIA are retrieved from the Dow Jones Daily Industrial Index from

the Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS) at the University of Pennsylvania, Yahoo Finance,

and Williamson (2000).9



The membership composition and the history of divisors of the DJIA is obtained from Dow Jones

(2000), the S&P Dow Jones Indices, and the Wall Street Journal.10



Figure 1 represents the official DJIA from October 1, 1928 to December 31, 2019. The DJIA

started at 240.01 points on October 1, 1928 and ended at 28,538.44 points on December 31, 2019.

During the Great Depression, the Dow decreased by 89 percent from a high of 381.17 points on

September 3, 1929 to a low of 41.22 points on July 8, 1932.

4. Replication Discrepancies

In this section we identify several discrepancies between the DJIA and the replication based on

the CRSP database.



A. Stock Splits and Stock Dividends

Table 1 reports the corporate actions that require an adjustment in the divisor of a price-weighted

price index. Stock splits are the most common actions amounting to 158 events over our sample

period. All but one of these stock splits led to adjustments of the divisor of the official DJIA.13




13
  On September 18, 1955, Sears Roebuck & Company (S) had a 1% stock dividend that is classified in the CRSP
database as a stock split.

                                                    13

          Stock dividend                    105                      81                          59.1%
            Rights issue                     52                      51                          37.2%
              Spin-off                       26                       1                          0.7%
     Non-ordinary distribution               15                       3                          2.2%
        Step in liquidation                   1                       0                          0.0%
         Partial liquidation                  1                       0                          0.0%




The second-most frequent action is stock dividends, which are conceptually identical to stock

splits. Over our sample period, we observe 105 stock dividends. However, only 24 of these stock

dividends have been recognized by the DJIA, leading to an adjustment in the divisor.14

Historically, the DJIA has adjusted for relatively large stock dividends, but did not adjust for

smaller stock dividends: The average stock dividend of DJIA components that is not accompanied

by a divisor change amounts to 3.02%. The failure to adjust the divisor for some stock dividends

results in a downward bias in the DJIA. The inconsistent treatment of DJIA between stock splits

and stock dividends and within stock dividends (between larger and smaller ones) is problematic

and biases the index value downwards.



B. Rights Issues and Spin-Offs

Rights issues are also fairly frequent events that are almost always ignored by the providers of the

DJIA.15 Rights issues are valuable for stock investors and ignoring these events understates the



14
   On December 3, 1947, Dow Jones decided that "any stock dividend, etc. that will change the averages by one or
more points should be recognized by a change in divisors." Not all stock dividends are small. For example, Goodyear
Tire & Rubber's issued a 100% stock dividend on September 11, 1951. This stock dividend would be identical to a
two-for-one stock split.
15
   American Telephone & Telegraph Company (ATC) issued a right offering of one share of stock for each ten shares
held (purchase price $100 per share) on September 14, 1956.

performance of an index. Unlike rights issues, which are ignored, the DJIA adjusts its divisor for

most spin-offs of Dow component companies.

Table 2 shows that most of the events unrecognized by a divisor change occur prior to 1970.

Interestingly, overall events have declined over the last two decades as firms are less likely to split

their shares and execute other corporate actions.



C. Date Discrepancies

We also identify around a dozen discrepancies between the event dates provided by CRSP and the

dates used by the DJIA to adjust the divisor. Although most of these discrepancies occur in the

early part of the sample (1928-1932), some discrepancies occur as late as 2009. For example,

according to the CRSP database, American Smelting (AR) performed a three-for-one stock split

on December 27, 1928 and Radio Corporation (RCA) performed a five-for-one stock split on

March 12, 1929. However, the DJIA adjusted the divisor for both stock splits on January 9, 1929,


                                                  15
when it also replaced Victor Talking Machine with National Cash Register. Although the DJIA

uses different effective dates for the stock splits, the index providers adjust the prices of the

splitting companies to ensure that there are no discontinuities in the index levels.



D. Price Discrepancies

The prices provided in the CRSP database in some circumstances do not correspond to the prices

apparently used by the index providers.16 This may be due to the fact that the DJIA and CRSP use

different data providers or that prices in the CRSP database are changed retroactively. These

discrepancies will typically only have a temporary impact on the level of the DJIA until the price

discrepancies disappear. A permanent difference in the level of the DJIA results if the price

discrepancies happen on the days the divisor is adjusted. In this case, the future divisors will all be

affected by the price discrepancy.



E. Rounding of Divisor

A final discrepancy occurs due to the rounding of the divisor. The DJIA provider rounded the

divisor to tenths from November 20, 1935 to May 30, 1947, to hundredths prior to November 20,

1935 and from May 30, 1947 to June 18, 1956, and to thousandths from June 18, 1956 to May 12,

1992. Since May 12, 1992, the DJIA is computed based on a divisor that includes at least eight




16
   On July 3, 2014, the prices provided by S&P Dow Jones Indices for five companies do not match the prices in the
CRSP database. ExxonMobil (XOM)'s provided price is 102.26, whereas XOM's CRSP price is 102.59. Similarly,
price differences for the other four companies are as follows: General Electric (GE) 26.85 versus 26.86, Johnson &
Johnson (JNJ) 105.84 versus 105.42, JPMorgan (JPM) 57.13 versus 57.05, and American Express (AXP) 95.82 versus
95.84. These price discrepancies result in a single-day difference in the calculated DJIA of 0.9 Dow points when
summing up the prices and dividing by the divisor.

significant digits. These rounding differences have a permanent impact on the DJIA that can be

economically significant.17



5. Replicated Indices of Dow Components

In this section we construct an alternative price-weighted price index of the Dow components that

correctly adjusts for corporate events such as stock splits, stock dividends, rights issues, and spin-

offs based on the CRSP database.



A. Replication using CRSP Data

We compute the value of a price-weighted index of the Dow components since 1928 using the

CRSP database. We consistently adjust for stock splits, stock dividends, rights issues, and spin-

offs using the information provided by the CRSP database. We set the initial value of the replicated

index equal to the "official" Dow at the beginning of the sample period, which is 240.01. We refer

to this replicated Dow Jones index as the DJIA-R, whereas the official Dow Jones is simply

abbreviated by DJIA.



Figure 2 contrasts the values of the official and the replicated DJIA from October 1928 to

December 2019. Although the two indices closely track each other, the replicated index exhibits a

higher overall value as the missed stock dividends and right issues bias the value of the official

DJIA downwards. At the end of December 2019, the DJIA closed at a value of 28,538.44 points,




17
  On May 16, 1947, Kodak performed a five-for-one stock split and the divisor changed from 13.3 to 12.2. However,
the unrounded divisor should have been 12.18495326 using an initial divisor of 13.3. The index value without
rounding the divisor would have been 165.17 points, which is 0.12 percent higher than the actual DJIA of 164.97. The
maximum rounding error with a divisor of 12.2 would be around 0.4 percent (i.e., 0.05/12.2).

                                                        17
whereas the replicated DJIA, with all corporate events accounted for, closed at 32,913.65 points.

Overall, the official DJIA is biased downward by 15.3 percent.

To test whether the performance difference between the official and the replicated DJIA is

statistically significant, we compute the annual price returns of the two indices and test whether

the mean returns are significantly different using a paired t-test. The p-value of the test is 0.0004,

which indicates that the return difference is statistically significant. We also find that the replicated

index outperforms the official DJIA in 60 of the 91 years covering our sample period.18

  The annual mean returns, standard deviations, and p-values exclude the partial year of 1928 that occurs in our
sample. Thus, these calculations include only values from the first trading day of 1929 to December 31, 2019.

B. Decomposition of Index Discrepancies

To investigate which of the event types explain the difference between the official and replicated

DJIA, we sequentially adjust our replicated index for various corporate actions. The time series of

the percentage difference are reported in Figure 3. The orange curve shows the overall percentage

discrepancy, which amounts to 15.3 percent at the end of the sample period. Most of this

discrepancy occurs before 1960 as stock dividends and rights issues, which have been typically

ignored by the providers of the DJIA, but they are less common in recent decades.



The discrepancy between the official and our replicated DJIA shrinks to 5.5 percent if we exclude

stock dividends, to 1.4 percent if we additionally exclude rights issues, and to 0.06 percent if we

also exclude all other corporate events. In contrast to these events, adjusting for date discrepancies

actually reduces the value of the replicated index by 1.6 percent.



Overall, the downward bias of the DJIA can be explained primarily by stock dividends and rights

issues that have been ignored by the index provider in early years. The other discrepancies generate

some noise in the time series but do not have large impacts on the index values.

6. Weighting

In this section we analyze whether the performance of the DJIA differs from the performance of

other indices formed using alternative weighting methods (i.e., price-, value-, and equal-weighted)

and alternative compositions (i.e., Dow firms, largest 30 firms, S&P firms, total market).



A. Different Weighting of Dow Components

The three main weighting methods for indices are price-, value-, or equal-weighted. Figure 4

depicts the time-series of the three indices using the official membership composition determined

by the DJIA. The price-weighted index corresponds to our replicated index that consistently

includes stock dividends, rights issues, and other corporate events (i.e., DJIA-R). The value-

weighted index (i.e., VW-DJIA) is based on the market capitalizations of the securities at the prior-

day close. The value-weighted index needs to be rebalanced whenever the composition of the index


                                                       20
changes or when the number of shares outstanding changes. The equal-weighted index (i.e., EW-

DJIA) is rebalanced whenever the composition of the DJIA changes and at the end of each calendar

year.19

Over our sample period, the equal-weighted index of the Dow components outperforms the price-

and value-weighted versions. The end-value of the equal-weighted index is 47,972.46 points,

whereas the price- and value-weighted indices closed at 32,913.65 and 22,142.33 points,

respectively. The equal-weighted index outperformed the price-weighted index in 49 of the 91



19
   The equal-weighted index is not rebalanced daily to avoid biases caused by the bid-ask bounce, microstructure
frictions, and data errors. An equal-weighted index needs to purchase securities when the stock price drops and sell
securities when the stock price increases. If stock prices bounce from the bid to the ask price, then a daily rebalancing
strategy will tend to buy at the bid price and sell at the ask price, which is not possible.

years, whereas the value-weighted index underperformed the price-weighted index in 48 of the 91

years. The paired two-tailed p-values are 0.42 for the difference between equal and price weights

and 0.11 for the difference between value and price weights. The superior performance of the equal

weighted index is related to the small-firm effect first reported by Banz (1981). Even within the

relatively large firms in the DJIA, smaller firms tend to outperform larger firms.



B. Different Index Composition

The companies in the DJIA are not representative of the market as a whole. The components of

the DJIA are chosen by the index provider to represent different industries, but they are not chosen

according to fixed rules. The index initially included only industrial firms, as indicated by its name.

However, the index providers added technology, finance, and consumer goods firms in the 1980s

and 1990s to enhance the representativeness of the index. Furthermore, the DJIA includes only 30

relatively large firms. A more representative index would need to include a larger number of

companies.



Figure 5 shows the number of firms included in the CRSP database over our sample period. The

number of firms publicly listed amounted to only 625 in 1928. The number of publicly-traded

firms increased substantially in the 1970s, when NASDAQ was founded. The number reached a

maximum of 7,533 in 1997. Since then, the number of publicly-traded firms has declined by more

than 50 percent to 3,619.



The representativeness of firms in the DJIA has fluctuated substantially over time. The firms in

the DJIA accounted for less than 30 percent of the total market capitalization of publicly-traded



                                                  22
firms in the late 1920s. The representativeness of these firms increased during the Great

Depression and reached more than 40 percent in the early 1940s. The representativeness of the 30

Dow firms deteriorated subsequently as more firms became publicly listed. The 30 firms in the

DJIA accounted for 25.9 percent of the market capitalization at the end of 2019.

Figure 5 also depicts the representativeness of the 30 largest firms in the CRSP database as

measured by market capitalization (i.e., Big 30 index). The representativeness of these largest

firms tracks the representativeness of the firms in the DJIA fairly closely. At the end of 2019, the

largest 30 firms accounted for 35.9 percent of the total market capitalization of U.S. securities, as

measured by the CRSP database.

To study the impact of different index compositions, we summarize in Figure 6 the performance

of the DJIA, the Big 30 index, the S&P Composite, and the CRSP total market index, which

includes all publicly-traded firms.20 To focus on the composition effect, the figure reports the

value-weighted versions of the three indices.



The CRSP total market index outperforms both the value-weighted DJIA and the Big-30 index.21

Interestingly, the performance of the Big-30 index is almost identical to the performance of the


20
   The S&P Composite Index includes 90 firms until February 28, 1957 and 500 firms subsequently (excluding
different share classes). We obtain the daily price and total returns of the S&P index from CRSP. The values do not
exactly correspond to the official S&P indices, as CRSP replicates the historical index values using their database and
the membership composition. For example, the deviation amounts to 1.82 percent from July 1962 to December 2019,
when both series are available.
21
   We focus on the value-weighted Big 30 index, as a price-weighted index would be disproportionately weighted
towards stocks with high stock prices. For example, at the end of December 2019, a price-weighted Big 30 index
would put 97.72 percent of the weight on Berkshire Hathaway, which had at that time a stock price of $339,590. Apple
would only have a weight of 0.08 percent. This example demonstrates that price-weighted indices can be very poorly
diversified.

                                                          24
value-weighted DJIA. However, the differences in performance are not statistically significant.

The p-values for the differences in returns are 0.87 and 0.44, respectively.



Table 3 summarizes the mean annual price returns, the standard deviations of the annual returns,

and the p-values for whether the annual returns of the various price indices differ from the

published DJIA.22 It may be surprising that the long-term performance of the different indices is

fairly similar and typically not statistically different from the official DJIA. Over a very long

horizon it does not play a significant role how the indices are constructed. The performance of the

DJIA is fairly similar to other large-capitalization price-return indices.



It is interesting that the standard deviations are also very similar across the different portfolios.

One may have expected broader portfolios to exhibit lower standard deviations due to the superior

diversification levels. However, the DJIA tends to include more mature firms that tend to exhibit

lower volatilities than younger and smaller firms.



Table 3 also reports the Sharpe ratios of the different price indices.23 The Sharpe ratio is lowest for

the value-weighted Dow (i.e., 0.177) and highest for the equal-weighted Dow (i.e., 0.217). Broader

indices such as the S&P and the CRSP total market index exhibit higher Sharpe ratios than

narrower indices.




22
   The annual mean returns, standard deviations, and p-values in Tables 3 and 4 exclude the partial year of 1928.
23
  The Sharpe ratio is defined as the annual return of a portfolio in excess of the risk-free rate divided by the annualized
standard deviation.

7. Cash Dividends

All the indices considered until now are price indices, which exclude returns from dividend

distributions. Although dividend payments generate small return effects for broadly diversified

portfolios on a daily basis, these payouts are very important over longer time horizons.24 In this

section, we study the impact of including cash dividends in stock returns.25



A. Dividend Yield

Figure 7 depicts the annual dividend yield of the price-weighted DJIA over our sample period. The

dividend yield is calculated by first determining the price-weighted difference between the total

returns and price returns, as defined by CRSP, for each company. These daily price-weighted

return differences are then summed up over a calendar year to calculate the annual dividend yield.



24
   The DJIA has included four special dividends by adjusting the divisor. These dividend payments were the $39.625
special dividend by Union Carbide (UK) in 1986, the $4 and $3 special dividends of Texaco (TX) in 1989, and the $3
special dividend by Microsoft (MSFT) in 2004.
25
   S&P Dow Jones Indices computes a total return index for the DJIA starting on September 30, 1987.

                                                       26
The average dividend yield of the DJIA from 1929-2019 equals 3.86 percent. The dividend yield

has decreased substantially since the early 1980s as firms partially substituted share repurchases

for dividends.

B. Index Values with Dividend Payments

To incorporate the returns of dividend payments to the index values, we recursively compute the

price-weighted total return index by including the dividend payments on a daily basis. The initial

value is set equal to the value of the DJIA at the beginning of October 1928.

Whereas the other adjustments discussed earlier in our paper have small or moderate impacts on

the indices, adjusting for dividends has an enormous impact on the accumulated value for long-

term strategies when those dividends are reinvested. The replicated DJIA without dividend

payments accumulated to 32,914 points by the end of 2019. On the other hand, including dividend

payments and reinvesting those dividend payments back into the index increase the index level by

34 times to 1,113,047 points. Thus, ignoring dividend payments understates the performance of

long-term stock investors dramatically.




C. Alternative Weighting Methods

Our final analyses compute the total return indices using different weighting methods and index

compositions.

Figure 9 summarizes the time-series patterns of the price-, value-, and equal-weighted indices of

the Dow components. Consistent with our prior analysis based on price returns, we find that the

equal-weighted index outperforms the price-weighted index and the value-weighted index

underperforms the price-weighted index. The end values are 1,820,443 points for the equal-

weighted return and 881,297 for the value-weighted return.

Figure 10 studies the impact of different index membership. To focus on the composition effects,

we depict the performance of the value-weighted versions of the indices. The value-weighted S&P

Composite index exhibits the highest performance level and closes at a value of 1,021,118 at the

end of 2019. On the other hand, the Big-30 index exhibits the worst long-term performance.

Table 4 reports the summary statistics for the long-term performance of the total returns of the

different indices. The last column indicates that the mean total returns for all stock indices except

for the equal-weighted DJIA are not statistically significantly different from the total-return DJIA.

The Sharpe ratios are also fairly close to the one for the DJIA. Thus, weighting methods and

membership composition are of second order, whereas the inclusion of dividends is a first order

effect.

8. Conclusions

We discuss in this paper the unique features of the DJIA. It uses price weights, it ignores cash

dividend payments, and it also treats stock dividends, rights issues, and other corporate actions

inconsistently. We replicate the DJIA and show that alternative stock price indices that use superior

weighting methods and more systematic inclusion criteria perform very similarly to the Dow Jones

Industrial Average. However, ignoring cash and stock dividends underestimates the long-run

returns earned by stock market investors dramatically.



Our work suggests that publicizing a value weighted, broadly defined, total return index which

includes dividend payments of stocks would be useful for gauging the returns offered by U.S.

equity markets. Such an index could be continuously computed and might aid people in making

their own portfolio decisions.
