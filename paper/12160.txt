In 1901, six Australian states joined together in political and economic union, creating an internal
free trade area and adopting a common external tariff. This paper investigates the impact of
federation on Australia's internal and international trade flows by studying changes in the "border
effect" over this time. This is possible because Australian states reported intra-Australian trade prior
to 1901 and for eight years after federation. The results indicate that federation itself produced little
change in Australia's trade patterns, but that the border effect increased substantially between 1906
and 1909 when the protectionist Lyne Tariff was imposed.

                  The Impact of Federation on Australia’s Trade Flows


I. Introduction

       In January 1901, the Australian colonies joined together in a political federation,

setting the stage for the formation of a customs union later that year. As a result, all

duties on intra-Australian trade were abolished and a common external tariff was

imposed. The economic impact of this dramatic policy change is an important but

unanswered question in Australian economic history.

       The economic literature on customs unions suggest that a reduction in tariffs will

create trade between partner countries and divert trade away from non-partner countries,

with the effect on economic welfare being ambiguous.1 Although the trade and welfare

implications of a customs union can be evaluated with an applied general equilibrium

model, the demanding data and parameter requirements of such models pose formidable

obstacles to simulating such a policy change for early twentieth century Australia.

       However, it is possible to examine changes in Australia’s “border effect” for this

period, i.e., the difference between its intra-national and international trade, as explored

in a large literature started by McCallum (1995). A unique aspect of Australia’s trade

statistics during this period is that the Australian states collected data on trade with each

other and with foreign countries prior to federation, and continued to do so for nine

years after federation. These data give us a rare glimpse of how the country’s internal

and external trade flows changed as a result of political and economic union.

        This paper studies how Australia’s “border effect” changed in the years between

1890 and 1909. Section 2 describes the events leading up to the formation of the

Australian customs union. Section 3 examines tariff barriers before and after federation

and data on Australia’s internal and external trade flows during this period. Section 4

presents the empirical results of a gravity equation model that permits the estimation of

the effect of national borders on Australia’s trade flows for selected years between 1890

and 1909. To anticipate the main findings, federation does not appear to have resulted

in any discernable shift in Australia’s aggregate trade flows. However, the measured

border effect increased substantially between 1906 and 1909, which may be related to

the imposition of the protectionist Lyne Tariff in 1907. Section 5 concludes the paper.



II. The Formation of the Australian Customs Union

        The Australian states achieved a large measure of tariff autonomy in 1850 with

the passage of the Australian Colonies Government Act by the British parliament. From

the 1850s until Federation, each of the Australian colonies was an independent political

entity that was entitled to determine its own import duties. While British colonial

authorities had no role in setting the structure or height of these tariffs, they did require

them to be non-discriminatory and uniform across all trading partners. As a result, the

duties had to be applied to trade between the Australian colonies. The ban on
                                                                                           4
differential duties meant that the colonies could not give each other, or even Britain,

preferential tariff treatment.

        This ban on discrimination, in keeping with Britain’s strong belief in universal

free trade, had the unintended consequence of preventing closer economic ties between

the Australian states. The imposition of tariffs on intra-Australian trade even became a

source of strife and discontent. Conflict between New South Wales and Victoria over

the customs treatment of border trade along the Murray and Darling rivers was particular

source of difficulty, but was far from the only problem. Six intercolonial conferences in

the decade after 1863 failed to improve matters and “at each the disagreement became

more bitter,” according to Reitsman (1960, p. 6). Indeed, in the words of one historian

of early Australian tariff policy, “the history of the trade relations of the Australian

colonies, it must be confessed, is a sorry record of intercolonial jealousy and strife”

(Allin 1918, p. 1). “Provincialism” is a word often used to describe trade relations during

this period.

        The desire to eliminate these barriers to internal trade was a principal reason for the

movement toward federation in the 1890s. As the first Australian Minister for Trade and

Customs said in parliament in 1901: “Years and years we have struggled for Federation.

Why? So that the fiscal barriers which have so long divided the sister States should be

removed” (quoted in Reitsman 1960, p. 11). Of course, the negotiations leading up to the

formation of the Commonwealth were difficult; New Zealand dropped out of the discussions,
                                                                                             5
                                                               2
and even the participation of Western Australia was in doubt. Eventually, however, a

constitution for the Australian Commonwealth was approved by voters after a second public

referendum in June 1899. The United Kingdom agreed to the arrangement in July 1900, and

on 1 January 1901, the six states of Australia united under the federal constitution.

       Under the constitution, the six states lost their tariff autonomy and all power to

regulate foreign commerce shifted to the federal government. Yet commerce between

the Australia states did not become free of duty until a common external tariff had been

settled upon. The framers of the constitution did not attempt to determine the tariff, but

left this to be decided by the first Australian parliament. The constitution provided that

“uniform duties of customs shall be imposed within two years after the establishment of

the Commonwealth,” but it did not take that long. The first common tariff was

implemented on 8 October 1901. As of that date, all duties on commerce between the

Australian states were abolished. A special constitutional provision permitted Western

Australia to continue to impose duties on goods from other states for five years, with the

duties declining by one fifth each year.



III. Federation and Australia’s Trade Flows

       At the time of federation, the Australian states were highly integrated economies,

with few formal barriers to trade except the tariff. As Forster (1975) put it, “there were

no barriers to the free flow of capital and labour, economic institutions often operated


2
 According to one historian of the period, “For the majority of New Zealanders,
federation with Australia did not make economic or political sense in the face of the
                                                                                            6
across several colonies and of course there was very close resemblance in language,

laws, and social institutions generally.” Federation removed a principal barrier to

exchange between the Australian states, namely tariffs. Over time, economic and

political union also mitigated the influence of other policies that might have acted as

non-tariff barriers between the states.3 The combined impact of reduced tariffs and

harmonized inter-state standards drew the economies of the Australian states even closer

together.

       The impact of the customs union formation in 1901 could be expected to vary by

state, depending upon the height of its pre-federation tariffs. The tariff codes of each

colony were similar in the 1850s, but increasingly diverged after the 1860s (Patterson

1968). New South Wales maintained a free trade policy, eschewing duties on imported

manufactured goods and applying tariffs almost exclusively on “narcotics and

stimulants” (tobacco and alcohol) for revenue purposes. Victoria adopted a more

protectionist policy in levying higher duties on imports of manufactured goods to assist

local industry. The other colonies chose to be somewhere in the middle of this

spectrum, with Western Australia tending more toward the free-trade end and Tasmania

imposing perhaps even higher barriers than Victoria.

       However, it is difficult to assess the magnitude of these pre-federation barriers.


expanding British market.” Quoted in McLean (1995, p. 175).
3
  As Pincus (1995, p. 58) put it: “The new central government was given power over
currency, coinage and legal tender; over banking, insurance, quarantine, corporations,
bankruptcy, copyrights, weights and measures, posts and telegraph and the like; that is,
over the ways in which the colonies had imposed non-tariff barriers on intercolonial
trade.” Other non-tariff barriers, such as different railway gauges, would take decades
                                                                                              7
Quantifying the impact of non-tariff barriers is inherently problematic, and even

determining the height of pre- and post-federation tariffs is not a straightforward

exercise. Table 1 presents some rough indicators on the average tariff barriers of the

states prior to federation. The first column is the percent of imports that entered free of

duty. The second and third columns measure the average tariff based on customs

revenue as a share of total dutiable imports and dutiable imports excluding alcohol and

tobacco. This last measure may be the best indicator of the average tariff imposed on

goods that competed with domestic production because tariffs on alcohol and tobacco

were often revenue duties which coexisted with domestic excise taxes. Even if these

measures do not provide a perfect measure of trade barriers, they seem to provide a

consistent rank ordering of the Australian states in terms of the restrictiveness of their

trade regime.4

       As the Table 1 indicates, New South Wales pursued a policy of low tariffs, with

nearly 90 percent of imports entering duty free. After 1896, New South Wales imposed

no tariffs on imported manufactured goods. The average tariff on dutiable goods of 10



to eliminate.
4
  While the shortcomings of the tariff revenue as a percent of import value are well
known, it may be the best available measure of trade policy. As Rodriguez and Rodrik
(2001, p. 316) note, “It is common to assert . . . that simple trade-weighted tariff
averages or nontariff coverage ratios - which we believe to be the most direct indicators
of trade restrictions - are misleading indicators of the stance of trade policy. Yet we
know of no papers that document the existence of serious biases in these direct
indicators, much less establish that an alternative indicator performs better (in the
relevant sense of calibrating the restrictiveness of trade regimes). An examination of
simple averages of taxes on imports and exports and NTB coverage ratios leaves us with
the impression that these measures in fact do a decent job of rank-ordering countries
according to the restrictiveness of their trade regimes.”
                                                                                              8
percent reflects the revenue raised from specific duties on “intoxicants and narcotics” –

ale and beer, spirits and wine, opium and tobacco. (Domestic excise taxes were also

levied on domestic production of tobacco and alcohol goods, so the tariff was essentially

the international extension of those domestic excises.) Tariffs on other merchandise

were only about one percent of import value. By contrast, Victoria imposed significant

duties on imported manufactured goods and its tariff on merchandise other than

narcotics and stimulants was nearly 20 percent. Tasmania allowed very few goods to

enter the state free of duty, and average tariffs on merchandise exceeded 20 percent.

Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia had tariff rates somewhere in

between the New South Wales and Victoria/Tasmania extremes.

        However, the average tariff measures in Table 1 could be misleading indicators

of the taxes applied to the goods that comprised most of intra-Australia trade. While

Australia’s overseas imports consisted largely of textiles and other manufactured goods

from Britain, Australia’s inter-state commerce consisted more of food, drink, metals,

and agricultural products. The tariff codes for these products were a complex array of

specific duties and domestic excises that make it extremely difficult to determine the

differential impact of tariffs on intra- versus inter-national trade.

        What about the level of the first common external tariff? Forster (1977) suggests

that the political compromise reached by the states in parliament was not between free

trade and existing protection, but between existing protection and further protection. In

his view, the first federal tariff was substantially closer to Victoria’s than to New South

Wales’s. Forster (1977) concludes that “for the colonies as a whole the tariff was raised
                                                                                            9
considerably.” One reason for the increase in the average external tariff is that two

levels of government now had to be funded – the states and the Commonwealth. A key

part of the negotiation leading to federation concerned the division of customs revenues

among the states. The transitional arrangement required the federal government to

return to the states three-fourths of all customs and excise revenue for ten years after

federation. Thus, the first parliament had a stake in raising a significant amount of tariff

revenue because it only got to keep one quarter of the proceeds.

       Figure 1 depicts the average Australia-wide tariff (as measured by total state

customs revenue divided by Australia’s total imports, similar to the state figures in

Table 1) from 1890 to 1913. This figure might give some indication of the height of the

first common external tariff relative to existing tariffs. From 1901 to 1903, the average

tariff rose from about 20 percent to about 28 percent. Not all of this increase was due to

the federal tariff, however, because the cyclicality of this measure is probably

influenced by the interaction of import price movements and specific duties in the tariff

code. That is, the increase in the average tariff after 1900 reflects in part the role of

import price deflation in raising the ad valorem equivalent of specific duties, while the

decline in the tariff from 1903 to 1906 reflects in part the impact of import price

inflation in reducing the ad valorem equivalent of specific duties.5

 Australia’s import price deflator declined 4 percent between 1901/02 and 1904/05, and
increased 13 percent between 1904/05 and 1906/07 (Butlin 1977, p. 81). Because of
specific duties, import price fluctuations also account for much of the change in the
average U.S. tariff over time; see Irwin (1998).
                                                                                             10
       The impact of Federation on the trade of the various states differs depending

upon how the common external tariff compared to its initial tariff level. For example,

New South Wales did not levy any significant tariffs on intra-Australian trade, except on

drink and tobacco. Except for those goods, the customs union formation would not

result in much trade creation with the other Australian states because New South Wales

did not tax their goods prior to the union. However, New South Wales was required to

increase its external tariff considerably as a result of federation, and its imports would

probably be diverted from the rest of the world to the Australian states.

       By contrast, Victoria did impose duties on imports from Australian states. If its

tariff was not changed much by the new common external tariff, then Victoria could be

expected to experience trade creation with the rest of Australia because it abolished all

duties on goods from other states. The other Australian states with high initial tariffs

also may have been in the position of enforcing a similar external tariff but abolishing

duties on internal trade. Western Australia’s trade might not be affected by Federation

much at all since it continued to impose duties on intra-Australian trade until 1907

(albeit duties that were phased out over that time).

       Figure 2 presents one depiction of how intra- and inter-national trade changed

over the period 1893 to 1909. This measure of intra-Australian imports as a share of

total imports for each state shows a slight decline for most states after 1895 until

federation. This decline may be related to the economic recovery from the severe

depression in 1893-95. As incomes recovered, foreign trade expanded at a more rapid

rate than domestic trade (Boehm 1971, pp. 28ff). Political and economic union appears
                                                                                           11
to be weakly associated with a reversal in this decline, but there is not a sharp change

in the shares that might be readily identifiable with federation. Tasmania experiences a

slight rise in the share of intra-Australian imports after federation, but contrary to what

might have been expected, there is not much increase in the share of Victoria’s imports

coming from other Australian states.

       While it is tempting to identify the impact of federation on trade by comparing

Australia’s actual trade before and after 1901 (as in Figure 2), such an ex post

interpretation is problematic because post-federation trade flows may be affected by a

host of factors other than federation itself. A decline in external trade relative to

domestic trade after federation might be mistakenly attributed to trade diversion as a

result of the customs union when in fact it might simply be due to the sensitivity of

foreign trade to income. Specifically, a major drought in 1902-03 resulted in a decline

in real incomes right after federation that particularly affected the trade of New South

Wales. Unfortunately, this problem virtually rules out any direct comparison of trade

flows in 1900 with trade flows in 1902 as a way of measuring the impact of federation.

       Given the problems of a simple ex post evaluation of trade flows, and the

difficulties of constructing an applied general equilibrium model of the Australian

economy at this time, this paper takes an indirect approach in trying to assess the impact

of federation on Australia’s trade. The indirect approach is to estimate the impact of

Australia’s political “border” on its trade by looking at the difference between

Australia’s intranational and international trade around the time of federation.
                                                                                                 12
IV. A Gravity Model of Australia’s Trade Flows

        In an influential article, McCallum (1995) exploits a unique set of data on intra-

provincial trade in Canada to compare the country’s intra- and inter-national trade.

McCallum uses the popular gravity model of bilateral trade flows, which relates a

country’s trade to its economic size and distance from trading partners, to provide an

estimate of the implicit obstacles to trade created by national borders. McCallum

estimates the following equation:

(1)     log (Xit + Xjt) =   +   1   log (yi) +   2   log (yj) +   3   log (DISij) + Dij +   ij


where Xij is exports from region i to region j, yi and yj are the economic size (measured

by GDP) of regions i and j, DISij is the distance between regions i and j, and Dij is a

dummy variable that takes the value of one if regions i and j belong to the same country

(i.e., an indicator of intra-national trade). In this equation, bilateral trade is expressed as

a simple log-linear function of two countries’ or states’ GDP, the distance between then,

and a dummy variable for intra-Canadian trade.

        Using data from 1988, McCallum finds that the coefficient on the dummy

variable was 3.1. Taking the exponential of this estimate yields the result that trade

between Canadian provinces was 22 times greater than trade between the provinces and

the United States, after controlling for distance and incomes. This finding stimulated a

great deal of research on why there was so much intranational and so little international

trade between the countries even though formal barriers to international trade were very

low. (Subsequent work by John Helliwell and others find that the border effect was
                                                                                                               13
only slightly diminished as a result of the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement that

took effect in 1989.)

        As Feenstra (2002, 2004) and Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) point out,

however, this is an upwardly-biased indicator of the magnitude of the border effect.

Because of asymmetries created by differences in country size, there is not one

exclusive measure of the border effect. For example, a given border effect will be large

when measured from the standpoint of a small country, but small when measured from

the standpoint of a large country.

        Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) develop a specification to estimate border

effects that accounts for this difference and is more closely tied to economic theory.

The appropriate specification (constraining the coefficients on GDP to equal one) is:
                                                                             -1                -1
(2) log (Xij/yiyj) = (1 - ) log (DISij) + (1 - )      ij   + log (Pi)             + log (Pj)        + (1 - )   ij,


where    is the elasticity of substitution in consumption between all goods, is the trade

cost or implicit tax barrier to trade between countries, and the P’s are price indicies

(“multilateral resistance terms”) that reflect, among other things, transport costs.

Because the P’s are not readily calculated, country fixed-effects have been proposed as

an alternative estimation strategy that leads to consistent (but less efficient) results. To

reduce the upward bias in the measure of the border effect, the dummy variable is

switched to indicate international trade and not intranational trade. As a result, their

estimating equation is:

(3) log (Xij/yiyj) =    log (DISij) +   (1 - Dij) +   1     i   +   2   j   + (1 - )    ij


where the ’s are indicator variables for state i and region j.
                                                                                          14
        The results from the Anderson and van Wincoop specification in equation (3)

cannot be directly compared to those from the McCallum specification in equation (1).

However, the two can be compared if the McCallum regression is recast by constraining

the coefficients on GDP to equal one such that:

(4) log (Xij/yiyj) =   log (DISij) +   (Dij) +   ij.


This equation will be estimated along with equation (3) simply for purposes of

comparing the results from the two approaches.

        Sufficient data exist from the federation period for these equations to be

estimated for Australia. The intra-Australian trade and external trade data are from the

annual statistical abstracts of the Australian states: New South Wales, Victoria, South

Australia, Queensland, Western Australia, and Tasmania.6 These unique data, which

give us a rare glimpse at a country’s internal trade pattern, were no longer published

after 1909.

        A recurring question about these data is the extent to which they are

compromised by goods in transit between these states but ultimately destined for other

countries. Both New South Wales (Sydney) and Victoria (Melbourne) received goods

from other states in Australia that were to be shipped to the United Kingdom or other

overseas destinations. Fortunately, the export data for New South Wales, Victoria, and

South Australia explicitly separate out locally produced goods from those of other

Australian state whose goods were in transit to other destinations. In addition, Tasmania

South Australia, and the annual Statistics volumes for Victoria, Queensland, and

presented data both on exports and exports by country of final destination (e.g.,

exports to NSW are large, but many were ultimately going to the United Kingdom).

The main concern is for data from Queensland and Western Australia, as sources for

these states do not clearly break out transshipments. However, exports from these states

can be matched with imports from New South Wales and Victoria, and it appears that

Queensland and Western Australia did separate out transshipments in their reported

trade with other Australian states.

       Indeed, transshipment and reexports appear to be less of a problem with the trade

data of the individual states than for the aggregate trade data applied by the

Commonwealth Statisticians starting in 1901. As Boehm (1965, pp. 236-237) notes:

“the understatements apparently apply only to the estimates of overseas exports and

imports. It appears not to apply to the series of imports and exports of each colony

which include both overseas and intercolonial trade and which are particularly useful for

regional analysis.”7

       A related problem is unrecorded transactions between New South Wales and

Victoria across the Murray river. Some assessments in the statistical publications of

 Even so, Boehm shows that transshipments were only about 2 percent of recorded
merchandise exports for Australia in the 1890s. See also Boehm (1971), appendix 1.

that the magnitude of unrecorded trade was not substantial. But there is no simple

method to account for the fact that some river transactions went unrecorded.8

       The sources for the other data are straightforward. Measures of real GDP are

taken from Maddison (2003). Maddison presents data for 20 countries with which some

of the larger Australian states traded: New Zealand, United Kingdom, Canada, India,

Ceylon (Sri Lanka), Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Belgium, Holland (the Netherlands),

France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, China, Japan, Java (Indonesia), Mexico, Peru, and the

United States. For Australia, real GDP is also taken from Maddison (2003) and

apportioned to the various states based on the GDP shares in Cashin (1995). Distance is

       Equations (4) - the variant on the McCallum regression - and equation (3) - the

Anderson and van Wincoop specification - are estimated for the years 1890, 1900, 1906,

and 1909. This gives us a picture of Australia’s trade well prior to federation, just prior

to federation, and for two separate years after federation. The year 1890 is about as far

back in time that sufficient observations are available to make for informative results.

Even so, in this year there are no observations for Western Australia’s or Tasmania’s

exports as neither state reported their trade statistics in sufficient detail. The year 1900

is just prior to federation and includes observations from all states. Ideally, one would

like to examine the year 1902 as the year after federation to compare it with 1900, but

 In results that are not reported, a dummy variable indicating trade between New South
Wales and Victoria was used to see if trade between the two states was smaller than
might have been expected given the economic size and distance between them.
Invariably, the dummy variable was small with a large standard error.
                                                                                             17
the best comparison years (1902-04) are affected by drought. By 1906 the Australian

economy had recovered and so that year is taken as the best representation of Australia’s

trade after federation. The year 1909, the final year in which intra-Australian trade data

were published, captures the impact of the Australian tariff imposed in 1907.

       Table 2 presents the results. For each year, the first column reports results from

our variant of McCallum’s specification (equation 4) and the second column reports

results from Anderson and van Wincoop’s specification (equation 3). Given the

importance of the British Commonwealth to Australia’s trade patterns, a dummy

variable for trade with another Commonwealth country is also included in the

regressions. For 1890, the first column reports that the coefficient on the intra-

Australian trade dummy variable is 3.16. Taking the exponential of this estimate

suggests that intra-Australian trade is 23 times greater than trade between Australia and

the rest of the world. (This result is remarkably close to McCallum’s estimate of intra-

Canadian trade in 1988.) In addition, taking the exponential of the coefficient on the

Commonwealth indicator suggests that trade within the British Empire was 7 times

greater than trade with the rest of the world. As is commonly noted, these are

exceptionally high figures.

       The second column for 1890 includes indicator variables for the exporting state

and for four importing regions (Oceania, Asia, Europe, and the Americas) and reverses

the dummy variable so that it represents international trade. How should we interpret

the estimate of gamma as -1.55, representing international trade? As Feenstra (2002,

2004) notes, in moving from equation (2) to equation (3), (1- )   ij   was replaced by (1-
                                                                                             18
Dij), so equating these two and solving for the exponential of exp( ij) yields exp[ (1-

Dij)/(1- )]. For cross-border trade (Dij = 0), exp( ij) = exp[ /(1- )], and thus the impact

depends upon the elasticity of substitution. If we take      = 5, then the estimate of exp( ij)

= 1.47. This suggests that the implicit border barrier between Australia and the rest of

the world amounts to an implied tax of 47 percent.

       However, this implicit price barrier is highly sensitive to the assumed elasticity

of substitution. With    = 4, for example, the implicit tax rises to 68 percent, and if      =

3, then the tax is about 117 percent. We lack any solid information on the elasticity of

substitution between domestic and foreign goods for this period; it could be that

Australian products were quite different from foreign (imported) goods, making for a

low elasticity of substitution and a higher implicit tax.

       We cannot use the estimate of ( to determine how much more trade there was

within Australia than across the border, but its exponential is equal to the geometric

mean of the border’s impact on intranational trade relative to international trade for each

country, i.e., the average border effect for Australia and rest of the world (Feenstra

2002, 2004). In this case, since e1.55 = 4.7, the average effect of the border is to raise

intranational by a factor of 4.7 above international trade. This clearly indicates that

there was a significant border effect prior to federation.

       The results for 1900 are more noteworthy than those for 1890 because they

includes the trade of all six states, resulting in many more observations. The results

indicate a decline in size of the intra-Australian trade variable, suggesting that the

degree of intra-state trade fell from 23 in 1890 to 16 in 1900. Similarly, the magnitude
                                                                                              19
of the Commonwealth dummy variable falls as well. Despite this, the implicit tax

arising from the fixed-effect estimation indicates a slight decline to 41 percent (again

assuming    = 5). The average border affect is little changed from 1890.

        The real question is how federation changed this border effect. The final four

columns for Table 2 report similar regressions for 1906 and 1909, the last year in which

the Australian states reported data on intra-Australian trade. While intra-Australian

trade exceeded external trade by a factor of 16 in 1900, it exceeds it by a factor of 22 in

1906. One would expect such an increase with the formation of a customs union. The

intra-Commonwealth indicator variable continues to decline relative to 1890 and 1900.

However, in the Anderson and van Wincoop specification, the implicit border tax and

average border effect are slightly smaller in 1906 than in 1900. The implicit border tax

is 41 percent in 1900 and 40 percent in 1906, while the average border effect falls from

a factor of 4.7 to 3.9. Given the similarity in the results for these two years, it appears

that federation did not have a substantial impact on the “border” between 1900 and

1906.

        What explains the fact that internal free trade as a result of federation apparently

brought about no significant changes in Australia’s trade flows? One possibility is that

tariff barriers were not a serious impediment to intra-Australian trade, while non-tariff

barriers (such as different railway gauges) were not immediately affected by federation.

Another possibility is that the high degree of capital and labor mobility between

Australian states in certain industries effectively overcame any significant trade barriers

and these factor flows substituted for trade flows even after the internal tariff was
                                                                                              20
   reduced (Mundell 1957). Unfortunately, the results here cannot shed light on the

   precise reasons why federation did not significantly alter Australia’s trade pattern.

           However, the results for 1909 are strikingly different from the previous years. In

   the McCallum specification, intra-Australian trade is now 40 times greater than external

   trade. In the Anderson and van Wincoop specification, the implicit border tax rises

   from about 40 percent to more than 70 percent, and the average border effect more than

   doubles, increasing from 3.9 in 1906 to 8.9 in 1909.

           The key policy change between 1906 and 1909 was the imposition of the Lyne

   tariff of 1907. By all accounts, the Lyne tariff substantially increased tariff rates. Shann

   (1930) reports that it roughly doubled duties and reduced the number of commodities on

   the duty-free list. According to a League of Nations study, the average Australian tariff

   on manufactured goods rose from 6 percent in 1902 to 16 percent in 1913 (Anderson

   and Garnaut 1987, p. 7). The year 1908 stands out as one in which the average tariff

   jumped noticeably, according to Figure 1. Thus, it appears that a much greater degree

   of trade protection was adopted not as a result of federation, but as a result of legislation

   adopted shortly thereafter.9

           The other significant change in the 1907 tariff was the introduction of tariff

   preferences for the British Commonwealth. These preferences appear to have the slight

   effect of halting the decline in intra-Commonwealth trade that was evident up to this

   point. These effects are all summarized in Table 3, which shows how different the year

federation.

1909 is compared to the other years. These results suggest that the import tariffs

imposed by Australia after federation altered its external trade to a much more

significant degree than the act of federation itself. Yet the difference in the border

indicators between 1906 and 1909 is not statistically significant. When the data from

those two years is pooled with a year dummy and interactions with the year dummy, the

coefficient on the border effect interacted with the year dummy (for 1909) is -0.45 with

a standard error of 1.11. Thus, one cannot reject the hypothesis that the border effects

are the same in both years due to the imprecision with which those effects are measured.



V. Conclusions

       In 1901, six Australian states formed a customs union with political federation.

Although the removal of tariff barriers to intra-Australian trade might be expected to

significantly alter the balance between the country’s internal and external trade, the

share of intra-Australian imports rose only slightly after federation. A gravity equation

model suggests that there was not a significant shift in Australia’s trade in 1906

compared to 1900.

       However, the Lyne Tariff of 1907/08 significantly increased Australia’s external

tariffs and the gravity equation estimates of the “border effect” rise sharply between

1906 and 1909. This suggests that Australia’s growing economic distance from the

world into the mid-twentieth century was much more the result of its own external tariff

policies than to trade diversion resulting from its formation of a free trade area in 1901.
