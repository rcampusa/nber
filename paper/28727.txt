Does Mentoring Increase the Collaboration Networks of Female Economists? An Evaluation
of the CeMENT Randomized Trial

                                         ABSTRACT

Previous research has shown that women in the treatment group of the CeMENT randomized
controlled trial increased their publications and the likelihood that they were tenured in top 50
economics departments. This paper examines one potential mechanism, namely, that CeMENT
expanded the collaboration networks of the participants. Our analysis finds that women who
received the mentoring treatment had three additional pre-tenure coauthors, 1.6 more pre-tenure
publications and 43 additional citations to those publications. After controlling for additional
coauthors, the CeMENT program increased publications, and top-tier publications. These results
suggest that the information conveyed at the workshop facilitated participants' career success.

       Women in the economics field are less likely to get tenure (Ginther and Kahn 2004,

Ginther and Kahn 2014, Ginther and Kahn forthcoming) when compared to their male

colleagues. Research productivity is cited as one of the major reasons for the gender difference in

economic careers in academia (Conley, Önder and Torgler 2016, Conley and Önder 2014).

Studies have shown that collaborations among economists are positively related to the overall

productivity of both men and women (McDowell, Singell and Stater 2006). In this study, we

investigate the impact of the CeMENT mentoring randomized controlled trial on coauthorship

networks. Our results show that the CeMENT workshop expanded coauthorship networks among

treated women, but these additional coauthors do not fully explain the positive impact of the

mentoring workshop.

I.     The Importance of Collaboration in Research Productivity


       Lower research productivity is often cited as a primary reason for women's disadvantage

in academic careers. Conley, Önder and Torgler (2016) found that research productivity is

positively related with the availability of academic jobs for both genders. Women's

responsibility in childbearing and caregiving negatively affects their research productivity

(Joecks, Pull and Backes-Gellner 2014, Krapf et al. 2014). At work, women devote more time in

teaching and other non-research obligations (Taylor, Fender, and Burke 2006, Harter, Becker and

Watts 2011, Manchester and Barbezat 2013).

       Coauthorship is increasingly important for research productivity in economics

(Hamermesh 2012). Several researchers have examined coauthorship and its impact on academic

research productivity (Laband and Tollison 2000, Hamermesh 2012). Although many researchers

have shown a positive association between coauthorship and research productivity, establishing

the causal effect of coauthorship is difficult due to the endogeneity of collaboration networks.
Lee and Bozeman (2005) instrumented coauthorship using a scale for the location of coauthors.

Common research interest between coauthors has also been used as instrument to handle the

endogeneity of coauthorship networks (Ductor 2015).

        A limited number of papers have studied women's collaboration networks. McDowell,

Singell and Stater (2006) showed that female economists were less likely to coauthor than their

male colleagues, indicating that lacking professional research networks might explain women's

lower research productivity. However, women's smaller coauthorship networks may be a

rational choice because Sarsons (2017) found that women were given less credit for coauthored

work than men. In addition, Hengel (2017) and Card et al (2020) found that women economists

may be held to a higher standard for publications than men.

        Given the importance of collaboration to research productivity, we hypothesize that the

CeMENT workshop provides a positive shock to collaboration networks. Since the CeMENT

workshop is a randomized controlled trial, it may result in an exogenous change to professional

networks for those who are treated, giving us an opportunity to examine the coauthorship

networks of CeMENT participants compared to the control group.

II.     The CeMENT Randomized Controlled Trial

        With the support of the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the American Economic

Association (AEA), the AEA's Committee on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession

(CSWEP) established the CeMENT mentoring program to support junior female economists. 1

  CSWEP runs two mentoring workshops. The CeMENT Workshop for Faculty in Doctoral Programs
https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/committees/cswep/programs/CEMENT-mentoring-workshops#doctoral was
originally a randomized controlled trial and is the source of data for this paper. The workshop is held immediately
following the ASSA meetings. The CeMENT Workshop for Faculty in Non-Doctoral programs
https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/committees/cswep/programs/CEMENT-mentoring-workshops#nondoctoral is
held in conjunction with a regional economic association meeting. The Non-Doctoral workshop was not designed as


                                                         2
The National Workshop (now the Workshop for Faculty in Doctoral Programs) focuses on junior

female economists employed at institutions where research accomplishments weigh heavily in

the promotion decision. It was originally designed as a randomized controlled trial and was held

every other year from 2004 to 2014. The AEA funded the workshop every year starting in 2015.

Previous studies have shown that the CeMENT program increased the number of publications,

publications in top journals, and the number of federal grants for treated cohorts and increased

the likelihood that women remained in academia as well as promotion to tenure in top-ranked

economics departments (Blau et al. 2010; Ginther et al. 2020). However, neither evaluation has

fully investigated the mechanism contributing to the improvement in publication outcomes.

        The CeMENT Mentoring Workshop for Faculty in Doctoral Programs was designed to

provide role models (senior female economists) and peers in one's research field. The workshop

is held immediately after the ASSA meetings and lasts two days. Between 40 and 50 junior

faculty attend and are divided into groups of 4 to 5 women in the same field. Two senior female

economists in the same field are assigned to mentor each group. Prior to the conference, each

woman circulates a research paper that will be read and discussed by the group. In between

group sessions, plenary sessions made up of a panel of senior mentors focused on the topics of

research and publishing, getting grants, networking strategies, teaching, the tenure process, and

work-life balance. Thus, the CeMENT intervention focused on strategies for publishing research

as well as providing comments on a specific paper. In addition, the networking strategy session

focused on how to increase professional exposure.




a randomized controlled trial and does not emphasize the same professional development topics as the Doctoral
Workshop.


                                                        3
        Approximately 80 people applied to each workshop. Applications were screened by

completeness and research intensity of an applicant's current institution (those at teaching-

focused universities were re-directed to the Non-Doctoral Workshop). Applicants were assigned

to groups based on research field (e.g. Labor, Macroeconomics, Health, Development, etc.).

Within each field, applicants were randomly assigned to treatment or control groups, and more

applicants were treated than not (e.g. if there were eight applicants in a field, five were selected

as treatments). All applicants were told that there were more applications than slots available in

the workshop, and several women reapplied for the workshop.

III.    Data on Publications and Methods

        We collected the curricula vitae (CVs) and Web of Science publications of the applicants

to the CeMENT workshop. Our Web of Science queries for publications were based on five

years prior to the doctorate through the third quarter of 2018. We collected data on the first eight

CeMENT cohorts from 2004­2016. We did not include the most recent cohorts because it will

take time for potential new collaborations to result in additional publications. In total, there are

512 people in the data. 2 We rank the quality of the doctoral department and first job using the

world rankings of institutions in economics from Kalaitzidakis, Stengos, and Mamuneas (2003).

        Our WOS publication data contain information on year of publication, journal,

affiliations, coauthor names, and citations. We ranked journals based on quality. Top Tier

journals are the American Economic Review, the Journal of Political Economy, the Quarterly

Journal of Economics, Econometrica, and the Review of Economic Studies. Top Field journals

are in our second category, and Other Refereed publications are all journals indexed in WOS that

 Our sample includes more cohorts of data compared to Ginther et al (2020) that restricted the sample to people
who had sufficient time for promotion to tenure.

are not categorized as Top Tier or Top Field. Since we are interested in the mechanisms

associated with the CeMENT workshop we focus on pre-tenure publications as in Ginther et al.

(2020). We identified 3,161 pre-tenure publications of which 136 were Top Tier, 1,023 were Top

Field and 2,002 were Other Refereed.

       We identified the number of unique coauthors by publication years and used that data to

identify the number of coauthors prior to receiving the mentoring treatment and the number of

additional coauthors after treatment but pre-tenure. In addition, we identified only 20

publications that resulted from the CeMENT workshop. Two women collaborated on multiple

publications with women in their same cohort (8 publications); 10 women collaborated on one

publication with another member of their cohort (5 publications); 3 women collaborated with a

CeMENT mentor (3 publications); and 2 women collaborated on 2 publications each with a

CeMENT mentor (4 publications).

       Table 1 lists the cohort year and number of treatment and control groups. Appendix 1

provides more details about our data collection methods. As mentioned earlier, 83 out of the 512

women in our sample reapplied for the workshop and 60 of those women eventually received the

mentoring treatment. We follow Ginther et al. (2020) in using an intent-to-treat framework

where the initial assignment to the treatment or control group is used as an instrument for

whether a person was eventually treated.

       Table 2 compares the characteristics of the sample prior to the CeMENT workshop.

There are few significant differences between the treatment and control groups. Between 86 and

90% of the applicants had an academic first job. Over half of the sample (53­56%) obtained their

PhD at Top 10 or 20 ranked institutions. Women in the treatment and control groups had on

average 1.3 to 1.6 pretreatment coauthors. We found two significant differences in pre-CEMENT


                                                 5
characteristics. First, the treated group received their doctorates on average one year earlier than

the control group. Second, the control group includes more women whose first job was at an

unranked (201+) academic institution. These differences are likely the result of changes in

CeMENT policies after 2014 that gave women who previously applied to the workshop the

opportunity to participate in subsequent workshops. In all estimates we control for years since

PhD, the initial CeMENT cohort, and pre-treatment coauthors in order to adjust for the CeMENT

applicant's initial collaboration network. In addition, we split the sample by first job at a top 200

ranked institution (Ranked) and 201+ ranked as well as nonacademic institutions (Unranked).

IV.    Results

       Table 3, Panel A reports our main results on the effect of the CeMENT treatment on pre-

tenure publications, coauthors and total citations as of 2018 using the full sample. All models use

initial treatment assignment as an instrument for the probability of ever receiving treatment.

Women who participated in the CeMENT workshop published 1.6 more papers (representing a

26% increase at the mean), 0.21 additional Top Tier papers (representing a 78% increase), and

0.96 additional Other Refereed papers (representing a 16% increase), all statistically significant

at p<0.05. As found in the previous literature, there is a significant relationship between the

number of coauthors and publications. Each additional pretreatment coauthor contributed 0.79 in

additional publications. However, the number of coauthors have no impact on Top Tier

publications.

       In addition, the CeMENT workshop significantly expanded a woman's pre-tenure

collaborations, adding 3 additional coauthors relative to the treatment group (a 51% increase).

However, these additional collaborations were not directly the result of collaborations formed at

the CeMENT workshop. After adjusting for CeMENT papers, the treated group still had an



                                                  6
average of 3 more coauthors than the control group. Finally, the treatment group had 43 more

citations to pre-tenure publications than the control group (a 45% increase).

        Panel B of Table 3 reports the same results for the subsample of women whose first job

was at a top 200 ranked academic institution. We see similar results for total publications (1.3

more), but no significant difference from the control group for other publication measures.

However, women whose first job was at a ranked institution who received the mentoring

treatment have 3.4 additional coauthors (a 52% increase over the mean). Citations are not

significantly different between the treatment and control groups. Panel C repeats the analysis for

women whose first job was at an unranked academic or a nonacademic institution. The women in

the treatment group have more total publications than those at ranked institutions 1.6 compared

to 1.3. Most of this increase is made up of Other Refereed publications. Women in the treatment

group have 1.3 more Other Refereed publications than the control group, an increase of 33% at

the mean. Also, women in the treatment group have an additional 61 citations, representing an

84% increase. However, treated women whose first job was at unranked or nonacademic

institutions who received the mentoring treatment have one fewer coauthor (2.3 compared to 3.4)

than women at ranked institutions. In fact, the average number of coauthors in the two groups

differs by 1.7.

        The final panel of Table 3 re-estimates the models for the full sample including controls

for coauthors added after the CeMENT workshop as well as pre-treatment coauthors. After

controlling for all pre-tenure coauthors, women who received the mentoring treatment had an

additional 0.57 publication (a 9% increase). Although much of the publication effect for treated

women is explained by controlling for coauthors, the mentoring treatment still has a marginally

significant (p<0.10) effect. We also find that coauthors explain none of the highly significant




                                                 7
effect of the mentoring treatment on Top Tier publications. Finally, we find that mentoring

treatment contributes to 31 additional citations (p<0.07) after controlling for all pre-tenure

collaborators, a 32% increase.

       In Appendix 2, Table A1, we limited the sample to those who were in the analysis sample

in Ginther et al. (2020) and present the estimates in Table 3 for that sample. The results are very

similar to those in Table 3, although the magnitude of the estimates is somewhat larger. In

particular, the treated women add 3.5 more coauthors compared to the control group. In the

bottom panel women in the treatment group have an additional .8 publication (an 11% increase)

after controlling for all pre-tenure coauthors.



V.     Conclusions

       Researchers have found that women publish fewer papers than men, have more difficulty

publishing their work, and are given less credit for coauthored work. The CeMENT randomized

controlled mentoring trial has shown that mentoring increases the number and quality of

publications (Blau et al. 2010, Ginther et al. 2020). This paper examines whether the increase in

publications is the result of expanded coauthoring networks.

       We found that the mentoring treatment increases publications, Top Tier publications,

Other Refereed publications, and total citations. In addition, the treatment increased the number

of pretreatment coauthors by three relative to the control group. We were expecting that this

increase in networks would be the result of new collaborations formed at the CeMENT workshop

but found that was not the case. Networks also grew larger at ranked academic institutions

relative to unranked institutions.




                                                  8
       Once we control for the number of pre-tenure coauthors, the estimated impact of the

mentoring treatment on publications is significantly reduced, but not eliminated. Taken together,

these results suggest that the CeMENT workshop provided information and advice that

contributed to the expansion of collaboration networks and the career success of treated women.

Although women at unranked academic and nonacademic institutions had smaller increases in

their number of coauthors, the mentoring treatment increased their publications and citations as

well. Thus, it remains a troubling puzzle that these women were less successful in achieving

tenure than women at the top-ranked institutions (Ginther et al. 2020). Unfortunately, Ginther

and Kahn (forthcoming) found evidence that women at less research-intensive universities were

less likely to be promoted than men after controlling for publications and citations, suggesting

that unobservable factors including bias may be playing a role.

            The collection of publication data was time consuming. We started by collecting

information on publications and CVs for individuals in our sample. Based on this information,

we created a list of search queries for everyone in the CeMENT data. Each search query includes

names, publication year intervals and affiliations. For names, we use both full names and name

initials, because publications indexed in WOS prior to 2008 included only last names and initials

for first and middle name. We limit the publication year intervals to be from 5 years prior to PhD

year to 2018. The affiliations are the job institutions or affiliations of each person. Such

information could be found on the job information collected in in the CVs. Institution names

must be changed according to the Web of Science organization enhanced index.

            For example, supposed that we have a person in the data named Katherine R. McDonald,

who graduated in the 2008 from University of Kansas, and she worked in the University of

Chicago from 2009 to 2013 and switched to Federal Reserve Bank of Boston after 2013. 3 Then

the search query for her would be:

            (AU = "McDonald, Katherine" or AU = McDonald, KR or AU = "McDonald, K") and

            (PY = (2003-2018)) and (OG = "University of Kansas" or OG = "University of Chicago"

            or OG = "Federal Reserve Bank ­ Boston")

            The search with the name "McDonald, KR" would results in all the records with the full

name "McDonald, Katherine R." For people without a middle name (or middle name is not

found), the search using last name and first name initials would result in records with same last

name but not same first name. For example, paper published by McDonald, Kathy or McDonald,

Kevin are likely to be found. Economics papers published before 2006 and health economics

papers published in health journals are more likely to be published using name initials. We

automated this search process by creating Python code to scrape search results from WOS.

        After searching and downloading the result files from WOS for each person, we put the

data together and hand-validated publications using information from the CVs. We use author's

full names, field, institutions and journals to find the false records.

        There are several potential limitations to our data. First, the data collection is based on

online searches. We were not able to find all the information for everyone in the data, making it

less consistent. Second, because of the query limitations in WOS, we cannot simply use the

WOS search results only. The search queries vary by each person. Some searches returned zero

records and required updating. The screening process may have introduced coding errors. Most

of the CV searches were done in 2017, however publications were found in WOS through the

third quarter of 2018.
