                   Household Saving: An Econometric Investigation


                                      ABSTRACT



       Household or personal saving is recomputed to include net purchases of

consumer durables, net contributions to government life insurance and pension

reserves, and an adjustment for the inflation premium component in interest

income. These adjustments raise the measured household saving rate by nearly 5

percentage points in the 1965—75 period but result in an extremely sharp 7

percentage point decline in the rate between 1975 and the early 1980s.

       A model of household saving behavior is then presented and estimated

using annual data from the 1952—82 period. While saving responds to numerous

influences, major swings in the adjusted saving rate —— a significant decline

in the 1950s and rebound in the early 1960s, as well as the decline since 1975

——   are   largely explained by two variables: the wealth/income ratio and the

growth rate of real income.

          CHAPTER 4: HOUSEHOLD SAVING: AN ECONOMETRIC INVESTIGATION



      INTRODUCTION

By official government accounts, the U.S. saves a substantially smaller

fraction of income than do other industrialized countries. Reasons for the

small fraction and the implications of it for America's future well—being are

widely discussed (Feldstein 1977; Boskin 1983) .   Contributing   to the low

national rate is a low, and apparently declining (Auerbach 1985), personal or

household saving rate. The measurement and determinants of household saving

are the subject of this chapter.

      Major problems in measuring saving rates (Auerbach 1981; Blades and

Sturm 1982) raise questions as to just how low the U.S. household saving rate

is and how much it has declined recently. We consider the sources of

measurement error in the following section and compute an adjusted household

saving series that includes net purchases of consumer durables, net

contributions to government life insurance and pension reserves, and an

adjustment for the inflation premium component in interest income. These

adjustments raise the measured household saving rate by nearly S percentage

points in the 1965—75 period but result in an extremely sharp 7 percentage

point decline in the rate between 1975 and the early 1980s.

      We then present a model of household saving behavior and estimate it

using annual data from the 1952—82 period. While saving responds to numerous

influences, major swings in the saving rate —— a significant decline in the

l9SOs and rebound in the early l960s, as well as the decline since 1975 ——      are

largely explained by two variables: the wealth/income ratio and the growth

rate of real income. A detailed interpretation of the empirical estimates is

provided in the text and summarized in the concluding section.



      THE MEASUREMENT OF PERSONAL SAVING

Personal saving is calculated in the National Income and Product Accounts

(NIPA) as:




             SNIA = YPERS — CEXP — TXPERS — INTPD,
                                                                    (1)




where SNIA, YPERS, CEXP, TXPERS, and INTPD represent personal saving, income,

consumption expenditures, tax payments, and interest paid to business,1

respectively. Thus, measurement errors in any of the terms netted from

personal income, as well in personal income itself, will be embedded in SNIA

dollar for dollar.2 Below we discuss important measurement errors in each of

these terms and describe the adjustments we make to correct the errors.



      Consumption (CEXP) and Tax (TXPERS) Adjustments

Theoretical models of consumption and saving behavior (for example, the Life

Cycle Hypothesis, the Permanent Income Hypothesis, and their derivatives) are

stated in terms of the consumption of service flows. These flows, rather than

consumption expenditures, are an argument in the utility function. To be

consistent with this theory, the component of consumer expenditures repre-

senting net investment in consumer durable goods should properly be considered
                                                                             4—3




personal saving. The NIPA measure of personal saving, however, is constructed

on an expenditures rather than a service flow basis. Consequently, we adjust

SIA by the difference between the value of expenditures and the value of the

consumption of services (CON) to arrive at the theoretically appropriate

                                                            -
personal saving measure (SAV) :



            SAV = SNIA + SDUR = SNIA +   (CEXP — CON)   ,             (2)



w!iei-e SDUR is net investment in consumer durable goods. SOUR has risen,

erratically, from 15 billion 1972 dollars in the early 1950s to 35 billion in

the middle 1970s. Consumer durable goods are distinguished from nondurables

and services because they need not be consumed in the same period that they

are purchased. To the extent that net new purchases of consumer durable goods

are carried over to the next period, current net purchases will be a poor

measure of actual consumption in the period.

      There are two measurement problems associated with tax liabilities. The

first concerns the treatment of government life insurance and employees

retirement fund activities. In the NIPA, these transactions are treated as

social insurance contributions (taxes) and payments (transfers) -   The flow of

funds treatment of the net contributions as household claims analogous to

private life insurance and pension reserves is more appropriate. Thus the net

oontributions, denoted by SGPEN, must be added to household saving (and

subtracted from government saving).3 This variable rose from 3 billion 1972

dollars in the early l9SOs to 20 billion in the early 1980s.
                                                                              4—4



      The second problem associated with the NIPA measurement of personal

taxes occurs because personal income taxes are measured on a cash payment

rather than a liability accrual basis. If individuals plan consumption and

saving over a long period of time, the relevant incOme tax variable will be

the one that represents their actual tax liabilities (see Peek 1982, 1983).

The tax adjustment (STAX) is constructed as:



            STAX   TXPERS — TXLIAE,                                 (3)




where TXLIAB is tax accruals taken from annual issues of Statistics of Income,

Individual Income Tax Returns (501)   Most of the difference between tax

payments and accruals (which has fluctuated between —2 and +10 billion 1972

dollars) arises because the net refund for tax year t is included in the

liabilities of year t and in the cash payments of year t+1. The major

fluctuations in the net refunds series are largely due to differences in the

timing and magnitude of the changes in income tax rates and the corresponding

withholding schedules.



      Expected Inflation and Personal Income (YPERS)

The final proposed personal saving adjustment is due to distortions in the

measurement of interest income (and payments) and capital losses (and gains)

during inflationary periods. The expectation of net capital losses on fixed.-

dollar financial assets leads to the incorporation of an inflation premium in

nominal interest rates to compensate investors for the losses. Part of the
                                                                              4—5



household stock of fixed—dollar assets is being converted into a flow (the

inflation premium component) that is recorded inappropriately as income

received and capital losses incurred. Because saving is computed as income

less consumption and taxes, an extended period of anticipated inflation would

result in a substantial overstatement of the personal saving rate.

      Three categories of interest payments are incorporated in personal

income: (1) monetary interest paid to persons, (2) imputed interest paid to

persons by depository institutions, and (3) imputed interest paid to persons

by life insurance companies and private noninsured pension funds.     The second
category is also imputed to consumption expenditures.     Consequently, if it is

rnismeasured, the error [being added to and subtracted from the right hand side

of (1)] is not included in measured personal saving. However, an overstate—

merit of the other two categories will lead to a dollar for dollar overstate-

ment of SNIA. Similarly, an overstatement of interest paid by consumers to

business (IWTPD) will result in a dollar for dollar understatement of SNIA.

      Jump (1980) proposed that an inflation premium equal to the product of

the anticipated inflation rate and the stock of net household fixed—income

assets be subtracted from the official saving measure.4    Because this premium

implies immediate, complete adjustment of interest income to the current

anticipated inflation rate, it would substantially overstate, and be more

volatile than, the inflation premium component of NIPA interest income

included in personal saving during a period of rising inflation for three

reasons. First, binding interest rate ceilings on at least some demand and

savings accounts existed in the U.S. for the 1965—79 period. Once these
                                                                               4—6




nominal interest rate ceilings were reached, the monetary interest payments on

such assets could incorporate an additional inflation premium only as rapidly

as ceiling interest rates were raised. Second, while additional interest from

financial institutions is imputed to individuals when interest rates

(inflation) rise, imputed interest generally. responds slug'jishly to interest

rate changes. Third, a significant part of fixed—valued household assets and

liabilities are long—term. For these instruments, coupon receipts/payments

adjust to an increase in inflation expectations only over time as new bonds

are issued to replace maturing bonds. (Yields adjust immediately via a

decline in the market price of the instruments.) This analysis suggests that

there will be a lagged adjustment of the inflation component of NIPA interest

income and expenses to an increase in the anticipated inflation rate.   (The

adjustment to a decrease in inflation will occur more rapidly to the extent

that high coupons are replaced by lower coupons as long—term debt is

refinanced at the lower market rate.) A final problem with Jumps adjustment is

that it ignores the tax liabilities incurred on monetary interest income: only

the net—of—tax inflation premium component can be used to maintain the real

value of net financial assets.

      We have constructed inflation adjustments for both personal saving and

personal income that are based on the actual NIPA interest income measure.

The inflation component incorporated in personal saving is calculated as:
                                                                                    4—7



                 SPREM = (1 - TXINT) (RINTSAv — RINTSAV5O)ASAVJ           (4)




where ASAV represents the stock of net household fixed—income assets at the

beginning of the period,5 RINTSAV represents the ratio of the relevant

personal interest income to ASAV, RINTSAVSO is the 1950 value of RINTSAV, and

TXINT is the assumed tax rate on interest income.6 This procedure allocates

any increase in interest income (adjusted for the growth in net financial

assets) to our inflation component measure. It is likely that the inflation

component in 1950, if      any,   was extremely small. To the extent that it was

nonzero, our measure differs from the true component by a small constant but

still accurately reflects its movements. We have implicitly assumed that the

real interest rate built into interest income was constant during the 1950—82

period.7 The inflation—component adjustment to saving reaches 59        billion    real.

1972 dollars by 1981.

         The   calculation of the inflation premium embedded in NIPA. disposable
income is similarly calculated:


                YPREM =   (1 — TXINT) (RINTYD — RINTYDSO)AYD1             (5)




where RINTYD is now the ratio of the sum of the two interest income categories

used to calculate SPREM and the imputed interest paid to persons by financial

institutions to AYD. RINTYD5O is its 1950 value, and AYD is all fixed—income

assets.    AYD differs    from ASAV in that we do not subtract nonmortgage fixed—
income    liabilities of individuals    because the inflation component in INTPD   is
relevant   only to the calculation of SPREM. TXINT may slightly overstate the

tax liabilities on intere.t income because it includes nontaxable imputed

interest paid to persons by depository institutions, life insurance companies
                                                                                  4—8



and private noninsured pension funds, as well as monetary interest payments to

persons. However, the imputed component is small relative to the total and

probably accounts for a less than proportionate share of the inflation

premium. t4oreover, TXIF4T does not reflect state and local taxes. The

adjusted personal saving rate can then be calculated asv




                        RSAVADJTX = SNIA—SPREN                         (6)




      Table 4—1 contains four personal saving rates. RSAVNIA is conventional

NIPA personal saving, RSAVADJ is our adjusted saving rate with TXINT         0,

                            ——Place Table 4—1 Near Here——

RSAVADJTX includes the tax adjustment, and RSAVJUMP represents the personal

saving rate using Jump's method.8 Our tax—adjusted personal saving rate is

relatively stable through 1975. It does not rise in the late 1960s and early

1970s as does the official rate. While it does decline substantially after

1975, it remains positive. In sharp contrast, Jump's measure begins to

decline after 1967, becomes negative after 1975, and is sharply negative in

the early 1980s. The decline from 1967 to 1980 is 13 percentage points, 8

more than the decline in our series. About one—third of the excess decline

can be attributed to the overstatement of the inflation preinia and two—thirds

to the ignoring of taxes.



      Adjusted Personal Saving Rates

We can now calculate our adjusted personal saving series. This series

incorporates the four adjustments to NIPA personal saving described above: (1)

net investment in consumer durable goods, (2) the treatment of contributions

 conversion of household taxes to an accrual basis, and (4) the inflation

 component incorporated in interest income. The first three adjustments are

 added to NIPA saving, while the inflation component is subtracted. The

 adjusted personal saving measure is thus:

 variables as a percent of disposable labor income.    Disposable labor income is
 used rather than total disposable income because the former avoids the serious

                         ——Place Table 4—3 Near Here——

measurement problems associated with
                                     property income during inflationary
periods.
      The saving rate including all adjustments was in the 13 to 16 percent

range in the early to middle l950s before sliding into the 10 to 12 percent

range in the 1958—63 span. For the years 1965 to 1975, the rate again assumed

the high values of the middle l9SOs. From there, the rate fell to the 11 to

13 percent range in the second half of the 1970s and then down to the 7 to 8½

percent level in the early 1980s.



      THE MODEL9

The model is developed in three parts. We begin with planned wealth

accumulation, then consider actual accumulation and its implication for the

saving relation, and finally consider the likely impact of different capital

gains components.

      Planned Wealth Accumulation

Planned wealth accumulation is assumed to arise from the desires of indivi-

duals to smooth their pattern of consumption over their lifetime and to leave

bequests. Because human capital cannot be carried over into retirement years,

some of it must be transformed into nonhuman wealth to allow consumption after

retirement or to permit bequests. In addition, a precautionary motive arising

from the existence of unforeseen fluctuations in income (and perhaps needs)

would lead to the holding of a nonzero stock of nonhuman wealth by individuals

even if anticipated future consumption and income were equal.

      Given an intertemporal utility function with current and future levels

of consumption (as well as any final bequest) as arguments, an individual

determines a desired consumption path by maximizing utility subject to his

perceived lifetime resources. Given an expected labor income path, the

interest rate, and the length of the retirement span, this desired consumption

path implies an associated wealth accumulation path. At any given time, the

end—of—period wealth required would be the level that would just allow the

individual to meet his future planned consumptipn path, asswning his expecta-

tions of the future are realized. Consistency requires that each period's

desired wealth level must be attainable if expectation, about the other

variables are realized. Thus, the planned change in wealth in any; period is

simply the difference between the level of desired end—of—period household

nonhuman wealth consistent with the desired consumption path, Wd, and actual

household nonhuman wealth at the end of period t—l (beginning of period t),

W1. The simultaneous determination of the desired wealth and consumption

paths requires this complete adjustment of actual to desired wealth within the

period because failure to attain the desired wealth stock by the end of the

period means that the future planned consumption path cannot be realized.

         Desired wealth is assumed to depend on total resources [proxied by

 expected disposable labor income (YDL) , expected transfer payments (YTR)

 beginning—of—period nonhuman wealth (Wp, and expected capital gains

 the gap between potential and actual real GNP (GAP) ,      the   real after—tax
 interest rate (RRATt) ,     and the share of the population that is over age 65

 (AGE), where the last two variables are scaled by YDL to allow their real

 dollar impacts to grow with the level of real economic activity.

The resources coefficients w1 through w4 should be positive. 10          We would

expect w5, the coefficient on GAP, also to be positive because a cyclical

increase in expected labor income would represent a smaller rise in perceived

                                      than/an increase representing an upward shift
in the time path of expected labor income. Thus, w1 would represent the

effect on desired wealth of such a rioncyclical rise in YDLe (that is,

unaccompanied by a decline in GAP). Owing to offsetting income and substitu-

tion effects, w6 could have either sign. The age composition variable is

intended to reflect any changes over time in the proportionof individuals in

the retirement (dissaving) stage of their lifetimes; thus             should be

negative.



        DERIVATION OF THE SAVING RELATION

Actual wealth accumulation,            is the sum of planned,     —
                                                                      W1,   and

unplanned, AW, accumulation:
                                                                                     4—12



                   —          +
         wt                       Aw.                                         (9)


The latter is assumed to be related to the unexpected components of disposable

labor income (YDL) ,     transfer     income (YTR') , and capital gains (G)



         AW' =           +              +
                 b1YDL       b2YTR'         b3GU.                             (10)


The fractions of the unexpected components that are saved,
                                                                   b1, b2 and b3, are
assumed to be near unity. Virtually all of any unexpected increments to

purchasing power would be added to wealth during the period in which they

occur because individuals are unable to incorporate these unknown increments

into their current expenditure plans. However, the longer the length of the

time period taken as the unit of analysis, the more opportunity there is to

adjust expenditure behavior within the current period and, therefore, the

smaller would be the bs.

      As emphasized in the previous chapter, there are two ways in which

household nonhuman wealth can change: (1) net purchases of assets by

individuals (personal saving) and (2) the net change in the real value of

household assets previously held (capital gains). We can state this identity
as:
                                                                                          4—13



                       +
                           G.                                                      (11)



 With respect to current wealth, the source of its value is uniMportant.

 Accrued capital gains embedded in an asset (less any accrued income tax

 liability)11 are indistinguishable
                                                from an equal amoànt of personal saving
 that has been invested in a similar
                                                 asset. Recognizing that accrued capital
 gains in (11) are composed of expected and
                                                        unexpected components,

 we can substitute (10) into (9), the result and
                                                             (12) into (11), and solve for

The final term (—G) represents
                                          a displacement, or deflection, effeàt of

expected capital gains on personal saving!2 The extent to which the

displacement effect of expected capital gains on planned saving will be less

than one—for—one depends on the magnitude of the response of total planned

wealth accumulation to expected capital
                                                    gains (w4 in equation (8)J.



      Disaggrtion of Capital Gains

The detailed discussion on capital gains in the
                                                           previous chapter suggests that
there are theoretical reasons to disaggregate
                                                         total capital gains by asset
groups. We can write total real capital gains as:
                                                                                           4—14



               =             +            + CSTK   +            +
                   A1GHLN        A2GDUR                GNFAPt       A3GNFAB,        (13)




 where GHLN represents real capital gains on owner—occupied housing, land and

 noncorporate equity; GDUR represents real capital gains on consumer durable

 goods; and GSTK represents real capital gains on corporate equities. Real

 capital gains on net financial assets have been separated into two components:

ONFAP (real capital gains on net financial assets due to changes in the
                        '3
general price level) and GNFAB (real capital gains on net financial assets due

to nominal bond price changes) .          As discussed in the previous chapter, we

would expect the A's to be between zero and unity, with A1 larger than A2

because housing and land are longer—lived than consumer durable goods. We

would expect A3 to be closer to zero the longer the intended holding period of

bond owners. A strict Hicks' prospective_income view would imply a value of

zero for A3.

      Each of the gains components in (13) can be partitioned into expected

and unexpected components, where the expected component affects desired wealth

accumulation through the w4 coefficient in (8) and the unexpected component

influences the unexpected change in wealth through                   in (10). However, the
values of w4 and b3 could vary across asset categories. The effect of an

expected capital gain on desired wealth would depend on its informational

content, that is, the magnitude of its effect on the perceived value of total

resources. This is related to how certain one is of the
                                                                        expected gain
actually occurring and the extent to which current gains provide information

about future gains. A capital gain expected to recur in the future would

represent a larger increase in perceived total resources (and hence a higher

level of current and future consumption) than a one time gain. Thus, a

nonrecurring gain woul.d raise current consumption less and end—of—period
                                                                                                   4—15



desired wealth level more. If we let w41 through w45 represent the w4s for

GHLNe, GDURe, GSTKe, GNFAPe and GNFABe, in that order, then we might expect

    and w45 to be largest because stock and bond prices are more volatile than

goods prices. For example, the standard deviations of GSThe and GNFABe are

five and a half and four and a half times as large as their respective means.

At the same time, the standard deviations of GOURe and GNFAPe are roughly half

            of their respective means. The standard deviation of GHLHe
          _____
and ehnsn-r

is just under one and a half times its mean. Based on relative volatility, we

would expect to find
                          w43>w45>w41>w44>w42.
      The b3's, on the other hand, will tend to be smaller the quicker that

individuals learn of unexpected gains and losses and can incorporate such

information into their behavioral decisions. Because people trade houses,

land and durables less often than stocks and bonds (for which we have daily

price quotes), we would expect b31 and b32 to exceed b33 and b35. Morover,

while much attention is given to trades of comparable houses by others because

houses constitute so much of one's wealth, little attention is apparently

accorded durable trades. Because changes in general price indices are

published with relatively short lags, b311 should lie betwein the two extremes.

      Combining (8), (11'), and (13) —after restating the latter in terms of

expected and unexpected components —— we obtain:

 We would expect to find A3<O and l>A7%A8>A1>A. While we expect A7, A8, and

 A1 to be positive, as discussed earlier, A2 could take on a small negative

 value. Similarly, we would expect A4 to be positive, A5 to be negative, and

 are uncertain about the sign of A5 a priori. Given the preceding analysis, we

would expect all ten capital gains coefficients to be negative.

         An important characteristic of the expected capital gains coefficients

 is that the larger the effect of an increase in expected capital gains on

desired wealth, the smaller the expected capital gains coefficient in the

saving equation. This is related to the deflection effect discussed earlier.

The more the expected capital gain raises desired wealth, and thus planned

wealth accuxnuation, the less it deflects (or reduces) saving.                  Consequently,
a large behavioral effect on desired wealth would be associated with a

relatively small effect on personal saving. However1 the interpretation of

the expected capital gains coefficients is complicated by the presence of the

A' in A9, A10, and A13. A value of A less than unity, indicating that the

capital gains are only partially viewed as additions to wealth, would further

reduce (in absolute value) the expected capital gains coefficients. In fact,

the less the capital gains are viewed as additions to wealth, the nearer to

zero are the values of A9, A10, and A13. Thus, relatively large effects on
                                                                                4—17



desired wealth or relatively small effects on the perceived actual change in

wealth will both result in values of A9, A10 and A13 very near zero. Of the

unexpected capital gains coefficients, we would expect to find A14 and A15

very near zero, and A16, A17, and A18 having valuesbetween zero and A11, A12,

and A13, respectively.



      EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS

This section is divided into four parts. After discussing the data, we

present estimates of the basic model and of an extended model. An interpre-

tation of the preferred estimated relationship concludes the section.



      Data Specification

Estimation of the saving equation requires proxies for each of the relevant

variables. The saving, income, wealth, and capital gains variables are all

per capita constant 1972 dollar magnitudes. The dependent variable, SAy, is

the sum of the NIPA personal saving measure (SNIA) and net investment in

consumer durable goods (SDUR) .   This   is consistent with the theoretically

appropriate measurement of consumption as service flows rather than as

expenditures. The measurement error terms (SGPEN, STAX, and SPREM) have been

described above. They, too, are divided by population. Population and the

share aged 65 or older (AGE) are from the Economic Report of the President.

      The beginning—of—period value of household wealth (W) is taken from the

Balance Sheet Accounts. Thus it does not include the real value of unfunded

pension wealth, a series that rose markedly during the 1950—80 period. Our

measure of the GNP gap (GAP) ,   potential   less actual GNP, relies on the

potential GNP series calculated by the President's Council of Economic

Advisors and the NIPA GNP measure. It is lagged one period to avoid
                                                                            4—18



simultaneity problems. The real after—tax interest rate (RRAT) is calculated

as the after—tax yield on one—year Treasury bills less the Livingston survey

measure of the one—year expected inflation rate. The Treasury bill yield is

the average for the preceding December. The effective marginal tax rate is

the TXINT series.

      The income measures are based on NIPA data. To calculate disposable

labor income, total personal tax liabilities must be allocated between labor

and property income. Personal labor income is the sum of the NIPA measures of

wages and salaries, other labor income, and a proportion of proprietor's

income. Using SOl data on federal income tax liabilities and wage income and

extending a series on federal income tax liabilities on wages and salaries

provided by Charles Steindel, we were able to allocate Sot federal and NIPA

state and local income tax liabilities between labor and property income.

Personal social security contributions were included in labor's share of tax

liabilities.

      The calculation of the capital gains proxies from balance sheet account

data and the decomposition of the capital gains series into their expected and

unexpected elements were described in the previous chapter. Disposable labor

income and transfer payments are divided into their expected and unexpected

components by a similar regression procedureJ4

      The mean, high, and low values for the variables and their scale are

listed in Table 4—4. The saving, income, capital gains, wealth and gap

                          ——Place Table 4—4 Near Here——

variables   are all 1972 dollars per capita. Both AGE and REAP are measured in
decimals (in the equations they are measured as deviations from their means)

        Estimates for the Basic Model

Table 4—5 presents estimates of variants of equation (14) .     Although   the

specification differs somewhat, the estimates presented in column 1 are

                           ——Place   Table 4-5 Near Here——
consistent   with the general findings of Peek (1983). As predicted by our

measurement error discussion, the tax liabilities adjustment (STAX) has an

estimated coefficient that does not differ significantly from minus one (t—

statistic = 0.69)     The relative magnitudes of the income coefficients are as
predicted. The YTRE coefficient does not exceed its estimated standard error.
The unreasonably large estimated effect of YTRU may be related to several
retroactive increases in social security     benefit levels (see Modigliani and

Steindel   (1977)]. Because NIPA saving is measured as a residual, any
retroactive   and unexpected increase in disposable income is automatically

forced into measured saving leading to an overstatement of the marginal

response of saving to unexpected transfer payments. The coefficients on

wealth and population over 65 have the predicted negative sign. The GNP—gap

coefficient has the incorrect sign, but does not differ significantly from

zero. The interest—rate coefficient is negative and statistically insignifi-

cant.

        Initially all ten capital gains proxies were included in the saving

equation. To reduce the number of explanatory variables to a more manageable

size, the capital gains proxies with estimated coefficients having t—

statistics below unity were eliminated from the equation. Because there were

a number of strong simple correlations between pairs of capital gains

variables making it very difficult to pinpoint individual effects, the proxies

were eliminated sequentially. First, GHLNU and GDURU (with t—statistics of

—0. l7and —0. 49,   respectively)   were eliminated. Their near zero effects are

consistent with our expectations. Next, GNFABE (with a t—statistic of 1.45)

and then GNF'APE (with a t—statistic of 2.07) were eliminated. Although we

were using a rule that estimated coefficients should exceed their estimated

standard errors for retention of the capital gains variables in the equations,

we eliminated GNFAPE and GNFABE because they had the wrongsign and always had

t—statistics below unity (with the appropriate negative signs) in later

specifications, Similarly, we retained ONFAPO and GNFABU for comparison

purposes because they meet the criterion in our later key equations. Of the

six remaining capital gains coefficients, two (GDUBE and GSTJCU) differ

significantly from zero. Contrary to our predictions, however, unexpected

capital gains on corporate equities have a larger (although not significantly

so) effect on saving than do their expected counterpart. Furthermore, the

coefficient on unexpected gains on net financial assets due to changes in the

general price level has the wrong sign but is much less than its estimated

standard error.

      The rather high correlations between pairs of explanatory variables make

it very difficult to pinpoint the individual effects of the explanatory

variables on personal saving. For example, the pairwise correlations between

W, YDLE, YTRE, and AGE range (in absolute value) between 0.89 and 0.98.

Furthermore, the pairwise correlations of BRAT and GDUBE with these variables

range from 0.61. to 0.79. First—differencing the data substantially reduces

the collinearity between pairs of explanatory variables, thereby making it

easier to disentangle the separate influences of each explanatory variablej5

Column 2 presents the results of reestimating the basic saving equation using

changes rather than levels of the data. While many of the estimated

coefficients are little changed from their column 1 values, there are a number

of notable exceptions.
                                                                               4—21



      The point estimate of the income—tax—liabilities_adjustment coefficient

(—0.989) is now much nearer minus unity (t—statistic =      0.02)   The effects of

beginning—of—period wealth, expected disposable labor income, and unexpected

disposable labor income have all increased. The estimated wealth effect is

now slightly closer to the —0.03 to —0.M5 value typically obtained. On the

other hand, the 0.57 IDLE coefficient is somewhat larger than the 0.3 to 0.5

expected coefficient on disposable income cited in the literature.16 However,

because disposable labor income is only about 75 percent of total disposable

income, an estimated coefficient in the range of 0.4 to 0.67 would be

consistent with a disposable income coefficient in the range of 0.3 to 0.5.

In fact, Juster and Taylor (1975) ,   using   a disposable labor income measure,

found effects consistent with an estimate in the range of 0.4 to 0.5 in our
                 17
specification.

      The estimated coefficient on expected transfer payments now has a small

(statistically insignificant) negative value, while the estimated effect of

unexpected transfer payments is now below unity as our theory predicts. The

GNP gap coefficient has the predicted positive sign, although it is still

statistically insignificant, and the real after—tax interest rate has a larger

(and still statistically insignificant) negative effect. With respect to the

capital gains coefficients, the GNFAPU coefficient now has the correct sign

(although both GNFAPU and GNFABU still have estimated coefficients exceeded by

their estimated standard errors) .    The estimated effects of expected capital

gains on durables and unexpected gains on both corporate equities and on net          *

financial   assets due to nominal bond price changes have each declined, causing

CDURE and GSTKU to lose their statistical significance. The effect of

expected capital gains on housing, land and noncorporate equity has increased
                                                                               4—22




and now   differs   significantly from zero. Due to the slight increase in the

effect of GSTKE and the sharp decline in the GSTKU effect, the two effects are

now almost identical.

      As noted in the development of our model, the interpretation of the

capital gains coefficients is rather complicated. The magnitude of the

estimated coefficients represents a combination of effects: one related to the

effect of capital gains on desired wealth (the w4's) or on unplanned wealth

accumulation (the b3s) and one related to the extent to which the capital

gains are perceived as additions to wealth (the X's) .       Our earlier analysis

suggested relative sizes for the w 's and b 's as well as the A. 's. Eased
                                 41        31                  1

on the w4.'s alone, we would expect to find GDURE and GNFAPE with the largest

effects and G$TKE and GNFABE with the smallest. To the extent that the A.1 's

are below unity, the effects of GHLNE, GDURE, and GNFAEE would be reduced

somewhat. In fact, we do find a relatively large effect of expected capital

gains on durables due to their relatively small effect on desired wealth, even

after incorporating the A, effect which tends to reduce the extent of

 deflection. However, its estimated standard error is even larger. The much

 smaller estimated effects on saving of the other expected capital gains

 proxies are probably related to their relatively larger effects on desired

 wealth (and hence smaller deflection effects) .    This   is certainly the case

 with GULNE relative to GDURE because our theoretical analysis suggests that A1>

A2. Again, the relatively smaller effect of GSTKE is consistent with our

 theory. The combination of a relatively large value of w45 and a value of

 1 probably accounts for the absence of GNFABE.

          The absence of unexpected gains on housing, land and noncorporate equity

 and on consumer durables is consistent with our prior analysis suggesting

 values of b31 and b32 very near unity. This is reinforced to the extent that
                                                                            4—23



A1 and A2 are below unity. Small negative effects of GSTKU, GNFAPtJ, and

GNFABU would be consistent with the relatively smaller values of b33, b34, and

b35. None of the three unexpected capital gains effects, however, differs

significantly from zero.

      We now turn to a consideration of the remaining two ñeasurement error

terms, SGPEN and SPREM. Column 3 presents the results of reestimating the

column 2 equation with these two additional explanatory variables. We retain

the first—differenced specification because the levels of both these variables

are highly correlated with the other explanatory variables. The standard

error of the equation drops dramatically (over 40 percent) from 22.54 to only

13.16. Most of this decline is due to the introduction of SPREM.18 All three

of the measurement error terms have coefficients that differ significantly

from zero, but not from their predicted values. The t—statistic for the null

hypothesis that the STAX coefficient is minus one is only 0.39. similarly,

the t—statistics for the SGPEW coefficient differing from minus one and for

the SPREM coefficient differing from plus one are 0.13 and 1.34, respectively.

Thus, we can not reject any of the hypothesized restrictions.

      The primary differences between the coefficients on the other variables

are: the wealth and AGE coefficients increase substantially, the RHAT

coefficient becomes positive (but is still less than its standard error), the

GHLNE coefficient drops sharply and loses its significance, and the

coefficients on both GDURE and GSTKE increase and become significant. The

GSTKE effect now exceeds that of GSTKTJ as our theory predicts. The

coefficients on unexpected capital gains on net financial assets due to

nominal bond price changes and due to changes in the general price level both

rise (in absolut.e value) and exceed their estimated standard errors.
                                                                            4—24




        Column 4 imposes the hypothesized plus or minus unity restrictions on

the measurement error terms. That is, the dependent variable is now our

adjusted saving measure, SADJ. The standard error of the equation is reduced

slightly from 13.16 to 12.71. Except for the doubling of the GHLNE effect,

the estimated coefficients on the capital gains proxies are only slightly

altered. The wealth and expedted transfer payments effects also decline

somewhat.    (These reactions to the imposition of the coefficient restrictions

may be related to the strong trend elements contained in SGPEN, SPREM, W, and

?TRE)

        The estimated effects of expected and unexpected capital gains on

corporate equity are very similar to each other in each specification we have

considered. This could be due to problems in separating total corporate

equity capital gains into expected and unexpected components. Consequently,

we also considered an alternative measure of expected gains on corporate.

equity based on the Livingston survey expectations of Standard and Poor's

Industrial Stock Price index. The expected percentage increase (or decrease)

was multiplied by the beginning—of—period value of household corporate equity

holdings to calculate GSTKE. The difference between this measure and the

actual stock market capital gains was taken as the unexpected component.

Because the Livingston data are available only after 1952, the sample period

for this regression is 1954—82. The results are very similar to those

obtained when the specification in column 4 is reestimated over the same

sample period, indicating that our results are robust with respect to quite

different measures of expected stock market capital gains. The SEE of the

equation with the alternative GSTKE measure is 12.19, slightly lower than our

original specification when estimated over the same sample period (12.52)

The Livingston GSTKE and GSTKU estimated coetficients are —0.0401 and —0.0214
                                                                            4—25



with standard errors of 0.0191 and 0.004, respectively. The similarity in

the magnitudes of the effects may be due to individuals reacting similarly to

both the expected and unexpected components because information on actual

stock market capital gains and losses is available on a next day basis. If

that is the case, we lose very little by considering totaistock market

capital gains because the particular decomposition of total stock market

capital gains is irrelevant.



      Further Estimates

The one unappealing aspect of the coefficients in column 4 is the implied

response of saving to changes in the age distribution of the population. The

three percentage point increase in the share of population over age 65,

together with the —4.29 coefficient, yields a decline in the personal saving

ratio in the last 30 years of over 13 percentage points! One might contend

that this response is 5 to 10 times too great. On the other hand, one might

argue that older households were not otdy growing in relative importance but

that each was saving relatively less, possibly owing to a sharp rise in social

security wealth and the certainty of this wealth (due to indexation in

1972) }9 Further, an increased tendency toward early retirement has occurred

concurrently with the aging of the population; between 1954 and 1980, the

labor force participation rate of males between the ages of 55 and 64 declined

from 0.88 to 0.72. This could make a coefficient as large, in absolute

magnitude, as —1.5 plausible. The remaining columns in Table 4—S reflect

attempts to reduce the age coefficient to a more reasonable value without

losing the appealing aspects of column 4.
                                                                                 4—26




      The major additions in column 5 are a constant term in our difference

equation and Slemrod's (1984) minutes—to—midnight or nuclear fear variable

(scaled by expected labor income) .   In   Slemrod's view, increased fear of a

nuclear holocaust (decreased expected life span and ability to leave a

bequest) would likely reduce the propensity to save. The equation also

combines some like variables with similar. impacts (expected and unexpected

labor income, expected and unexpected stock market gains, and unexpected gains

on net financial assets due to changes in the general price level and to

changes in nominal bond prices) and deletes some variables with negligible

impacts (expected transfer income and expected gains on net financial assets

due to changes in the general price level) .    As can be seen, the constant and

fear variable have t—ratios slightly above unity and reduce the age coeffi-

cient by nearly 20 percent. The coefficient on the nuclear fear variable

suggests that a ten minute increase in the clock, the largest observed

variation, would raise the saving rate by almost a full percentage point.20

      Not only is the constant term insignificantly different from zero, but

it is difficult to interpret. One general interpretation is the negative

impact of the growth in social security (and other unfunded pension) wealth on

saving; this would be consistent with the large and significant negative

impact of real nonhuman wealth (t ratios over 4 in columns 4 and 5) .    However,
social security wealth certainty has not been growing in the 1980s. To

account for this, the constant in column 5 was replaced, in turn, by constants

that were truncated (became zero) in 1974, 1977, and 1980. The best fit was

obtained with the latter variable and is reported as column 6 in the table.

As can be seen, this truncated constant is significantly different from zero.

Also, the AGE coefficient exhibits a further decline, although it is still at

least double what we would consider a plausible magnitude.
                                                                                   4—27



      While the truncated constant may reflect something other than the impact

of unfunded pensions, we shall accept this interpretation. Because Feldstein

(1982) is the most visible and vocal advocate of the negative unfunded—

pensions effect, we compare our results with his. He concludes that personal

saving was reduced by $58 billion in 1976, his last year of analysis, when NIA

personal saving was $69 billion (p. 636) .    Moreover, three—quarters of this
reduction was due to the increase in social security wealth since 1951, the

year our analysis begins; that is, the growth in social security wealth

between 1951 and 1976 reduced personal saving in 1976 by $43.5 billion. To

obtain our 1976 impact on the level of personal saving per capita, we multiply

the 10.8 coefficient in our change equation by 25. The result of $270 is then

compared with the 1976 NIA measure of personal saving per capita of $426.

This ratio, 0.63, is the same as that computed by dividing Feldstein's $43.5

by $69. The two estimates, then, are capatible, suggesting both specifica—
                                              21
tions may be capturing the same phenomenon.

      In our final estimates, we arbitrarily halved the age coefficient to

—1.5, its maximum plausible value. The result was a sharp increase in the

coefficient on the truncated constant to —15 (t    ratio   of 4) .   In   order not to

overstate   the unfunded—pensions effect, we then constrained the constant to
—10, roughly   the value in column 6. column 7 contains the estimates of such a
relation.   Note the small decline in the overall explanatory power from column

6 and the general correspondence between the coefficients in column 7 and

those in columns 4, 5 and 6. In addition to the enormous significance of

labor income, coefficients on wealth, stock market gains, and unexpected

transfer income have t—ratios above 5, and those on expected housing et. al.

and durable gains, unexpected net financial asset gains, and temporary
                                                                              4—28




economic slack (the GNP gap) are in the 2 to 3½ range.     The nuclear fear

variable has a t of 1½.    The real after—tax interest rate continues to have if

small,   insignificant positive coefficient.



         Interpretation of the Estimates

In the absence of permanent changes in expected capital gains, unexpected

transfer payments and the GWP gap, these variables have only a temporary

impact on household saving. The largest stock market losses occurred in

1973—74, sandwiched in between relatively large gains in both 1971—72 and

1975—76. As a result, household saving was about 10 percent higher in 1973—74

than in the surrounding years. Large expected gains on housing, land and

noncorporate equity in 1977—78 reduced personal saving by over 5 percent;

systematic large losses on durables raised saving by a like amount in the late

l970s and early l9SOs. More generally, the GAP variable and its coefficient

suggest that household saving is about 10 percent greater in the early stages

of economic recoveries than in the late stages of economic booms. Finally,

unexpected transfers only rarely have affected saving by 5 percent, although a

large jump in government unemployment insurance benefits in 1975 associated

with legislation to extend both the duration and coverage of benefits

increased saving by over 10 percent.

         Determinants of longer—term, major shifts in the saving ratio are

probably of more interest. The adjusted saving rate, as computed in Table 4—

3, is reproduced at roughly 7 year intervals in the top row of Table 4—6. The

ratio fell sharply in the l9SOs, reversed itself in the 1960s, held

constant through the middle 1970s and has   since   plummeted. The second row
contains the major determinant of changes   in the saving ratio, the wealth—

Lncomr' ratio. The q'.'neral inverse relationship between the two rows is

obvious. The remainder of the Table refers to changes between the periods.

The next two rows contain the percentage changes in real income and wealth per

capita.   In three of the four intervals, real wealth grew at a roughly 21

percent rate, the first two being dominated by equity gains and the last by

the land—housing surge; the negligible real gains in the 1968—74 period were

the result of equity losses offsetting land—housing gains (see Chapter 3 for a

fun discussion of these real wealth changes). Real income grew less rapidly

on average and was more volatile, with enormous real growth in the l960s and

minimal growth since the middle l970s. The wealth—income ratio rose in the

first and last intervals owing to large wealth growth and declined in the

middle two intervals, first because of the incredibly large income growth and

then because of the stock market debacle.

      The remainder of the Table indicates the change in the saving ratio

between periods and the source of the change. The dominant role of the

wealth—income ratio in the major declines in the saving ratio in the l?SOs and

late 1970s is obvious; also contributing to these declines, especially the

latter, was the aging of the population. In the intervening two intervals,

these two influences were roughly offsetting. Some of the rise ,in the saving

ratio in the l960s is explained by the relaxation of interpatiônal tensions

following solution of the Cuban missile crisis and passage o the Partial Test

Ban Treaty in the early 1960s, and part of the recent decline n the rate owes

to increased tensions between the U.S. and the Soviets, The sharp rise in the
                                                                                 4—30



saving rate in the 1960s was due to the above—noted enormous growth in real

income; because the marginal propensity to save is greater than the average1

increases in income raise the average savin9 rate.

      While the real—after—tax interest rate has a negligible direct impact on

household saving, this variable appears to have a major indirect effect. As

one might expect, real cumulated gains on housing, land and noncorporate equity

(which are related to land) and the real after—tax interest rate exhibit a

statistically significant negative correlation. An increase in the interest

rate leads to a downward revaluation of the assets and a decrease to an upward

revaluation. These gains (or losses) then feed into the level of household

wealth which has a negative influence on personal saving.

      The real after—tax interest rate (BRAT) declined from 0.0183 in 1970 to

—0.0210 in 1980—81. To obtain an impact of this decline on wealth (and then

on saving) , we estimated a relationship between cumulated real gains on

housing, land and noncorporate equity (TGI{LN) and RBAT over the 1952—82

period, obtaining (standard errors in parentheses):

      TGHLN = 438 — 17489         BRAT       B2 =    .643

                 (38)    (2419)              OW . 0.88
                                             SEE =   204

                                            Mean =   $39   billion.

Multiplying 17489 by 0.0393 (the change in RRAT)qives an induced increase in

TGHLN (and hence wealth at the beginning of the 1981—82 period) of $688

billion or 2992 per capita 1972 dollars. Using the estimated wealth

coefficient of —0.0383 from column 7 of Table          we; obtain a reduction in

saving between 1970 and 1981—82 of' 114.6 per capita 1972 dollars. Thus, in

the absence of the sharp reduction in RRAT (and the associated surge in TGHLN

and wealth) ,   the   average value of our adjusted personal saving measure in
                                                                             4—31



1981—82 would have been 332.8 rather than 218.2 per capita 1972 dollars. The

1981—82 saving rate then would have been 11.27 percent, or 50 percent more

than the observed 7.39 percent value. This calculation overstates the effect

because a lower level of wealth in the earlier years due to the absence of

cumulated gains on housing, land and noncorporate equity wàuld have induced

additional saving. Allowing for this feedback, the 1980—81 saving ratio still

would have been about 10 percent or 2½ percentage points higher than the

observed ratio.



         SUMMARY

The WIPA measurement of personal saving is incorrect in a number of important

respects. These include the treatment of net purchases of consumer durables

as consumption instead of saving, the treatment of net contributions to

government life insurance and retirement funds as taxes instead of saving, and

the measurement of personal taxes on a cash—payment rather than liability—

accrual basis. Finally, because inflation converts part of fixed—income

wealth into an interest income flow (some of the inflation premium in new

issue interest rates is built into recorded after—tax interest income), the

NIPA measure overstates saving in an inflationary period. We have computed an

adjusted saving variable to correct for all of these errors, and we have

obtained empirical support for the validity of our corrections.

         Our adjusted saving rate exhibits some major movements in the 1951—82

period. The rate declines from over 15 percent in the early l9SOs to around

11 percent in the early 1960s and then rebounds to over 14 percent by the

middle 1960s. After approximately a decade of relative stability, the rate

plummets in the second half of the 1970s to under 8 percent in the early

1980s.
                                                                             4—32




      The most important variables explaining longer—run swings in the saving

rate are real wealth and income. Large real gains on equities and on hpusing

and land in the second halves of the l9SOs and l970s, respectively, account

for most of the sharp declines in the saving ratio in these periods- .   While

wealth also grew rapidly during most of the 1960s, again otiing largely to

stock—market-gains, the saving ratio actually increased because of

unparalleled real income growth. This growth raised the saving ratio both

directly, because the marginal propensity. to save out of income exceeds the

average propensity, and indirectly, because the wealth—income ratio is

lowered.

      Acting almost continuously Lo depress the saving—ratio throughout the

1951—80 period was a marked increase in the retired portion of the population

and rapid growth in unfunded pension wealth (both social security and pensions

for government employees) .   The former resulted from both a three percentage

point increase in the share of the population over age 65 (from 8 percent to

11) and a doubling of males below age 65 choosing early retirement. The

precise role of these two factors is uncertain, but together they would have

reduced the saving rate to zero in the absence of real income growth (the

marginal greater than average phenomenon)

      The real after—tax interest rate (which obviously measures the returns

to savers with some imprecision) does not have a direct influence on the

saving ratio. However, an indirect channel of influence exists, namely a

strong significant negative relationship between the market value of housing,

land and noncorporate equity and the real after—tax interest rate. In fact,

the sharp decline in this rate underlies the fall in the saving ratio

attributable to the housing and land boom in the second half of the l970s.

      Short—run movements in the saving ratio are caused by the volatility of

the stock market and of economic activity generally. Apparently owing to

income uncertainty asociated with unemployment, the saving rate is higher in

the early stages of an upswing than in the late stages. Finally, there is

some weak evidence that heightened fear of nuclear war lowers the saving ratio

and relaxation of international tensions raises the ratio.

1. Interest payments on mortgage and home improvement loans are not included

     in interest paid by consumers to business. Because homeowners are

     treated as business operators in the NIPA, these payments are counted as

     interest paid by business to business and are not included in personal

     income -




2.   Net personal transfer payments to foreigners is also subtracted from

     personal income in calculating SNIA. We have ignored this term in our

     theoretical analysis because of its relatively small magnitude and

     because it is not central to our analysis.



3.   For a discussion of the flow of funds treatment, see Board of Governors

     of the Federal Reserve System, (1975) : 31—33.   The data on SGPEN were

     supplied by their flow of funds section.



4. The inflation adjustment was first addressed by Poole (1972) -     His
     measure of the inflation premium in disposable income was constructed as:




                      YPREM =     YINT,



     where Ir, RCB, and lINT represent the anticipated inflation rate, the

     corporate bond rate, and net interest income.

                                                                                4/2

5. Fixed—income assets are measured net of consumer credit, but mortgage

     debt is not subtracted. This is because interest payments on consumer

     credit are subtracted from personal income in constructing personal

     saving while interest payments on mortgages are not (see footnote 1)   -




6.   The TXINT series is constructed from the SOT data supplemented with

     tables provided by Charles Hicks. Following Wright (1969), the tax rate

     is calculated as a weighted average of the marginal personal income tax

     rate for each adjusted gross income class. The weight for each class is

     equal to its share of the total interest received by all income classes.



7.   This is not meant to suggest that we think the real interest rate was

     constant over this period. In fact, there is ample empirical evidence

     that the real rate has varied cyclically (Hendershott and Huang, 1984,

     for example) .   However, that variation has been on the order of only two

     percentage points. Moreover, the variation in the rate built into

     interest income is substantially less given the lags with which this

     income reflects rate movements. In contrast, interest income incorpor-

     ated a major (6 to 8 percentage point) trend increase in expected

     inflation between 1950 and 1981.



8. This series is calculated as (SNIA — ITASAV)/(YD — wAYD), where Jr is the

     one—year expected inflation rate at the end of the previous year from the

     Livingston survey data supplied by the Federal Reserve Bank of Phila-

     delphia.

9. The model is similar to that of Peek (1983)



10. while an increase in expected transfer payments would tend to raise wd by

    increasing the perceived value of total lifetime resources, it would at

    the same time discourage the accumulation of wealth for retirement to the

    extent that it leads to the expectation of a higher retirement income

     (e.g., social security benefits). Similarly, an increase in unemployment

    benefits could reduce the need for precautionary wealth held to carry an

    individual through a period of less than normal earnings. If these

     influences more than offset the positive total resources effect, w2 would

    be negative.



11. We will ignore any accrued income tax liabilities on accrued capital

    gains. Such taxes are paid only upon realization, if ever, and ar& based

     on nominal rather than real capital gains. Bailey (1969) found that the

     effective tax rate on accrued capital gains was very small, perhaps as

     low as 5 to 10 percent.



12. Nichols (1970) investigates some implications of this deflection issue

     whereby real capital gains crowd out asset accumulation in satisfying

     wealth accumulation motives.

14. Recall that adjustment to personal saving for the inflation premium

    component in interest income requires a compensating adjustment to (the

    expected component of) GNFAP. Consequently, in the equations that follow

    our measure of the expected component of GNFAP will be the sum of our

    original (Chapter 3) measure of GNFAPE and SPREM. This is equivalent to

    reducing expected capital 'osses by the inflation premium component in

    net interest income.

15. Plosser and Schwert (1978) suggest differencing as a crude test of model

    specification. The results from the levels regression of a correctly

    specified model should be confirmed by the results from the reestimation

    of the equation using the first differences of the data.



16. Tobin and Dolde (1971: 101) suggest that a consumption function

    specification containing disposable income and wealth would have

    coefficients on these variables in the ranges of 0.5 to 0.7 and 0.03 to

    0.05, respectively. This implies a disposable income coefficient between

    0.3 and 0.5 for the corresponding saving equation.



17. When the equation is reestimated omitting some of the variables that are

    highly correlated with IDLE (W, AGE, and GHLNE) , as well as GAP, the

    estimated coefficient on IDLE drops to only 0.28, while the estimated

    coefficient on IDLU (0.59) is little affected.



18. When only SPREM was added to the specification in column 2, its estimated

    coefficient was 1.28 (S.E. =   0.30) and the SEE was reduced from 22.54 to
     15.51.




19. Kane (1985) suggests this effect.



20. This estimate, which is obviously measured with some imprecision, is

     slightly less than half the impact on the NIA private saving rate

    obtained by Slemrod (1984) .   We   obtained a much larger impact when the

    NIA personal saving rate, rather than our corrected rate, was employed as

    the   dependent variable.

21. A similar estimate, again employing a different data set and methodology,

    was recently obtained by Carmichael (1984) .   See Feldstein (1982) for

    references to numerous studies, micro and macro, on the saving impact of

    social security.



22. There is an implicit constant term in the saving—levels equation of —400.

    Given the —10 on the truncated constant in the changes equation, the

     "constant" in the levels equation rises, in absolute value, by 10 each

    year through 1979. If expected real labor income per capita were to

    increase by 2½ percent the first year and then by slightly decreasing

    amounts in later years, the unfunded pensions effect on the average

    saving rate would precisely offset the effect of real income growth

     (higher marginal than average rate) leaving the average saving rate

    unchanged. Of course, real income per capita grew by far less than 2

    percent per year except in the 1960s when the growth rate was nearly 3

    percent.
