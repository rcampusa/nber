While it is by now well known that the privatization of township- and village-run enterprises

(TVREs) has been rapidly and widely taking place in China, it is much less known whether and to

what extent privatization has improved resource allocation and productivity. As a first step toward

the fuller understanding of the effect of privatization, this study undertakes case studies of garment

and casting enterprises in the Greater Yantgze River Region, where TVREs led miraculous

economic growth in the 1980s. Our empirical results indicate that productivity was significantly

enhanced by the recent privatization with time lag of a few years.

I.     Introduction

        Until the 1980s, China’s miraculous economic growth had been led by publicly owned

township and village enterprises (TVEs), which may be more accurately termed township-

and village-run enterprises or TVREs (Chen et al. 1992; Jefferson et al. 1996; Otsuka et al.

1998).1      In the 1990s, however, private sector has emerged to be a leading sector of the

economy in China.          In the southeastern part of Jiangsu province, whose successful record

of economic development based on TVREs in the 1980s was dubbed the “Sunan Model of

Industrial Development,” the privatization of TVREs has been taking place in the late

1990s.        Furthermore, the growth rate of Zhejiang province, which has depended

consistently on the growth of private sectors since the beginning of the 1980s, outweighed

most other provinces including Jiangsu in the 1990s (Zhang 1999).

        While it is by now well known that privatization has been rapidly and widely taking

place in China, it is much less known whether and to what extent privatization has

improved resource allocation and productivity.2            The major issue to be addressed in this

study is to assess the productivity effects of TVE privatization quantitatively.           If the recent

privatization results in the improvement of production efficiency, a question immediately

arises as to why it did not take place earlier. Also it is interesting to ask why TVREs

prospered in Jiangsu in the 1980s. These issues are critically important in understanding



1    Note that township and village enterprises (TVEs) include both TVREs and private enterprises.

     An exceptional and pioneering study is Li et al. (1999).

the growth performance of the Chinese economy in the 1990s and assessing its future

growth potential for the early decades of the 21st century.

     As a first step toward the fuller understanding of the effects of TVE privatization on

productivity, this study undertakes case studies of the garment and metal casting enterprises

in the Great Yangtze River Region extending from the suburbs of Shanghai to the western

border of Anhui province.         Common and important characteristics of TVREs in the

suburbs of Shanghai and southern Jiangsu were identified to be their dependence on SOEs

in technology, management, and marketing (Otsuka, Liu, and Murakami 1998).                      Some

TVREs used to be cooperative TVEs or “branch factory” of urban SOEs, in which

managers were sent from SOEs and profits were shared between them in accordance with

their investment shares (Fudan University Economic Research Center 1988).                 Putting-out

contracts were frequently made not only between SOEs and their branches but also

between SOEs and independent TVREs.             Moreover, TVREs often purchased second-hand

machines used by SOEs and employed retired SOE workers in order to acquire the

technology and management know-how of SOEs (Murakami, Liu, and Otsuka 1994, 1996).

It seems that township and village governments supported such transactions and

cooperation through direct involvement in enterprise management.3

     Our maintained hypothesis is that such cooperation between TVREs and SOEs was



3 This view is consistent with the justification of TVREs by Che and Qian (1998), who argue that the
advantage of local government ownership lies in reduction of state predation.



                                                  2
mutually beneficial, at least in the light industries during the 1980s.4               TVREs faced

largely unregulated management environments, but lacked technology, management

know-how, and marketing capacity.            In contrast, the management of SOEs was tightly

regulated, even though they had decent management, technology, and marketing

knowledge.       In the 1990s, two major changes seem to have taken place, which have

eroded the advantage of the TVRE-SOE cooperation.                 First, TVREs have absorbed the

production knowledge and capacity of SOEs, so that payoff to maintain cooperative

relationship with SOEs has gradually declined (Liu and Otsuka 1998).                    Second, free

market system has developed, so that the direct government support for the inter-enterprise

transactions, particularly face-to-face transactions between TVREs and SOEs in our

context, tends to lose its significance (Li 1996; Hsiao et al. 1998; Jin and Qian 1998; Chen

and Rozelle 1999).        Therefore, we hypothesize that privatization in the late 1990s has

resulted in significant improvements in production efficiency by enhancing management

incentives without sacrificing marketing efficiencies.

       The organization of this paper is as follows.       In the next section, sampling scheme is

explained, and the basic statistics of our sample enterprises, such as the growth rate of

valued added, are presented.        After examining the changing importance of subcontracting

transactions with SOEs and the changing distribution of stock ownership by the local

government vis-à-vis private owners in section III, we assess the impacts of privatization

4
    Lin and Yao (2001) contend that the development of the SOE sector tended to help the development of




                                                   3
on productivity by estimating the function that explains the growth rate of per worker

value-added, separately for the garment and metal casting industries, in section IV.

Implications of this study will be discussed in the final section.




II.   Data

       To analyze determinants and consequences of TVRE privatization, we use data

collected by a rural enterprise survey conducted in 1999 and 2000 in the Great Yangtze

River Region from the suburb of Shanghai to about 650 km points upstream.                     The study

areas include 5 counties in the suburb of Shanghai, 19 counties in the south of the Yangtze

River in Jiangsu province, and 29 counties between the Yangtze and the Huai He Rivers in

Anhui province. These areas are connected by an express-way which goes from Shanghai

along the Yangtze River to Nanjing, the capital city of Jiangsu, crosses the river from south

to north at this city, and goes west up to and beyond Hefei, the capital city of Anhui.

Sample enterprises were selected randomly from the enterprise lists compiled by local

governments of 28 counties selected randomly from the 53 counties. The garment and

casting samples consist of 78 and 80 enterprises, respectively.

      We chose specific industries for case studies, partly because the productivity impacts

of privatization cannot be assessed unless we can reasonably assume identical production

function parameters among sample enterprises.            We chose the Great Yangtze River Region,


the TVE sector in the light industries whereas the opposite was the case in the heavy industries.



                                                    4
because the influence of SOEs in Shanghai, a center of the state industrial sectors in China,

tends to decline with the distance from Shanghai, so that sufficient geographical variations

of the influence of SOEs can be observed. The garment and the casting industries were

chosen, partly because they have numerous enterprises over wide areas and partly because

their dependence on SOEs is contrasting: the metal casting enterprises wholly depend on

SOEs in both input and output transactions as of 2000, whereas the garment enterprises are

far more independent from SOEs.

     The retrospective survey of enterprises provides information on production and costs

as well as changing distributions of ownership shares during the 1995-1998 period, and

information on equipment and marketing channels in 1995 and 1998.                    Table 1 shows the

growth rate of real value added of the sample enterprises and the number of observations

by area. In this study, value added was calculated as gross value of output minus material

cost, energy cost, and payments to shipping agencies and wholesalers.                   We applied the

method of double deflation to the survey data of nominal value added, in order to obtain

real value added at the 1998 price.5        The data of real value added in both 1995 and 1998

are complete only for 56 enterprises in the garment industry and 58 in the casting industry,

5
  The price indexes of products of the Garment and Other Fiber Products industry and the Smetling and
Pressing of Ferrous Metals industry, assessed at the factory gate by the State Statistics Bureau (various
years), were used as deflators for garment and casting products, respectively. Since price data on
shipping and marketing services are not available, we applied the same deflator as the output to these
services. As deflators for materials in the garment and the casting industries, we used the factory price
index of products of the Textile industry and the Smelting and Pressing of Ferrous Metals industry,
respectively. As a deflator for energy cost, we used the electricity price data in the case of the garment
sample and the coal price data in the case of the casting sample, both of which are provided by the State
Statistics Bureau (various years).



                                                    5
particularly because of the entry of new enterprises after 1995. 6                  For descriptive

exposition, we classified the study areas into four regions: the suburb of Shanghai,

Southeast Jiangsu, Southwest Jiangsu, and Anhui.

     Southeast Jiangsu is a traditionally fertile granary and close to Shanghai. With these

geographical advantages, the economy in this area started growing rapidly with the

remarkable development of TVREs, as soon as the central government commenced the

economic reform in the late 1970s.            By the early 1990s, the successful TVRE-led

development strategy pursued in this area became widely known under the name of the

“Sunan Model of Industrial Development.”              Since the early 1990s, however, the Sunan

Model has been challenged by another model of industrial development formed in and

around Wenzhou city in Zehjiang province, whose economy has been catching up with

Southeast Jiangsu starting from a much lower level of development (Zhang 1999; Tang and

Cheng 2000; Sonobe, Hu, and Otsuka 2002b).                In this “Wenzhou Model of Industrial

Development,” high economic growth is driven by private enterprises and “disguised”

TVREs which were essentially private but disguising themselves as TVREs because private

enterprises were unfavorably treated by various regulations.

     TVREs were also developed in Southwest Jiangsu including Nanjing.                      Probably

because Nanjing is the capital city of Jiangsu province, there were a larger number of SOEs

6
  Each sample includes several new entrants established in 1995, 1996, or 1997. Those firms
established in 1998 were excluded from the sample. The production data in the first year of operation
of new entrants were not used in the analysis because variables in the first year have incomparably




                                                  6
and urban collective enterprises in this area than in Southeast Jiangsu. Accordingly, the

relative importance of the TVRE sector was smaller in this area than in Southeast Jiangsu.

In Anhui, where manufacturing was least developed among the study areas, the share of the

SOE sector in gross industrial output was greatest, although the absolute size of the SOE

sector was much smaller than in the other study areas.7               It is interesting to note that the

share of private enterprises and self-employed small-scale family enterprises in Anhui

province was greater than in the other study areas in 1995 and earlier.8               This is consistent

with the hypothesis that the development of the private sector was predominant in poor

areas with a few SOEs because local governments in such areas could not afford to

establish a large number of TVREs in cooperation with SOEs.

     As shown in Table 1, the average size of enterprises, in terms of their real value added,

grew in all areas in the garment sample but declined in Shanghai and Southwest Jiangsu in

the casting sample from 1995 to 1998.9            A factor that made the casting industry stagnant

or declining was the anti-pollution regulation in urbanized areas.             The regulation was most

stringent in Shanghai, where the municipality government prohibited the expansion and

renewal of foundries. Customers shifted orders away from foundries in Shanghai to other

areas where environmental regulations were less tight, especially to Southeast Jiangsu.



greater variances than those in subsequent years.
7
  Data of industrial output and its composition by sector, aggregated at the provincial level, are available
from the Statistical Bureaus of Jigansu and Anhui provinces (various years).
8
  The self-employed enterprises are those with seven workers or less.
9
  In a discussion of growth performance, attention should be paid to effects of business cycle.



                                                     7
As a result, casting enterprises in Southeast Jiangsu had much better growth record than

their counterparts in Southwest Jiangsu as well as Shanghai. Casting enterprises in Anhui,

however, were growing even faster. In the garment sample, the average growth rate

increases with distance from Shanghai.        Thus, in both casting and garment samples,

enterprises in Anhui were growing faster than in any other study areas.                These

comparisons suggest that patterns of comparative advantage in the coastal and central

regions were significantly changing within labor-intensive industries, such as the garment

industry, and polluting industries, such as the casting industry.

     A unique feature of our enterprise survey is that it traces the changing distribution of

ownership within each sample enterprise since its establishment.        Officially registered

ownership types (such as TVRE, shareholding, joint share, foreign joint venture, and

private) could be misleading as the episodes of numerous “disguised” TVREs in Wenzhou

suggest.    Such enterprises also existed in Jiangsu, according to our own survey.

Moreover, such categorization offers no information on increases in private ownership

shares if the registered ownership type of the enterprise remains the same.    Thus, for the

purpose of measuring the extent of privatization, it is more desirable to use continuous

indicators of ownership than categorical variables.      In practice, the privatization of an

enterprise begins by estimating the capitalized value of its assets.    Then, the shares of

various owners (e.g., township government, which primarily invested at the time of

enterprise establishment, and enterprise itself, which reinvested profits) are determined



                                               8
according to their previous investments and services, and hence, ownership distribution

becomes clear after capitalization.     To trace the ownership distribution before the

capitalization, we simply relied on the subjective assessment of key informants, who were

usually general managers.

     As shown in Table 2, we classified owners into five types: (i) local government, (ii)

SOEs, (iii) workers, (iv) joint ventures with foreign enterprises, and (v) private owners.

In this classification, SOEs include urban collective enterprises.   Private owners include,

most importantly, the general manager and other leaders within the enterprise, and a

relatively small number of individuals and enterprises outside the enterprise except SOEs

and joint ventures. In the garment sample, there were a number of enterprises that had

experienced partial privatization before 1995, as reflected in private ownership of as high

as 23.6 percent.   In the casting sample, most enterprises were 100 percent owned in 1995

by the local government at least nominally, and there were a small number of completely

private enterprises, most of which were outgrowths of self-employed, family enterprises.

Thus, the average ownership share of local governments was much higher in the casting

sample in 1995.    In both samples, however, the pace of privatization accelerated, and the

average ownership share of local governments decreased to less than 30 percent and that of

private owners increased to more than 50 percent in 1998. Presumably, this is not a mere

coincidence but a result of the increasing pressure that the central government put on local

governments to fully privatize their TVREs enterprises.



                                             9
       In the literature on ambiguous property rights in China, a central question is why

TVREs could achieve remarkable growth performances in the 1980s and the early 1990s,

despite the disincentive effect of the ambiguous ownership of TVREs on enterprise

management.      A plausible answer to this question is that the market in this period in China

was characterized by high transaction costs, which could be reduced by the intervention of

local governments (Li 1996; Hsiao et al. 1998; Jin and Qian 1998; Chen and Rozelle 1999).

Although not mentioned in this literature, we would like to emphasize that such transaction

costs were particularly high when transactions were made with SOEs.           As free market

transactions developed, however, it is likely that the government support for transactions

and cooperation between TVREs and SOEs have gradually lost its significance. If this is

the case, privatization ought to increase the production efficiency of rural enterprises. In

order to examine the relevance of these arguments, we will look at the production data

more carefully in the next two sections.




III.   Privatization and Growth in the Garment Industry

       Garment enterprises in our sample produce a variety of garment products ranging

from cheap underwear to expensive and technically difficult men’s suits.       In view of the

presumed importance of marketing channels, we classify these products into original

products, which are designed and marketed by the sample enterprises themselves, and those

produced under subcontracting with large enterprises, such as SOEs and foreign joint



                                              10
ventures. Although many of the sample enterprises in Southeast Jiangsue used to be

cooperative TVEs or branch factories of SOEs in Shanghai when free market transactions

were not developed, they are now transacting with a number of SOEs and other enterprises.

While subcontracting has several forms, such as putting out and original equipment

manufacturing (OEM), we do not distinguish them since such distinction is practically

impossible for some sample enterprises.      Instead, we distinguish subcontracting with

SOEs from subcontracting with other types of enterprises.

     Table 3 shows the composition of original products and subcontracting with SOEs and

other enterprises in sales revenues by study area in 1995 and 1998.          It is said that

compared with Zhejiang province, garment enterprises in our study areas, especially those

in Southeast Jiangsu, have high skills and use expensive equipment to produce high-quality

products, but they are behind in establishing their own marketing network.       Consistent

with this argument, the proportion of original products to the sales revenue in Southeast

Jiangsu in 1995 is as low as 18.0 percent and that of subcontracting with SOEs is as high as

45.6 percent.   A possible explanation for such differences between this area and Zhejiang

is that garment enterprises in Southeast Jiangsu could afford to invest in expensive

machines by taking advantage of geographical proximity to Shanghai to receive

subcontracting orders from SOEs and foreign ventures.       Although garment enterprises in

Anhui were not advantageous in these respects, they have high shares of subcontracting

with SOEs because they tended to follow the Sunan Model, in that they had a high



                                            11
propensity to subcontract with relatively small local SOEs and urban collectives.

     Table 4 compares the ownership share of the local government between those

enterprises heavily dependent on SOE-subcontracting and the other sample enterprises.        In

1995, SOE-subcontracting accounted for more than half of the sales revenue at 24 sample

enterprises, which had a much higher average ownership share of the local government and

a lower average share of private owners than the other sample enterprises.        This suggests

that the local government’s involvement in enterprise management was helpful in making

and maintaining subcontracting contacts with SOEs in 1995.              By 1998, however, there

was a reversal in the relationship between ownership pattern and transaction mode, in

which those enterprises heavily dependent on SOE subcontracting tended to have lower

government shares and higher private shares.           This reversal is consistent with our

maintained hypothesis that the local government’s supports for subcontracting with SOEs

lost its significance in this industry during the period under study.

     Privatization, which clarifies ambiguous property rights by increasing managers’

ownership shares, would enhance profit-seeking incentives of managers.              If the local

government’s support for subcontracting with SOEs became no longer important,

privatization would improve production efficiency without sacrificing transaction

efficiencies.   To date, however, few empirical studies have assessed the productivity

effects of TVRE privatization or confirmed even its existence.            On the contrary, some

theoretical studies presume that productive efficiency of a rural enterprise does not depend



                                               12
on the type of enterprise’s ownership (e.g., Weitzman and Xu 1994).               An exception is the

pioneering work by Li and Rozelle (2000), who find that although positive productivity

effect exists, it is realized not right after privatization but with adjustment lags of a few

years.10

     To assess the productivity effect of privatization, we specified a growth function of the

following general form:


      G(V) ＝ f [G(K), G(L), PS1995, ∆PS1996, ∆PS1997, X],                                           (1)




where G(V), G(K), and G(L) are growth rates of real value added, real capital stock, and the

number of workers, respectively, during from 1995 to 1998; PS1995 is the ownership share

of private owners in 1995, which is intended to capture the effect of privatization that took

place before 1996; ∆PS1996 and ∆PS1997 are increases in the share of private owners during

the whole year of 1996 and 1997, respectively; and X is a vector of other independent

variables. To estimate real capital stock, we first estimated nominal net investment from

the survey data on nominal capital stock, and then used the factory price index of

machinery products as deflator.11       Estimated real values of net investments were added to



10 Their use of dummy variables to represent the privatization is questionable in view of the continuous
process of privatization.
11
   Through our survey, we obtained nominal values of initial investments in equipment at the time of
enterprise establishment, and nominal stock values of equipment in 1995 and 1998. We assumed that
equal amount of nominal net investment were made each year between enterprise establishment and
1995 and between 1995 and 1998. In this way, we estimated annual values of nominal net investment.



                                                   13
the real value of initial investment to obtain real values of capital stock in 1995 and 1998.

     Since the dependent variable in equation (1) is the growth rate of value added rather

than physical quantity, it is affected not only by production efficiency but also by

transaction efficiency.   If privatization enhanced production efficiency without sacrificing

transaction efficiency, it would have a significantly positive effect on output growth.     To

the extent that the role of the local government in supporting TVE-SOE transactions was

important, however, privatization would reduce transaction efficiency and cancel out part

of the positive productivity effect.   We focus on the privatization that took place before

1998 because it is unlikely that privatization in 1998 affected immediately the productivity

growth during the 1995-1998 period.                Vector X includes the proportion of

SOE-subcontracting to sales revenue in 1995, three provincial dummies (with Southwest

Jiangsu being default), the road distance from Shanghai, the road distance from the nearest

exit of the expressway, and the years of operation.    If subcontracting with SOEs helped a

TVE learn technology, marketing, and/or management from SOEs, the proportion of

SOE-subcontracting would have a positive effect on labor productivity growth.

     To avoid possibly serious multicollinearity between G(K) and G(L), and to control for

the effect of enterprise specific unobservables, we modified equation (1) into the following

estimable form:

where u is an error term.         Since the growth rate of capital-labor ratio, G(K/L), on the

right-hand side of equation (2) is likely to be endogenous, we instrumented it with ln(L),

ln(K/L), and ln(V/L) in the base year (i.e., 1995) and the growth rate of average annual

wage earnings per worker in the county during the 1995–1998 period.12                Although there is

a possibility that the choice of the extent of privatization by the local government is

affected by the labor productivity growth of the enterprise, ∆PS and PS are treated as

exogenous variables at this stage of our study.

        Table 5 reports 3SLS estimates of the capital-labor ratio (K/L) growth function and

the labor productivity (V/L) growth function.            For comparison, the OLS estimates of the

reduced form are also shown.           In column (i), the K-L ratio level in 1995 has a negative

and significant effect on its subsequent growth, serving as an instrumental variable.               The

years of operation have a positive and significant effect on the K-L ratio growth, which

suggests that older enterprises tended to have had large labor employment before 1995 and

then hasten to adjust their labor and capital inputs to the soaring wage rate during the study

period. The private ownership share as of 1995 and the subsequent privatization do not

have any significant effect on the K-L ratio growth in the garment sample.

        In columns (ii) and (iii), privatization in 1996 has a positive and significant effect on

the growth of labor productivity, which strongly supports the hypothesis that privatization

improves production efficiency. In both columns, the productivity effect of privatization

in 1997 is positive but insignificant. These results are consistent with the finding by Li

and Rozelle (2000) that productivity effect is realized not right after privatization but with a

few-year adjustment time lag.       The result that the proportion of SOE-subcontracting has a

negative and significant effect on labor productivity growth suggests that the sample

enterprises had already absorbed technologies and management know-how from SOEs by

the sample period, and that transactions with technologically more advanced enterprises,

such as foreign joint ventures, and/or the establishment of own marketing channels were

becoming important for productivity growth.           As shown in column (ii), the estimate of

coefficient, a5, of G(K/L) in equation (2) is 0.667, which is reasonably close to the sample

average of (1 – labor share), where the labor share is measured as the ratio of nominal wage

payments to nominal value added.




IV.   Privatization and Growth in the Casting Industry

      Unlike subcontracting in the garment industry, casting subcontracting was made

almost exclusively with SOEs, especially those in and around Shanghai.        Even in the case

of original products manufactured and sold freely by TVEs, major buyers were mostly

SOEs, and suppliers of important inputs, such as coal and pig iron, were also SOEs.       Thus,

transactions and cooperation with SOEs were indispensable for casting enterprises.


municipality and Jiangsu and Anhui provinces (various years).



                                                 16
Moreover, the quality of cast products is difficult to inspect visually, especially in the case

of complicated shapes and large sizes, and, hence, the cost of inter-enterprise transactions

tended to be high in this industry, even though free market transactions were developed in

the 1990s. It is, therefore, likely that the role of the local government in supporting

transactions with SOEs was greater in this industry than in the garment industry.

     According to Table 6, original products accounted for a large part of sales revenue in

Anhui but much less in areas closer to Shanghai. Enterprise managers told us that original

products tended to be parts for light consumer goods and relatively simple machines, such

as small pumps and tractor engines, while parts for heavy equipment, such as huge engines

for large ships, were produced under subcontracts with SOEs. The heavy concentration of

large SOEs in Shanghai and its vicinity seems to explain the finding from Table 6 that the

proportion of subcontracting decreases as the distance from Shanghai increases.             As

shown in Table 7, the ownership structure of original product-oriented enterprises was

similar to that of subcontracting-oriented enterprises in 1995.    In 1998, the difference in

ownership structure between these two types of enterprises was a little greater than in 1995,

but it was not statistically significant.

     Table 8 reports the estimation results of the K-L ratio function and the labor

productivity growth function for the casting sample.     This table is organized in the same

fashion as Table 7 except that the proportion of SOE-subcontracting to sales revenue in

table 7 is replaced by the proportion of original products in Table 8. In column (i), the



                                              17
private ownership share as of 1995 had a negative and significant effect on the growth of

the K-L ratio during the 1995-1998 period, whereas privatization that took place in 1997

had a positive and significant effect on the K-L ratio growth. These results suggest that

privatized enterprises reduced labor employment at first but then increased as production

efficiency improved.   The Anhui dummy has a positive and significant effect on the K-L

ratio growth, which is likely to be a reflection of the tendency to geographical growth

convergence.   The K-L ratio, labor productivity, and labor employment size in 1995 in

column (i), which are excluded from column (ii), have positive and significant effects on

the subsequent growth of the K-L ratio and, hence, they serve as instrumental variables.

     The most important result shown in Table 8 is that privatization in 1996 had a positive

and significant effect on labor productivity growth, even though the productivity effect of

privatization was weaker in the casting industry than in the garment industry.

Interestingly, privatization in 1997 has a negative and significant effect on labor

productivity growth.   These results are consistent with our arguments that the temporarily

detrimental effect of privatization on transaction efficiency was more substantially in the

casting industry than in the garment industry, and that the productivity effect of

privatization was realized with time lags.        The Anhui dummy has a positive and

significant effect on labor productivity as well as on K-L ratio growth, which supports the

hypothesis that the center of gravity in the casting industry was shifting from the coastal

region, such as the suburbs of Shanghai, to the central region such as Anhui province.



                                             18
V. Concluding Remarks

     In this case study, we found that privatization of TVREs has been rapidly taking place

in the Greater Yangtze River Region since the middle of the 1990s.         Although this rapid

privatization was due partly to the policy of the central government, we argued that it was

closely related to the increasing importance of free market transactions, which made the

intervention of local governments in the management of TVREs less productive.           Thus,

we advanced the hypothesis that the recent privatization has improved the production

efficiency of enterprises.     Our hypothesis is clearly supported by the three-stage

estimation of the capital-labor ratio growth and labor productivity growth functions for

both the garment and metal casting industries, which commonly indicates that productivity

was significantly enhanced by privatization with a few years’ time lag.        The estimation

results suggest that the productivity effect of privatization was greater in an industry where

products and materials were more efficiently transacted at free markets.

     At this point, we must emphasize that in all likelihood, our analysis has identified

mere short-run effects of privatization on productivity.     In the longer-run, privatization

will have greater effects on productivity than estimated in this study, as free markets of

products and materials develop.      In our observation, enormous difference still exists

between private enterprises in Zhejiang province and the Greater Yangtze River Region.

First, current competition among enterprises in Zhejiang province centers round the



                                             19
production of differentiated, improved products, often with brand names, and the

establishment of nation-wide marketing network.           In Jiangsu, however, competition

through brand names and the establishment of own marketing network has begun late and

taken place only among a small number of leading enterprises.        Second, closely-related

industries tend to be clustered in Zhejiang province to enjoy the so-called “localization

economies” arising from information externalities, the division and specialization of labor

among enterprises, and possibly the formation of skilled labor markets (see e.g., Zhang

1999; Tang and Cheng 2000; Sonobe and Otsuka 2002a, b). Such industrial clusters seem

to have been formed gradually through free market competition over the last two decades.

In contrast, industrial clusters have been less developed in the Great Yangtze River Region

except the Sunan area near Shanghai. It is likely that in the longer run, the improvement

of products and marketing capacity and the geographical concentration of industries will

take place in the Greater Yangtze River Region as well.

     Upshot is that we have to carefully distinguish between the short-run effects of

privatization, which would have arisen from improved management incentives, and

longer-run effects, which would arise from investments in the development of improved

products and the establishment of marketing system, as well as from the formation of

industrial clusters.   Our result that the short-run incentive effect of privation is

significantly positive strongly indicates that privatization can be a driving force leading to

the continued improvement of productivity over long periods, so far as privatization

enhances market competition among enterprises across wide areas.
