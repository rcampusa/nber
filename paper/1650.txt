                 Estimates of the Value of Patent
                   Rights in European Countries
                    During the Post-1950 Period


                               ABSTRACT




     This paper examines the distribution of the values of patent rights in the

United Kingdom, France, and Germany during the post-1950 period. These values

are inferred from the behavior of patentees with respect to payment of renewal

fees on their patents. A simple economic model of renewal decisions is

combined with data on the proportion of patents renewed at alternative ages and

the renewal fee schedules to produce estimates of the distribution (and the

total) value of patent rights in these countries. Moreover, the data indicate

that there have been changes in the value distribution, and we follow these

changes over the period. The empirical results of particular interest

concern: the total value of patent rights and the relationship between

changes in it and changes in the quantity of patents, the skew in the

distribution of patent values, and the rate of obsolescence on the returns to

patents.

       The objective of this paper is to analyze empirically the private

value of patent rights in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany during

the post—1950 period. Since patent rights are seldom marketed, we cannot

obtain direct evidence on their values. Instead, we infer the value of

patent rights from the economic behavior of patentees. In particular,

in most countries (including the three studied here) agents must pay an

annual renewal fee in order to keep their patents in force. We use a

simple economic model of the renewal decision to recover the distribution

of the values of the patents in a cohort from the proportion of patents

in that cohort renewed at different ages, and the renewal fee schedules

faced by the cohort.

       The model, together with the renewal data, suffice to provide

estimates of the total value of the patents in a cohort, and its

distribution among the members of that cohort. In addition, the data

indicate     that the parameters of the model differ by both year and cohort.
We   allow   for these differences and then examine the implied movements
in   the mean and total value of cohorts of patents during the post—1950

period. Since there is little previous large sample evidence on changes

in the value of patents over time, most     aggregate intertemporal (and
cross section) comparisons of patent output have focused on changes in
quantities    of patents (either applied for or granted; see, for example,

the articles in Griliches ed., 1984). Our empirical results indicate

that, at least during the post—1950 period in these three countries,

changes in the quantity of patents are frequently inversely related to

changes in the "quality" (or mean value) of these patents. Previous

studies    which rely exclusively on the quantity of patents as an indicator
                                                                                 2




of inventive activity miss the changes over time in the total value of

patent rights, and as a result their conclusions may be misleading.

        Section 1 presents the patent renewal model, which is a slightly

extended version of a model developed by us in earlier work (Pakes and

Schankerman 1984a; Schankerman and Pakes 1985). Section 2 describes

in some detail the data set used for the empirical work. This new data

set consists of patent renewal rates and fees for cohorts of patents at

the aggregate level. It contains almost all patents taken out in the

United Kingdom, France and Germany during the post—1950 period. Section

3 describes the empirical specification of the model and presents the

estimates. In Section 4 we consider the implications of these estimates.

This includes an empirical characterization of the distribution of the

private value of patent rights for each country, and an examination of

the movements over time in both the quality and quantity of annual

patent applications. Brief concluding remarks close the paper.



1. A Model of Patent Renewal

        Consider an agent who holds a patent. Let j denote the cohort of

the patent. and t   be   its age, so t   +j   represents the year. In order to

keep   the patent in force the agent must pay an annual renewal fee. The
renewal fee varies with the age and possibly the cohort of the patent,
and we denote the sequence of renewal fees at different ages by {C}.
An agent who pays the renewal fee earns the implicit        return to patent

protection   during the coining year, Ri. We shall assume that the
sequence {R.}    is known    with certainty at the time the patent is applied
for.'    The agent's decision problem is to maximize the discounted value
                                                                              3



of net returns accruing to the patent by choosing an optimal age at

which to stop paying the renewal fee. Formally, the agent chooses the

lifespan of the patent, T, to

                                        T
(1)                  max   —
                               V(T) =         (R.
                                                    —
                                                        C.)(1   +
             T€1,2,...,TJ               t=1


where i is the discount rate and T is the statutory limit to patent
protection. Provided the sequence {R — C.)1 is nonincreasing in t,
the optm:l lifespan T is the first age at which         C < 0, or if—



no such T £[1,2,...,T) exists, then T = T. Equivalently, in a world
of certainty with nonincreasing net returns, the condition for renewal
of the patent at age t is that the annual returns at least cover the
cost of renewal, or

(2)              >



Since the renewal fees are nondecreasing in age (see Section 2), a
condition which insures that net revenues are nonincreasing is that the
sequence {R.} is noriincreasing, that is, that the returns to holding a
patent do in fact decay over time.
        The sequence of returns {R} reflects the initial returns R0. and
the sequence of the rates of decay of those returns {6). If the
sequence of returns {R} were the swe for all patents in a given
cohort, then all patents would be cancelledat the same age and the time
path of renewals would be degenerate. We allow patents in a given
cohort to differ in their initial returns but assume that the sequence
of decay rates           does not differ among patents.2 The decay rates,
however,   will be   allowed to vary in response to changes in the economic
                                                                                     4

a vector of parameters. Then the proportion of patents in cohort j

renewed at age t, Pr., is



                   =                           = 1   —

        The estimation problem is to use data on the proportion of patents

renewed and the costs of renewal to estimate the sequence of decay rates

and the parameters characterizing the density function of initial

revenues. These parameters will allow us to derive the distribution of

the value of patent rights and characterize changes that have occurred

in it over time (see Section 4). We begin with a description of the

data.




2. Description of the Data

        The data were obtained directly from the patent offices in the

U.K., France and Germany.3 For each country we obtained information on

the number of patents in each cohort which were renewed at different

ages, the total number of patent applications in the cohort, and the

renewal cost schedules in nominal terms during the post—1950 period.
                                                                                   5



There was no available information either on individual patents or on a

breakdown of cohorts by industrial sector or type of patent. Table 1

summarizes some basic characteristics of the data.

         In each of these countries, maintenance of patent protection

requires payment of an annual renewal fee which begins some years after

the patent is applied for and continues until the statutory limit to

patent protection. The range of patent ages varies across countries

(see row 1 in Table 1) and represents the span of ages over which data

on   patent   renewals and fees are available. The data contain (at least

partial) information on the renewals of between twenty—seven and twenty—
nine cohorts of patents applied for between 1950 and 1979, depending on
the country. The range of years in which we observe the renewals of the
cohorts still in force is 1955—1981 in the U.K. and Germany, but only
1970—1981     for France.
         The renewal fee schedules are published by the respective patent
offices    and are changed periodically, but the most recent schedule

applies    to all patents regardless of the year of initial patent

application.      Hence the renewal fee at a particular age depends on the
year in which      the   patent reaches that age. The   nominal renewal fees in

domestic      currency were converted to real costs using the country's
implicit      GDP deflator and then to 1980 U.S. dollars    using   the official

exchange rates in 1980.

         We designate a cohort of patents    as all those patents applied for
in   a   given year, and distinguish different cohorts within a country by
the   index j. In the U.K. and France, the proportion of patents in

 cohort j which is renewed at age t,           is calculated as the ratio of
                                                                                   6

bThjs ratio is computed directly from the German data, and averaged over
 cohorts. The data for the U.K. arid France do not associate grants with

CThe ratio of the between age to total variance in X. is the ratio of
  the variance in X —X to the variance in X. —             X, after correcting
 both terms for their degrees of freedom. Here             is the average
  (across cohorts) value of X. at age t, and X is the grand mean of X.

renewals to patent applications (actually "completed specifications" in

the U.K., which denotes completed applications). Therefore, some of the

patent dropouts in the early ages may be "involuntary," reflecting their

failure to be granted rather than the patentee's comparison of returns

to costs of renewal. This is particularly true for France where patents

are recorded from age' two. In the U.K. the first observed renewal age

is five and we were informed by patent office personnel that virtually

all grants occur within five years after the patent application. In

Germany the renewal data are recorded only for patents which have already

been granted, but the age of the patent is based on the application date

as in the U.K. and France. We compute the renewal proportion              as the

ratio of renewals at age t   to   the patents from cohort j   which are

eventually granted. The German renewal data avoid the problem of

"involuntary attrition," but they sample     only   from the population of

patents granted (in contrast to the U.K. and France, where the population

consists of all patents applied for). The countries also differ

substantially in the fraction of patent applications which is granted.

The German data allow us to compute this fraction directly, but in the

U.K. and France we have to approximate it (see notes to Table 1) because

the data on grants are not identified with specific cohorts of patents.

As row 6 in Table 1 shows, the patent screening process in the U.K. and

France does not weed out many patents (83 and 93 percent of applications

are granted, respectively). However, only about one—third of all

applications are granted in Germany.

      There   are two dimensions to the data, the age and the cohort (date
of application) of the patent. The last three rows in Table 1        present
                                                                                     8

       the renewal proportion            and the proportion of dropouts (mortality

rate) P
          t—l,J

                        tJ
                                 is clear that almost all of the variance in

renewals and costs of renewals is between age variance, implying that the

age paths of the renewal proportion and renewal fees do not vary much

among cohorts in a given country. For the renewal proportion, however,

this is largely a result of looking at the levels (and hence the

accumulation of dropouts over ages). The total variance in the mortality

rate is divided about equally between the age and cohort dimensions.

Figure   1 provides the average mortality rates at each age for each
country (averaged over the available observations on cohorts for that
age). The mortality rates vary substantially          both over ages and across

countries. This is particularly noticeable for the first few ages in

France, where part of the inter—age variance may be a result of the

patent   granting procedure. Figures 2 and 3 present the age paths of the
renewal fees and the proportion of patents renewed for each country,
averaged    over the available observations on cohorts. Note that the

renewal fees rise monotonically and the renewal proportion declines

monotonically in age in all countries. The renewal fees start at low

levels and rise much more steeply in Germany after age six. The age

paths of renewals are strikingly similar in the         U.K. and France after
age   five, and there is a large fraction which does not pay the fifth

renewal in both countries. More than half of the patents are cancelled

by age eight and only 25 percent survive past age thirteen. In Germany-

the   proportion renewed is higher than in the other countries at all

ages, but it declines at a significantly faster pace after age six.

These characteristics are consistent both with our prior information on

the German     data   and with the model of renewal behavior in the previous

section.     Since the German renewal data are based on granted patents, if

the German patent office is successful in weeding out relatively

unprofitable patents one would expect fewer dropouts in the German data

in   the early ages when the renewal fees in that country are still
relatively small and comparable to the renewal fees in the other
countries. After age six, however, the renewal fees in Germany increase
at   a distinctly faster pace than in the ILK. and France. The model of

renewal behavior implies, all else equal, that this should result in a

faster rate of decline in the proportion of patents renewed in Germany,

and   this   is in fact what we observe.

       Two    other   conclusions emerge from the evidence in Figures 2 and 3.

First, if the model of patent renewal in Section 1 is correct, the age
path of renewals indicates that there is a concentration of patents with
very little private economic value. The reason is that the model implies
that patents are renewed if the annual revenues exceed the renewal cost,
yet   the bulk of patents are cancelled even at rather modest levels of

renewal fees. Second, again conditional on our model, it may be

difficult with these data to estimate the tail of the distribution of

the value     of patent   rights very precisely. Since renewal fees are never

very   large   in absolute terms, a proportion of patents will be maintained

for the entire period, and the renewal data will not be very informative

on their values. (We return to this point below.)
                                                                             12



3. Empirical Specification and Results

        The model of patent renewal in Section 1 assumes a known, fixed

distribution of initial revenues which then decay over time. There are

several pieces of evidence which indicate that this may not be a good

assumption for the early ages. We reported in the previous section that

the mortality rate of renewals behaves quite irregularly during the first

few ages in France (see Figure 1). For the U.K. we do not observe any

renewals until age fives However, in Germany, where our data contain the

renewals of those patents already granted, the mortality rate at age

three   is much smaller than that for the subsequent ages, even though the
costs are essentially the same. Part of the reason underlying the
behavior   of the French data in the early ages is likely to be the

involuntary attrition resulting from patent applications which were not

granted——a phenomenon not accounted for by our model. A second cause of

the inappropriateness of the deterministic decay assumption in the early

ages is that in those ages future returns to the patent may   be highly
uncertain, and agents may hold the patent until more information on its

value accumulates. In a separate paper, Pakes (1984) constructs a more

complicated model of patent renewal which allows both for agents to

uncover more profitable uses for the ideas embodied in their patents,

and for the effects of the patent—granting process. Estimates of that

model indicated that these processes are important in the early ages,

but their combined effects are negligible in France and the U.K. after

age   four, and in Germany after age three. In view of this evidence and
the   fact that the first observed renewal for the U.K. is for age five,

we base our empirical work on renewals after age five in France and the
                                                                                     13




U.K., and     on renewals after age three in Germany. The universe of

patents is taken as those patents which survive to these initial ages,

and hence all renewal proportions P. are normalized by the value of

at the initial age for the associated cohort.4

      To complete the specification of the model one requires a

parameterization of the distribution of initial revenues, f(R0.;O)

where 0. is the vector of parameters for cohort j.         We   experimented

empirically with three alternative specifications, the Weibull, Pareto—

Levy and the lognormal distributions. The lognornial consistently fit

the data better than either the Weibull or the Pareto—Levy.5 Assuming,

then, that R0 distributes lognormally and letting lower case letters

denote the logarithms of upper case ones, we have r0. —                      where
                                                                 N(i.i.cY)
N(,) designates the normal distribution. In logarithmic form, the

decision rule in Section 1 is to renew a patent at age t if and only if

        Given only the proportion renewing in each cohort/age cell, we

cannot estimate separate decay rates for each cell and a separate

lognormal distribution for each cohort. However, we do want to allow for

some variation in both the decay rate and the initial distributions over

the approximately three decades covered by-our data. Given the lognormal

specification, the mean level of initial revenues in a cohort is given

      +1    2
by e1           ,       and the coefficient of variation is o. We will allow for

cohort—specific values of i                    but   maintain a common value of G             across
cohorts. This is equivalent to letting cohorts of patents differ by a

proportional            rescaling of the initial revenues of all patents in a given
cohort. Second, we want to permit the decay rates to vary over time.
The initial revenues of a patent R0. will decay as the patent ages
because of competitive pressures, but they may also experience some
growth as the relevant market expands. The net decay rate will reflect
both    of these factors. To allow for this, we use the specification

dt.
         (1 —                = (1   —
                                        S)exp{0g.         + 1D1+2D2} where                     is the rate of

growth   of aggregate               demand (GDP) in year t +           j   and we expect            >

      = 1 if 1960 <           t+j       < 1969 and zero elsewhere, and D2                    1 if

t + j > 1970 and zero otherwise. The time d.mmiy variables     and

are included to capture broad differences in decay rates across decades
which are not reflected in                    annual movements in aggregate demand. Note

that    positive values for                    or        indicate a decline in the rate of
decay    during the 1960's or 1970's relative to the 1950's.

      Finally, in writing down the model in (5) we have ignored any

sampling error in the observations on                          The variance of the sampling

error is given by           —              where              is the number of patents in

cohort j. For cohorts as large as those in the sample (see row 5 in

Table 1), this variance is essentially zero and will not affect the

results. In order to allow for discrepancies between the actual and

predicted values from the model, we follow Ameiniya                        (1981) by specifying
an error term in the renewal rule (4), c÷... Incorporating these various

specifications, the model we actually estimate is

allows for a free sequence of                        (we call this the fixed—effects

model). The null hypothesis that there are no cohort effects                                 =   11

the distribution of the value of patent rights in the post—1950 period

in all countries. A more detailed investigation of these changes is

provided in Section 4•7

      Regression (3) in each panel presents the estimates for the model

which allows both for fixed effects in p and variations in the decay rate.

Note first that the basic parameters of the model (ii, o and 5) all have

the right sign and are statistically significant in all three countries.

The estimates of   indicate that the distribution of initial revenues

exhibits substantial dispersion and skewness in all three countries.

The degree of skewness is illustrated by the ratio of the mean to the

median value of initial revenues, which for the lognormal is given by

e2/2 (Johnson and Kotz 1970, Chapter 14). This ratio varies from 2.86

in Germany to 6.44 in France, indicating a rather sharp skewness to the

right. Intercountry differences in p are inversely correlated with those

in o, so that countries with higher mean returns have lower coefficients

of variation in those returns.8

      The estimates of the rate of decay in the returns from holding

patents in the 1950's is lower in Germany (0.12) than in the U.K. (0.26);

there is no information on renewals in the 1950's for France (see Table

1). Together with the higher mean and lower coefficient of variation in

Germany, this seems to indicate that the relatively stringent German

patent granting procedures are, on the whole, successful in selecting

patents with higher initial returns and lower subsequent decay in those

returns. The estimated coefficients on the decadal dummy variables (

and     provide some tentative evidence that the rate of decay declined

in the 1960's and 1970's. The implied estimate of the rate of decay in
                                                                                 18



the 1970's is 0.17 for the U.K. and 0.11 for Germany, which is closer

to the estimate for France which is also for the 1970's. The hypothesis

we advanced that the rate of decay depends inversely on the rate of

growth of the market ( > 0) receives mixed support from the data. The

point estimates of       have the expected sign in the U.K. and France

though not in Germany, but the null hypothesis that          0 can be rejected

only for the U.K. Moreover, given the magnitudes of         and the market

growth rates, the implied quantitative impact of GDP growth on the decay

rate is small, at least at the economy—wide level of aggregation. On

the whole, the estimates of the decay rate do indicate a fairly rapid

decline in the private returns from holding patents, higher than the rate

of   decay   generally assumed for the physical productivity of traditional

capital goods. This result is not surprising since the decay in the
returns earned from holding patents is not due to any decline in the
physical productivity of the knowledge embodied in them, but rather to
the two related points concerning the market valuation of the innovations
they represent——namely, that it    is   difficult to establish and maintain
effective    proprietary rights over the knowledge and that new inventions

are developed which displace the original one (see Arrow 1962; Pakes and

Schankerman 1964 summarize related evidence on the rate of obsolescence

in the returns to innovation).



4. The Value of Patent Rights

        In this section we use the parameter estimates in Table 2 to

derive    the distribution of the value of patent rights and to examine
empirically changes that have occurred in both the size and quality of
                                                                                                19




cohorts of patents since 1955. The present value of patent protection

for a single patent, denoted by V, is

where Rt —
             C   is the net revenue from holding the patent during age t,

I is the discount rate, 6 is the appropriate decay rate, and T is the

optimal lifespan of the patent as defined in Section 1

The lognorinal distribution on           induces a distribution of these values.

The estimates of the parameters Ii, G, and 6 are used to generate the

quantilesof the distribution of V and their standard errors by

simulating the value distribution.9

      Table 3 presents the distribution of the value of patent rights

for the 1970 cohort in each country. The distributions for the U.K. and

France are based on the returns that accrue to patents which survive

until age five, measured fromage five until the patent is allowed to

lapse. Tvo sets are generated for Germany, one based on age three and

a second (for comparative purposes) rebased at age five. This is done

by treating patents which are cancelled (in the simulation procedure)

before   age five as having zero value and adjusting downward the revenue
stream for all surviving patents by the factor (1 — 6)2.
      The most prominent feature of these distributions is their sharp
skewness. There is a dense concentration of patent rights with very
little economic value. - The median        value   of patent protection is only
$1861 in the U.K., $897 in Prance, and $5710 in Germany. Despite a
substantial rise in the third quantile, only ten percent of all patent

aThe value of patent rights is the discounted sum of net returns from
 age five until the patent lapses, for patents which survive until age
 five, in 1980 U.S. dollars. The discount rate is 0.10 and the
 parameter estimates from Table 2 are used for (li,a,5)——that is,
 (6.36,1.57,.19) for the U.K., (7.51,1.47,.12) for Germany, and
 (5.39,1.93,.l0) for France.

rights are worth more than $16,125 in the U.K., $13,682 in France and

$45,370 in Germany. Most of the value of the stock of patent rights

is concentrated in the tail of the distribution (especially the upper

five percent). The quantiles are estimated with reasonable precision

(standard errors less than half of point estimates), even in the tail.

The general picture of a sharply skewed distribution of the value of

patent rights emerges clearly in all three countries. We noted earlier

that the patent renewal data are the only direct source of information

on the distribution of the value of patent protection. However, the

limited amount of information available on the related distribution of

the value of patented innovations is similar in this respect. The

survey evidence in Sanders, Rossman and Harris (1958), and Grabowski

and Vernon (1983), and the larger—sample econometric evidence in Pakes

(1985) suggest that the distribution of values of patented innovations

is extremely skewed.

      The mean of the discounted sum of returns from age five, among

those patents still in force at age five, is $6,963 in the U.K., $6,656

in France, and $19,124 in Germany. These differences are only partly

a result of intercountry differences in the proportion of patents that

survive until age five (a proportion determined in part by patent

granting procedures). The mean returns from age five among all patents

applied for (in contrast to just those surviving) are $4,735 in the

U.K., $4,792 in France, and $6,502 in Germany.10 Note that these latter

values are almost perfectly proportional to the levels of GDP in the

various countries ($435.2, $457.8, and $623.8 million in the U.K.,

France, and Germany, respectively). The evidence, therefore, is
                                                                            22




consistent with a form of Schmookler's (1966) demand inducement

hypothesis in which differences in the returns from holding patents are

primarily determined by differences in market size.

        An estimate of the total discounted (at ten percent) value of

patent protection from age five for all those patents in the 1970 cohort

can be obtained by multiplying the means provided in the last paragraph

by the number of patents applied for in the 1970 cohort. These estimates

are: $234 million for the U.K., $217.6 million for France, and $381.7

million for Germany. As measures of the total value of patent protection,

these figures are biased downwards since they ignore both the value of

patent protection for those patents which do not survive until age five,

and the value of the first five years of protection for those patents

which do survive. Nevertheless, it would be of interest to compare them

to the R&D costs of producing the patents in the 1970 cohort. Though

the desired R&D figures are not available, we do have the R&D

expenditures made by the business enterprises in each country in 1970

(OECD 1982). The ratio of the value of the patent rights from age five

in these countries to the R&D expenditures of their business enterprises

is .057 in the U.K., .068 in France, and .056 in Germany. This

comparison of our estimates of the total value of patent rights in a

country to that country's R&D costs ignores, in addition to the value

of patent protection prior to age five, various balance of trade and

timing effects." Even so, the figures do suggest two conclusions.

First,   the returns that result from   the proprietary rights created by

the    patent laws seem to be over 5.5 percent of total R&D expenditures.
Of    course, whether a six percent increase in the value of inventions
                                                                              23




represents a quantitatively important stimulus to R&D effort depends on

the response elasticity of R&D investment to such incentives——a topic

beyond the scope of this paper. The second conclusion is that the bulk

of the returns from R&D investments do not seem to result from the

ability of R&D performers to obtain patents. It is worth emphasizing,

however, that these are aggregate results and the relative importance of

patent protection may differ across sectors of the economy.'2

        One further caveat is in order here. We noted that the results

indicate that much of the total value of the patent rights in a cohort

of   patents   is concentrated in the tail of the value distribution. Since

the patents in this tail are those which are renewed until the statutory

limit to patent lives, our only nonparametric information on their values

results from the behavioral assumption that they would not be renewed at

the statutory limit unless their current returns were greater than the

costs of renewal. Our model imputes exact values to these patents by

extrapolating the estimated lognormal distribution. As noted earlier,

the lognormal distribution did fit the observed renewal data better than

the other distributions we tried (see note 5), but we used a global

measure of fit which may not reflect closeness of fit in the tail. Of

course we can never compare fits for that part of the tail we do not

observe, but we can examine the robustness of our conclusions to

dropping the renewal information in the neighborhood of the expiration

date. This corresponds to asking what would have happened if we had

less information on the-tail than we did in fact have.'3 Dropping the

last   one, two, and three ages results in a change of the estimate of the
mean value of the U.K. distribution from $6,963, to $6,686, $7,296, and
                                                                                  24



$9,176, respectively. The corresponding changes for the French means

are from $6,656, to $6,301, $6,401, and $6,696; and for Germany from

$19,124 to $17,363, $17,176, and $18,094. None of these differences

alters the qualitative nature of the conclusions drawn above.

characteristics of cohorts of patents between 1955 and 1975. It provides

the estimates of the mean value of patent protection from age five for
patents that survive until age five (V), and the estimates of the total

value of patent protection from age five (V). This table makes it clear

that there are striking differences between the changes that occur over

time in the number of patents in a cohort, and those that occur in the

value of the patent rights embodied in those cohorts. Regardless of

whether PA or P5 is used as .a measure of quantity, we find that in all

countries (though to varying degrees) the number of patents increased

between 1955 and 1965, but then decreased between 1965 and 1975. In

contrast, the value of the cohorts of patents increased in both ten—year

intervals——and the increase was greatest in the later period in the U.K.

and Germany. The point to stress here is that our estimates imply that

one cannot make inferences on changes in the value of cohorts of patents

during this period from changes in the quantity of patents in those

cohorts, for there have been large (and largely offsetting) changes in

the "quality" (or mean values) of the patents in the cohorts. We return

to this point below.

that PA and P5 move in a similar fashion in all countries (so that either

could be used to follow changes in the quantity of patents) , and that

changes in V over time in each country are quite highly (and positively)

correlated with changes in GDP in the respective countries. The squared

correlation coefficient between changes in log V and those in log GDP

are .92, .55, and .91 for the U.K., Germany and France, respectively.

holding      patents depend primarily on differences in market size receives

some support in the time series (differences within a country over time),

as well as in the cross section (differences across countries), dimensions.

          Our estimates imply that in the U.K. the total value of a cohort

of patents approximately doubled over the twenty year period (GDP

increased by a factor of 1.65 over the same                                 time span). The increase in
the total value index resulted from about equal increases in the quantity

(PA or P5), and the quality (V), indices. A more detailed look at the

underlying data, however, reveals two distinct subperiods for each index.

Between 1955 and 1969 the quantity index moved up rapidly, while the

quality index actually declined somewhat. In 1969 there was a clear

structural break which reversed the direction of change of both indices.

The quantity of patents declined and their quality increased thereafter.

In Germany the total value of a cohort of patents also doubled over the

twenty—year period (GDP increased by a factor of 2.37), but almost the

entire increase resulted from increases in the quality index (the

quantity of patents in a cohort barely changed over the period). There

are also two distinct subperiods in the German data. From 1955 to 1964
                                                                                 27




the quantity of patents increased slightly and there was a barely

perceptible drop in the quality index. After 1964 there was a sharp

increase in the quality index and a small decrease in quantity. In

France the total value of a cohort tripled over the twenty—year period

(GDP increased by a factor of 2.67), and this was a result of roughly

equal increases in the quality and quantity indices. There is also some

indication of two subperiods in the French results, though the break

between them seems to be much less sharp   than   for the UK.   or   Germany.

Both quantity and quality indices move upward fairly smoothly until 1966,

at which point the quantity index begins a slow downward trend and the

quality   index moves upward more sharply (though in a somewhat choppy
fashion).
      We conclude from this evidence that there appears to be        some kind

of structural break in the mid to late 1960's in all three countries.

This shift is characterized by a marked decline in the number of patents

in a cohort and a simultaneous sharp increase in the mean value of the

patent rights of patents in a cohort in the U.K. and Germany (and

possibly in France). A number of authors have noted an apparent world-

wide decline in patenting activity during the 1970's (e.g., Evenson 1984;

Griliches 1984). Evenson (1984) also documents a pervasive decline in

patenting per unit of inventive input since the late 1960's (including

the U.K., France and Germany). He interprets this trend as evidence of

an exhaustion of technological potential, that is, as a decline in the

"real invention per unit of inventive input" (Evenson 1984, p. 108).

However, the evidence in this paper on the rise in the mean value of

patent rights since the late 1960's suggests an alternative, though not
                                                                                 28




mutually exclusive, hypothesis. Part of the decline in patenting per

unit of inventive input may reflect a shift away from "more patentst' to

patents   of "higher quality."


Concluding Remarks
        This paper provides an empirical investigation of the private
value   of patent protection and its changes over time. The approach is

based on a simple model of patent renewal behavior, originally developed

in Pakes and Schankerman (1984 ).      The patent holder makes a decision

each year, until the statutory expiration, whether to renew the patent

on the basis of a comparison of the cost of renewal and the contemporaneous

revenues which accrue to holding the patent. Given an assumed

distribution function for initial revenues and observations on the actual

time path of patent renewals and fees, the model delivers empirical

estimates of the parameters of the distribution function of initial

revenues and the rate of decay of these revenues. These parameters can

then be used to generate the distribution of the value of patent rights.

The empirical application of the model is based on a lognormal distribution

of initial revenues and a comprehensive data set covering essentially all

patent applications made during the post—1950 period in the U.K., France

and Germany.

        The   qualitative characteristics of the empirical results that
emerge from this study can be suuiniarized quite succinctly. First,    the

distribution    of the value of patent rights is   sharply skewed in all three

countries.     There is a concentration of patent rights with very little

private   economic value, but the tail of the distribution contains highly
                                                                              29



valuable patent rights. Second, the private rate of decay in revenues

is quite high, and there is some evidence that it declined during the

1960's and 1970's. Third, the aggregate value of patent rights, though

large in absolute terms, appears to be less than ten percent of the

domestic R&D expenditures of the business enterprises in these countries.

Though this finding suggests that at the aggregate level patent

protection is a relatively small component of the incentive structure

underlying private R&D investments, it does not necessarily imply that

patent protection is an ineffective stimulus to R&D.

        Finally, there have been substantial changes over time in both the

number of patents applied for annually, and in the mean value of the

patent rights that accrue to them. Moreover, the variation in the

quantity of patents in different cohorts tended to be negatively related

to the variation in their mean values, implying that exclusive reliance

on patent counts as an indicator of inventive output can be quite

misleading. In particular, there appears to have been a sharp structural

break during the mid    to   late 1960's, after which the number of patents

began to fall but the "quality" of the patents that were applied for rose
substantially.. Our estimates indicate that once the movements in quality
are accounted for, the total value of patent rights increased rather
than declined.
        The methodology and empirical results provided here suggest that,
at least in countries with renewal fees, it is both feasible and
important to incorporate explicit measures of the "quality" of patents
in measures of inventive output based on patent variables. The next
important   step   is to analyze   the empirical characteristics and the
                                                                      30




theoretical determinants of variation in the quality dimension at a

more disaggregated level, among different industries, and between

different types of patents.

      1. For a more complicated model which allows agents to be uncertain

about the {R} sequence see Pakes        (1984).   It should be noted, however,

that our model does not assume that the rate of decay in the sequence

{R.} is exogenous to the firm's decision making process. In a dynamic

context, a firm    possessing   an innovation has   to   choose between increasing

present    revenues and inducing entry, and charging smaller royalties to
forestall entry. This choice is the basis of Gaskins' (1971) dynamic
limit pricing analysis of situations involving temporary monopoly power.
Gaskins' model can be used to show that the optimal revenue stream

declines in age, a condition assumed below.

      2. One interesting generalization of this model would be to allow

for differences in decay rates across patents and to estimate the

parameters of the joint distribution of the value of initial returns and

the decay rates. The assumption of a coon decay rate on the output of

inventive activity, however, is used frequently in the empirical

literature, and one advantage of our approach is that one can compare

the estimates provided in this paper to the values assumed in that

literature.

         4. The French data do not contain the renewal proportion at age

five for the cohorts 1951—1965, since they cover only the later ages.

To obtain estimates of P .
                           5J
                                for   these cohorts, we first ran a linear

regression of P5 against the exogenous variables included in the model

(see equation (6) below) using the remaining cohorts 1966—1976. The

estimated parameters were then used to generate predictions of P5, P5,

for cohorts 1950—1965, using the actual values of the exogenous variables

for those cohorts. The normalization was then conducted with P ..              Given
                                                                       5J
the nonlinear form of the dependent variable in the final estimating

equation (see (6) below), this two—stage procedure is not fully

consistent but there is no alternative if we wish to exploit the French

data.

         5. The comparison between the alter-native specifications was

based on two different measures of statistical fit suggested by Amemiya

(1981): the stml of squared differences between           and      where

is the estimate of        implied by the estimates of the parameters of the

relevant model; and the weighted sum       of squares   using as a weight the

binomial sampling variance of           about its true value          —

where N. is the number of patents on cohort j.          The comparisons were

made    both for the fixed effects and the no—effects model (see the
                                                                                     33



discussion below). The logriormal specification fit the data best in all

three countries.

      6. Two points should be noted. First, Ainemiya's (1981) suggestion

of superimposing the error E. which is presumed to be independently

distributed is not, strictly speaking, consistent with the model since

the sequence 1(1 —
                      P)    is (by construction) nondecreasing in t. We

use Amemiya's procedure and ignore this problem in the results we present

because the estimate of the variance of E. is too small for one to
                                                 U

think correction for the problem would have a significant effect on the

parameter estimates. Second, note that since we have data only on the

cohorts rather than on individual patents, any patent—specific

disturbance (such as an optimization error in the renewal rule) is

subsumed in the distribution function.

      7. Two remarks are in order. First, we tested a random effects

specification of the p's by comparing the within—cohort and between—

cohort parameter estimates for the model with a constant decay rate (see

Hausman   and Taylor, 1981). The hypothesis of random effects is rejected
decisively in all three countries. Second, we tried summarizing the
full set of cohort fixed effects as       a   linear or quadratic trend over
time, i.e., p   = p + a0j   +
                                a1j2   where p   represents   the value for the
initial cohort. This specification is rejected formally by the data
(computed F statistics about six), but the overall trends in the

individual   p's are reflected by the estimates. In the U.K. and Germany

the quadratic fits much better than the linear trend. The point

estimates (standard errors) for the U.K. are p =          6.47   (.22), cx = —.048

(.013) and      = .0022 (.0005); for Germany, p = 7.01 (.13), c = —.0073
                                                                                 34




(.011), cx1 =   .0016 (.0004). In both countries the implied 1i!s first

decline and then rise. In France one cannot reject the linear trend as

against the quadratic. The estimates are p =    4.53   (.22) and        = .044

(.01).

         8. The estimate of p for Germany is not directly comparable to

those for the U.K. and France since it is based on renewals from age

three. Naking the adjustment to age five (i.e.,        + ln(1 —   )2)   yields

an estimate of 7.04, which does not alter our conclusion. Note also

that we can estimate the response of patent renewals to the costs of

renewal. The estimate of i/o provides the response of y. = _1(1 —

to   increases in costs. The estimates in the table imply that a one

percent increase in renewal fees decreases the proportion renewed by

about .02 percentage points. (This is based on derivatives evaluated

at sample means, but the figure does not vary much across ages or

countries.) Of course, to obtain the elasticity of P with respect to

costs we have to divide .02 by P, and this will vary with age.

         9. We draw 50,000 pseudo—random variables from a lognormal

distribution with the estimated values of p and G,     calculate   V for each

of then, and then derive the quantiles of the implied distribution of V.

The process is repeated three more times, each time perturbing one of

the estimated parameters (p, o, and 6) by one percent. This provides

numerical estimates of the derivatives of each of the quantiles with

respect to the parameters, which are used with the estimated covariance

matrix of the parameter estimates to calculate the (asymptotic) standard

errors of each of the quantiles.
                                                                           35



      10. These   means are measured by multiplying the mean value of

patents   surviving to age five by the proportion of all applications
which reach age five.
      11.   Not all of the returns to the patents in force in a given

country accrue to nationals of that country, and business enterprises in

a given country also earn   returns from   patents in force elsewhere.

Noreover, there is some lag between R&D expenditures and patentable

output (though the mean lag does not appear to be long; see Pakes and

Schankerman 1984). It is worth noting that the ratios presented in the

text are insensitive to the choice of cohort. The figures for the U.K.,

France and Germany in 1965 are .062, .087 and .067 respectively; for

1975 they are .085, .055 and .071.

      12. In an important study of the British patent system based on

extensive survey data, Taylor and Silberston (1973) conclude that patent

protection is for the most part not an important component of the

incentive structure inducing R&D investment, but there are some notable

exceptions (e.g., chemicals and pharmaceuticals). Also see Mansfield,

Schwartz and Wagner (1981).

      13. We are grateful to Robin Sickles for this suggestion.
