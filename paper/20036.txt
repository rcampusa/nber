                                                ABSTRACT

We examine the relationship between the diffusion of advanced internet technology and the geographic
concentration of invention, as measured by patents. First, we show that patenting became more concentrated
from the early 1990s to the early 2000s and, similarly, that counties that were leaders in patenting
in the early 1990s produced relatively more patents by the early 2000s. Second, we compare the extent
of invention in counties that were leaders in internet adoption to those that were not. We see little difference
in the growth rate of patenting between leaders and laggards in internet adoption, on average. However,
we find that the rate of patent growth was faster among counties who were not leaders in patenting
in the early 1990s but were leaders in internet adoption by 2000, suggesting that the internet helped
stem the trend towards more geographic concentration. We show that these results are largely driven
by patents filed by distant collaborators rather than non-collaborative patents or patents by non-distant
collaborators, suggesting low cost long-distance digital communication as a potential mechanism.

    1. Introduction

        Vannevar Bush’s publication Science: The Endless Frontier frames a range of questions about the

localization of information, and about how the costs of knowledge transmission, dissemination, and

collaboration increase in distance (Jaffe, Trajtenberg, and Henderson 1993; Glaeser, Kerr, and Ponzetto

2010; Delgado, Porter, and Stern 2008; Saxenian 1994, etc.). Over the years this conceptualization has

motivated a range of research questions about the collocation of inventive activity. The creation and

maintenance of geographic clusters of invention, and their links to regional economic growth, have been

an important part of innovation policy.

        In the years since the publication of that book, several factors have potentially altered the

importance of agglomeration for inventive activity. First, globalization and the vertical disintegration of

supply chains—inwhich increasingly many different companies manufacture the components that make

up a final product—has increased the premium on invention as a source of regional competititiveness,

thereby reinforcing pre-existing differences in the geographic distribution of invention. Second, declines

in communications costs—engendered by the widespread diffusion of the internet—have substantially

reduced the cost of certain kinds of communication, leading to changes in the geographic distribution of

innovation and invention (Agrawal and Goldfarb 2008; Forman and van Zeebroeck 2012). These two

changes push in opposite directions.

        In this chapter, we ask whether invention, as measured in patent data, has become more

geographically concentrated between the early 1990s and the early 2000s. We address this topic in

order to explore the overall net effect of the two forces pushing for or against geographic agglomeration

of invention. We also explore the potential role of internet technology in explaining this pattern. Either

an increase or decrease in the geographic concentration of invention is possible. By increase in

concentration, we mean that the places that served as the location for the majority of the inventions in

the past serve as a source for an even greater share in the future. The places rich with inventions


                                                                                                         2
become richer. By decrease, we mean the opposite, that the places that are not rich with invention

become richer.

        This chapter builds on our research agenda examining how the diffusion of the internet altered

the geographic concentration of activity (Forman, Goldfarb and Greenstein 2002, 2005, 2008, 2012). The

approach of this study resembles our approach in Forman, Goldfarb, and Greenstein (2012), which

examined how geographic variation in business internet adoption shaped US wage growth over the late

1990s. This chapter examines a different outcome, and, hence, a different question, namely, whether

those counties that were leading innovators (as measured by patents) between 1990 and 1995

increased or decreased their relative rate of patenting between 2000 and 2005. Then we explore how

internet adoption correlates with this change, and whether it increases or decreases the rate of

concentration in patenting.

        We undertake this exercise with the view that economic theory does not give clear guidance to

the expected result. There are good reasons to expect the internet to have increased the geographic

concentration of invention or to have decreased it.

        On the side of increasing concentration: The literature on the economics of IT often finds a

localization of the adoption of IT (Forman, Goldfarb, Greenstein (2008) and Forman and Goldfarb (2006)

reviews the literature). The effective use of advanced internet technology draws on frontier IT skills that

are found disproportionately in urban areas, and it builds on existing links between business use of IT,

support services, and specialized labor markets in urban areas. Furthermore, while the internet reduces

communication costs for both local and distant communication, most communication and most social

contacts are local (Wellman 2001, Hampton and Wellman 2002). Much of the literature on internet

adoption and usage, including much of our own prior work, shows a high geographic concentration of

economic activity in the areas where the internet is most frequently adopted (Blum and Goldfarb 2006;

Sinai and Waldfogel 2004; Forman, Goldfarb, and Greenstein 2005; Kolko 2002; Glaeser and Ponzetto


                                                                                                         3
2007; Arora and Forman 2007; Forman, Goldfarb, and Greenstein 2012; Agrawal, Catalini, and Goldfarb

2011; etc.).

        On the side of decreasing concentration: the internet is a communications technology, and it

can allow people in isolated areas to plug in to the rest of the economy. Communications scholars and

others have long argued that the internet might overcome geographic barriers to economic (and

political) activities. Cairncross (1997) and Friedman (2005) provide popular summaries of these ideas,

emphasizing the “death of distance” and the “flat world”. Moreover, in the specific context of

knowledge production and invention, the internet can reduce collaboration costs and, potentially, the

importance of collocation in inventive activity. The empirical literature also has some findings suggesting

that the internet might increase cross-institutional and cross-regional collaboration over time (Jones,

Wuchty, and Uzzi 2008; Agrawal and Goldfarb 2008; Ding, Levin, Stephan, and Winkler 2012). The

setting most closely resembling the one we study in this chapter (Forman and van Zeebroeck, 2012) also

shows that internet adoption leads to increased distant collaboration for patents issued to researchers

in a given multi-establishment firm.

        Our findings generally favor the view that the internet worked against the concentration of

invention. Studying the growth rate of patenting across counties, we show this in several steps. First, we

show that invention became more geographically concentrated over this period, suggesting a general

trend towards increasing concentration of invention. Specifically, our raw data suggest that patenting

grew 27% during this period. For the top quartile of patenting counties from 1990-95, patenting grew

50%. For those below the median, patenting did not grow at all. We highlight differences between our

setting and findings and a line of research which has found convergence in economic growth rates

across countries and geographic regions (e.g., Barro and Sala-i-Martin 1991; Magrini 2004; Delgado,

Porter, and Stern 2010, 2012). While differences between our results and this research line may reflect

differences in our measure of local economic activity (patents v. economic output or wage growth), we


                                                                                                         4
also show that our findings are driven in particular by substantial increases in the concentration of

patenting at the very top of the distribution.

        We next demonstrate how county-level growth in patenting is shaped by business internet

adoption and the prior concentration of patents. While the geographic concentration of patenting

increased over the time period we study, the internet appears to have mitigated, rather than

exacerbated, that trend. In particular, the overall concentration of invention rose but, among counties

that were leading internet adopters, we see little change in the concentration of invention.

Furthermore, our results suggest that this relationship is strongest for long-distance collaboration.

Although it is important to recognize that we cannot rule out the possibility that an omitted factor

caused both internet adoption and growth in patenting in the set of internet-adopting counties with

that were behind in patenting in the early 1990s, our results are more consistent with the internet

reducing the geographic concentration of invention than with the internet increasing that

concentration.

        To summarize, our chapter provides evidence about the net effects of opposing factors that

have influenced the concentration of inventive activity since the publication of Bush’s book. We

highlight the effects of the Internet. Recent literature has shown that scientific collaboration across

institutions has increased over time and that IT is partly responsible. We contribute the first direct

evidence that the diffusion of the internet is correlated with a reduction in the geographic concentration

of inventive activity, suggesting that the diffusion of the internet has the potential to weaken the

longstanding importance of the geographic localization of innovative activity. Our results also raise

intriguing questions about whether the internet’s impact on the geographic concentration of invention

is distinct from its impact on the geographic concentration of other economic activity, such as wages,

business adoption of IT, hospital productivity, and so on. That is, the internet may be a force for




                                                                                                        5
weakening the links between the geography of inventive activity and the geography of other economic

activity.



    2. Data

            We use a variety of data sources to examine how adoption of advanced internet among firms

will affect local inventive activity. We match data on IT investment from the Harte Hanks Market

Intelligence Computer Intelligence Database with patent data from the USPTO between 1990 and 2005.

We further combine this with data from the US decennial Census. Our sample construction is shaped by

key features of our data and the setting. First, we expect a significant lag between the time when IT

investments are made and when they influence the creation of new invention. Second, there is

significant year-to-year variability in patent output at the county level and particularly at the industry-

county level. Third, as with our prior work, we exploit the historical circumstances that led to the

deployment of the internet. Instead of creating a gradual deployment and adoption, circumstances

created a rather abrupt change in a short time span, leading to a period “before the internet diffused”

and a period “after the internet diffused.” As a result, in our core analyses our base period and

reference period both include six years—that is, we look at the difference in patent output between

1990 and 1995 (before the diffusion of the internet) and 2000 and 2005 (after its diffusion). 1

            2.1 Patent Data

            Our data on local inventive output are measured using patent data from the USPTO. We use

application rather than grant date to measure the timing of inventive activity because the application-

to-grant delay varies over time, and because the application date is closer to the time when the

invention occurred. 2



1
  We have experimented with alternative specifications for the base and reference years. Our results are robust to these
changes, though we do sometimes lose significance for some results in some years.
2
  See, for example, Griliches (1990).

                                                                                                                      6
          To measure the effect that internet adoption will have on local inventive activity, we match

patents to counties using inventor locations. 3 For patents with multiple inventors that reside in multiple

counties, we allocate patents to all of the counties where inventors reside. We use county as the unit of

observation rather than MSA to facilitate comparison with prior work that has studied the implications

of internet investment on local economic outcomes (Forman, Goldfarb, and Greenstein 2012). Our

procedure will accurately assign patent output to the correct county to the extent that inventors work

where they reside, but may make some errors in assignment when inventors commute between

counties. 4

          In our analyses we use a combination of raw patent counts and five year citation-weighted

patents as our measure of inventive output. As is well known, not all inventions meet the U.S. Patent

and Trademark Office (USPTO) criteria for patentability (Jaffe and Trajtenberg 2002). Further, inventors

must make an explicit decision to patent an invention, rather than relying on some other method to

appropriate the value of their invention. There will be incremental inventive activity that is not patented

and therefore is not reflected in patent statistics (e.g., Cohen, Nelson, and Walsh 2000). However, so

long as the propensity of firms in a location to patent does not vary significantly over time in a way that

is correlated with internet adoption, this should not bias our estimates of the key parameters of

interest. It is also well known that patent values are very skewed. Weighting by citations is one way to

address this problem; citation-weighted patents have been shown to be correlated with a firm’s stock

market value above and beyond the information provided by patent counts (Hall, Jaffe, and Trajtenberg

2005).

          Our baseline analyses explore whether internet adoption is associated with changes in the

growth of total patents and citation-weighted patents over time. However, we also explore how our

3
 Specifically, we match the city and state of the inventor location to ZIP codes, and then match the ZIP codes to counties.
4
  We also believe that using inventor locations, which is often the location of their residence, is superior to the alternative of
using the location of the assignee, which is the location of a firm or corporate building in the vast majority of patents. The latter
does not necessarily correspond with the location of the invention, particularly in corporations that assign all patents to
headquarters, irrespective of their origins.

                                                                                                                                   7
results vary by county-industry group. To do this, we utilize the 2011 USPTO concordance between

patent classes and NAICS manufacturing industries. 5 In these analyses, our unit of analysis is county-

industry-year rather than county-year. To facilitate comparisons between our county and county-

industry analyses, all of our patents have a primary class that can be mapped to NAICS using the 2011

concordance. Thus, our measures of patent growth will miss some inventive activity that cannot be used

downstream in manufacturing.

          We perform several additional analyses over different subsets of the patent data. First, we re-

estimate our models over the set of patents with more than one inventor. We label these as

collaborative patents. Second, we define distant collaborative patents as ones in which there exists a

pair of inventors for whom the distance between the centroids of the inventors’ home counties are

greater than 50 miles apart.

          We further explore differences based upon the type of institution to which the patent is

assigned. We identify educational institutions based upon a search of key phrases in the assignee name

field of the patent. 6 We further use the assignee role field in the patents to identify whether the patent

is from a U.S. private company or corporation or a U.S. government agency. 7 Last, we examine how our

results vary by technological field, using the Hall, Jaffe, Trajtenberg (2001) technology categories.

          A primary question in this paper is whether internet investments by firms contribute to changes

in the distribution of inventive activity. In particular, our interest is in exploring whether internet


5
    For more details on the correspondence, see http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/ido/oeip/taf/data/
naics_conc/2011/read_me.txt. To perform the correspondence, we use the primary USPTO class in the patent document. In
cases where a given USPTO class is related to several industries, we weight the patent equally across the industries to which it is
related.
6
  Specifically, we define educational institutions as those which have any of the following phrases in the assignee name (not
case sensitive): “university”; “institute of technology”; “college”; “school of medicine”; “school of mines”; “school of
engineering”; and some permutations on these phrases. Further, we identified several specific research active institutions for
which these key words were not accurate predictors of educational status. As a result, we also added the following phrases:
“georgia tech”; “cornell research foundation”; “wisconsin alumni”; “board of regents for education”; “oregon graduate center”;
“iowa state research foundation”; and “board of governors for higher education, state of rhode island”
7
  We also explored whether our results differed for private firms who were small (below 500 employees) and large using the
small entity status field on USPTO data on maintenance fee payments. We found that many of our main results were
qualitatively similar for small and larger entities, though the economic magnitudes were somewhat weaker among small firms.

                                                                                                                                 8
investments have contributed to more or less concentration in outcomes. To facilitate this, we construct

measures of the total number of patents in the county between 1990 and 1995 to measure

concentration in innovative activity prior to the diffusion of the internet.

         2.2 Information Technology Data

         As mentioned above, our IT data come from the Harte Hanks Market Intelligence Computer

Intelligence Database (hereafter CI database). 8 9 The database contains rich establishment- and firm-

level data including the number of employees, the number of personal computers and servers, and

adoption of internet applications. Harte Hanks collects these data to resell to the marketing divisions of

technology companies. Interview teams survey establishments throughout the calendar year; our

sample contains the most current information as of December 2000.

         Harte Hanks tracks over 300,000 establishments in the U.S. We exclude government, military,

and nonprofit establishments because the availability of advanced internet for these establishments and

the relationship between advanced internet adoption and patent output may be different than for

private firms. Our sample contains nonfarm business establishments with over 100 employees, and

includes a total of 86,879 establishments. Prior work has demonstrated that these data are among the

best establishment-level data about the use of IT in the US, and include half of all establishments with

100 or more employees in the US (Forman, Goldfarb, and Greenstein 2005). While our sample includes

only relatively large establishments, this is not a significant problem because very few small

establishments adopted advanced internet technology during this time.

         The construction of our measure of advanced internet is identical to that used in our previous

study of the effects of advanced internet adoption on local wage growth (Forman, Goldfarb, and

Greenstein 2012). It includes those facets of internet technology that became available after 1995 in a

8
  These data have been used in a variety of previous studies (including our own) studying the adoption of IT (Bresnahan and
Greenstein 1997; Forman, Goldfarb, and Greenstein 2005), the productivity of IT investments (Bresnahan, Brynjolfsson, and Hitt
2002; Brynjolfsson and Hitt 2003; Bloom, Sadun, and Van Reenen 2012), and the effects of IT investments on local wage growth
(Forman, Goldfarb, and Greenstein 2012).
9
  This section draws heavily from Forman, Goldfarb, and Greenstein (2012).

                                                                                                                            9
variety of different uses and applications. The raw data in the CI database include at least 20 different

specific applications, from basic internet access to software for internet-enabled enterprise resource

planning (ERP) business applications.

         Our measure of advanced internet adoption involves investment in frontier technologies, often

with significant adaptation costs. As we have done in our prior work, we use substantial investments in

e-commerce or e-business to identify advanced internet investment. Specifically, we looked for evidence

of investment in two or more of the following internet-based applications: ERP, customer service,

education, extranet, publications, purchasing, and technical support. Not all of these applications are

directly involved in the production of new inventions, however all support intra- or inter-establishment

communication and coordination, and often involve significant changes to business processes. Our

measure of advanced internet investment should be viewed as a proxy for a firm’s propensity to invest

in frontier IT that facilitates communication and collaboration, rather than a direct measure of IT

investments that are used as part of the production process in science. As a result, it is possible this will

generate some attenuation bias in our estimates. 10

         We aggregate our establishment-level indicators of advanced internet investment to the county

to obtain location-level measures of the extent of advanced internet investment. Because the

distribution of establishments over industries may be different in our sample of firms from that of the

population, as we have done in prior work we weight the number of establishments in our database

using the number of establishments by two-digit NAICS industry in the Census Bureau’s 1999 County

Business Patterns data.

         This measure has several attractive properties. 11 For one, industry-level measures of this

variable correlate with Bureau of Economic Analysis measures of industry-level differences in IT



10
   Unfortunately, the CI database collects little information on applications that directly facilitate knowledge sharing or
knowledge management. See Forman and van Zeebroeck (2012) for further details.
11
   Here we summarize some highlights. For further details, see Forman, Goldfarb, and Greenstein (2012).

                                                                                                                        10
investments. The measure also highlights significant regional differences in advanced internet use

(Forman, Goldfarb, and Greenstein 2005). Advanced internet adoption is high in locations that include

internet-intensive and IT-intensive industries, such as the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, Denver, and

Houston. In such regions, advanced internet adoption is high even for establishments that are not

producing in traditionally IT-intensive industries.

            As noted above, variance in our IT measure will come from differences in adoption rates among

large nonfarm business establishments at the county level. Because we do not directly measure the IT

investment behavior of public and educational institutions, our analyses of the effects of IT investment

on patenting behavior in these institutions must be treated with some caution.

       2.3 Controls

            We combine these IT and patent data with additional county-level information from a variety of

sources. First, we use information from the 1990 US Census on population, median income, and

percentage of population with a university education, high school education, below the poverty line,

African American, and above 64 years old. We further use the 2000 US Census to control for changes in

factors such as population and change in percent African American, university education, high school

education, and over 64 years old. We obtain county-level information on additional factors that will

influence the propensity of a county to innovate such as enrollment in Carnegie tier 1 research

universities in 1990; the fraction of students enrolled in engineering programs; and the 1990 percentage

of the county’s workforce in professional occupations. 12 To control for differences in growth rates based

on the scale of economic activity, we also include controls for employment, establishments, and weekly

wages in the country from 1999 County Business Patterns Data.

            Table 1 provides the descriptive statistics. While our Census data include the population and

demographic data of over 3100 counties, as in our prior work we drop several hundred counties for

which we have no IT data. Generally, these are very low population counties with few firms and patents.

There are 2734 counties for which we have IT data. There are also some counties that we drop from our

analysis because there are no patents in either the 1990-95 or 2000-05 period, though results are robust

to assuming that these are zero growth counties. If there are no patents in both periods, we set growth

in patenting to zero. Across our different dependent variables we have between 2519 and 2854

observations. As a result, we have between 2235 and 2833 observations in our combined IT- and patent

data set.

         The top part of table 1 shows the average percent change in our dependent variable across

different categories. The average percent change is decreasing for some variables. Because these

variables are the average of the percent changes across counties, this does not mean that total

patenting in the US for that category is decreasing. Some counties in our data have a large percent

change but, due to their small size, do not have a large impact on the total amount of patenting.

    3. Empirical strategy and results

         Our empirical analysis proceeds in four steps. First, we establish the relationship between

patent levels in the 1990-95 period and growth in patenting between 1990-95 and 2000-05. We show an

increased concentration in patenting. Second, we show that there is no significant relationship between

advanced internet adoption by firms and growth in patenting. Third, we show that the relationship

between prior patent levels and growth in patenting is weaker for counties with high levels of internet

adoption. Fourth, we demonstrate that the effect of internet on weakening the trend to increased

geographic concentration of patenting is driven by changes in distant collaborative patents and private

firms.



3.1 Increased concentration of patenting




                                                                                                     12
          Figure 1 shows a Lorenz curve for patenting by county comparing 1990-95 to 2000-05. The size

of the area under the 45 degree line measures the degree of inequality across counties in their

patenting behavior. As the curve moves away from the 45 degree line, it suggests that the geographic

concentration of patenting rises in general. Thus, the curve suggests that patenting was somewhat more

geographically concentrated in the 2000-05 period than in the 1990-95 period.

          Table 2 shows that the increase in concentration is influenced by a substantial increase in

concentration at the very top of the distribution, with the top 0.1% of counties (i.e. the top three

counties) showing a particularly large increase in the share of patents. That finding suggests that we

should make inferences with some caution, as this finding depends on the performance in a very small

number of locations. We can have more confidence in the inference since, as noted above, other

evidence points in a similar direction. Overall patenting grew 27% during this time period. This suggests

that patenting increased in the top 30th percentile of the distribution of patenting. It stayed roughly the

same between the 30th-70th percentiles, and fell for the remainder of counties.

          In Table 3, we show the related result that those counties that had a large number of patents in

the 1990-95 period had a relatively large increase in their level of patenting. In particular, column 1

contains the following regression:

          (1)     Log(Patentsi0005)- Log(Patentsi9095) =α+γXi+β1Patentsi9095+εi,

          Where Patentsi9095 and Patentsi0005 are the number of cumulative patents in county i from 1990-

95 and 2000-2005, Xi is a vector of controls including county-level business and demographic data (as

listed in Table 1), and εi is a normal i.i.d. error. The positive and significant coefficient in the first row

shows that those counties with higher levels of patenting from 1990-95 had higher rates of patent

growth.




                                                                                                           13
         The remaining columns of the table show robustness to various alternative specifications.

Column 2 weights the patents by citations over five years. Columns 3 and 4 use only collaborative

patents to define the dependent variable. 13

         Columns 5 through 8 show robustness to switching the unit of observation to the industry-

county. This enables the analysis to account for differences across industries in where agglomeration

takes place. The industry-level data is challenging to work with as there are many zeros. Therefore, the

simple logged difference growth equation cannot be used as it will lead to many missing observations. In

addition, the data are highly skewed, with a long positive tail and a fatter-than-normal negative tail in

the difference. Instead of the logged difference, we use an ordered probit, splitting the dependent

variable into nine groups: (∞,-5), [-5,-2), [-2,-1), [-1,0), 0, (0,1], (1,2], (2,5], (5, ∞). The results show that

this alternative specification does not yield qualitatively different results: Those counties that were

leading in patenting from 1990-95 had relatively rapid growth in patenting.

         The controls also yield some interesting, though perhaps unsurprising, correlations. The level of

education, and changes in the level of education, are strongly and positively correlated with growth in

patenting. In addition, the fraction of the local students in engineering is highly correlated with growth

in patenting. An increased population is associated with increased growth in patenting while an

increased elderly population is associated with decreased growth in patenting.

         To summarize, these results suggest that regions where patenting had previously been

concentrated experienced the greatest increase in patent growth between the early 1990s and early

2000s. That is interesting because these findings differ qualitatively from findings on the literature on

regional growth and convergence (e.g., Barro and Sala-i-Martin 1991; Magrini 2004; Delgado, Porter,

and Stern 2010, 2012), which have documented evidence of convergence in aggregate growth rates

across countries and regions in a range of settings. There may be several reasons for this difference in

13
  We maintain total patents 1990-95 as the key covariate as we believe the key measure is the rate of overall patenting in the
pre-period. That said, results are robust to using collaborative patents as the key covariate.

                                                                                                                          14
findings. Our focus is on growth in patenting rather than growth in economic output or wages. Further

and related, our results are particularly influenced by increases in the concentration of inventive activity

at the very top of the patenting distribution, a result that may have no analog for other measures of

economic activity, such as wage growth. In addition, recent work has found that the presence of clusters

of related industries may have a significant impact on growth in employment and patenting (Delgado,

Porter, and Stern 2010, 2012). These clusters may have been particularly influential in influencing the

top tail of the distribution of inventive activity over our sample. We stress these different effects,

because it highlights the open question motivating our study. There are different mechanisms at work,

and they push in different directions, and it is important to know whether they operate to the same

degree and direction on all economic activity.

        3.2 Business adoption of the internet and growth in patenting

        Before assessing whether the internet might enhance or reduce the rate of concentration in

patenting, it is important to establish the baseline relationship between internet adoption and growth in

patenting. Table 4 shows that there is no significant correlation between internet adoption and growth

in patenting overall and a weakly significant correlation for collaborative patents. Column (1) shows the

results of the following regression:

    (2) Log(Patentsi i0005)- Log(Patentsi9095) =α+γXi+β2AdvancedInterneti+εi,

        Where AdvancedInterneti measures the extent of advanced internet investment by businesses in

county i in 2000. Columns (2) through (8) mirror the columns in Table 3, and while the coefficients are

positive, there is no significance in any of the non-collaborative patent specifications. In this table, and

in all remaining tables, we do not report the coefficients on the controls because they are not the focus

on the analysis and the signs and significance are similar to those found in Table 3.




                                                                                                         15
     3.3 Business adoption of the internet and the concentration of patenting

          Table 5 examines whether internet adoption increases or reduces the rate of concentration in

patenting. Column (1) shows the results of the following regression:

     (3) Log(Patentsi0005)- Log(Patentsi9095) =α+γXi+β1Patentsi9095+β2AdvancedInterneti

                                                          +β3Patentsi9095 AdvancedInterneti +εi,

The core coefficient of interest is β3, the interaction between pre-period patenting and internet

adoption. The result suggests that internet adoption is correlated with a reduction in the growth in

concentration of patenting (as measured by the correlation between growth in patenting and patenting

in the pre-period). The quantitative importance is not apparent from the coefficient, so we separately

calculate the implied marginal effect. It suggests that an increase in advanced internet by one standard

deviation reduces the increase in concentration by 57%, which is quite substantial. In other words,

among counties that were leaders in internet adoption, the rate of patent growth between the early

1990s and the early 2000s is only weakly correlated with the level of patenting in the 1990 to 1995

period.

          Put another way, for a county in the 25th percentile of internet adoption, moving from the 25th

percentile in patenting to the 90th percentile in patenting in the early 1990s yields an implied increase in

the growth of patenting of 5.4 percent. For a county in the 75th percentile of internet adoption, the

same move yields an implied increase in patenting of 2.3 percent. For a county in the 90th percentile of

internet adoption, the same move yields an implied increase in patenting of just 0.4 percent. 14 Thus,

internet adoption is correlated with a reduction in this divergence: High internet adopting locations that

were not leaders in patenting did not fall behind.




14
  The increase estimated from the regression is substantially smaller than might be suggested by the descriptive statistics
presented in the introduction because the regressions include controls for county-level demographics that are highly correlated
with growth in patenting, such as education and population growth.

                                                                                                                           16
        As in Tables 2 and 3, the alternative specifications in Columns 2 through 8 are broadly consistent

with column 1. The qualitative results are similar if patents are weighted by five year citation rates, if

only collaborative patents are used, and if the unit of observation is the county-industry.

        One potential concern with this analysis is that AdvancedInterneti and Patentsi9095 are highly

correlated and therefore the interaction term captures an unusual part of the distribution. Figure 2

addresses this concern. It presents a scatter plot of AdvancedInterneti on the horizontal axis and

Patentsi9095 on the vertical axis. Figure 2 shows that, while AdvancedInterneti and Patentsi9095 are indeed

highly correlated, there is plenty of variation. There are many locations with high levels of

AdvancedInterneti and low levels of Patentsi9095 and there are many with low levels of AdvancedInterneti

and high levels of Patentsi9095.

        Broadly, Table 5 is suggestive that internet overcomes isolation in invention, though we need to

be cautious as it also could be an omitted variable driving both increased invention and increased

internet. Next we provide some suggestive evidence that the internet facilitated communication by

inventors, providing some support for a causal interpretation of Table 5.



3.4 Collaboration, firm type, and local growth in patenting

        Table 6 reproduces the first four columns of Table 5, but with alternative dependent variables.

Instead of measuring patents and collaborative patents, Column 1 looks at the growth in the number of

distant collaborators, as defined in section 2.1. Column 2 looks at the growth in the number of

collaborative patents by county in which none of the collaborators are distant from each other. Column

3 looks at non-collaborative patents. Columns 4 through 6 show the same analysis but with citation-

weighted patents.

        In our previous results we documented that advanced internet adoption was associated with

decreasing concentration in innovative activity. One possible explanation for this result is that advanced


                                                                                                        17
internet adoption made innovative activity in less innovative places relatively more attractive through a

decline in the costs of collaboration. Another possibility is that the internet increased the productivity of

innovative activity in less innovative regions relative to more innovative ones by, for example, more

easily accessing labor, consultants, or ideas developed elsewhere. While we are unable to identify

between these hypotheses, we view the results of Table 6 as suggestive that advanced internet

adoption reduced the extent of geographic concentration for inventions developed through distant

collaborations more than other types of inventions.

        In particular, the internet is primarily a communications technology that reduces the cost of

both distant and local communication, but the impact of patenting by firms is largest for distant

collaborations (Forman and van Zeebroeck 2012). As in Table 5, Columns 1 and 4 (row 3) of Table 6 show

that, for counties with low rates of advanced internet adoption, leading counties in the pre-period

increased distant collaborations much faster than other counties. For counties with high rates of

advanced internet adoption, leading counties in the pre-period did not increase distant collaborations

much faster.

        In contrast, for non-distant collaborations (columns 2 and 5 row 3) and for non-collaborative

patents (columns 3 and 6 row 3) we see no difference between counties with high and low rates of

advanced internet adoption, leading counties in the pre-period, and the increase in patenting. Thus, the

correlation in Table 5 between patenting in the pre-period, advanced internet, and patent growth does

not hold for non-collaborative patents and short-distance collaborative patents even though it holds for

long-distance collaborative patents.

        Because the role of the internet is likely to facilitate distant collaboration, and because prior

work suggested that the internet increased distant patenting between firms (Forman and van Zeebroeck

2012), this suggests that the results of Table 5 may suggest a causal relationship rather than only a




                                                                                                          18
spurious relationship measuring counties that were becoming more innovative overall (and therefore

becoming more innovative in terms of both patenting and internet adoption).

        Table 7 separates patents assigned to US-based private firms, patents assigned to educational

institutions, and patents assigned to governments. Consistent with the suggested mechanism, and

consistent with the fact that our data on advanced internet represents US-based private firms and not

educational institutions or government, our results are strongest for US-based private firms.

        We have conducted a number of additional robustness checks on our main results. While not

shown here to save space, qualitative results are robust to several alternative specifications including

slightly different years, dropping controls, assigning a value of 1 to counties with zero patents in a given

period to avoid dropping missing values, and to using alternative threshold choices for the ordered

probit in the results at the industry-county level.

        3.5 Differences in concentration of patenting across technology categories

        Table 8 shows the results by technology category. We use the 6 broad technology categories

defined by Hall, Jaffe, and Trajtenberg (2001). We find that the results are broadly robust across

categories with the exception of Computers and Communication, which does not display increase

concentration in patenting activity over time. While this finding merits additional investigation, it is

interesting to note the recent findings by Ozcan and Greenstein (2013) of decreasing concentration of

inventive activity among firms in this technology category. We see increased geographic concentration

in patenting across all other technological categories, including Chemical, Drugs & Medical, Electrical

and Electronic, and Mechanical. We see that the interaction of internet is associated with reduced

geographic concentration for these categories too. This is particularly interesting in light of the findings

for Electrical and Electronic industries, the area closest to computing and communications. This suggests

no simple explanation will suffice, not one that stresses simple differences between hardware and

software or upstream and downstream industries. This is another important question for future work.


                                                                                                         19
4   Conclusion

        We have explored the geographic concentration of invention. We first find evidence that

suggests that the geographic concentration of patenting increased from 1990-95 to 2000-05. Overall

patenting grew 27% but patenting in the top quartile of counties grew 50%. While this result seems to

contrast with work in the convergence literature, we emphasize the use of different methods and the

importance of the very top of the patenting distribution in our findings. Then we showed that advanced

internet adoption by businesses works against the general increase in the geographic concentration of

patenting, leading to different experiences across the regions of the United States. We find that the

correlation is strong for distant collaborations and disappears for nearby collaborations and for non-

collaborative patents, which suggests that the internet’s availability and growth drove at least part of

the overall reduction in the growth in concentration of invention.

        As noted above, our analysis helps us understand the net impact of two fundamental changes in

the years since the publication of Vannevar Bush’s Science: The Endless Frontier: (1) globalization and its

implications for innovation and invention as a source of regional competitiveness, and (2) the impact of

the internet and associated reductions in communication and coordination costs. Our results suggest

that while the net effect of these changes on the concentration of innovation is positive, internet

technology has played a role in mitigating this effect.

        Our analysis contains a number of limitations that limit the generalizability of our findings. First,

we study one type of invention, patenting, in a particular time period. The internet might have increased

patenting but not invention, for example by simplifying the process of applying for a patent through

internet lawyers rather than causing any increase in invention per se. Hence, our results beg questions

about whether other measures of invention – e.g., non-patented inventions, new product development,

entrepreneurial founding in technologically intensive markets – follow a similar pattern.


                                                                                                          20
        In addition, and as mentioned, our findings are consistent with two different explanations. First,

it could be the causal explanation, perhaps by allowing relatively isolated inventors to collaborate with

inventors located elsewhere. Second, it could be driven by an omitted variable that caused both

increased patenting and internet adoption. For example, for counties that were not leaders in patenting

in the early 1990s, internet adoption might be a symptom rather than a cause of increased attention to

invention and a growth in the rate of internet adoption by firms. While the results on distant

collaboration vs non-collaborative patents are suggestive, they are not definitive. Hence, our findings

beg questions about how to instrument for internet adoption to identify truly exogenous variation

across the US.

        Notwithstanding these limitations, our results here, combined with prior work on the impact of

the internet on the concentration of economic activity, suggest that the impact can depend on the

particular activity and context being studied. It seems to lead to increased concentration in wages

(Forman, Goldfarb, and Greenstein 2012) and hospital efficiency (Dranove, Forman, Goldfarb, and

Greenstein 2013), but a decreased concentration in retailing (Choi and Bell 2011), and, as suggested

above, in patenting and invention. Those findings also raise intriguing questions about whether the

internet’s impact on the geographic concentration of invention is distinct from its impact on the

geographic concentration of other economic activity, such as wages, business adoption of IT, hospital

productivity, and so on. If that is the case, then the internet could act as a broad force for weakening the

links between the geography of inventive activity and spatial patterns of downstream use of it. We

speculate that such a broad trend, if sustained for a long time period, would manifest in numerous

measurable economic activities. Hence, our findings also motivate questions comparing changes in the

geographic concentration of different parts of the value chain over the very long run.
