                                             ABSTRACT

This note generalizes the Solow-Stiglitz efficiency condition for natural resources to the problem of
fossil fuel extraction with a greenhouse effect. The generalized optimality condition suggests that the
greenhouse effect implies overextraction in the sense of leaving future generations a wrongly composed
wealth portfolio with too few natural resources relative to man-made capital. This judgment is independent
of society's ethical preferences concerning the well-being of future generations.

1. Introduction

A forward-looking society has to solve two fundamental economic problems. It has to decide

how much wealth it wants to transfer from the present to the future and how its wealth

portfolio of natural resources and man-made capital is to be composed, given that natural

resources can be extracted and transformed into capital by means of producing investment

goods. While the analysis of the first decision requires assumptions about society’s

intertemporal preferences including difficult ethical considerations concerning the proper

weight to be given to future generations, the second decision is potentially simpler insofar as

technological efficiency conditions that make use of the principle of Pareto optimality may

suffice.

       For the case of exhaustible natural resources that have zero extraction costs, that serve

as factors of production and that produce no environmental waste, Solow (1974) and Stiglitz

(1974) have solved the wealth composition problem by showing that the speed of resource

extraction should be chosen such that the marginal product of the natural resource grows at a

rate that equals the marginal product of capital. The Solow-Stiglitz condition is a necessary

condition for Pareto optimality because when this condition is satisfied, it is impossible to

increase consumption of man-made goods in one period of time without decreasing it in

another.

       As is well known, the Solow-Stiglitz condition is the market analogue of a rule

derived by Hotelling (1931) which describes the behavior of well-functioning competitive

markets for natural resources with perfect foresight. According to Hotelling’s rule, the price

of the exhaustible resource will grow at a rate that is equal to the market rate of interest, for if

not, wealth maximizing resource owners would shift extraction from periods with low to

periods with high discounted prices until any differences between the discounted prices have

disappeared. Hotelling’s rule coincides with the Solow-Stiglitz efficiency condition when the

market rate of interest equals the marginal product of capital and the price of the natural

                                                 3
resource equals the marginal product of the resource.

       The Solow-Stiglitz condition was derived a quarter of a century ago when the

Meadows report (Meadows et al. 1972) had alerted the world of the problem of the

exhaustibility of natural resources shortly before the 1973 oil crisis. Recently, the Stern report

(Stern et al. 2006) has alerted the world of the huge costs in terms of lost GDP resulting from

the greenhouse effect that the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is causing,

arguing that this effect is “the greatest and widest-ranging market failure ever seen” (p. 1). It

now appears that the greenhouse effect is not just a side aspect of the extraction of fossil fuels

but of paramount importance for the economics of resource extraction. As the stock of carbon

is gradually taken out of the ground, the stock of carbon dioxide accumulates in the air, and

possibly the limited absorption capacity of the latter will slow down the extraction of fossil

fuels more and earlier than the limited availability of the former. There is a double stock

adjustment problem for natural resources, and a triple one in society’s portfolio problem:

Society has to decide on how much man-made capital, how many unused fossil fuels and how

much waste in the form of carbon dioxide it wants to bequeath to future generations.

       This note extends the Solow-Stiglitz efficiency condition to the case of

counterproductive effects resulting from the accumulation of a stock of carbon dioxide in the

atmosphere. In the spirit of the Stern report, global warming is seen as technological problem

that creates measurable damage in terms of lost growth as well as protection and reaction

costs. Think for example of the dykes, the new buildings, the air conditioning and dislocation

costs that a change in the world climate would require. As the protection and reaction cost

reduces the output remaining for investment and consumption, the quality of the environment

in the sense of additional carbon dioxide being absent from the atmosphere can be seen as an

argument of the aggregate production function. The note also incorporates stock-dependent

extraction costs to take account of the fact that the resources lie in different sites with

different site-specific extraction costs. Following Kemp and Long (1980) and Sinn (1981,

                                                4
1984), it is assumed that the sequence of extraction is in the inverse order of the site-specific

extraction costs.

        The problem of economic growth with depletable resources and the accumulation of

waste in the atmosphere has been studied by a number of authors in rich intertemporal

optimization models. See, in particular, Krautkraemer (1985, 1998), Kolstad and

Krautkraemer (1993) and Withagen (1995). While this literature thoroughly analysed the

implications of environmental variables on the growth process and derived interesting

conclusions, it has not explicitly addressed the question of intertemporal Pareto optimality.

Moreover, it typically assumed waste to be an argument of the utility rather than the

production function, to capture the role of environmental amenities. The model used here

comes closer to a special variant of a more general intertemporal setting that Kamien and

Schwartz (1982, p. 58) once described. Kamien and Schwartz treat resource extraction as a

factor of production and include the stock of the accumulated waste as an argument in the

production function. However they do not derive the conditions for Pareto optimality.



2. The Model

Let S be the stock of (reduced, oxidizable) carbon underground, R the current flow of carbon

extraction and P the accumulated stock of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. To keep things

simple, assume a given mix of fossil fuels and hence a given energy output per unit of carbon

or carbon dioxide.1 Assume moreover that a given fraction of the produced carbon dioxide is

absorbed by the oceans and the biomasses on land.2 Then, P= a + b( S0 − S ) where a is some

initial stock of P, b is a technological parameter following from the laws of organic

1
  Produced energy (including energy waste) relative to carbon burned is higher the higher the hydrogen content
of fossil fuels. However, the emissions of carbon dioxide are in strict proportion to the reduced carbon actually
burned (and not wasted because of insufficient combustion).
2
  This fraction is about 55%. The remainder, 45% of the emitted carbon, accumulates in the air with hardly any
natural decay. See, e.g., Houghton (2004, p. 32). If anything, with a continuation of global warming, the fraction
of carbon dioxide emissions that stays in the air will be gradually increasing. The approach of this paper could



                                                        5
chemistry, geology and meteorology, and S0 is the initial stock of S. Thus, without loss of

generality, the economy’s output Y net of the damage caused by the stock of carbon dioxide in

the atmosphere can be taken to be given by a neo-classical production function



(1)                        Yt = F ( Kt , R t , St , t )




where K is the stock of capital and t indicates the time period. It is assumed that

FK , FR , FS > 0 and FKK , FRR , FSS < 0 . Note that the resource in situ, S, can be treated like a

production factor since the damage from carbon dioxide is smaller the larger the stock of

carbon that is not extracted. In fact, S can be interpreted as a measure of environmental

quality so that (1) is basically the production function proposed in the Stern report (p. 124).

Accordingly, FS denotes both the marginal benefit of an enhanced environmental quality and

the marginal damage of the stock of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. FSS < 0 implies that

the marginal damage is larger, the more carbon dioxide has already been emitted.

        Output is used for consumption of final goods C, investment goods I, and resource

extraction X, where the extraction cost function is X ( S , R)              with X S < 0 and X R > 0 .

X S < 0 reflects the assumption that the extraction of different sites is in the inverse order of

extraction costs.



(2)              Yt = C t + I t + X ( St , R t ) .




While the flow controls C, I and R can freely be chosen in line with (2), the state variables K

and S evolve according to


easily be reinterpreted for the more general case where P = ϕ ( S0 − S ) where ϕ ′ > 0 and the curvature of ϕ


                                                          6
(3)               Kt +1 − Kt = It

and

(4)               St +1 − St = − R t .



Equations (1) through (4) hold for all t.

        Let us now assume that the economy evolves in a Pareto efficient way and see what

this implies. Pareto efficiency means that a technically feasible perturbation of the time paths

of the economy’s variables is unable to increase consumption in one period without

decreasing it in another. To be specific, consider a perturbation that keeps all time paths

unchanged        until     time          t * −1   and          again   from     t * +2     onwards,        while

Ct*+1, It* , It*+1, R t* , R t*+1, Kt*+1 and St*+1 are variable. Note that because of (3) an (4) this

assumption implies that Kt* and St* are fixed. In addition, keep Ct* unchanged to see

whether the perturbation is able to change Ct*+1 ; if it is not, the time path is efficient.

        To carry out the perturbation differentiate equations (1) and (2) totally for t = t * and

t = t * +1 setting the derivatives of those variables that are assumed to be unchanged equal to

zero. This yields



(5)                        d It* = ( FR t* − X R t* ) d R t*

and

(6)      d Ct*+1 = − d I t*+1 + FKt*+1 d Kt*+1 + ( FR t*+1 − X R t*+1 ) d R t*+1+ ( FSt*+1 − X St*+1 ) d St*+1 .




As the perturbation is limited to periods t* and t*+1,



captures the endogenous change in the oceanic and land-biological absorption processes.

                                                         7
(7)                       d It* = − d It*+1

and

(8)                       d R t*= − d R t*+1 ,



and because of (3) and (4) it holds that



(9)                       d Kt*+1 = d It*

and

(10)                      d St*+1 = − d R t* .




Using (7) - (10), equation (6) can be converted to



(11)             d Ct*+1 = (1 + FKt*+1 ) d It* − ( FR t*+1 − X R t*+1 ) d R t*− ( FSt*+1 − X St*+1 ) d R t* .




If equation (5) is used to eliminate d It* , (11) becomes



(12)    d Ct*+1 =

        (1 + FKt*+1 )( FR t* − X R t* ) d R t* − ( FR t*+1 − X R t*+1 ) d R t*− ( FSt*+1 − X St*+1 ) d R t* .




This equation shows that, in general, consumption in period t*+1 will change after the

perturbation in the time paths of the model’s variables, indicating the possibility of Pareto

improvements. However, if the time paths around which the perturbations are carried out are

Pareto optimal, then d Ct*+1 = 0 . Obviously, this is the case if


                                                         8
                              FR t*+1 − X R t*+1 + FSt*+1 − X St*+1
(13)           1 + FKt*+1 =                                           .
                                           FR t* − X R t*




Equation (13) gives the marginal condition for a Pareto optimal resource extraction policy

with global warming and stock dependent extraction costs.




3. Interpretation

To interpret the optimality condition consider first the Solow-Stiglitz case where

X R = X S = FR = FS = 0 . Equation (13) becomes



                          FR t*+1
(14)           FKt*+1 =             −1 ,
                          FR t*




confirming the rule that the rate of increase in the marginal product of the natural resource

equals the marginal product of capital. Choosing among two means of transferring wealth to

the future, man-made capital and the resource in situ, society should compose its portfolio

such that both means have the same marginal rate of return. Giving up a unit of consumption

today and investing it for one period, makes it possible to consume FKt*+1 more than this unit

one period ahead. Postponing the extraction of 1/ FRt* units of the natural resource by one

period also means giving up a unit of consumption of man-made goods today. The reward of

doing so is that, after the period, output and hence consumption will increase by

FR t*+1 / FR t* − 1 units above the one unit of consumption given up. There is such a reward to

postponing extraction because the resource is more scarce in the future and is therefore

                                                      9
making higher marginal contributions to aggregate output.

       Next, allow for damages resulting from the accumulated stock of carbon dioxide in the

atmosphere, while continuing to neglect extraction costs. Equation (13) becomes



                                  FR t*+1          FSt*+1
(15)                   FKt*+1 =             −1 +            .
                                   FR t*           FR t*




The new term in this formula on the right measures the marginal environmental benefit from

keeping the carbon underground. The 1/ FR t* additional units of the natural resource that

temporarily stay underground when society gives up one unit of consumption not only make it

possible to generate more output and man-made consumption after one period because the

growing resource scarcity will then generate a higher marginal product of resource

consumption. They also generate a further FSt*+1 / FR t* units of output and man-made

consumption as fewer protective measures have to be taken. The labor, capital and oil needed

to build the additional dikes, buildings and air conditioning devices protecting mankind

against global warming can be used to produce consumption goods instead. If society pursues

a Pareto efficient development path, these two future advantages of curtailing consumption by

way of extracting a bit less in the present must be equal to the future advantage in terms of

higher output and consumption that would result from giving up a bit of present consumption

for the purpose of additional investment.

       Another interpretation can be given to equation (15) if it is written as



(16)           FR t* (1 + FKt*+1 ) − FSt*+1 = FR t*+1 .




Suppose, society chooses between two strategies of generating additional consumption in


                                                     10
period t*+1 by way of extracting one additional unit of carbon. The first is the capitalist

strategy: The additional unit of carbon is extracted for productive purposes right away in

period t* , and the additional output is invested so as to produce more consumption goods in

t*+1. The other is the green strategy: The additional unit of carbon is extracted later, in period

t*+1, and is then used to generate more consumption goods directly, without the detour via

investment. The additional consumption goods generated by the capitalist strategy are

measured by the left-hand side of the equation. Their quantity is diminished by the

environmental damage FSt*+1 that this strategy causes. The additional consumption goods

generated with the green strategy, FRt*+1 ,           are measured by the right-hand side of the

equation. The equation shows that Pareto efficiency prevails if both, the capitalist and the

green strategies, are equally successful at the margin.

        Unfortunately, of course, Pareto efficiency does not prevail in reality, as market forces

do not take account of the environmental damage. As markets at best pursue the Hotelling

rule FR t* (1 + FKt*+1 ) = FR t*+1 it follows that




(17)                     FR t* (1 + FKt*+1 ) − FSt*+1 < FR t*+1   (market solution).




Thus, without government intervention, the green strategy is clearly better at the margin.

        Condition (17) implies that the marginal product of the resource rises too quickly

relative to what the marginal product of capital and the marginal environmental benefit of the

resource in situ demand. This means that the extraction path is too steep, with too much

extraction in the present and a too rapid decline over time. Because of “the greatest and

widest-ranging market failure ever seen”, to repeat the words of the Stern report, society

chooses a suboptimal composition of the wealth portfolio that it transfers to future generations




                                                     11
with too little natural capital relative to man-made capital.3

        Consider now the case where stock dependent extraction costs are added. This is the

case captured by equation (13) which can also be written as



                           ⎛ FR    − X R t*+1 ⎞      FSt*+1         X St*+1
(18)              FKt*+1 = ⎜ t*+1            − 1⎟ +             −               .
                           ⎜ FR t* − X R t*     ⎟ FR t* − X R t* FR t* − X R t*
                           ⎝                    ⎠



The common denominator of the terms on the right-hand side reflects the fact that with

marginal extraction costs of size X Rt* an additional unit of man-made consumption goods in

period t* costs 1/( FRt* − X Rt* ) units of carbon. The first term on the right-hand side again

measures society’s rate of return from postponing consumption by way of resource

conservation, where other than in (14) and (15), the return is now measured in terms of the

relative increase in the marginal product of resource input in production net of marginal

extraction costs. The second term measures the rate of return from an improved

environmental quality as reflected by a temporarily higher resource stock, the global warming

effect. The third term measures a further rate of return from resource conservation resulting

from the fact that a period ahead marginal extraction costs will be lower as more of the more

easily accessible sites remain available. While the formula is significantly more complicated

than before, the role of the environmental externality does not change, having the same

qualitative implications for a judgment about the optimality of market processes as explained



3
 This statement would have to be modified in the case of insecure property rights.. While (15) and (16) indicate
that Pareto optimality requires the marginal product of the resource to rise at a rate below the marginal product
of capital, imperfect property rights in the resource ceteris paribus imply that the marginal product of the
resource rises at a rate above the marginal product of capital (see Long 1975 and Konrad, Olsen and Schöb
1994). In the current setting without exploration costs imperfect property rights mean that fossil fuels are
extracted faster than the Hotelling rule predicts, but global warming means that even the Hotelling rule implies
too rapid extraction. As Bohn and Deacon (2000) have shown, the influence of insecure property rights is likely
to be reversed, however, if there are exploration costs, for resource owners do not even dare to finance the start-
up investments.


                                                       12
above. As the extraction cost terms entering the formula reflect private costs with no

externalities involved, it remains true that market forces extract the resource faster than would

be Pareto optimal.

           Note finally that a simplification is possible without much loss of generality if a

continuous-time formulation is chosen and marginal extraction cost is assumed to depend

only on the stock in situ with unit extraction costs g ( S ), g ′ < 0 , such that X ( S , R) = g ( S ) R .

With continuous time, equation (18) becomes



                                F&R − X& R + FS − X S
                         FK =                           .
                                      FR − X R




Substituting X R = g ( S ) , X S = g ′( S ) R and X& R = g ′( S ) S& = − g ′( S ) R , as S& = − R , and

rearranging terms gives



                                 F&R + FS
                         FK =                  .
                                FR − g ( S )




3. Concluding remarks

This note has shown that the stock externality resulting from the increased concentration of

carbon dioxide in the atmosphere plays an important role in the conditions for intertemporal

Pareto externality, reducing the efficient rate of increase in the marginal product of carbon

consumption below what otherwise would have been optimal. As this externality is not taken

into account by market forces society hands future generations a wrongly composed wealth

portfolio with a too little stock of the resource in situ relative to the stock of man-made

capital.

                                                   13
       In a general sense, this implication is not surprising. After all, it is a common political

premise that the damages caused by global warming imply that carbon extraction should be

reduced. The political initiatives in this regard range from the Kyoto Protocol to the United

Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1997 to the G8 Summit in

Heiligendamn in 2007. However, not all reasons given in the public and scholarly debates can

be subsumed under the argument presented here.

       For example, the normative result derived does not hinge on the assumption of

adjustment costs (Quiggin and Horowitz 2003) or option values (Krutilla and Fisher 1975)

which might make conservation a wise strategy. Neither does it follow from intergeneration

equity considerations or philosophical arguments that would legitimate the use of a lower

discount rate than markets do (Anand and Sen 2000; Solow 1974, p. 9; Stern et. al. 2006,

Annex to chapter 2). In fact, the result is extremely robust insofar as it simply depends on the

principle of Pareto optimality which is about the weakest welfare criterion available.

Rawlsians, Musgravian believers in intergeneration equity or non-discounters alike should

agree to the goal of increasing consumption in one period or for one generation without

reducing it for another, and this goal is enough to prove overextraction when there is a

positive stock externality of the resource in situ.

       Note, though, that the Pareto conditions derived do not lend themselves to defend

extreme conservationist views. They do not imply that some of the carbon be permanently

preserved, but only that the extraction be postponed. To make the argument for permanent

preservation, much stronger assumptions about intertemporal preferences, the size of the

available stock and limiting properties of the production function would be needed than were

made in this note. Postponing extraction does not mean that some of the carbon available in

the earth’s crust should never be used. It only means that measures are appropriate to reduce

the speed of extraction and global warming. It is this sense only in which this note supports

the recommendations of the Stern report as well as other environmentalist concerns.

                                                14
Fortunately, for the time being, that should not make a major practical difference in terms of

the policy measures against the terrors of global warming that ought be taken.
