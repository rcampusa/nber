            Optimal Funding and Asset Allocation Rules for
                    Defined—Benefit Pension Plans



                               ABSTRACT



     This paper considers a world in which pension funds may default, the

cost of the associated risk of default is not borne fully by the sponsoring

corporation, and there are differential tax effects. The focus is on ways

in which the wealth of the shareholders of a corporation sponsoring a pension

plan might be increased if the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Pension

Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) follow simple and naive policies.

Under the conditions examined, the optimal policy for pension plan funding

and asset allocation is shown to be extremal in a certain sense. This

suggests that the IRS and the PBGC may wish to use more complex regulatory

procedures than those considered in the paper.

 1. Introduction



Considerable   attention     has   been   devoted   to     the   funding of
defined—benefit pension plans. Both the level of funding and the
allocation of fund assets have been considered from the viewpoints of
various   interested   parties     (beneficiaries, corporate managers,
corporate shareholders, and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation).
Both   practical   and     theoretical            have tended to
                                          investigations
characterize the asset allocation decision as one of choosing an
appropriate bond—stock mix's.


Sharpe (1976) showed that, in the absence of taxes, if the parties
bearing the, cost of possible default behave rationally, neither the
asset allocation decision nor the funding decision may affect the
wealth of corporate shareholders. On the other hand, if some parties
do not require compensation for actions that increase the risk of
default,  the   optimal   policy  from   the viewpoint of corporate
shareholders may involve funding as little as possible and using asset
allocation to maximize default risk.


Two important papers, by Black (1980) and Tepper (1981) consider the
effects of current tax law, assuming that there is no probability of
defau1t     Under these conditions shareholder wealth may be maximized
by funding to the greatest possible extent and holding assets (such as
bonds) taxed highly for other investors.


This paper considers a world in which pension funds may default, the
cost of the associated risk of default is not borne fully by the
sponsoring corporation, and there are differential tax effects. We
explore ways in which the wealth of the shareholders of a corporation
sponsoring a pension plan might be increased if the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (P}33C)
follow simple    (and naive) policies. This analysis suggests that the
two agencies may want to consider more complex rules. Optimal policy

for th PEGC is discussed briefly in Sharpe (197) Tepper (1982)
describes some of the issues involved in setting tax policy. We do not
explore   such issues here. Instead, we hope to provide useful   inputs
for addressing these more fundamental questions.

 2. The General Problem



Throughout, we will deal with a defined benefit lc17?.     1flIt1cl   fl
decision must be made concerning the amount of assets in the plan.
Following      this decision, e assume that the plan             will he f,'ozen.
That   jSq     no     further benefits will accrue and   no further contributions
will be made.


In addition to the decision concerning the level of               initial   assets,
decisions must be made in subsequent periods concerning the allocation
of  assets among alternative investment instruments. The former is
termed   the  findinq decision, the latter are asset allocation
decisions.      All     may be constrained by legal, regulatory,            or   other
restri ctions.


The ].iabilities of a fro:en defined—benefit plan can be described by
a vector of benefit payments B1, B,, . ., ELI. to be paid from t.he fund
at     times        1,2,.T if possible. We assume these are known with
certai nty. —


At  each time t, the current market value of the fund's assets is
compared  with the benefits then due. If assets exceed required
payments, the benefits are paid and the remaining assets re—Invested.
If not, no further benefits are paid by the fund. If all benefits have
been paid at date T, the remaining assets revert to the sponsoring
corporation.

Beneficiaries may be insured in whole or in part against default, but
we     assume that neither insurance premia nor wages paid by the
corporation are affected by the level of funding or the allocation of
fund assets. Moreover, we assume that the goal of those making these
decisions is to maximize the wealth of corporate shareholders
                                Funding and (Ulocatiun Rules for Fension Plans
                                                                       Page   5




2.   1    Valuation of Contingent Claims


To  represent a market with "tax effects" we employ a modified version
of the state—preference approach used by (Litzenberger and VanHorne
   1978). IndivIdual investors can purchase claims to receive income
cont.inqent on the occurrence of alternative states of the world.
However, different kinds of payments may be taxed differently -for at
least some investors. Thus a claim for a "capital gain dollar"
contingent on state s may be valued differently in the market than one
for a "dividend dollar" contingent on the same state. Given M such
types of dollars and N states of the world, we assume that It is
possible. explicitly or implicitly, for individual investors to
purchase all M*N primitive (Arrow—Debreu) contingent claims. This is
similar, bu- not the same as, the familiar complete—markets approach.
The latter typically assumes that existing securities "span" the space
of state—contingent claims and that unlimited short sales with no
impounds and full use of the proceeds            are possible. In a tax able
world,      if   this were possible, riskiess "tax arbitrage" between two
investors        in   different tax brackets could occur, as shown by (Schaefer,
1979).      Thus we implicitly assume the existence of boundaries on
holdings and/or tax treatment.


We cSsLtme        that at
                        time T, the resid1 val ue' of the fund, R (which
will        be zero if the fund has defaulted) will be used to pay
shareholders. The amount may be subject to corporate tax leaving less
than R to be paid out. Let

         R(s) = the residual value if state s occurs,

            = the corporate tax rate (assumed to be independent
                 of s and R(s)),


         va(s) = the present value of a dollar paid to
                the corporation's shareholders in state s.
                                         Funding and Al 1 ocat ion Rules for F'em;i on Fl ans
                                                                                     Page



If    the residual is to be paid in the form of dividends, v() will be
the    market price        for a "dividend dollar li in state s; I + the resi dual
is to be paid            in capital gains, va(s) will be the market price of a
"capital gains dollar" in state s. We assume only that the form each
distribution would take is known, and that the V(S) values                                  are
selected accordingly.


Letting:

      v(s)    =   v a (s) Cl—   tC   J




the present value of R(s) is

        V(s) =    v(s)R(s)

Henceforth we will focus an the v(s) values.,                     with v(l),,... v(N) termed
the   c'aluatior,   fw-,ction.

Given     a set of      possible residual values R(i),. .,R(N).,            the value of the
pension fund for the corporate shareholders will be

        V =       I' V(s) =          I        Cv(s)   R(s)J.

We    assume that the objective of those making the decisions concerning
the fund is to maximize V. given some ValLtatiofl function v(1) ,                   - . ,v(N).

A key ingredient in our analysis is the assumption                          that   neither the
corporate taxes nor the personal taxes paid an R(s) will be related to
the choice of investments made by the managers of the pension fund
For example, the eventual taxes paid if a "dividend dollar" is
received within the pension fund in a given state of the world would
be the same as those paid if a "capital gains" dollar had been
received within the fund in the same circumstances. A dollar received
in the pension fund in a given state of the world thus has the same
value    for the corporation's shareholders whatever Its type.
However,   the present price of a claim to receive such a dollar may
depend on its type. Thus the presence of differential tax treatment

                                                                 Page 7

will influence the relative attractiveness of alternative instruments,
even for a "tax—exempt' pensi on fund.

 2.2 Choice of Assets



While    individuals may have some flexibility in their c:hoice of
state—contingent payments. we assume that the pension fund must choose
-from  a    limited  set of coir,binations of such claims. The fund
manager's choice set thus does not span the set of state—contingent
claims. In the next part of the paper we consider a choice between two
instruments  (  e.g., 'bonds" and "stocks") in a one—period setting. We
show that in this case one of two extreme funding policies (fund
either as much or as little as possible) will be optimal, as will one
of two extreme asset allocation policies ( invest either in bonds or
in stocks, but not both). Later we obtain analogous results in a
setting invc)].ving many periods and many assets. We then address the
issue raised by Black and Tepper given two instruments, bonds and
stocks, with di-fferent tax status and different risks, we show that
an all--bond. maximum—funding policy may riot be optimal. The final
section of the paper provides suggestions for future research.

 3. One period and two assets



We begin with the asset allocation decision.


Consider a pension plan with A dollars to invest. This may be used to
purchase either or both of two types of assets. One unit
                                                           of asset 1
can be purchased for one dollar and will pay 01(5) dollars one period
hence if the state of the world is s. Similarly, one unit of asset 2
can be purchased for one dollar and will pay D(s) dollars in one
period if state s occurs. We assume a simple regulatory setting in
which the plan's managers may select a value                   of      X between Xmin and
 X
     max ,
                 where

             x      th proportion of the fund's assets to be invested
                    in asset 2.

We also assume that there are no transactions costs.

The value of assets one period hence will be

                         1
                 (1—X)AD (s) +       XAD(s)

At the end of the period, a benefit of B dollars must be paid out of
the funds assets, if possible. The amount (1+ any) left for taxes and
payments to shareholders will be

                                                       '7              +
             R(AX,s)         =   C   (1—X)AD1 (s) ÷ XAD(s) —   B   ]



where

                   denotes z if :>O and 0        if   z<0.


Assume4that neither the firm's wage bill nor its insurance premium is
a function of X or .

                                                                                       Page 9

The   amount of the residual claim in state s is
                                                                           +
        R(AX.s)           =   CA
                                    1
                                   ED (s) +      X(D(s)—D1 (s))J — EJ

The goal is to maximize the val tie                   of the   resi dual       claim

        V
                  S
                      v(s)    R(A,X,s)

by choosing feasible values of A                     and X.


Let

        V(s) =            v(s)R(A.X,s)
                                                     1                         +
                       v(s)   C A ED I (s) + X(D(s)—D (s))J —          EIJ




Figure        1       pl1ots V(s) as a function of X, given A, for three cases: (a)
a state in which asset 2 underperforms asset 1, (b) a state in which
the two assets have equal payoffs, and (c) a state in which asset 2
outperforms asset 1. A key observation is that the function is
(weak).y) convex from above —— going from ic-ft to right the s].ope never
dcc r e a s es -


                                            FIGURE 1 HERE

Note that V is simply the sum over states of such components of val ue

            V =
                      S
                           V(s).

Thus it       must also be weakly convex from above.


It follows that, given A, shareholder wealth will be maximized at
either X )72p or X     but every interior feasible valce af )i b..'ill he

do,inated. Depending on the situation, all funds should be invested
in either asset 1 or asset 2. No mixed solutions will be optimal.


Now consider the question of the appropriate funding level. Assets
invested  in a pension fund must come from somewhere. Corporate

                                                                                Page 10

projects must be foregone, funds must be raised from bondholders or
stockholders, etc. For simplicity, assume that dollars not invested
in the fund will be used to finance an investment that will pay
Dc(S) dollars one period hence if the state of the world is s
and that 5Lth payoffs will be taxed in the same manner as those
obtained  as  residual  values from the pension fund. Then the
opportunity cost of an investment of A dollars in the fund will be

            A    [v(s)DC(s)J             A


      where

                 =    the present value o-f 1 dollar invested in corporate
                        assets (at the margin, 1 dollar),

and the ne't               present value of the       pension fund to the shareholders
will       be


                     SUM       [V(s)   — v(s)DC(s)J
                           S


Equivalently         stated:


           Vn=   S
                       Vn (5)

where

                     = v(s) C [Ar(s)]+_ADC(s)

           r(s) = (1—X)D (s) + XD(s).
                                  1




The  value of V will typically be negative; thus (— V") can be
interpreted as the cost of the pension plan We assume that the goal
is to maximize the former value —— i.e. to minimize                     the   cost of the
plan.

Figure 2 shows the assumed regul atory cli mate. The fund may choose a
value of A between Amm and Amax and a value of X between X mm and

       .
                       max might correspond to ERISA's full funding

limtation and A mi n to its minimum funding standard. The values of
X

     and X max are intended to represent a naive policy on the part a-f
the PE-GC concerning "prudent" management of the fund. In this simple.
case the feasible region has -four 'corners". In section 4 we consider
a   somewhat  broader   class of regulatory policies; however,, the
assumption        is retained that the -feasible region is convex, with linear
borders.


                                         FIGURE 2 HERE ———---


Figure 3         plots        Vn(S) as     a function   of 4 given X, -for three cases:
(a)     a   state in          which   pension assets    do better than corporate assets,
(b)     a state in which the two types             of assets     equally well, and (c:) a
                                                                do
state       in     which        pension      assets     underperform corporate assets.
This function            is    also    (weakly)    convex from above. And, since Vr      is
the sum    over states of                 such components of value, it        must also be
wea::ly convex -from above.

It follows that, given X                     shareholder wealth      will   be maximized at
either A7fl2fl
          - or A       but                  e'ery interior feasible value of     will

much or as little as possible.


Given A,         an extreme value o-f should be chosen. Given X, an extreme
                                               X

value of         A should be chosen. The overall optimum thus involves an
extreme value        of an extreme value o-f X. In Figure 2, all
                               A and
positions but those at the corners o-f the feasible region will be
dominated.

 4.    Many Periods and Many Assets


Consider now a more general problem with defined benefits B1,...
payable at times 1,..T. Further suppose that the pension plan can
invest in K assets, indexed by k=1,...,K. Generalizing the notation
used eariier we                      denote by         the   return at time t to a dollar
invested           at time t-1 in security k. Of course                further   depends on the
state s but it will be convenient to suppress this dependence
initially.
Next let X              denote the fraction of the pension plan's wealth                that is
invested          in security k between times t—1 and t, and define

                                           k
 (1) Mt =                        X                for t1,...,T

H a total              o-f   Z        dollars is invested at time t—1, the wealth of the
pension fund at time t, before payment of benefits, will be ZMt. We
call      the pension fund's investment multiplier for period t.
The portfolio proportions X are decision variables and can depend
on the state s through information that is available at time t—1 (see
below)   but we surpress this dependence for the moment. The pension
             •


fund manager's other decision variable is the initial investment level
A. We denote by W                              the wealth of     the pension fund at    time t,
immediately after payment of benefits. These wealth levels W can he
expressed in terms of the initial investment level A and portfolio
proportions             by the recursive formula


 (2)         W =    t_iMt Bt                       for t1,. ..,T

   with          WA by convention.

(3) Propositicrn.                The       residual wealth R=WT is a convex function of
each multiplier Mt alone, holding the other multipliers, the benefit
obligations, and the initial investment level fixed. Furthermore, R is
a convex function of the initial investment level A, holding all else
+ i x ed..

 4.1 Formulation a-f the Fund Manager's Problem



We assume that the pension fund manager wants to select an initial
 undinq level A and relative port-folio proportions     so as to
maximize  the valuation of the residual claim R = NT sLtblect to
regulatory limitations imposed on the initial funding
                                                      level or fund
allocation among assets. One must also specify the -fund managers
capability to adjust the allocation dynamically in response to
information received. The latter aspect makes -formal representation of
multi—period,            problems fundamentally more complex than single—period
problems. We will adopt          abstract representation of the
                                              a    rather
manager's optimization problem, but one that is well suited to our
objecti yes.

Let           be the set of all states s                         that night pertain at time T. A
trading        strategy          will         be         formally   defined as a collection
                         where

      (i) A    is    a constant,


      (ii)          =                   is a       vector whose components sum to one,


     and for    t=2,...T
      (iii)
          -
                        = (Xt(s)...,Xt(S))
                           1             K:                                  -

                                                     is a vector of functions whose
                                                     -




               components sum to one for every state s


 One interprets X(s) as the fraction a-f t.he -funds wealth to' be
 invested in security k during period t if state s prevails, and it is
 obviously necessary to restrict the way in which this fractior may
 depend on s.              We take as given a sequence i'"T—1 of successively

those     events whose occur rerice or                non--occurrence wi 1   1 be knovn at t. i me
t. In dditi.on to the restrictions stated above it is required that
      (viewed as a            vector—valued function a-f             s)     be measurable with
respect          to i' meaning that Xt(s)=Xt(s') whenever s and s' lie in
the same cell of the partition P1. Ey defining P() as the trivial
partition  (whose  only  cell is     itself>, we can extend this
measurability          requirement to apply to                      as well. EeCaLL5e          is    a

finite set. by assumption, each of the strategy components   can he
viewed as a finite—dirnonsionai vector rather than a function, this
vector having one component for each c:el I of the partition Ft_i.

To  complete the formulation, we require that AI and that Xt(5)E for
all t=1,...T and s-, where I is a compact interval and    is a set to
he described shortly. As                   in the model of     section 2, I is the interval
between a lower funding limit imposed by the PGC and an upper limit
imposed by the IRS. while       is the set of all asset distributions
(relative portfolio proportions) that are Judged by the FGC to be
prudent. For the two—asset model a-f section 2 we took  to be the set
of all pairs (X 1 .X 2) such that

                                                         -
        x mm .    <= x 1      x
                                  max
                                             and X 1 +X = 1.

For     the gereral setting we assume that                      is the bounded       solution set
of    some        finite
                 system of linear inequalities and equalities, including
the requirement xl÷...+xR=i. (Thus      is a compact, convex, polyhedral
set and has a finite number of extreme points.)


The     preceding paragraph contains a strong                   assumpti on.   We are assumi ncj
that the definition of a prudent asset distribution does                            not depend on
the     initial funding level A,              and more generally does not depend on the
success enjoyed by the fund's investments up to an intermediate
decision point. This assumption is essential in all that follows,
although    can be allowed to depend on t and even s (subject to
measurability              restrictions)        without      substantially         changing     our
anal ysi s.

Ours is not a standard dynamic programmi rig formulation of the fund
manager's sequential dcci sion probi em. ifl particular we have made no
explicit  mention of the way current portfolio decisions may depend on
the fund wealth carried forward from previous periods. y coordinating
the way successive portfolio descriptions X1...,.X1 are made to depend
on s. however, one can synthesize any desired dependency o-f current
decisions on past success or failure. Our formulation is completely
equivalent to the standard one. For future reference, we observe that
this   problem   does   have  an optimal solution (the supremum is
attai ned) •    because          it amounts to max i mi   at ion   of a canti nuous function
over a compact subset of a finite—dimensional Euclidean space.


 4.2 Optimal ity of Extremal Strategies



Hereafter we denote by x(x1... ,x) a generic element of , by
y=(y1....y) a qener-ic extreme point of i and by E the (finite) set
of all such extreme points y. Since                  is a compact, convex, polyhedral
set   by assumption, each point xEii can be written as a convex
combination   a-f  the   extreme   points yEE. That is, there exist
non-negative weights Ca(y). yEE] such that  a(y)1 and

(8)    x =           a(y)   y,


  or equivalently.

 (9) x' =              a(y)      y1      for k=1,...,K

                                                                                      Page 17


A strategy          (A.X     1....X +       for   the fund   manager's optimization
                                                                                  problem
is    said   to be 'xrina1                 if     A is an endpoint (extreme point) of the
interval        I     and
                               Xt(s)E for each state s and each t1....,T.
Incidentally, a single strategy component X will be called extremal
if Xt(s)E for all states s.

It is the purpose of this subsection to prove there exists an optimal
strategy which is extremal. Toward that end, first let (A,X1,...X1..)
be an arbitrary feasible strategy. Adding a notational dependence on A
for emphasis, let R(As)WT(A,s) be defined in terms of A and the
relative portfolio proportions X(s) as at the beginning of this
section. and then let V(A) be defined in terms of R(A,s) by (7).
Proposition         (3)     shows that R(A,s) is a convex function of A for each
fixed s, and it follows immediately (because the contingent claim
valuations v(s) are non—negative) that V(A) is convex. Thus V(A) will
be maximized by taking A to be an endpoint of the feasible interval I.
To   repeat,   the valuation associated with an arbitrary feasible
strategy can be increased (or at least not decreased) by moving A to
one of the extreme points of I, leaving X1,...,X1 fixed.

We     now    argue    a similar- improvement can be effected by
                            that
substituting for any of the strategy components     a well chosen
extremal strategy component. Again let (AXl,...XT) be arbitrary, fix
a period t. and let S be any cell of the partition          Then there
exists a point x     such that Xt(s)=x for all sS. Adding a notational
dependence on x for emphasis, let us set


 (1(:)) Mt(six)                     ..   X(s)D(s)
                      =                     k k        -
                             Lk=l   ..
                                          x Dt(s) for sS.


Then R(sx)=W1(s,x) is defined in terms of Mt(s,x) for states sES as
at the beginning of this section, and we set

     V(S,x) =                 vs)        ER(s,x) —   ADC(s)].

Obviously V(S,x)             is the contribution to the total valuation V made by
                                   Funding and llocation Rules for Fcnsion Plans
                                                                               Page 18

states in cell         B,    and it is only the contribution from these states
that is affected by our choice of x.


Recall that x can be represented in terms of the extremal points y via
(8>, and we now consider how the partial valuation V(S) would be
affected if we were to replace x by some y'EE. F3y             analogy   with (10), let


 (11) NI(s) =                       y   D()       for yE and s:S,

and then let R(s,y) and V(S,y) be defined in terms of Mt(s,y) in the
obvious way. From (8), (10) and (11>, we have


 (12) Mt(sx)      =                a(y)M(sY) for sS
                        :y.E
Proposition (3) says that R=WT is a convex function of                           so (12)

implies

 (13) R(s,x) S                   a(y) R(s,y)       for sS,
                        yEE
and hence (because ():() for all sETS)

 (14) V(S,x) <
                            y9     a(y) V(S,y).

Obviously (14) can only hold if V(S,y))V(S,X) for at least one
extreme   point       y. so we can increase (or        at   1 east not decrease) V (s) by

substituting this y -for x in our specification of the strategy
component X. Repeating this argument for e.ch cell of the partition
Fti we come to the following: one can increase the overall valuation
           or at least not decrease it by substituting for        an
V%I V(s),
extremal strategy component X.

The   proof that there exists an extremal optimal policy is now
essentially complete. We know that there exists an optimal solution
         ,X1). But one can substitute for     an extremal investment
level (*. then substitute for       a well chosen extremal strategy

component X,... ,           then     substitute for XT a well chosen extremal

strategy component 4,                without   ever decreasing the total valuation.

 5. Bonds Versus Stocks


We turn now to the issues raised by Black (1980) and Tepper (1981>.
Given a choice between "bonds and tstocksh and a range of permissible
funding   levels,  what  policies   will  be optimal for corporate
shareholders?         analyze   these issues we will use the
                                   To                                                                                 simple
one—period, two—asset setting o-F section 3.


Key     to
         the Black—Tepper argument is the superiority of pension fund
investment over corporate investment and, within the pension fund, the
superiority of bonds (here, asset 1)                                                    over stocks      (asset 2).   In our
notation this assumption takes the form:

                                          1                                "                            c
 (15)           1
                S
                                v(s>D (s) >           I
                                                      S
                                                                  v(s>D(s)          >              v(s)D (s).

From        (15)            it is easy to deduce the following: if all feasible (A,X)
combinations provide adequate coverage to pay every beneficiary in
full  i.n every state of the world, the optimal solution will involve
full  funding (A=Ama>   and investment solely in bonds (X=0). The
                                                )


argument goes as follows. Since there will be no default in any state,
the positive part ([)+) notation becomes redundant and the value of
the residual can be written as:

            n                                                                                            c

the     choice of an optimal X value.     is thus maximized at    max

This      is the conclusion reached by Elack and Tepper. Our setting is
different -—       we    rely on a market       structure. while they use arbitrage
arguments       that     require     explicit      offsetting   acti ons   but the
c.onc:lusions are the same.

The Ei ack-Tepper- result involves the Use o-f pension +Ltfldi ng and
lnvestment in bonds to take advantage of an asymetric tax structure.
Policies that involve possible default by the fund provide a way to
take advantage of possible asymetri c behavi or on the part of the PEGC,
the insurer of pension benefits. If stocks are more effective than
bonds  in this role, and if the feasible (A,X) region includes
combinations that make default possible, the Black—Tepper strategy may
not maximize •shareholder wealth.

The matter is not straightforward, even                in this very simple setting.
The "value of the insurance" depends on the relationship between the
payoffs over states of (1) fund assets and (2) benefits. It is
entirely possible that a risky bond might provide both tax benefits
and a large value -For the i neurance. In effect, we are assuming that
the manager will consider both the "tax effect" and the "insurance
offect" of decii one concerning funding and investment. Our previous
results indicate that in our setting,               the optimal policy will involve
an extreme point in the feasible (A,X) space, whether the choice of
"bonds' versus "stocks" involves a trade—off of these two effects or
riot.     it is instructive, however, to examine a very simple case in
which there is such a tradeoff.

Assume that the payoffs from the two instruments are

      Ionds:     D1(1)     1.1

                 D1(2) = 1.1

                 D(2) =



The valuation function is

                  v(1)           .85

Note that investment solely in bonds will cover benefit payments in
every state, even at the minimum feasible funding level. Thus the
value of the insLtraflCe will Increase with X.


Figure 4 shows the feasible region and the value of                                      at each

 the   cost   of the pension plan).

One might think that, given the tradeoff between the insurance and tax
effects, and our previous results, the optimal policy would involve
either (a) full funding plus investment In bonds (corner 1 in Figure
4) or (b) minimum funding plus investment in stocks (corner 3 in
Figure   4).   However, as our example shows, this need not be the case.
Here the cost of the           plan     is   minimized by a policy involving full
fundi rig and investment    sol ely   in stocks (corner 2).

6. Summary and Conclusions



The main conclusion of        this   paper is the indication that a fund
manager should focus on extreme funding and investment strategies if
our assuTDptions ahout regulatory cor,straintg are valid. The IRS and
the FB(C on the other handq may kant to adopt regulatory policies
such that fund    managers'     optimal strategies will be more consistent
with broader social objectives.
