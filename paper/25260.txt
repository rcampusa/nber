                                         ABSTRACT

Beginning in 1712, North Carolina’s assembly emitted its own paper money and maintained
some amount of paper money in public circulation for the rest of the colonial period. Yet, data on
colonial North Carolina’s paper money regime in the current literature are thin and often
erroneous. We correct that here. We forensically reconstruct North Carolina’s paper money
regime from original sources—providing yearly quantitative data on printings, net new emissions,
redemptions and removals, and amounts remaining in public circulation. These new data provide
the basis for future economic, political, and social histories of colonial North Carolina.

    The Paper Money of Colonial North Carolina, 1712–74:
               Reconstructing the Evidence
                                      Cory Cutsail and Farley Grubb*

       Beginning in 1712, North Carolina’s assembly emitted its own paper money and
       maintained some amount of paper money in public circulation for the rest of the colonial
       period. Yet, data on colonial North Carolina’s paper money regime in the current
       literature are thin and often erroneous. We correct that here. We forensically reconstruct
       North Carolina’s paper money regime from original sources—providing yearly
       quantitative data on printings, net new emissions, redemptions and removals, and
       amounts remaining in public circulation. These new data provide the basis for future
       economic, political, and social histories of colonial North Carolina.

       The British North American colonies were the first Western economies to emit sizable

amounts of paper money—called bills of credit. Colonial assemblies had these bills printed and

placed in their treasuries. They directly spent these bills on soldiers’ pay, military provisions,

salaries, and so on. They also had some bills loaned on interest to their citizens, who secured

these loans by pledging their lands as collateral. These colony-specific, assembly-issued paper

monies formed an important part of the circulating medium of exchange in many colonies. They

were the only paper monies in circulation. No public or private incorporated banks issuing paper

banknotes, redeemable in specie on demand, existed in colonial America.1

       North Carolina was an early adopter of paper money, being the second of the southern

colonies, after South Carolina, to emit paper money. It was also the only colony to emit paper

money from the beginning of its existence as a separate colony through the rest of the colonial

period. Spanning from 1712 through 1774, North Carolina maintained one of the longest

continuous paper money economies among the thirteen colonies. North Carolina issued its bills

in North Carolina pounds (£NC = North Carolina paper pounds). North Carolina set the face value

of its bills at 1.5£NC = 1£S (£S = pounds sterling) from 1712 to 1748, and 1.33£NC = 1£S from

1748 through 1774. Post 1747, at face value, 1£NC ≈ $101.34 in 2012 U.S. dollars.2
                                                                                                    2


       North Carolina did not have a general circulating medium of exchange before emitting

paper money. Throughout the colonial period, foreign specie coins were largely absent and there

is little evidence that other colony’s paper monies circulated in North Carolina, with the possible

exception of some Virginia paper money circulating in the Albemarle region between 1764 and

1772. In addition, there is little evidence that North Carolina paper money circulated in other

colonies as a money. In the absence of North Carolina paper money, North Carolinians primarily

used direct barter of agricultural commodities, some rated by the assembly in terms of exchange

and tax value, to transact local exchange. The North Carolina assembly also accepted rated

commodities in payment of taxes and fees. This revenue made it difficult and costly for the

assembly to pay its debts, fund provincial government projects, and pay military expenses. If tax

payments were in agricultural commodities, then sufficient funds could not be raised in time to

meet large emergency wartime spending requirements.3

       The solution in colonial America was to move tax receipts through time by issuing paper

bills of credit. The assembly created and spent these bills into circulation to pay for immediate

war expenses. They simultaneously establishes future taxes payable in these bills, thereby

removing them from circulation in the near future. The assembly both moved tax receipts

through time to spend more on the current emergency than what was possible with only current

tax receipts and made the payment of government debts and taxes less difficult and costly. The

side effect was to create a local medium of exchange in the assembly’s bills usable between the

time of its emission and the time of its tax redemption and removal from circulation.4

       The North Carolina assembly spent considerable legal space on structuring its paper

money emissions. All emission acts included future taxes and mortgage payment schedules

designed to redeem and remove that emission’s bills from circulation. Each act spread
                                                                                                     3


redemption over many years to kept future tax burdens at reasonable levels. Redeemed bills were

to be burnt and not re-spent by the assembly. Each emission’s spending and redemption structure

was different. Some emissions paid interest, most did not. Some emissions were a legal tender,

some were not. Some emissions were handwritten; others were typeset on a printing press. Some

emissions were loaned to citizens who pledged their lands as collateral—called land banks

emissions. Most emissions, however, were spent directly out of the treasury to pay military

expenses, salaries, and other government debts.

       Colonists knew how tax-redemption and land bank bills of credit worked. While the

broad coincidences in bills-of-credit emission structures across colonies indicates that colonists

were aware of the discussion and actions in other colonies, there is no evidence that North

Carolina’s assembly directly copied language and practices from neighboring colonies into their

paper money acts. First, surviving examples of paper monies show considerable variation across

colonies. Second, North Carolina’s early paper money acts have not survived, so a definitive

statement about copying neighboring colonies’ acts is not possible. Third, North Carolina’s later

paper money acts are different in execution detail from that of neighboring colonies’ acts. For

example, North Carolina’s first land-bank emission was in 1729, whereas South Carolina’s first

land bank was in 1712, Virginia never had a land bank emission, Maryland’s first land bank was

in 1733, and Pennsylvania and New Jersey first land banks were in the early 1720s.5

       North Carolina’s economic and political history is incomplete without a full explication

of its paper money emissions. Many of the political conflicts between the assembly (the Lower

House), the governor, and the British Crown involved paper money. North Carolina’s

participation in colonial wars and wars with indigenous Americans depended on paper money.

The size and timing of tax burdens were affected by paper money emissions. Future political,
                                                                                                          4


economic, and social histories of colonial North Carolina should be informed by, and must be

consistent with, the paper money data provided here.6

        North Carolina’s paper money is understudied. The magnitudes in circulation and their

composition are largely unknown. Tabulated continuous yearly data on the amount in circulation

exist in the current literature only for the years 1748–68, and those data are questionable.

Compared with our data here, the yearly data reported in the Historical Statistics for 1748–68

averages 15 percent too high.7 No systematic data on gross emissions, net emissions, or

redemption and removal of bills exist in the current literature. We correct this by reconstructing

yearly data over the entire history of colonial North Carolina’s paper money regime. These new

data fill in what is currently missing in the literature and correct the prior existing data for errors

of omission, transcription, and interpretation.

        The paper proceeds as follows: First, the data sources and the outcome from the data

reconstruction exercise are presented. This includes providing context for the secular trend in the

amounts of paper money in circulation by adjusting for population growth and market value

versus face value when compared with other colonies. Second, the details of the forensic

accounting reconstruction of the data are provided so scholars can reproduce the results and

delve deeper into the potential causes of the secular patterns shown.

                              Data Sources and Evidence Outcomes

        The annual amounts of paper money authorized, the net new emissions, redemptions and

removals, and amounts left in public circulation cannot be directly taken from existing records.

These data must be reconstructed using forensic accounting techniques. The treasury records of

North Carolina have not survived, or been yet found. Statutory laws provide information on

authorized paper money emissions and redemption structures, though the complete text of all
                                                                                                    5


paper money laws have not survived, especially for the earliest emissions. Occasional

retrospective reports on emissions, redemptions, and amounts in circulation by governors, or

other unattributed government personnel, recount some details of emissions and redemptions.

After 1748, the treasurers more systematically reported summaries of paper money redemptions

and removals to the Lower House which were recorded in the Lower House minutes.

       All these sources are combined to reconstruct the most internally consistent and coherent

annual data series on paper money flows possible, see Table 1. Figure 1 displays the face value

amounts of North Carolina’s paper money in circulation. Table 1 also provides the assembly’s

face value at redemption rating to pounds sterling, as well as observations of the current market

value to pounds sterling, of the North Carolina pound. The market value declined substantially

from 1715 to 1740, recovering after 1748. In addition, Table 1 and Figure 1 show the importance

of paper money for funding emergency war expenses, such as the Tuscarora Indian War, King

George’s War, the French and Indian War, as well the putting down the Regulator Rebellion.

       To put Figure 1 in context, both over time and in relation to other colonies, Figure 2

converts the data to per white capita amounts. It also adds several other colonies’ data, putting all

in a common measurement unit, namely Queen Anne’s Proclamation rate of 1.33 colonial

pounds equaling one-pound sterling. The paper monies of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and

Virginia are the only colonies south of New England with continuous annual data that we

currently trust, being vetting or judged as reasonably trustworthy by us.8

       In per white capita face value proclamation amounts, North Carolina’s paper money in

circulation peaks in the 1730s. The amounts post-1750 are a third to half the 1730s amounts.

Most of the difference from Figure 1 to Figure 2 is due to white population growth. The peaks in

North Carolina per white capita paper money amounts in the 1710s and 1730s are comparable in
                                                                                                          6

Notes: EM # = emission number by chronological count. The difference between authorized
emissions and net new emissions is due to currency swaps of new bills for old bills, to new bills
never spent out of the treasury, and to new bills released at a later date than authorized. The
1745–48 change in the legislated rate of redemption was a partial default on the outstanding
paper money in circulation and not a change in face value designation on that money. The 1748a
and 1748b values capture the change over from the old to the new paper money and the
legislated change in the par at redemption value. McCusker, Money and Exchange, 215, states
that the “par of exchange” after the Seven Year’s War was 1.78. He confused the approximate
market rate in this period for the legal “par” rate at redemption that remained at 1.33.

War, with North Carolina maintaining far less paper money per white capita in circulation at

market values than did either New Jersey, Pennsylvania, or Virginia. Understanding the causes

of this market value effect on altering the secular trend in North Carolina’s per white capita

amounts of paper money in circulation requires a deeper look into how North Carolina structured

and executed it paper money laws between the 1710s and 1750.

money within North Carolina. Quantitative evidence for where the assembly spent their paper

money or where taxes in paper money were paid has yet to be found. However, given that most

of the assembly’s spending of paper money was on military personnel and supplies, the initial

injection of paper money would be where the militia was mustered and supplies gathered, and

thereafter in the theaters of conflict. Given that the militia was comprised of most adult males,

paper money was likely spread initially quite broadly geographically across North Carolina.

Where it circulated thereafter is hard to establish quantitatively.

                                       Data Reconstruction

       The following describes the forensic accounting reconstruction that went into the North

Carolina data reported in Table 1 and Figures 1 through 3. The reconstruction details allow

scholars to reproduce the results here as well as improve on them in the future. They also provide

context for evaluating the performance of colonial North Carolina’s paper money regime.

1712 through 1747: Emissions #1 through #6

       North Carolina was administratively separated from South Carolina in 1711. Between

1711 and 1747, North Carolina authorized six emissions of paper money totaling 140,500£NC.

This total is the face value amount authorized to be created, of which 74,000£NC was to be used

to execute one-for-one swaps with existing bills already in circulation. Thus, total net new

emissions were 66,500£NC. All six emissions had a face value at redemption of 1.5£NC = 1£S.

Emissions #1, #2, #3, and #4 were designated a legal tender. See Table 1 for emission numbers.

The legal tender status of emission #5 is unclear. Emission #6 was not made a legal tender.

Emissions #1, #2, #3, #4, and #5 were handwritten, as no printer existed in the colony at that

time. Emission #6 was the first emission to be printed on a press.10 All six emissions are

assumed to go into circulation in the year authorized, or in the following year if authorization

was late in the year. The records are not detailed enough to tell if some authorized bills sat idle in

the treasury before being spent into circulation.

       The Tuscarora Indian War broke out in 1711, threatening the existence of the colony.

Emission #1 and #2, in 1712 and 1713, respectively, where issued to fund this war. The acts

authorizing these emissions have not survived. The information about them comes from

contemporary and retrospective letters written by governors. Both emissions paid interest. That

interest rate cannot be found in the contemporary records. The first interest rate used by the
                                                                                                      12


assembly was 6.25 percent in the 1729 paper money act. That rate is used to calculate the interest

paid on these emissions.

       Colonel Alexander Spotswood wrote to the Board of Trade on May 8, 1712 that, to

prosecute the Indian war, North Carolina had raised 4,000£NC. North Carolina Governor George

Burrington, in a letter to the Lords of Trade and Plantations on May 19, 1733, stated that war

broke out in 1711 and though the assembly had laid on taxes they could not collect them and so

emitted 4,000£NC bills of credit paying interest to fund the war. A report by the assembly in 1741

stated that 4,000£NC were emitted in 1712 and 8,000£NC were emitted in 1713, bringing the total

in 1713 to 12,000£NC.11

       The act authorizing emission #3 in 1714 stated that the remaining part of the 12,000£NC

from emissions #1 and #2 with up to two years of accrued interest were to be swapped for

emission #3 bills. While poll and real estate taxes had been laid, there is no indication that these

taxes were collected in 1712 and 1713, or that bills were redeemed and burned in those years.

Thus, 12,000£NC was in circulation at the end of 1713.12

       The act authorizing emission #3 was passed in 1714. The law was confirmed (2 George I)

in 1715. The act went into operation in 1714 and authorized 24,000£NC. The bills paid no

interest. Emission #1 and #2 bills still outstanding, along with their accrued interest, were to be

swapped for emission #3 bills by early 1715.13

       If the full amounts of emissions #1 and #2 were still outstanding in 1714, then 12,000£NC

old bills would be swapped for new bills, leaving the net new emission amount from emission #3

to be 12,000£NC. Given an interest rate of 6.25 percent per year paid on old bills, the accrued

amount of interest paid to old-bill holders in emission #3 bills was 1,000£NC (two years of

accrued interest on 4,000£NC of emission #1 and one year of interest on the 8,000£NC of emission
                                                                                                   13


#2). That would leave the assembly with net new spendable bills out of emission #3 of

24,000£NC – 12,000£NC – 1,000£NC = 11,000£NC.14

       The assembly passed an act in 1714, confirmed in 1715, to raise 2,000£NC annually

toward redeeming and removing emission #3 bills from circulation. It was to be operative until

all the bills currently outstanding were redeemed and removed from circulation. These taxes

included a fifteen-shilling poll tax and a two-shillings six-pence per one hundred acre land tax.15

Assuming this amount of tax was first collected in 1714, leaves the amount in circulation at the

end of 1714 as 22,000£NC.

       Redemption and removals from 1715 through 1722 can be estimated by pro-rated back-

projection given the amount stated to be in circulation at the end of 1717 and 1722. Thomas

Pollack wrote to Charles Eden on November 13, 1717 that 16,000£NC were in circulation. A

report by the assembly in 1741 stated that at the end of 1722 there were 12,000£NC in circulation.

If 2,000£NC in bills were taxed out of circulation each year from 1714 through 1717 that would

leave 16,000£NC in circulation at the end of 1717 as Pollack indicated. To get from 16,000£NC to

12,000£NC by the end of 1722, an average of 800£NC would have to be taxed out of circulation

from 1718 through 1722. This decline in redemption volume is consistent with the reduction in

the poll tax from fifteen shillings to ten shilling in 1720 and then to five shilling in 1722.16

       The assembly passed the act authorizing emission #4 in 1722. It authorized 12,000£NC.

These bills were to be swapped one-for-one with the bills still outstanding, thought to be

12,000£NC. This number corroborates the other sources that indicate that by the end of 1722 the

amount in public circulation was 12,000£NC. The reason given in the act for the bill swap was

that the current bills had been outstanding so long and had experienced such wear and tear in

hand-to-hand usage that “most of them are very much Defaced and others being for such large
                                                                                                   14


Sums are not so Usefull…”17

       The act also removed all prior taxes used to redeem bills and instituted a five-shilling poll

tax that was to be used only for “Defraying the Contingent Charges of the Government.” Bills

paid in as taxes were re-spent by the government as opposed to being burnt. A report by the

assembly in 1736 claimed that the 12,000£NC in bills in circulation in 1722 were “the only

Currency or portable Medium of Trade subsisting in the Province.” It also indicated that no

provision was made to redeem and remove these bills. Governor Burrington in his 1733 report to

the Board of Trade repeated these assessments. Because emission #4 was a pure one-for-one

swap of bills, it did not add to the amount in public circulation. Because no taxes to redeem bills

were enacted, that amount stayed in circulation through 1729 when the next paper money act was

passed by the assembly.18

       In late 1729 the assembly passed the paper money act for emission #5 which went into

effect in 1730. The act has not survived. Information about the emission can be found in letters

from Governor Burrington to the Duke of Newcastle on July 2, 1731 and the Lords of Trade and

Plantation on May 19, 1733; and assembly reports made in 1736, 1740, and 1741.19 An emission

#5 bill is reproduced in Figure 4

       The act authorized 40,000£NC, of which 10,000£NC was to be swapped one-for-one for

emission #4 bills that were thought to be still outstanding. It was also thought that 2,000£NC bills

from emission #4 had been lost. In 1735 this 2,000£NC reappeared as not lost. These sums

corroborate the assumption above that no bills were redeemed between 1723 and 1729 and so the

full 12,000£NC of emission #4 remained in circulation from 1722 through 1729. The swap was

executed as 9,555£NC bills were so recorded as swapped and destroyed in the minutes of the

Lower House between April 20 and May 1, 1731. On February 21, 1735 a further 446£NC bills of

emission #4 were ordered destroyed, bringing the total swapped to 10,001£NC. No taxes were

enacted to redeem and remove this 10,000£NC. As with emission #4, these bills when received

for tax payments would be re-spent by the government.20

       The rest of emission #5, 30,000£NC, was loaned to citizens, who pledged their lands as

security, for a period of fifteen years (to 1744) at a 6.25 percent annual interest rate. The

principal would be repaid at one-fifteenth each year, with those bills removed from public
                                                                                                  16


circulation and destroyed. Any excess principal paid would be re-loaned to 1744. Table 2

reconstructs the intended structure of the land bank portion of emission #5.21 North Carolina was

sold to the Crown in 1729. George Burrington was named its first Royal Governor. He received

his commission on April 29, 1730, and arrived in North Carolina where he was shortly thereafter

sworn in as governor in Edenton on February 25, 1731. He declared the land bank portion of

emission #5 invalid and ordered that the principal and interest no longer be collected.22

       Burrington had attended a meeting of the Lord Commissioners for Trade and Plantations

(the Board of Trade) in London on July 23, 1729 where colonial bills of credit were discussed.

The topic of whether bills were necessary, and what sums and on what foundations would best

preserve their credit, was brought up. The Commissioners’ instructions to the new governor,

issued on December 14, 1730, were that he was not to give assent to any law emitting bills of

credit that did not have a clause “…declaring that the same shall not take effect until the said Act

shall have been approved & confirmed by us…” commonly called a suspending clause.23

While emission #5 was passed on November 27, 1729 by the assembly, Burrington regarded it as

falling under his instructions, even though it pre-dated his commission, his instructions, and his

arrival, because North Carolina had been purchased by the Crown in 1729. Given that emission

#5’s act did not have a suspending clause, and had not yet been approved and confirmed by the

Board of Trade, Burrington felt he had cause, given his instructions, to declare it invalid and

suspend its operation. He did this shortly after his arrival in North Carolina in late February

1731, even though emission #5 had already been in operation for over a year.

       Assuming that the first year of the land bank emission was operative, then 1,875£NC

interest income was received by the government by the end of 1730, and the first one-fifteenth of

the loan principal due at the end of 1730, 2,000£NC, was paid in and removed from circulation.

Notes: The act was said to be able to generate 15,000£NC in interest income over fifteen years,
which takes the loan period to 1744. Using one-fifteenth of the principal redeemed each year,
with any excess principal redeemed re-loaned out to 1744, and an interest rate of 6.25 yields the
15,000£NC so stated.


Thus, 40,000£NC was outstanding at the end of 1730, 28,000£NC on loan, 10,000£NC swapped for

emission #4 bills, and 2,000£NC of emission #4 bills thought lost but which would reappear in

1735. This 40,000£NC would remain outstanding from 1730 into 1735.

       Governor Burrington was relieved in 1734 and replaced by Governor Gabriel Johnston.

Under Johnston’s guidance the assembly moved to fix the paper money problem created by

Burrington. On March 1, 1735, the assembly passed its last paper money act before 1748,

namely emission #6. The act has not survived. Information about the emission can be found in

assembly reports made in 1736, 1740, and 1741.24

       Emission #6 printed 52,500£NC, of which 40,000£NC was to be swapped one-for-one for
                                                                                                    18


bills currently outstanding from emission #5. The swapped amount corroborates that the amount

in circulation at the end of 1734 was 40,000£NC. This swapped portion of emission #6 was to be

considered as loaned out at 6 percent interest per annum for ten years (to 1745). Any principal

paid before 1745 would be re-loaned at 6 percent per annum. The assembly ordered that all

emission #5 bills were to be swapped for emission #6 bills by February 24, 1739. On February

27, 1739, the treasurer indicated they had 37,880£NC in old bills in their hands that had already

been or were in the process of being swapped. They also indicated they had 3,300£NC new bills

in their hands to complete the required bill swap, as not all claims had been yet paid. The

assembly ordered the swapped bills burned.25 These amounts corroborate that approximately

40,000£NC bills were outstanding at the end of 1734.

       The interest earned by the government would be 2,400£NC per year, which is the amount

assumed to be earned from 1735 through 1740, after which loan principal started to be removed

from circulation. Of the 40,000£NC swapped bills, 28,000£NC were emission #5 loaned bills that

the previously governor had stopped principal and interest collection on. The other 12,000£NC

bills swapped had been emission #3 bills swapped for emission #4 bills that were then swapped

for emission #5 bills, plus the 2,000£NC in emission #4 bills thought lost that had reappeared in

1735. This 12,000£NC were not initially emitted on loan, but were bills spent by the government

to cover debts. Holders of these swapped bills in 1735 were forced to now accept them as loaned

sums upon which they would owe annual interest as well as principal repayment.

        Suppose you sold the government some war materials in 1714 and were paid with

emission #3 bills. If you held these bills, waiting for the government to redeem them via you

fulfilling your tax obligation, you would be disappointed. The bills you received in 1714 would

be swapped in 1722 for emission #4 bills that would then be swapped in 1730 for emission #5
                                                                                                   19


bills that would then be swapped in 1735 for emission #6 bills that you now owed to the

government as loan principal plus interest rather than as a claim against fulfilling your tax

obligations. You just got confiscated plus some.

       This seemingly endless postponement by the assembly in the face-value redemption of a

substantial portion of the bills they had put in circulation between 1715 and 1735 reduced the

bills’ expected value when used in trade. Citizens would be reluctant to accept bills in local trade

unless compensated for the risk of potential on-going delays in the bills’ face-value redemption.

Compensation would take of the form of an expanding gap between the bills’ face value and

their current market value. The collapse in the market value of the bills from 1715 to 1740,

shown in Table 1, is consistent with citizens reacting to the delayed redemption and confiscation

mentioned above.

       The rest of emission #6 not swapped for old bills, i.e. 12,500£NC, were new spending by

the assembly, with 2,500£NC used to cover debts and 10,000£NC as a grant to the King to cover

military expenses. A five shilling poll tax and a liquor duty were implemented for five years (to

1740) to redeem and remove these sums. In January 1740, the report on the state of paper money

said that the amount of bills still outstanding was 50,000£NC.26 Starting with 40,000£NC in

circulation at the end of 1734, adding 12,500£NC new bills to this total in 1735, and then

assuming that 500£NC were redeemed and removed each year from 1735 through 1739, yields

50,000£NC left in circulation at the end of 1739.

       The taxes to redeem the 12,500£NC portion of emission #6 lapsed at the end of 1739. In

1740, and again in 1745, the assembly added a one-shilling poll tax, the latter to run for eight

years, to redeem bills. In 1740, the assembly ordered that paid-in loan principal not be re-loaned

out. No other new taxes were enacted before 1748.27
                                                                                                      20


        The amount of bills redeemed between 1740 and 1748, and thus the amount left in public

circulation, is estimated using the amount reported as redeemed and burned in June of 1746. The

treasury account recorded in the minutes of the Lower House reported that in late June of 1746

an accumulated total from 1740 to 1746 of 3,543£NC had been paid in as taxes that had been

collected and delivered to the treasury by the local sheriffs, and a total of 689£NC of loan

principal had been paid into the treasury. The assembly ordered these bills burned.28 Prorating

these sums back to 1740 yields an average of 506£NC bills redeemed per year via tax payments,

and 98£NC or 99£NC bills redeemed on average per year as paid-in loan principal from 1740

through 1746. The same amounts are assumed to have been redeemed in 1747 and 1748. Thus,

by mid-1748, 44,560£NC bills were left in circulation. It is this sum that would be restructured

and partially defaulted on by the 1748 paper money act, namely emission #7.

The 1748 Restructuring of North Carolina’s Paper Money: Emission #7

        On April 4, 1748 the assembly passed the paper money act authorizing emission #7. This

act restructured North Carolina’s paper money system. From emission #7 through the rest of the

colonial period, all bills emitted by North Carolina would have a face value at redemption of

1.33£NC = 1£S. The assembly had finally switched to Queen Anne’s 1704 Proclamation value,

referred to as proclamation money. From 1748 on, the assembly also required more regularly

recorded summaries of treasury accounts on paper money, including announcements of the day,

time, and location for annual or semi-annual public burnings of specified amounts of redeemed

bills. The act also formally, for the first time, partially defaulted on prior bills that were currently

outstanding. It required that these bills be swapped for new emission #7 bills at a discount,

namely 7.5£NC in pre-1748 bills = 1£NC in 1748 bills, or 10£NC in pre-1748 bills = 1£S.29 As

such, the 44,560£NC outstanding in early 1748 would be swapped for 5,941£NC emission #7 bills
                                                                                                   21


beginning in mid-1748. An emission #7 bill is reproduced in Figure 5.

       The old pre-1748 bills were swapped for new emission #7 bills slowly through 1756. The

treasury reports are not easy to follow. While some old bills were recorded as swapped outright

for new bills, many old bills were recorded as used to pay current tax obligations with the

treasurer swapping the old bills paid in at that point for new bills and then recording the new bills

as redeemed. Both the old bills swapped and the new bills recorded as satisfying the tax

obligation were removed from circulation and burned. As best as we could reconstruct, the total

sum of old bills swapped for new emission #7 bills from 1748 through 1756, when the last swap

was recorded, was 44,129£NC. This evidence is consistent with, and so corroborates, the

estimated 44,560£NC old bills in circulation in mid-1748. A bill loss rate of 1 percent can easily

account for the difference.

       The 1748 paper money act authorized 21,350£NC. With 5,941£NC slated to be swapped for

old bills, that left 15,409£NC as a net new emission that the assembly could directly spend. The

act dedicated 6,000£NC toward building forts. Another 500£NC was to be paid to the

commissioners who executed the act. Whether this was to be paid to each of four commissioners

or divided among them is unclear. The remainder, between 7,409£NC and 8,909£NC, was to be

used to discharge the debts and defray the contingent charges of the government. Of the

15,409£NC net new emission in 1748, 4,000£NC sat idle in the treasury until March 30, 1753

when the assembly ordered it spent on fort construction. Thus, the amount in circulation at the

end of 1748 was 17,350£NC in new-bill face value, 15,409£NC – 4,000£NC + 5,941£NC in old bills

expressed in new-bill value. In 1753, the 4,000£NC is added back in to the amount in circulation.

The 1748 act also repealed all prior taxes slated to redeem bills and instituted a one-shilling

annual poll tax for as long as it took to redeem all emission #7 bills.30

1748 through 1774: Emissions #7 through #18

       From 1748 through 1774, North Carolina authorized twelve emissions of paper money,

emissions #7 through #18, totaling 208,056£NC. This total is the amount authorized to be printed,

of which some were designated for one-for-one swaps with existing bills already in circulation or

were bills never released out of the treasury before being destroyed. The resulting net new

emissions put into public circulation were 197,734£NC.

       Emissions #7, #8, #11, #12, #13, #14, #15, and #16 were made a legal tender. Emissions

#9, #10, #17, and #18 were not made a legal tender. Emissions #17 and #18 came after the

British Parliament passed the 1764 Currency Act (4 Geo III, c. 34) banning legal tender paper

money in the colonies. Emissions #9 and #10 were one-year notes that paid 6 percent interest,

and so giving them legal tender status may not have been considered necessary to support their

function and value. Emissions #9, #10, #11, #12, and #13 paid 6 percent annual interest. These

emissions were to circulate only for 1 to 1.5 years each before being redeemed—emission #13
                                                                                                   23


for 2.5 years. The other emissions did not pay interest and had longer circulation lives.31

       Emission #7 was discussed above. The assembly passed the act authorizing emission #8

on March 9, 1754. It authorized 40,000£NC, though the denomination structure only sums to

39,650£NC. This was the first of several paper money acts to fund North Carolina’s participation

in the Seven Years War. The 1754 act also continued the one-shilling poll tax until all bills

outstanding were redeemed and added four-pence per gallon liquor duty to this ongoing

redemption tax. The commissioners who executed the act received 800£NC, and the treasurers

receive 1 percent of the bills handled as payment. The assembly reported that 1,000£NC was not

spent out of the treasury until so ordered in 1756. The rest is assumed to have gone into

circulation in 1754.32

       Emissions #9 was enacted on September 13, 1756. It authorized 3,400£NC for western fort

construction. The bills were to be redeemed in one year and paid 6 percent annual interest. A

two-shilling poll tax and a two-pence per gallon liquor duty were imposed for 1757 to redeem

these bills. On November 29, 1757, the treasury reported that 61£NC of this emission were never

emitted and so were then burned.33 Thus, only 3,339£NC went into circulation.

       Emissions #10 and #11 were enacted on May 28, 1757 and November 21, 1757,

respectively. Emission #10 authorized 5,306£NC to militarily assistance to South Carolina. These

bills were to be redeemed by September 29, 1758 and paid 6 percent annual interest. A 4.5

shilling poll tax for 1758 and a 7.5 shilling tax on all law suits for 1758 and 1759 were enacted to

redeem these bills.

       Emission #11 authorized 9,500£NC, with 7,000£NC going to military expenses and

2,500£NC to pay off government debts. These bills were to be redeemed by December 10, 1758

and paid 6 percent annual interest. A 6.5 shilling poll tax for 1758 was enacted to redeem these
                                                                                                   24


bills. On December 22, 1758, the treasury reported that 3,815£NC of emission #10 and #11 bills

had never been emitted and so were then burned.34 Thus, only 10,991£NC from emissions #10

and #11 went into circulation.

        Emission #12 was enacted on May 4, 1758. It authorized 7,000£NC to cover military

expenses. These bills were to be redeemed by December 12, 1759 and paid 6 percent annual

interest. A 4.5 shilling poll tax for 1759 and a two-pence per gallon liquor duty for four years

were enacted to redeem these bills. The treasurers received 2 percent of all bills handled as

payment. Given no evidence to the contrary, all 7,000£NC are assumed to have gone into

circulation in 1758.35

       Emissions #13 and #14 were enacted on December 22, 1758—going into operation in

1759—and in November 1759, respectively. Emission #13 authorized 4,000£NC to cover military

expenses. These bills were to be redeemed by June 10, 1761 and paid 6 percent annual interest.

A 3.08 shilling poll tax for 1760 was enacted to redeem these bills.36 All 4,000£NC are assumed

to have gone into circulation in 1759. An emission #13 bill is reproduced in Figure 6.

Emission #14 authorized 5,500£NC in bills redeemed from emissions #9, #10, and #11 that had

not yet been burned to be re-spent to cover military expenses. The bills were to be written on by

the treasurer to indicate that they were so recycled, and these bills so indicated as recycled were

now due to be redeemed by December 10, 1763. They also no longer paid interest. A 1.67

shilling annual poll tax for 1761, 1762, and 1763 was enacted to re-redeem these bills. On

January 9, 1760, the treasurer indicated that 4,995£NC bills redeemed but not yet burned from

emissions #9, #10, and #11 had been used for this purpose.37 Thus, for 1759, 8,995£NC bills

from emissions #13 and #14 are assumed to have gone into circulation (4,000£NC + 4,995£NC).

       Emission #15 was enacted on July 14, 1760. It authorized 12,000£NC, with 3,000£NC used

to pay off government debts and 9,000£NC spent on prosecuting wars with indigenous

Americans. A one-shilling yearly poll tax was enacted to start on January 1763 and continue

until all the bills were redeemed.38 With no evidence to the contrary, all 12,000£NC are assumed

to have gone into circulation in 1760.

       Emission #16 was enacted on April 23, 1761. It authorized 20,000£NC to pay for military

assistance to South Carolina and Virginia. A two-shilling yearly poll tax was enacted to start on

January 1764 and continue until all the bills were redeemed.39 With no evidence to the contrary,

all 20,000£NC are assumed to have gone into circulation in 1761.

       Emission #17 was enacted on December 5, 1768. It likely did not go into operation until

1769. It authorized 20,000£NC to cover military expenses against the regulator insurgents,

expenses to survey border lines with indigenous American tribes, and to pay off government

debts. A two-shilling yearly poll tax starting in 1771 was to continue until all the bills were

redeemed.40 With no evidence to the contrary, all 20,000£NC are assumed to have

gone into circulation in 1769.

       Emission #18 was enacted in December of 1771 and is assumed to have gone into

operation in 1772. It authorized 60,000£NC to cover military expenses against the regulator

insurgents. A two-shilling yearly poll tax starting in 1772 and running for ten years was enacted

to redeem the bills. The treasurers received 1,500£NC for handling this emission.41 With no

evidence to the contrary, all 60,000£NC are assumed to have gone into circulation in 1772. An

emission #18 bill is reproduced in Figure 7.

1748 through 1774: Redemption and Removal of Bills

       For the years 1748 through 1774, the amount of bills annually redeemed and removed

from public circulation, and subsequently burned, can be taken directly from summaries of the

treasury reports recorded in the minutes of the Lower House of the assembly.42 The reports

sometimes indicate which emission’s bills had been redeemed and were slated to be burned, but

more often they combined emissions together into one allotment redeemed and slated to be

burned. We determine whether values were expressed in old pre-1748 bills or in new post-1747

bills, and whether old bills were simply swapped for new bills with the old bills burned, or

swapped for new bills with the new bills then paid in as taxes (redeemed) and so with both the

old and new bills burned. We also determine how to include the interest paid on emissions #9,

#10, #11, #12, and #13 in redemptions. Lastly, either no treasurer’s reports, or no minutes at all,

were recorded by the Lower House in 1763, 1765, 1768, 1769, 1773, and 1774. In these years,

we assumed no bills were redeemed, or if they were redeemed they were held and reported in

future years. No effort was made to determine the latter possibility and so in years with no

reports, it is assumed no redemptions took place. The lack of records in these years is due to the
                                                                                                     27

disruptions caused by wars with indigenous Americans, tax (regulator) insurrections, and

assembly disputes with the governor. These disruptions likely delayed tax collection. For

example, the assembly ordered a temporary stop to tax collection in 1773 and 1774.43

       How the government paid and accounted for the interest due on the bills from emissions

#9 through #13 is not clear. Our best guess is that money was not actually paid as interest to bill

holders. Instead, the interest was rolled into part of the tax obligation. For illustration, suppose I

have a 1.06£NC tax obligation due. I give the sheriff a 1£NC bill that has 6 percent interest due on

it. My tax obligation is counted as being paid in full. The treasurer credits the 1.06£NC amount to

the public account by taking the 1£NC bill paid in and then adds 0.06£NC in bills to it from the

treasury. The 1.06£NC in bills is then burned.

       A 1770 document reports the paper money emitted from 1748 through 1761 and

redeemed from 1749 to 1769. This is the source for the numbers reported in Leslie V. Brock and

in the Historical Statistics, which were, until now, the only continuous annual estimates of the
                                                                                                  28


amount of bills in circulation in North Carolina.44 This document has numerous errors.

       For example, the 1770 report lists only 189.66£NC redeemed for 1749, whereas the

treasury statements (there are two treasurers) report that 189.66£NC were only part of the sums

redeemed. Treasurer Moseley reported 712.63£NC new (1748) bills paid in and burned. This sum

was comprised of 1,422.15£NC old (pre-1748) bills paid in on the sinking fund that were swapped

for 189.66£NC new bills, and 1,261.75£NC old bills paid in on loan principal that were swapped

for 168.23£NC new bills. Thus, 354.74£NC of the 712.63£NC total were new bills paid in as taxes

to Moseley. All the old and new bills mentioned were burned. The 189.66£NC amount is the

source of the erroneous number listed in the 1770 report as the only amount redeemed in 1749.

       The treasury statements for 1749 also included Treasurer Barker’s report. He had

received 2,290.64£NC in old bills paid in on loan principal. This sum converts to 305.42£NC in

new bills when divided by the 7.5 default rate. The old bills were swapped for these new bills at

the point of redemption with both old and new bills then burned. The treasury statements also

indicate that 1,252.28£NC old bills were brought in and simply swapped for new bills—not as

part of any tax or loan payment obligation. These old bills were burned as well.

       To get the number reported in Table 1 as redeemed in 1749, 1,532£NC, we moved the sum

reported in early 1750 as redeemed, namely 513.60£NC in new bills, to 1749 to capture when they

were likely taken out of public circulation given the tenor of the 1750 treasury statement.45

Thus, 712.63£NC + 305.42£NC + 513.60£NC = 1,532£NC redeemed and removed from public

circulation in 1749 as reported in Table 1. This example for 1749 illustrates the forensic

accounting reconstruction used to correct the rest of the numbers in the 1770 report.

       The treasurers and assemblymen sometimes distinguished the emissions by different

names. Subsequent scholars have followed this convention. Emissions #7, #8, #15, and #16 were
                                                                                                     29


often referred to as bills of credit or proclamation bills. Emissions #9, #10, #11, #12, #13, and

#14 were often referred to as treasury notes or interest notes, and emissions #17 and #18 were

often referred to as debentures. These distinctions are largely artificial.46 Post-1764 Currency

Act bills, emissions #17 and #18, were called debentures to disguise that they were the same as

the pre-1764 bills of credit that were out of favor with Parliament. The term ‘treasury note’

simply identifies bills that had short maturity dates and that paid annual interest, as opposed to

bills that had longer maturity dates and paid no interest. In functionality, they were all bearer

bonds with some type of maturity structure, either zero-coupon bonds or interest-bearing bonds.

                                            Conclusion

       We reconstruct North Carolina’s paper money regime over its entire colonial history from

1712 through 1774, producing the most coherent and consist annual data series possible with the

current records available. We provide data on multiple aspects of paper money usage and in the

subcategories needed to assess paper money’s functionalities. This output is a substantial

improvement over what exists in the current literature, both in terms of coverage, measurement

categories, and accuracy of measurement.

       We present the factual underpinning of North Carolina’s paper money regime. Prior

histories that touch on North Carolina’s paper money regime use spotty and unconnected facts

that scholars just happened across, as well as literary statements by contemporaries about what

was happening.47 Literary statements by North Carolina’s governors, British ministers and

merchant, outside observers, and so on, are difficult to parse. They cannot be taken, as scholars

often do, at face value as history. Contemporaries often gave explanations dealing with paper

money that were manipulative rhetoric to support a desired policy outcome, or explanations

based on an erroneous understanding of the situation. Evaluating and interpreting literary history
                                                                                             30


requires an evidential database to provide comparative context—an anchor, if you will, on which

to moor that literary history. The data here provides that anchor.
