                                            ABSTRACT

This paper studies optimal fiscal and monetary policy under imperfect competition in a stochastic,

flexible-price, production economy without capital. It shows analytically that in this economy the

nominal interest rate acts as an indirect tax on monopoly profits. Unless the social planner has access

to a direct 100 percent tax on profits, he will always find it optimal to deviate from the Friedman

rule by setting a positive and time-varying nominal interest rate. The dynamic properties of the

Ramsey allocation are characterized numerically. As in the perfectly competitive case, the labor

income tax is remarkably smooth, whereas inflation is highly volatile and serially uncorrelated. An

exact numerical solution method to the Ramsey conditions is proposed.

1         Introduction

In the existing literature on optimal monetary policy two distinct branches have developed
that deliver diametrically opposed policy recommendations concerning the long-run and
cyclical behavior of prices and interest rates. One branch follows the theoretical framework
laid out in Lucas and Stokey (1983). It studies the joint determination of optimal fiscal
and monetary policy in flexible-price environments with perfect competition in product and

factor markets. In this group of papers, the government’s problem consists in financing
an exogenous stream of public spending by choosing the least disruptive combination of
inflation and distortionary income taxes. The criterion under which policies are evaluated
is the welfare of the representative private agent. A basic result of this literature is the

optimality of the Friedman rule. A zero opportunity cost of money has been shown to be
optimal under perfect-foresight in a variety of monetary models, including cash-in-advance,
money-in-the-utility function, and shopping-time models.1
        In a significant contribution to the literature, Chari et al. (1991) characterize optimal

monetary and fiscal policy in stochastic environments. They prove that the Friedman rule is
also optimal under uncertainty: the government finds it optimal to set the nominal interest
rate at zero at all dates and all states of the world. In addition, Chari et al. show that
income tax rates are remarkably stable over the business cycle, and that the inflation rate
is highly volatile and serially uncorrelated. Under the Ramsey policy, the government uses

unanticipated inflation as a lump-sum tax on financial wealth. The government is able to do
this because public debt is assumed to be nominal and non-state-contingent. Thus, inflation
plays the role of a shock absorber of unexpected adverse fiscal shocks.
        On the other hand, a more recent literature focuses on characterizing optimal monetary

policy in environments with nominal rigidities and imperfect competition.2 Besides its em-

phasis on the role of price rigidities and market power, this literature differs from the earlier
one described above in two important ways. First, it assumes, either explicitly or implicitly,
that the government has access to (endogenous) lump-sum taxes to finance its budget. An
important implication of this assumption is that there is no need to use unanticipated infla-

tion as a lump-sum tax; regular lump-sum taxes take up this role. Second, the government
is assumed to be able to implement a production (or employment) subsidy so as to eliminate
the distortion introduced by the presence of monopoly power in product and factor markets.
       A key result of this literature is that the optimal monetary policy features an inflation
rate that is zero or close to zero at all dates and all states.3 In addition, the nominal interest

rate is not only different from zero, but also varies significantly over the business cycle. The
reason why price stability turns out to be optimal in environments of the type described
here is straightforward: the government keeps the price level constant in order to minimize
(or completely eliminate) the costs introduced by inflation under nominal rigidities.

       This paper is the first step of a larger research project that aims to incorporate in a
unified framework the essential elements of the two approaches to optimal policy described
above. Specifically, in this paper we build a model that shares three elements with the earlier
literature: (a) The only source of regular taxation available to the government is distortionary

income taxes. In particular, the fiscal authority cannot adjust lump-sum taxes endogenously
in financing its outlays. (b) Prices are fully flexible. (c) The government cannot implement
production subsidies to undo distortions created by the presence of imperfect competition.
At the same time, our model shares with the more recent body of work on optimal monetary
policy the assumption that product markets are not perfectly competitive. In particular, we

assume that each firm in the economy is the monopolistic producer of a differentiated good.
An assumption maintained throughout this paper that is common to all of the papers cited
   3
    In models where money is used exclusively as a medium of account or when money enters in an additively
separable way in the utility function, the optimal inflation rate is typically strictly zero. Khan, King, and
Wolman (2000) show that when a nontrivial transaction role for money is introduced, the optimal inflation
rate lies between zero and the one called for by the Friedman rule. However, in calibrated model economies,
they find that the optimal rate of inflation is in fact very close to zero and smooth.



                                                     2
above (except for Lucas and Stokey, 1983) is that the government has the ability to fully
commit to the implementation of announced fiscal and monetary policies.
   In our imperfectly competitive economy, profits represent the income to a fixed “factor,”
namely, monopoly rights. It is therefore optimal for the Ramsey planner to tax profits at a

100 percent rate. Realistically, however, governments cannot implement a complete confis-
cation of this type of income. The main finding of our paper is that under this restriction
the Friedman rule ceases to be optimal. The Ramsey planner resorts to a positive nominal
interest rate as an indirect way to tax profits. The nominal interest rate represents an indi-
rect tax on profits because households must hold (non-interest-bearing) fiat money in order

to convert income into consumption. Indeed, we find that the Ramsey allocation features an
increasing relationship between the nominal interest rate and monopoly profits. Under the
assumption of no profit taxation and for plausible calibrations of other structural parameters
of the model economy, we find that as the profit share increases from zero to 25 percent, the

optimal average nominal interest rate increases continuously from zero to 8 percent per year.
In addition, the interest rate is time varying and its volatility is increasing in the degree of
monopoly power.
   The second central result of our study is that while the first moments of inflation, the

nominal interest rate, and tax rates are sensitive to the degree of market power in the Ramsey
allocation, the cyclical properties of these variables under imperfect competition are similar
to those arising in perfectly competitive environments. In particular, it is optimal for the
government to smooth tax rates and to make the inflation rate highly volatile. Thus, as
in the case of perfect competition, the government uses variations in the price level as a

state-contingent tax on financial wealth.
   The remainder of the paper is organized in 5 sections. Section 2 describes the economic
environment and defines a competitive equilibrium. Section 3 presents the primal form of
the equilibrium and shows that it is equivalent to the definition of competitive equilibrium

given in section 2. Section 4 establishes the first central result of this paper. Namely, the fact


                                                3
that the Friedman rule is not optimal when monopoly profits cannot be fully confiscated.
Section 5 analyzes the business-cycle properties of Ramsey allocations. It first presents a
novel numerical method for solving the exact conditions of the Ramsey problem. It then de-
scribes the calibration of the model and presents the quantitative results. Section 6 presents

some concluding remarks.



2     The model

In this section we develop a simple infinite-horizon production economy with imperfectly
competitive product markets. Prices are assumed to be fully flexible and asset markets com-
plete. The government finances an exogenous stream of purchases by levying distortionary

income taxes and printing money.


2.1    The private sector

Consider an economy populated by a large number of identical households. Each household
has preferences defined over processes of consumption and leisure and described by the utility
function
                                           X
                                           ∞
                                      E0         β t U (ct , ht )                          (1)
                                           t=0

where ct denotes consumption, ht denotes labor effort, β ∈ (0, 1) denotes the subjective

discount factor, and E0 denotes the mathematical expectation operator conditional on infor-
mation available in period 0. The single period utility function U is assumed to be increasing
in consumption, decreasing in effort, strictly concave, and twice continuously differentiable.
    In each period t ≥ 0, households can purchase two types of financial assets: fiat money,

Mt , and one-period, state-contingent, nominal assets, Dt+1 , that pay one unit of currency
in a particular state of period t + 1. Money holdings are motivated by assuming that
they facilitate consumption purchases. Specifically, consumption purchases are subject to a
proportional transaction cost s(vt ) that depends on the household’s money-to-consumption

                                                  4
ratio, or consumption-based money velocity,

                                                  Pt ct
                                           vt =         ,                                     (2)
                                                  Mt

where Pt denotes the price of the consumption good in period t. The transaction cost function
satisfies the following assumption:

Assumption 1 The function s(v) satisfies: (a) s(v) is nonnegative and twice continuously

differentiable; (b) There exists a level of velocity v > 0, to which we refer as the satiation
level of money, such that s(v) = s0 (v) = 0; (c) (v − v)s0 (v) > 0 for v 6= v; and (d)
2s0 (v) + vs00 (v) > 0 for all v ≥ v.

Assumption 1(a) states that the transaction cost is smooth. Assumption 1(b) ensures that

the Friedman rule, i.e., a zero nominal interest rate, need not be associated with an infinite
demand for money. It also implies that both the transaction cost and the distortion it
introduces vanish when the nominal interest rate is zero. Assumption 1(c) guarantees that
money velocity is always greater than or equal to the satiation level. As will become clear
shortly, assumption 1(d) ensures that the demand for money is decreasing in the nominal

interest rate. (Note that assumption 1(d) is weaker than the more common assumption of
strict convexity of the transaction cost function.)
   The consumption good ct is assumed to be a composite good made of a continuum of
intermediate differentiated goods. The aggregator function is of the Dixit-Stiglitz type.

Each household is the monopolistic producer of one variety of intermediate goods. The
intermediate goods are produced using a linear technology, zt h̃t , that takes labor, h̃t , as the
sole input and is subject to an exogenous productivity shock, zt . The household hires labor
from a perfectly competitive market. The demand for the intermediate input is of the form

Yt d(pt ), where Yt denotes the level of aggregate demand and pt denotes the relative price of
the intermediate good in terms of the composite consumption good. The demand function



                                                  5
d(·) is assumed to be decreasing and to satisfy d(1) = 1 and d0 (1) < −1.4 The monopolist
sets the price of the good it supplies taking the level of aggregate demand as given, and is
constrained to satisfy demand at that price, that is,


                                               zt h̃t ≥ Yt d(pt ).                                      (3)


      Finally, we assume that each period the household receives profits from financial institu-

tions in the amount Πt . The household takes Πt as exogenous. We introduce the variable
Πt because we want to allow for the possibility that in equilibrium only a fraction of the
transactions costs be true resource (or shoe-leather) costs. We do so by assuming that part of
the transaction cost is rebated to the public in a lump-sum fashion. We motivate this rebate
by assuming that part of the transaction cost represent pure profits of financial institutions

owned (in equal shares) by the public.
      The flow budget constraint of the household in period t is then given by:


 Pt ct [1+s(vt )]+Mt +Et rt+1 Dt+1 ≤ Mt−1 +Dt +Pt [pt Yt d(pt )−wt h̃t ]+(1−τt )Pt wt ht +Πt , (4)


where wt is the real wage rate and τt is the labor income tax rate. The variable rt+1 denotes
the period-t price of a claim to one unit of currency in a particular state of period t+1 divided

by the probability of occurrence of that state conditional on information available in period
t. The left-hand side of the budget constraint represents the uses of wealth: consumption
spending, including transactions costs, money holdings, and purchases of interest bearing
assets. The right-hand side shows the sources of wealth: money and contingent claims

acquired in the previous period, profits from the sale of the differentiated good, after-tax
labor income, and profits received from financial institutions.
      In addition, the household is subject to the following borrowing constraint that prevents

      The restrictions on d(1) and d0 (1) are necessary for the existence of a symmetric equilibrium.

                                 lim Et qt+j+1 (Dt+j+1 + Mt+j ) ≥ 0,                                  (5)
                                 j→∞



at all dates and under all contingencies. The variable qt represents the period-zero price of
one unit of currency to be delivered in a particular state of period t divided by the probability
of occurrence of that state given information available at time 0 and is given by


                                              qt = r1 r2 . . . rt ,


with q0 ≡ 1.
   The household chooses the set of processes {ct , ht , h̃t , pt , vt , Mt , Dt+1 }∞
                                                                                    t=0 , so as to maxi-

mize (1) subject to (2)- (5), taking as given the set of processes {Yt , Pt , wt , rt+1 , τt , zt }∞
                                                                                                   t=0 and

the initial condition M−1 + D0 .
   Let the multiplier on the flow budget constraint be λt /Pt . Then the first-order conditions

of the household’s maximization problem are (2)- (5) holding with equality and


                                 Uc (ct , ht ) = λt [1 + s(vt ) + vt s0 (vt )]                        (6)

                                                    d(pt )    wt
                                             pt +    0
                                                            =                                        (10)
                                                    d (pt )   zt

The interpretation of these optimality conditions is straightforward. The first-order condi-

tion (6) states that the transaction cost introduces a wedge between the marginal utility of
consumption and the marginal utility of wealth. The assumed form of the transaction cost


                                                       7
function ensures that this wedge is zero at the satiation point v and increasing in money
velocity for v > v. Equation (7) shows that both the labor income tax rate and the transac-
tion cost distort the consumption/leisure margin. Given the wage rate, households will tend
to work less and consume less the higher is τ or the smaller is vt . Equation (8) implicitly

defines the household’s money demand function. Note that Et rt+1 is the period-t price of an
asset that pays one unit of currency in every state in period t + 1. Thus Et rt+1 represents
the inverse of the risk-free gross nominal interest rate. Formally, letting Rt denote the gross
risk-free nominal interest rate, we have

                                                        1
                                              Rt =
                                                     Et rt+1

Our assumptions about the form of the transactions cost function imply that the demand

for money is strictly decreasing in the nominal interest rate and unit elastic in consumption.
Equation (9) represents a standard pricing equation for one-step-ahead nominal contingent
claims. Finally, equation (10) states that firms set prices so as to equate marginal revenue,
pt + d(pt )/d0 (pt ), to marginal cost, wt /zt .


2.2     The government

The government faces a stream of public consumption, denoted by gt , that is exogenous,
stochastic, and unproductive. These expenditures are financed by levying labor income taxes
at the rate τt , by printing money, and by issuing one-period, risk-free, nominal obligations,
which we denote by Bt . The government’s sequential budget constraint is then given by


                          Mt + Bt = Mt−1 + Rt−1 Bt−1 + Pt gt − τt Pt wt ht


for t ≥ 0. The monetary/fiscal regime consists in the announcement of state-contingent
plans for the nominal interest rate and the tax rate, {Rt , τt }.



                                                     8
2.3    Equilibrium

We restrict attention to symmetric equilibria where all households charge the same price
for the good they produce. As a result, we have that pt = 1 for all t. It then follows from

the fact that all firms face the same wage rate, the same technology shock, and the same
production technology, that they all hire the same amount of labor. That is, h̃t = ht . Also,
because all firms charge the same price, we have that the marginal revenue of the individual
monopolist, given by the left-hand side of (10), is constant and equal to 1 + 1/d0 (1). Letting


                                          η = d0 (1)


denote the equilibrium value of the elasticity of demand faced by the monopolist and µ the
equilibrium gross markup of prices to marginal cost, we have that

                                                η
                                          µ=                                              (11)
                                               1+η

The equilibrium gross markup approaches unity as the demand elasticity becomes perfectly
elastic (η → −∞) and approaches infinity as the demand elasticity becomes unit elastic

(η → −1).
   Because all households are identical, in equilibrium there is no borrowing or lending
among them. Thus, all interest-bearing asset holdings by private agents are in the form of
government securities. That is,
                                       Dt = Rt−1 Bt−1

at all dates and all contingencies. In equilibrium, it must be the case that the nominal
interest rate is non-negative,
                                           Rt ≥ 1.

Otherwise pure arbitrage opportunities would exist and households’ demand for consumption
would not be well defined.

                                               9
    Finally, as explained earlier, we assume that only a fraction α ∈ [0, 1] of the transaction
cost represents a true resource cost. The rest of the costs are assumed to be pure profits of
financial institutions owned by the public. Thus, in equilibrium


                                             Πt = (1 − α)ct s(vt )


    We are now ready to define an equilibrium. A competitive equilibrium as a set of plans

{ct , ht , Mt , Bt , vt , wt , λt , Pt , qt , rt+1 } satisfying the following conditions:

equilibrium that yields the highest level of utility to the representative household, that is,
that maximizes (1). As is well known, the planner will always find it optimal to confiscate the
entire initial financial wealth of the household by choosing a policy consistent with an infinite
initial price level, P0 = ∞. This is because such a confiscation amounts to a nondistortionary

lump-sum tax. To avoid this unrealistic feature of optimal policy, we restrict the initial price
level to be arbitrarily given.
    To find the optimal policy, it is convenient to use a simpler representation of the com-
petitive equilibrium known as the primal form. We turn to this task next.



3     Ramsey allocations

In this section we analytically derive the first central result of this paper. Namely, that the
Friedman rule ceases to be optimal when product markets are imperfectly competitive. We
begin by deriving the primal form of the competitive equilibrium. Then we state the Ramsey
problem. And finally we characterize optimal fiscal and monetary policy.


3.1    The primal form

Following a long-standing tradition in Public Finance, we study optimal policy using the
primal-form representation of the competitive equilibrium. Finding the primal form involves
the elimination of all prices and tax rates from the equilibrium conditions, so that the re-
sulting reduced form involves only real variables. In our economy, the real variables that
appear in the primal form are consumption, hours, and money velocity. The primal form of

the equilibrium conditions consists of two equations. One equation is a feasibility constraint,
given by the resource constraint (21), which must hold at every date and under all contingen-
cies. The other equation is a single, present-value constraint known as the implementability
constraint. The implementability constraint guarantees that at the prices and quantities

associated with every possible competitive equilibrium, the present discounted value of con-


                                               11
solidated government surpluses equals the government’s total initial liabilities. The following
proposition presents the primal form of the competitive equilibrium and establishes that it
is equivalent to the definition of competitive equilibrium given in section 2.3.

given (R−1 B−1 + M−1 ) and P0 , are the same as those satisfying (12)- (22), where


                                           γ(vt ) ≡ 1 + s(vt ) + vt s0 (vt )


and
                                      φ(vt ) ≡ [1 + αs(vt ) + vt s0 (vt )]/γ(vt )

.

Proof: We first show that plans {ct , ht , vt } satisfying (12)- (22) also satisfy (23), (24), vt ≥ v,
and vt2 s0 (vt ) < 1.

     Obviously, (21) implies (23). Furthermore, (14), (16), and assumption 1 together imply
that vt ≥ v and vt2 s0 (vt ) < 1. Let Wt+1 = Rt Bt + Mt and note that Wt+1 is in the information
set of time t. Use this expression to eliminate Bt from (18) and multiply by qt to obtain


                       qt Mt (1 − Rt−1 ) + qt Et rt+1 Wt+1 − qt Wt = qt [Pt gt − τt Pt wt ht ],




                                                           12
where we use (16) to write Rt in terms of rt+1 . Take expectations conditional on information
available at time zero and sum for t = 0 to t = T to obtain

                        T
                                                                       
                 E0        qt Mt (1 − Rt−1 ) − qt (Pt gt − τt Pt wt ht ) = −E0 qT +1 WT +1 + W0 .
                        t=0


In writing this expression, we use the fact that q0 = 1. Take limits for T → ∞. By (19) the

limit of the right hand side is well defined and equal to W0 . Thus, the limit of the left-hand
side exists. This yields:

                                      X
                                      ∞

                                       t=0


By (15) we have that Pt qt = β t λt P0 /λ0 . Use (12) to eliminate λt (22) to eliminate Mt /Pt to
obtain

Solve (13) for τt and (17) for wt . Then τt wt ht = (1 + η)/ηzt ht + γ(vt )/Uc (ct , ht )Uh (ct , ht )ht .
Use this in the above expression and replace gt with (21). This yields

Finally, use (14) to replace (1 − Rt−1 )/vt with vt s0 (vt ) and use the definitions φ(vt ) =
1+αs(vt )+vt s0 (vt )
     γ(vt )
                        and W0 = R−1 B−1 + M−1 to get

which is (24).
    Now we show that plans {ct , ht , vt } that satisfy vt ≥ v, vt2 s0 (vt ) < 1, (23), and (24) also

satisfy (12)- (22) at all dates all contingencies.



                                                                        13
   Clearly, (23) implies (21). Given a plan {ct , ht , vt } proceed as follows. Use (14) to
construct Rt as 1/[1 − vt2 s0 (vt )]. Note that our assumption that given assumption 1, the
constraints vt ≥ v and vt2 s0 (vt ) < 1 ensure that Rt ≥ 1. Let λt be given by (12), wt by (17)
and τt by (13). To construct plans for Mt , Pt+1 , and Bt , for t ≥ 0, use the following iterative

procedure: (a) Set t = 0; (b) Use equation (22) to construct Mt (one can do this for t = 0
because P0 is given); (c) Set Bt so as to satisfy equation (18); (d) Construct Pt+1 (one price
level for each state of the world in t + 1) as the solution to:

(e) Increase t by 1 and repeat steps (b) to (e). This procedure yields plans for Pt and thus
for the gross inflation rate πt ≡ Pt /Pt−1 . Of course, only if the resulting price level process

is positive can the plan {ct , ht , vt } be supported as a competitive equilibrium. Once the plan
for πt is known, construct a plan for rt+1 from (15) and let qt be given by (20). It remains
to be shown that (16) and (19) also hold. Use the definition of Pt to get for any t ≥ 0:

Using (13), (15), and (21) this expression can be written as:

                                                             Pt zt ht
Pt zt ht − Pt gt + Mt (1 − Rt−1 ) − (1 − τt )wt Pt ht +               + (Rt Bt + Mt )Et rt+1 = Rt−1 Bt−1 + Mt−1

Then use (17) and (18) to simplify this expression to


                                   (Rt Bt + Mt )Et rt+1 = Bt + Rt−1 Mt ,


which implies (16).
     Finally, we must show that (19) holds. We have already established that (18) holds at
every date and under every contingency. Multiply (18) in period t + j by qt+j and take
expectations conditional on information available at time t to get


Et [qt+j Mt+j (1 − rt+j+1 ) + qt+j+1 Wt+j+1 ] = Et [qt+j Wt+j + qt+j (Pt+j gt+j − τt+j Pt+j wt+j ht+j )]


Now sum for j = 0 to j = J.

Et         [qt+j Mt+j (1 − rt+j+1 ) − qt+j (Pt+j gt+j − τt+j Pt+j wt+j ht+j )] = −Et qt+J+1 Wt+J+1 + qt Wt

Divide by qt Pt

Et                   [(ct+j /vt+j )(1−rt+j+1 )−(gt+j −τt+j wt+j ht+j )] = −Et qt+J+1 Wt+J+1 /(qt Pt )+

                                                        15
Using the definition of Pt given by (25), we have already shown that the limit of the left-hand
side of the above expression as J → ∞ is Wt /Pt . Hence the limit of the right-hand side is
well defined. It then follows that


                                            lim Et qt+J+1 Wt+J+1 = 0
                                           J→∞



for every date t. Using the definition of Wt , one obtains immediately (19).

4         Non-optimality of the Friedman rule

In this section, we analyze conditions under which the Friedman rule, that is, Rt = 1 for
all t > 0, is optimal as well as conditions under which it fails to be optimal. To keep the
presentation simple, we restrict attention to the case that transaction costs represent true

resource costs to the economy (α = 1) and reserve the analysis of the case that only some
part of the transactions cost are resource costs (0 ≤ α < 1) for the appendix. Note that
when α = 1, φ(vt ) = 1 at all times so that φ0 (vt ) = 0.
        We begin by establishing that the Friedman rule is optimal in our economy in the absence

of market power. While the optimality of the Friedman rule has been shown in a number of
different flexible price monetary economies (see, for example, Chari et al., 1996; Correia and
Teles, 1996), to our knowledge, it has not previously been established for a transactions cost
based monetary economy like the one we consider; thus this result is of interest in its own.5

        In our framework the case of perfect competition obtains when the demand function
Yt d(pt ) becomes perfectly elastic, that is, when η = −∞. In this case the partial derivative
of the Lagrangian with respect to vt for t > 0 becomes ∂L/∂vt = −ψt s0 (vt )ct so that the
    5
    Chari and Kehoe (1999) analyze three models of money in which the Friedman rule is optimal if the
consumption elasticity of money demand is one. Specifically, they consider money-in-the-utility function,
shopping-time, and cash-in-advance models. Thus, our result on the optimality of the Friedman rule under
perfect competition adds one more model to the list of economies for which in the presence of a unit
consumption elasticity of money demand a zero nominal interest rate is optimal.



                                                   18
first-order condition of the Ramsey problem with respect to velocity is


                                   −ψt s0 (vt )ct ≤ 0 (= 0 if vt > v)


The only solution to this first-order condition is vt = v. To see this, note first that, given our
maintained assumption of no satiation in consumption and leisure, the Lagrange multiplier
on the feasibility constraint, ψt , is strictly positive. Also, by assumption 1, s0 (vt ) is strictly

positive for vt > v. It follows that the above first-order condition is violated when vt > v.
Finally, note that by assumption 1, s0 (v) = 0. From the liquidity preference function (14)
it then follows immediately that Rt = 1 for all states and dates t > 0. We summarize this
result in the following proposition.

Proposition 2 (Optimality of the Friedman rule under perfect competition) Sup-
pose product markets are perfectly competitive (η = −∞), transaction costs are not rebated

(α = 1), and assumption 1 holds. Then, under the Ramsey allocation


                                                   Rt = 1


for all t > 0.

   We now turn to one of the central results of this paper, namely, that the Friedman rule
fails to be optimal under imperfect competition. In this case the first-order condition of the
Ramsey problem with respect to velocity for t > 0 becomes

                         zt ht               γ 0 (vt )
                    −ξ         Uc (ct , ht )         2
                                                       − ψt s0 (vt )ct ≤ 0 (= 0 if vt > v)      (29)
                          η                  γ(vt )

To see that the Friedman rule cannot be optimal, evaluate the above expression at vt =

v. At vt = v, s0 (v) = 0, thus the second term on the left-hand side of the above first-
order condition vanishes. The Lagrange multiplier on the implementability constraint, ξ, is
positive, otherwise an increase in initial government debt would be welfare improving. Since η

                                                     19
is negative, it follows that the first-order condition can be satisfied only if γ 0 (v) = vs00 (v) ≤ 0.
However, given assumption 1, this can never be the case.6 Thus, we have the following
proposition

Proposition 3 (Non-optimality of the Friedman rule under imperfect competi-

tion) Suppose that product markets are imperfectly competitive (−∞ < η < −1), transaction
costs are not rebated (α = 1), and assumption 1 holds. Then, if a Ramsey allocation exists,
it must be the case that
                                                    Rt > 1

for all t > 0.


4.1       Intuition

The intuition behind the breakdown of the Friedman rule under imperfect competition is
the following: In the imperfectly competitive economy, part of income takes the form of

pure monopoly rents. By definition, the labor income tax rate cannot tax profits. As a
result, the social planner resorts to the inflation tax as an indirect way to tax profit income.
Specifically, when the household transforms profit income into consumption, it must use fiat
money, which is subject to the inflation tax.

       Because profits represent payments to a fixed factor, namely monopoly rights, a tax on
profits would be nondistortionary. Thus, when a benevolent government has the ability to
tax profits, it would like to tax them at a hundred percent rate. Formally, this result can be
   6
      One may argue that assumption 1(d), which implies that the nominal interest rate is a strictly increasing
function of v for all v ≥ v, or alternatively, that the elasticity of the liquidity preference function at a zero
nominal interest rate is finite, is too restrictive. Suppose instead that assumption 1(d) is relaxed by assuming
that it must hold only for v > v but not at v = v. In this case, a potential solution to (29) is v = v provided
s00 (v) = 0. However, v = v may not be the only solution to this first-order necessary condition. It could
very well be the case that there exists another v > v such that s00 (v) > 0 and that (29) is satisfied. Then it
has to be determined whether both solutions represent Ramsey allocations. If this were indeed found to be
the case, then the Friedman rule would not be a necessary feature of the Ramsey allocation. To establish
that the Friedman rule is a necessary characteristic of the Ramsey allocation, one would have to determine
that the solution involving a strictly positive nominal interest rate does not represent a maximum and that
the one involving the Friedman rule does. To establish such result it would be necessary to show that the
Ramsey problem is concave or alternatively to consider second-order conditions.

shown as follows. In equilibrium, profits are given by zt ht − wt ht . Suppose the government
has access to a proportional tax on profits, τtπ ∈ [0, 1]. Then the Ramsey problem can be
shown to be the same as above but for the implementability constraint (24), which now takes
the form

Because the derivative of the Lagrangian associated with the Ramsey problem with respect
to τtπ is strictly positive, the optimal profit tax rate is one at all dates and under all contingen-

cies. Note that when τtπ = 1, the implementability constraint is the same as in the perfectly
competitive economy. It then follows immediately that the Friedman rule reemerges as the
optimal monetary policy. On the other hand, if the government is constrained to tax profits
at a rate strictly less than unity (τtπ < τ π < 1), which is clearly the case of greatest empirical

interest, then the Ramsey planner chooses to set the profit tax rate at that upper bound
(τtπ = τ π for all t). In this case the implementability constraint is the same as that of an
imperfectly competitive economy without profit taxes (equation (24)) but with an elasticity
of demand of η/(1 − τ π ). That is, the presence of profit taxes is equivalent, from a Ramsey

point of view, to an economy without profit taxes but with less market power. It therefore
follows directly from proposition 3 that as long as τ π < 1, the Friedman rule is suboptimal.7



5        Dynamic properties of Ramsey allocations

In this section we characterize numerically the dynamic properties of Ramsey allocations.
We begin by proposing a solution method that does not rely on any type of approximation

of the nonlinear Ramsey conditions. Then we describe the calibration of the model. Finally,
     7
    One can show that if the Ramsey planner is constrained to apply a uniform tax rate to all forms of
income, that is, τt = τtπ for all t, the Friedman rule is optimal. (The derivation of this result is available
from the authors upon request.). However, this case is of marginal interest, for if the Ramsey planner had
the ability to set both tax rates independently, he would never find it optimal to set the same tax rate for
labor and profit income, thus neither to follow the Friedman rule.

the Ramsey planner’s first-order conditions. We look for stochastic processes {ct , ht , vt , ψt }

2. Choose an initial state s0 ≡ (g0 , z0 ).

3. Choose a positive value for ξ. Note that there is one equilibrium value of ξ for each
      possible initial state.

4. For t > 0, given a value for ξ and a realization of the state of the economy si , equations
      (31) and (33)-(35) form a static system that can be solved for c, v, h, and ψ as functions
      of ξ and si . Since there are only 4 possible values for si , given ξ, the variables c, v,
      h, and ψ take only 4 different values, one for each possible state. Thus, for t > 0 and

      a given value of ξ, the solution to the Ramsey conditions can be written as c(ξ, si ),
      h(ξ, si ), v(ξ, si ), and ψ(ξ, si ).

      Similarly, for t = 0, given an initial state, s0 = (g0 , z0 ) and a value for ξ, the variables

      c0 , h0 , ψ0 , v0 are the solution to (31) and (33)-(35) with I(t = 0) = 1. Thus, the

  by c0 (ξ, s0 ), h0 (ξ, s0 ), v0 (ξ, s0 ), and ψ0 (ξ, s0 ).

  We use a numerical nonlinear equation solver, such as the MATLAB routine fsolve.m,
  to find given ξ and s0 , the values of c(ξ, si ), h(ξ, si ), v(ξ, si), ψ(ξ, si ) for i = 1, . . . 4 and
  of c0 (ξ, s0 ), h0 (ξ, s0 ), v0 (ξ, s0 ), and ψ0 (ξ, s0 ).

5. Having computed the values taken by c, h, ψ, and v at every state and date for a given

  guess of ξ, we now check whether this guess of ξ is the correct one by evaluating the
  implementability constraint, equation (32).

  To do this, start by evaluating the left-hand side of the implementability constraint.

                     LHS(ξ, s0 ) = lhs0 (ξ, s0 ) + βΦ(s0 )(I − βΦ)−1 lhs(ξ)

  where Φ(s0 ) is the row of the transition matrix Φ corresponding to the state s0 . Now

  compute the right-hand side of (32)

                                            Uc (c0 (ξ, s0 ), h0 (ξ, s0 ))
                           RHS(ξ, s0 ) =                                  d0
                                                  γ(v0 (ξ, s0 ))


  Then compute the difference


                             y(ξ, s0 ) = LHS(ξ, s0 ) − RHS(ξ, s0 )



6. Use a numerical solver, such as the MATLAB routine fsolve.m, to find ξ such that
  y(ξ, s0) = 0. This yields the equilibrium value of ξ (and with it the equilibrium

  processes for c, h, v, and ψ.) for a given initial state s0 .

7. The computation of the inflation rate process πt deserves special discussion. This
  process can be computed using the following steps.


   (a) Note that because P0 is assumed to be given, so is π0 = P0 /P−1 .

   (b) Define the real value of outstanding liabilities at the beginning of period t as
       dt ≡ (Rt−1 Bt−1 + Mt−1 )/Pt . Note that d0 is given.

   (c) Use the sequential budget constraint of the government to write

                                                                         
                   πt+1 = Rt /dt+1 dt + gt − τt wt ht − ct /vt (1 − Rt−1 ) ;   t≥0

      (d) From the proof of proposition 1 it follows that

                                                 γ(vt+1 )
                                       dt+1 =              LHS(t + 1)
                                                Uc (t + 1)

           where

                          X
                          ∞                                                                 
                                j                                       zt+j ht+j Uc (t + j)
           LHS(t) = Et     β Uc (t + j)ct+j φ(t + j) + Uh (t + j)ht+j +
                       j=0
                                                                             ηγ(t + j)


      (e) The construction of LHS(t) is similar to that of LHS(ξ, s0 ) described above.
           Note that given ξ, the expression within square brackets in the above equation
           for LHS takes on only 4 distinct values, one for each of the 4 possible states of

           (gt , zt ). This means that, given ξ, LHS(t) (for t > 0) depends only on (gt , zt ).


We now put this method to work by computing the dynamic properties of the Ramsey
allocation in a simple calibrated economy.


5.2    Calibration

We calibrate our model to the U.S. economy. The time unit is meant to be a year. We assume
that up to period 0, the economy is in a steady state with an inflation rate of 4.2 percent

per year, which is consistent with the average growth rate of the U.S. GDP deflator over
the period 1960:Q1 to 1998:Q3 and a debt-to-GDP ratio of 0.44 percent, which corresponds
to the figure observed in the United States in 1995 (see the 1997 Economic Report of the
President, table B-79), and government expenditures equal to 20 percent of GDP, a figure

that is in line postwar U.S. data. We follow Prescott (1986) and set the subjective discount
rate β to 0.96 to be consistent with a steady-state real rate of return of 4 percent per year.
Drawing from the empirical study of Basu and Fernald (1997), we assign a value of 1.2 to the
gross value added markup, µ, defined by equation (11). These authors estimate gross output

production functions and obtain estimates for the gross output markup of about 1.1. They


                                                26
show that their estimates correspond to values for the value added markup of 25 percent.
We assume that the single-period utility index is of the form


                                      U (c, h) = ln(c) + θ ln(1 − h)


We set θ so that in the steady state households allocate 20 percent of their time to work.9
       We use the following specification for the transactions cost technology:

                                                          √
                                       s(v) = Av + B/v − 2 AB                                             (36)


This functional form implies a satiation point for consumption-based money velocity, v, equal
  p
to B/A. The money demand function implied by the above transaction technology is of
the form
                                                   B   1 Rt − 1
                                           vt2 =     +          ,
                                                   A A Rt

To identify the parameters A and B, we estimate this equation using quarterly U.S. data
from 1960:1 to 1999:3. We measure v as the ratio of non-durable consumption and services
expenditures to M1. The nominal interest rate is taken to be the three-month Treasury
Bill rate. The OLS estimate implies that A = 0.0111 and B = 0.07524.10 In our baseline

calibration we assume that transaction costs are true shoe leather costs, that is, we set α = 1.
       As in Chari et al. (1991), the processes for government spending and the technology
shock are assumed to follow independent, symmetric, two-state Markov chains. Government
consumption, gt , has a mean value of 0.04, a standard deviation of 0.0028 (or 7 percent of

mean g), and a first-order serial correlation of 0.9. The technology shock, zt , has a mean value
of unity, a standard deviation of 0.04, and a serial corelation of 0.82. Table 1 summarizes
the calibration of the economy.
   9
    See the appendix for a derivation of the exact relations used to identify θ.
  10
    The estimated equation is vt2 = 6.77+90.03(Rt −1)/Rt . The t-statistics for the constant and slope of the
regression are, respectively, 6.81 and 5.64; The R̄2 of the regression is 0.16. Instrumental variable estimates
using three lagged values of the dependent and independent variables yield similar estimates for A and B.

5.3        Numerical results

Table 2 displays a number of unconditional moments of key macroeconomic variables under

the Ramsey policy. Each panel corresponds to a different degree of market power, measured
by µ, the gross markup of prices over marginal cost. All economies are assumed to start
out in period 0 with the same level of real total government liabilities (R−1 B−1 + M−1 )/P0 .
Thus, the moments shown on table 2 are unconditional with respect to the exogenous shocks

gt and zt , but not with respect to the initial level of government liabilities.
   The top panel shows the case of perfect competition (µ = 1). In this case, the nominal
interest rate is constant and equal to zero, in line with our analytical results. Because under


                                               28
perfect competition the nominal interest rate is zero at all times, the distortion introduced
by the transaction cost is driven to zero in the Ramsey allocation (s(v) = s0 (v) = 0). On
the other hand, distortionary income taxes are far from zero. The average value of the labor
income tax rate is 18.8 percent. The Ramsey planner keeps this distortion smooth over the

business cycle; the standard deviation of τ is 0.05 percentage points. This means that a
two-standard deviation interval around the mean tax rate is 18.7-18.9 percent.
       In the Ramsey allocation with perfect competition, inflation is on average negative and
equal to -3.4 percent per year. This value is close to the negative of the subjective discount
rate of 4 percent. Average inflation does not exactly equal the subjective discount rate

because the real interest rate (given by the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution in
consumption) is correlated with the inflation rate. The inflation rate is highly volatile. A
two-standard deviation band around the mean features a deflation rate of 10.9 percent at
the lower end and inflation of 4.1 percent at the upper end. The Ramsey planner uses the

inflation rate as a state-contingent lump-sum tax on households’ financial wealth. This lump-
sum tax appears to be used mainly in response to unanticipated changes in the state of the
economy. This is reflected in the fact that inflation displays a near zero serial correlation.11
The high volatility and low persistence of the inflation rate stands in sharp contrast to the

smooth and highly persistent behavior of the labor income tax rate. Our results on the
dynamic properties of the Ramsey economy under perfect competition are consistent with
those obtained by Chari et al. (1991).12
  11
     The observation that in the Ramsey equilibrium inflation acts as a lump-sum tax on wealth was, to our
knowledge, first made by Chari et al. (1991) and has recently been stressed by Sims (2001).
  12
     The main quantitative difference in results is that Chari et al. find a standard deviation of inflation
of 19.93 percentage points which is more than twice the value we report in table 2. The source of this
discrepancy may lie in the fact that Chari et al. use a different solution method. One might think that
the disparity could be due to the fact that the models incorporate different motivations for the demand
for money. We assume that money reduces transactions costs, whereas Chari et al. use a cash-credit goods
model. However, since in both frameworks the Friedman rule is optimal, the monetary distortion vanishes in
both setups and thus should not play any role for the properties of the Ramsey allocation. Of course, the two
models might imply different values for the average ratio of money to GDP. Since money is one component of
households’ financial wealth, which in turn is the tax base of the state contingent lump-sum tax embodied in
inflation, the different money demand specifications may in principle explain the difference in the volatility
of inflation. However, we experimented using the steady-state money-to-GDP and the debt-to-GDP ratios
used by Chari et al. and found that the volatility of inflation is not significantly different from the value we


                                                      29
    As soon as one moves away from the assumption of perfect competition, the Friedman
rule ceases to be optimal. A central result of table 2 is that the average optimal nominal
interest rate is an increasing function of the profit share, which in our economy is related
to the markup by the function (µ − 1)/µ.13 As the markup increases from 1 to 1.35, or the

profit share increases from 0 to 25 percent, the average nominal interest rate increases from
0 to 7.8 percent per year.
    Because when the interest rate increases so do interest savings from the issuance of money,
one might be led to believe that as the markup increases the government might lower income
tax rates to compensate for the increase in seignorage revenue. However, as table 2 shows,

this is not the case here. The average labor income tax rate increases sharply from 18.8
to 33.3 percent as the markup rises from zero to 35 percent. The reason for the Ramsey
planner’s need to increase tax rates when the markup goes up is that the labor income tax
base falls as both employment and wages fall as the economy becomes less competitive.

Indeed employment falls from 0.24 to 0.17 and wages fall from 1 to 0.74 as µ increases from
1 to 1.35.
    Another result that emerges from inspection of table 2 is that, unlike under perfect
competition, in the presence of market power the Ramsey planner chooses not to keep the

nominal interest rate constant along the business cycle. Although small, the volatility of
the nominal interest rate increases with the markup. The standard deviation of the nominal
interest rate increases to 22 basis points as the degree of market power increases from zero to
35 percent. In addition, the nominal interest rate is highly persistent, with a serial correlation
of 0.88, highly correlated with government purchases, with a correlation coefficient of 0.86,

and negatively correlated with the technology shock, with a correlation of -0.5.
    Finally as in the case of perfect competition, tax rates are little volatile and persistent
and inflation is highly volatile and almost serially uncorrelated.
report in table 2.
  13
     Profits and monopoly power need not be related in this way. For instance, in the presence of fixed costs
the average profit share can be significantly smaller than (µ − 1)/µ.



                                                     30
6     Summary and conclusion

In this paper we have characterized optimal fiscal and monetary policy in an economy with
market power in product markets. The study was conducted within a standard stochastic,
dynamic, monetary economy with production but no capital. The production technology
is assumed to be subject to exogenous stochastic productivity shocks. The government
finances an exogenous and stochastic stream of government purchases by issuing money,

levying distortionary income taxes, and issuing bonds. Public debt takes the form of nominal,
non-state-contingent government obligations.
    In this economy, under perfect competition the Friedman rule is optimal. The central
result of this paper is that once pure profits are introduced through imperfect competition,

the Friedman rule ceases to be optimal. Indeed, the nominal interest rate increases with
the profit share. In addition, in the presence of pure monopoly rents, the optimal nominal
interest rate is time varying and its unconditional volatility increases with the magnitude of
such rents.

    A number of important properties of the Ramsey allocation under perfect competition
are, however, robust to the introduction of market power. In particular, regardless of the
degree of monopoly power the income tax rate displays very little volatility and is highly
persistent. By contrast, the inflation rate is highly volatile and nearly serially uncorrelated.
This shows that as in the case of perfect competition, under monopoly power the government

uses the inflation rate as a state-contingent, lump-sum tax on total financial wealth. This
lump-sum tax allows the government to refrain from changing distortionary taxes in response
to adverse government purchases or productivity shocks.
    In conducting the analysis of optimal fiscal and monetary policy we restricted attention

to a specific motivation for the demand for money. Namely, one in which money reduces
transaction costs associated with purchases of final goods. We conjecture, however, that our
central result regarding the breakdown of the Friedman rule in the presence of imperfect
competition holds in any monetary model where inflation acts as a tax on income or con-

                                              31
sumption. This is the case because as long as profit tax rates are bounded away from one
hundred percent, which is arguably the most realistic case, a benevolent government will
have an incentive to use inflation as an indirect way to tax profits.
   This paper can be extended in several directions. A natural one, which we persue in

Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2003), is to introduce nominal rigidities in the form of sticky
prices. One motivation for considering such an extension is that under price flexibility the
Ramsey allocation calls for highly volatile inflation rates. This aspect of the optimal policy
regime is at odds with conventional wisdom about the desirability of price stability. Sticky
prices may contribute to bringing down the optimal degree of inflation volatility. In Schmitt-

Grohé and Uribe (2003), we show that the incorporation of sticky prices into a model like
the one analyzed in this paper introduces a significant modification in the primal form of
the Ramsey problem. Specifically, under sticky prices and non-state-contingent nominal
government debt, it is no longer the case that the implementability constraint takes the

form of a single intertemporal restriction. Instead, it is replaced by a sequence of constraints
like (24), one for each date and state of the world. This modification of the Ramsey problem
is similar to the one that takes place in real models in which real public debt is restricted to
be non-state-contingent like the one studied by Aiyagari et al. (2002).

   More broadly, because imperfect competition is an essential element of modern general
equilibrium formulations of sticky-price models, the present study can be viewed as an in-
termediate step in the quest for understanding the properties of optimal fiscal and monetary
policy in models with sluggish nominal price adjustment.

Perfect Competition (η = −∞)

Suppose first that product markets are perfectly competitive (η = −∞). In this case,

equation (37) reduces to


                          ξUc(ct , ht )ct φ0 (vt ) − ψt αs0 (vt )ct ≤ 0 (= 0 if vt > v)


At v = v, φ0 (v) = 0 as long as assumption 1 holds and s00 (v) is finite. Therefore, the above
first-order condition is satisfied. There may exist additional solutions v > v to this first-
order condition if φ0 (v) > 0. On the other hand, if φ0 (v) < 0 for all v > v, then v = v is

the only solution to the first-order condition, and thus, if a Ramsey equilibrium exists it will
feature a zero nominal interest rate. An example of a transaction cost function that satisfies
assumption 1 and for which φ0 (v) < 0 for all v > v is the given in equation (36), which we
reproduce here for convenience:

                                                    √
                                 s(v) = Av + B/v − 2 AB                  A, B > 0



                                                           33
To see why, note that in this case the marginal transaction cost is given by


                                       s0 (v) = A − B/v 2

                             p
At the satiation point v =    B/A, we have s(v) = s0 (v) = 0, so that assumption 1(b) holds.
Furthermore,
                                      s00 (v) = 2B/v 3 > 0

which implies that assumption 1(d) is satisfied. Finally, we wish to show that φ0 (v) = 0 and
φ0 (v) < 0 for all v > v. Taking derivative of φ(v) with respect to v yields:

                                       2
                                                       √
                              (A + B/v   )(1 + 2Av  − 2  AB) − 2A(1 + Av − B/v)
             φ0 (v) = (1 − α)                              √
                                               (1 + 2Av − 2 AB)2

Let N (v) and D(v) denote, respectively, the numerator and denominator of the fraction

on the right-hand side of this expression. Note that N (v) = 0 and that D(v) = 1. Thus,
φ0 (v) = 0. Also, D(v) > 0 for v > v. Finally, N 0 (v) = −B/v 2 [1 + 2A(v − v s )] < 0 for v > v.
Thus, φ0 (v) < 0 for all v > v. This means that if a Ramsey equilibrium exists, then the
associated nominal interest rate is zero for all t > 0. We formalize this result in the following
proposition:

Proposition 4 (Optimality of the Friedman rule under perfect competition with-
out full rebate) Suppose product markets are perfectly competitive (η = −∞), transaction
costs are partially rebated (0 ≤ α < 1), and the transaction cost function is given by (36).
Then

                                            Rt = 1

for all t > 0.




                                               34
Imperfect competition (−∞ < η < −1)

Consider next the case of imperfectly competitive product markets, −∞ < η < −1. The
analysis of this case is essentially the same as for the case that α = 1. For in this case,

φ0 (v) = 0, so that the first-order condition of the Ramsey problem with respect to velocity,
equation (37), can never be satisfied at vt = v. We summarize this result in the following
proposition:

Proposition 5 (Non-optimality of the Friedman rule under imperfect compe-

tition without full rebate) Suppose that product markets are imperfectly competitive
(−∞ < η < −1), transaction costs are partially rebated (0 ≤ α < 1), and assumption 1
holds. Then, if a Ramsey allocation exists, it must be the case that


                                            Rt > 1


for all t > 0.


7.2    Calibration of θ

To find the value of θ we first need to compute the steady state value of τ . To do this, write
the government budget constraint (18) in real terms as:

                                                 Rt−1        mt−1
                          mt + bt + τt wt ht =        bt−1 +      + gt
                                                  πt          πt

Divide through by h to express variables in terms of GDP (note that mt = ct /vt and that
w = (1 + η)/η = 1/µ)

                         sc                    R          sc
                                 + sb + τt /µ = sb +              + sg
                     (1 + s(v))v               π     v(1 + s(v))π




                                                 35
Where sb = b/h, sc = (1 + s(v))c/h and sg = g/h. Solving for τ yields

                                                                      
                                                sc            1
                     τ = µ (R/π − 1)sb +                        − 1 + sg
                                            v(1 + s(v))       π

To obtain θ, use equation (13) to get

                                   1 − τ 1 + s(v) 1 + η 1 − h
                              θ=                              .
                                   γ(v)     sc      η     h
