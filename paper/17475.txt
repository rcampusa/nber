                                              ABSTRACT

Policymakers and microfinance institutions (MFIs) often claim to target poor entrepreneurs who then
invest loan proceeds in their businesses. Typically in nonresearch settings these claims are assessed
using readily available but unverified self-reports from client loan applications. Alternatively, independent
surveyors could directly elicit how borrowers spent their loan proceeds. That too, however, could suffer
from deliberate misreporting. We use data from the Peru and the Philippines in which independent
surveyors elicited loan use both directly (i.e., by asking how individuals spent their loan proceeds)
and indirectly (i.e., through a list-randomization technique that allows individuals to hide their answer
from the surveyor). We find that direct elicitation under-reports the non-enterprise uses of loan proceeds.

Introduction

Policymakers place increasing emphasis on expanding outreach to poorer (potential)
entrepreneurs, and microfinance institutions (MFIs) often claim to target poor entrepreneurs who
then invest loan proceeds in growing their businesses. Typically these claims are evaluated using
readily available but unverified self-reports from client loan applications. We examine whether
MFIs and third-parties can rely on client self-reports to learn how individuals spent the loan
proceeds.

If there is any incentive to lie, self-reports from clients to MFIs are likely to be biased in
whichever direction serves the interests of the clients. Even if clients are assured that their
answers will not affect their loan eligibility, respondents may lie if they do not trust the
surveyors’ (or loan officers’) guarantees or if they wish to project a socially desirable image.

Note that there is a more important impact question that we do not address: what expenditures or
investments were made that would not have been made had that lender not made the loan. To
answer this question, one needs a measure of the counterfactual: what would have happened
without a loan. In this paper we focus strictly on borrower reports of how they spent loan
proceeds, and how they report this differently whether asked by the lender, a surveyor directly,
or a surveyor indirectly in a way that allows the respondent to conceal their answer.

We report here on two mini-studies on borrower “use of funds” that are part of larger ongoing
studies with MFIs. The first, with Arariwa in Peru, uses a survey technique called “list
randomization” (explained below), to assess whether individuals feel compelled to underreport
using loan proceeds for consumption, rather than investment. The presumption is that if
individuals underreport using funds for consumption to an independent surveyor, then they will
likely also underreport the same if asked by a lender who emphasizes using loans for
entrepreneurial purposes. The second study, with First Macro Bank in the Philippines, examines
the key underreporting hypothesis more directly, by comparing reports on non-business uses
across three elicitation methods: direct questioning by the bank, direct questioning by the
surveyor, and list randomization presented by the surveyor.

Design, Data, and Results

List Randomization

Researchers in the social sciences have developed a variety of techniques that attempt to elicit
truthful responses to sensitive questions. One approach includes direct methods such as matching
the gender of surveyors and respondents, using forgiving language, using unfolding financial
brackets, and collecting data in private. A second approach involves using indirect methods such
as the randomized response technique, the bogus pipeline, and the list randomization technique
used here.1

List randomization, also known as the item count or unmatched count technique, provides a
simple way for respondents to report on sensitive behavior without allowing the researcher or
surveyors to identify individual responses. To employ this technique, half of the survey
respondents are randomly selected to receive a short list of statements (in our case a list of
business investments) and asked to report how many, but not which, statements are true. The
other half of the survey respondents are presented with the same list of statements and one key
additional statement designed to capture sensitive behavior (in our case non-business investment
or a type of consumption). By subtracting the mean number of true statements in the first group
from the mean number of true statements in the second group, researchers can estimate the
proportion of the sample that engages in the sensitive behavior.

Several studies suggest that the randomized list technique can yield more accurate responses to
sensitive survey questions compared to the direct reporting method. Across 48 comparisons of
direct report and list randomization, one meta-analysis found that 63% of the estimates for
socially undesirable behavior were significantly larger when elicited through list randomization
(Holbrook and Krosnick 2009). A more limited meta-analysis found that while the list
randomization estimates of socially undesirable behavior were generally larger, particularly for
studies using undergraduate samples, the overall difference was not significant (Tourangeau
2007).

To validate the method as a means to elicit information about specifically sensitive behavior,
some studies have more precisely estimated the effectiveness of the technique by comparing
direct report to list randomization for both sensitive and non-sensitive questions. Tsuchiya et al.
(2007) finds that the technique results in a significantly higher proportion of a sample admitting
to shoplifting, whereas the difference between methods in estimates of blood donation is
insignificant. Similarly, LaBrie and Earleywine (2000) finds that list randomization results in a
higher proportion of undergraduate students admitting to having unprotected sex, whereas there
was no significant difference for drinking alcohol, which presumably has less stigma.

  The randomized response technique was first developed in 1965 by Stanley Warner as a process in which a
randomizing device such as a spinner would select one of two statements about a sensitive topic. The spinner would
select one statement with known probability p and the other statement with probability 1-p. The respondent would
then inform the surveyor whether or not she agreed with the selected statement, without disclosing which statement
was selected by the spinner. Other indirect methods include the unrelated question technique, the forced alternative
technique, and the bogus pipeline technique. In the unrelated question technique, respondents are asked to answer
"yes" or "no" to one of two randomly selected questions: the sensitive question or a question with a known
probability of a "yes" answer. In the forced alternative technique, the respondent is presented with a sensitive
question and then uses a randomizing device to determine whether to respond "yes", "no", or to present her true
response. The bogus pipeline technique tells respondents they are being monitored by a lie detector.
One challenge of the list randomization method lies in the selection of the non-key items in the
list. In order to reduce variance, the values of non-key list items should have as little variance as
possible. That is, the non-key items should describe relatively innocuous behaviors that almost
everyone has done, or almost everyone has not done. But if the items represent behaviors that
pose no variation across people, the respondent may not feel confident that his or her answer
about the behavior in question would be anonymous. As a result of this dilemma, list
randomization often produces results that are too high in variance to be statistically significant,
especially if the behavior of interest is low prevalence (which it often is, since high prevalence
behaviors are typically not that sensitive in the first place) (Droitcour et al. 1991). We suspect
loan use for consumption purposes to be common enough to warrant the application of this
method here.

Another critique of list randomization lies in how the method is presented to respondents. Giving
a more detailed explanation of the technique reassures respondents that their answers will remain
anonymous, and therefore results in higher reports of the sensitive behavior (Ahart and Sackett
2004). There is no evidence, however, that the number of non-key items in the list affects the
difference between the direct response and list randomization estimates, implying that we can
gain relatively accurate estimates from lists of three, four, five, or six items (Tsuchiya et al.
2007). In comparison to other indirect methods, list randomization is often more simple to
administer (both for surveyors and respondents) and effective (Droitcour et al. 1991).

Another drawback of the list randomization technique is that it generates only aggregate
information. While it reveals information about the rate of presence of the sensitive behavior in a
population, the anonymity of the method makes it impossible to examine the relationship
between the behavior and individual characteristics due to the anonymity of the method.
Breaking down base rate analysis by subgroups defined by another individual measure can allow
for more subtle exploration of the relationship between the sensitive behavior and individual
characteristics (Ahart and Sackett 2004).

Study 1: Arariwa MFI, Peru

Our first mini-study compares borrower reports of loan uses from two different elicitation
methods implemented by surveyors: direct questioning versus list randomization. Prior to
evaluating the use of video and radio as a means for financial education, 1650 MFI clients were
surveyed in Cuzco, Peru. The lending institution, Arariwa, provides microcredit for business
purposes to approximately 20,000 low-income households in southeastern Peru. Arariwa
emphasizes that loans should be used for business, and requires the borrower to state what the
loan will be used for when they apply. However, there is no policy of explicitly monitoring the
use of the cash proceeds from loan disbursal. As part of the baseline survey, Arariwa clients were
asked questions related to their personal finances and education. Surveyors were not affiliated
with any MFI and informed survey respondents that their responses would not be shared with
anyone other than researchers studying how entrepreneurs that are Arariwa clients manage their
household finances.

All respondents were asked to report their loan uses through direct report and list randomization
techniques. For the direct report, respondents were asked to list up to five loans that they had
taken out in the past 12 months, by loan source and amount. They were then asked, “Which need
or which needs did you cover with this loan?” and allowed to list up to three uses for each loan.2
Though respondents were not prompted with categories, surveyors matched uses against one of
18 possibilities (Table 1). Note that this thus is not a perfect match to the list randomization
question; the second study, detailed below, addresses this flaw by matching the questions more
precisely. After eight more questions related to personal finances, respondents were presented
with the list randomization module.

In surveyor training, we explained that the list randomization intended to ask private questions in
an anonymous fashion. The surveyors did not understand the details of the calculation, but they
understood that the process generated anonymity and the importance of making this anonymity
clear to clients. They also understood the importance of maintaining the random assignment to
treatment groups.

Prior to beginning the list randomization, surveyors were instructed to demonstrate the technique
using an example. Surveyors were provided with five innocuous statements printed on a piece of
paper with a clear clipboard placed over the sheet. Respondents were handed the clipboards and
asked to use a white board marker to put check marks next to statements that are true for them.
Next, respondents were instructed to count the number of true statements before erasing their
check marks, returning the clipboard, and reporting the total count. After confirming that the
clients understood the anonymity ensured by the process, surveyors began the list randomization
module.

Clients were randomly selected to be presented with one of four possible groups of three to six
statements.3 All clients received the following three statements: “I used part of my Arariwa loan
to buy merchandise for my economic activity”, “I used part of my Arariwa loan to buy
equipment for my economic activity” and “I shared my loan with another person”. Clients in
group A (n=408) only received these statements. Clients in group B (n=414) additionally
received the following statement: “I used at least a quarter of my Arariwa loan on household


  Only 1.5% of the sample listed five loans, implying that respondents were not limited by the survey options to
2

underreport loans. Similarly, 2.4% of all loans and 2.1% of loans identified as “Loan from Arariwa” or “Loan from
Communal Bank (facilitated b Arariwa)” had three uses, implying that the three-use maximum was not binding for
most respondents.
3
  The randomization was stratified by lending group. A subset of clients were randomly selected to be
surveyed, and if an individual was not found then there was a replacement list, randomly ordered, of
individuals to survey. Any replacement individual was assigned to the same list randomization treatment as
the original target respondent.
items, such as food, a TV, a radio, etc.” Group C (n=388) received the four previous statements,
and the statement, “I used at least a quarter of my Arariwa loan to pay for my family’s medical
expenses.” Group D (n=401) received the previous five statements and the statement, “I used at
least a quarter of my Arariwa loan to pay for my family’s educational expenses.” By subtracting
the mean number of true statements for group A from the mean number of true statements for
group B, we get the proportion of clients that used a quarter of their loan for household items.
We similarly subtract B from C and C from D to get the proportions of clients using their loans
on education or medical expenses.

In order to compare estimates, we match the loan uses from direct report to those from list
randomization. Since the direct report question allows clients to list up to five loans from any
source, we limit the sample to only include Arariwa loans or communal loans facilitated by
Arariwa.4 Due to cultural norms and surveyor training, “household items” is best approximated
by the direct report responses that are classified as “consumption good”, “purchase clothing or
shoes”, and “other consumption need.”

 In piloting the survey, clients did not seem to differentiate between loans directly from Arariwa and loans from the
savings accumulated by peers in village banks organized by Arariwa.

N = 1650. An individual use = 1 if it is listed as any of three possible uses across any of
five possible loans. Only loans identified as "Loan from Arariwa" or "Loan from
Communal Bank (facilitated by Arariwa)" are included. Only 2.1% of those loans had
three uses, implying that the three-use maximum was not binding for most respondents.
Table 2 demonstrates a striking contrast in results between direct questioning and list
randomization. Direct questioning reveals only 7.7% of the sample volunteering household items
as a use for any of their Arariwa or Arariwa-facilitated loans. In comparison, the list
randomization technique suggests that 31.3% of the sample used at least a quarter of their
Arariwa loans on household items. Similarly, 2.2% of the sample volunteered a health related
loan use through direct questioning, whereas list randomization resulted in an estimate of 23.1%
of the sample using at least a quarter of their loan amounts on medical expenses. Finally, the
proportion for clients using loans for educational expenses is 7.1% through direct questioning,
but 33.2% through list randomization. Z-tests of proportions indicate that each of these three
differences is statistically significant.

Although the magnitude of the estimated underreporting here is large, it is consistent with results
from other studies. For example, Karlan and Zinman (2007) look at the “cash loan” market in
South Africa, and compare self-reports on loans with administrative data. They find that nearly
50% of respondents lie about their borrowing activity.

There are several reasons why list randomization might produce such different, and higher,
estimates of loan uses than direct report. Asking clients to do direct report first and list
randomization second biases the results. Future research could test this by randomizing the order
of direct report and lists. Another issue is whether list randomization reduces lying, and/or
facilitates recall. Future research could test this by comparing direct reports versus list
randomization on topics not likely to be sensitive (e.g., asking about using microloan proceeds
for business expenses), and/or by testing how prompting specific categories changes responses in
direct elicitation.

Direct report question allows up to three uses to be reported for each of five loans. Only loans
directly from Arariwa or facilitated by Arariwa are included. "Household items" question from list
randomization is matched to the following direct report options: "consumption goods", "purchase
clothing or shoes", and "other consumption need". List randomization questions required that over
1/4 of the loan was used for the specified purpose, whereas the direct report question did not have a
lower bound on proportion of loan used.
Study 2: FMB, The Philippines

In our second mini-study, clients at three banks in the Philippines were subjected to two
questions at four different times during their loan cycle. The questions aimed to get at the truth
behind two statements: (1) "I used 2500 pesos or more of my loan to pay down other debt" and
(2) "I used 5,000 pesos or more of my loan on any single transaction for my household".
(Respondents were asked to consider the statements with regard to their most recent loan.) The
four steps of elicitation are detailed in Table 3. First, credit officers presented the questions to
clients on their loan application. Credit officers then presented the questions again when clients
went to make their first loan repayment. These two instances allow us to see how answers
change before and after the loan was granted.

Surveyors then visited clients, on average, two weeks after the client was granted a loan from
one of the participating banks.5 The surveyor asked them to participate in a survey about "Health
and Financial Services." Respondents had no reason to believe that the surveyors had any
connection to the bank. The first few questions asked about health attitudes and behaviors so that
clients would not think that the surveys were coming directly from the bank. Surveyors had no
information about the three participating banks. Surveyors then asked the clients the two
questions explicitly. The difference between the responses during the first repayment and the
explicit questions from the surveyor allows us to see how responses change when clients think
the bank may be monitoring their answers. At that time, surveyors also presented the questions
indirectly using list randomization.

Clients were asked two sets of list randomization questions. These questions allowed us to
estimate the proportion of true answers to the two statements. Each client randomly received one
of four surveys. All surveys contained the following four statements in the first question: "I have
visited a hospital or clinic in the last six months," "I have more than three siblings," "I have
purchased some type of insurance in the past five years," and "My household owns an air
conditioner." The second and fourth surveys had "I used 2,500 pesos or more of my loan to pay
down other debt" as the fifth question.

Similarly the second set of list randomization questions included the following four statements
on all surveys: "I have a washing machine in my home," "I am originally from this city," "I have
completed one year or more of formal education post-high school," and "My household owns a
computer." The third and fourth surveys also include the statement "I used 5,000 pesos or more
of my loan on any single transaction for my household." In this case, the questions used in list
randomization were exactly the same as those used in direct elicitation, so any differences in
results can be attributed purely to the method and not the content of the question.

5
 We also surveyed some clients who were denied loans from the bank. These clients were part of a larger overall
experiment in which we randomized loan decisions on marginally creditworthy clients. Future work will look at the
difference in expenditures amongst randomized clients, thus taking into account the fungability of money.
Survey one was administered to 58 people in our sample, survey two was administered to 77
people, survey three was administered to 59 people and the final survey was administered to 66
people. Comparing results from the explicit question by the surveyor to results from the list
randomization will demonstrate how responses change when clients believe their answers are
truly private, even from the surveyor6

Chart 1 shows the results for Question 1, and Chart 2 shows the results for Question 2. When the
credit officers asked clients directly, for both questions, fewer than 4% of clients admitted that
the statements were true (note that due to compliance issues, our sample size is smaller for Step
B, hence the larger standard error). When surveyors asked the questions, response rates jumped
up, and when surveyors asked the questions using list randomization, response rates rose even
further.

  We had one final measure of whether or not clients actually used their loans to pay down debt or for household
expenditures. In the study there was a treatment group, which received loans from FMB, and a control group, which
did not. In both groups, surveys were used to measure expenditure. One survey was conducted two weeks after the
first repayment, at the same time that the direct questions were presented. The second survey was conducted much
later. Treatment groups showed higher levels of debt repayment and household expenditure than control groups.

Conclusion

Data on the loan uses of (potential) microfinance clients are important inputs into business
strategy and policy evaluation. We have highlighted some challenges in eliciting accurate
measures, presented some evidence suggesting that data collected by different methods produces
different inferences, and highlighted several directions for further research.

On a substantive, policy level, we learn a key lesson, and suggest a second for further research.
First, we show that clients demonstrate major biases in self-reports on the use of microcredit loan
proceeds. The MFI community often claims and advertises a strict focus on enterprise
investment. Here we find evidence of substantial perception of consumption uses by clients.
More to the point, we find that microcredit clients significantly overreport enterprise investments
and underreport consumption uses to credit officers, and even to independent surveyors. Second,
we also see using the list randomization technique as an interesting tool to determine under what
conditions people deliberately misreport information. This is useful not just methodologically,
but also in that it reveals information about social norms that could be interesting in its own
right. Such analysis clearly could be heterogeneous, and thus using this tool on larger sample
sizes and other topics could provide insightful.

Note that even accurate honest self-reports on loan uses have their limitations, and should not be
considered a measure of how the proceeds were really used. Money is fungible, and hence
observing the mechanical deployment of loan proceeds does not identify answers to what are
typically the greater questions of interest: how does credit access change actual expenditures
shortly after loan disbursal, whether on investment or consumption goods? Identifying such
impacts requires data on a valid comparison group of would-be borrowers that did not get a loan
for some exogenous reason. Future research from this second study, which generates such
exogenous variation by introducing some randomness into bank decisions on marginal
applications, will shed insight into this question.
