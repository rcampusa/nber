In this paper, we estimate the effect of the tax preference for health insurance on health care spending
using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys from 1996-2005. We use the fact that Social
Security taxes are only levied on earnings below a statutory threshold to identify the impact of the
tax preference. Because employer-sponsored health insurance premiums are excluded from Social
Security payroll taxes, workers who earn just below the Social Security tax threshold receive a larger
tax preference for health insurance than workers who earn just above it. We find a significant effect
of the tax preference, consistent with previous research.

I. INTRODUCTION

         The tax preference for employer-sponsored health insurance, under which

employer contributions to employee health insurance are deductible to the employer and

non-taxable to the employee, is perhaps the most salient feature of postwar health policy

in the United States. By making insured health spending appear less costly than it is, the

tax preference gives employees the incentive to take compensation as health insurance

rather than cash. This incentive has had two main effects. First, it has increased

insurance coverage, particularly coverage through employers (see Jonathan Gruber, 2002,

for a review of work identifying this effect). Second, it has distorted the quantity and

type of health insurance that people choose in a manner that has increased health

spending. At the most basic level, the tax preference increases demand for health

services by reducing their price relative to other goods and services. The tax preference

also induces people to channel their spending on health services through insurance rather

than spend out of pocket. This tax bias favoring the purchase of health insurance leads

people to choose health plans with lower deductibles and coinsurance rates, which in turn

further increases spending because of the moral hazard inherent in health insurance.1

Although economists differ about the consequences for social welfare of the effect of the

tax preference on coverage, virtually all since Martin Feldstein's (1973) seminal article

have agreed that the overspending on health care induced by the tax preference has

contributed to the inefficiency of the U.S. health system.

1
 Even though individuals' health plan choices are mediated through employers, there are several reasons to
expect a link between an individual's tax rate and his plan's generosity. First, most individuals with
employer-sponsored health insurance are offered a choice of health plan. According to the Kaiser Family
Foundation/Health Research and Educational Trust (2005), 67 percent of workers in 1996 and 63 percent in
2005 could choose from at least two plans. Second, even employers that offer only one plan choose its
parameters based on their workers' preferences. In particular, M. Kate Bundorf (2002) shows that worker
characteristics, including income (and therefore tax rate), are statistically significant determinants of plan
generosity.



                                                    2
       Assessments of the magnitude of the effect of the tax preference on health

spending have therefore been at the center of health policy debates for more than 30

years. Yet, for two reasons, few studies have convincingly identified the size of this

effect. First, because tax rates depend on income, and income and health spending are

jointly determined outcomes of an incompletely observable process, disentangling the

effect of the tax preference from other, unobserved determinants of income is difficult.

Second, because researchers only observe imperfectly measured proxies for the true post-

tax price for insurance, simple regression estimates of the effect of the tax preference are

biased toward zero.

       In this paper, we use the fact that Social Security taxes are only levied on earnings

below a statutory threshold to identify the tax preference’s impact. Because employer-

sponsored health insurance premiums are excluded from Social Security payroll taxes,

workers who earn just below the Social Security tax threshold receive a larger tax

preference for health insurance than workers who earn just above it. By comparing

health care spending of individuals in families with workers just above the payroll tax

threshold with that of individuals in families with workers who are just below it, we can

identify the effect of the tax preference for insurance.

       Using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys Household Component

(MEPS-HC) from 1996-2005, we estimate a significant impact of the tax preference for

insurance on health spending, consistent with results in the previous literature. The paper

proceeds in the next five sections. Section II reviews previous work concerned with

estimating the effect of tax policy on health spending and describes our methodological

approach. Section III discusses the data we use for our analysis, and presents tabular




                                             3
results which show evidence of a large impact of the Social Security payroll tax on health

care spending. People in families with a holder of employer-sponsored insurance who

earns just above the tax threshold spend 24 percent less than people in families with an

employer-sponsored-insurance policyholder who earns just below the tax threshold.

Section IV imbeds the payroll tax in a more general framework for analyzing the impact

of tax policy on health care spending and provides an estimate of the tax preference’s

effect. Section V uses data from the Community Tracking Study from 1996-1998 to

investigate the mechanism through which this effect occurs. We find that holders of

employer-sponsored health insurance who earn just above the tax threshold have lower

premiums, and thus presumably less extensive health insurance coverage, than those who

earn just below it. Section VI makes some concluding observations.



II. EFFECTS OF TAX PREFERENCES ON HEALTH SPENDING: PREVIOUS

RESEARCH

       As Mark Pauly's (1986) classic review highlights, conventional estimates of the

effects of tax policy on health spending suffer from two sources of potential bias. First,

because marginal tax rates rise with income, and individuals’ incomes and health

spending are jointly determined by an endogenous process, simple regression estimates of

the effect of the tax rate on spending are in general biased and inconsistent. Second,

because researchers only observe proxies for the after-tax price of insurance, and these

proxies measure the true after-tax price with error, estimates of the effect of the tax rate

are biased toward zero. As Pauly points out, these problems are of more than theoretical

concern. The wide range of early estimates of the elasticity reported by Pauly, -0.14 to -




                                             4
1.9, reflect the failure of traditional approaches to deal robustly with these sources of

bias.

         More recent research has taken two novel approaches to address this shortcoming.

One arm of this research uses theoretical models to simulate the effects of tax policy

based on existing empirical estimates of the price elasticity of demand for health

services.2 William Jack and Louise Sheiner (1997) use this parameter as an input to a

theoretical model in which consumers choose insurance contracts and then face random

health shocks. They calculate how much health spending would be reduced by repeal of

the tax preference under various assumptions about individuals' coefficient of relative

risk aversion. They also propose conditions under which extending the tax preference to

out-of-pocket spending can actually reduce health spending.3 Jonathan Gruber (2002)

uses a simulation model that highlights the role of firms' offering decisions to show how

spending and employer coverage would change in response to complete and partial repeal

of the tax preference. John Cogan, Glenn Hubbard, and Daniel Kessler (2011) show that

the effect of the tax preference for insurance on health spending can be written as the

product of two parameters: the price elasticity of demand for health services, and the




2
  The most comprehensive study of the elasticity of demand for health services remains the RAND Health
Insurance Experiment, which found that a one percent increase in the out-of-pocket price led to a 0.2
percent decline in spending (Willard Manning, et al., 1987; Joseph Newhouse, 1993). In a more recent
study using observational data, Matthew Eichner (1998) found that a one percent increase in the price led to
approximately a 0.7 percent decline in spending.
3
  Expanding deductibility has two opposing effects on health care spending. First, it lowers the overall price
of health care relative to other goods and services, thereby increasing health care spending. Second, it raises
the price of purchasing health care through insurance relative to out-of-pocket. The second effect induces
people to shift to health plans with higher deductibles and coinsurance rates which, in turn, lowers health
care spending. Because the base of out-of-pocket spending is so much smaller than that of insured
spending, the net change in the overall price of health care from expanding deductibility is much smaller
than the change in the relative price of out-of-pocket versus insured care. This fact leads the second effect
to dominate the first and, in turn, leads to a net decrease in spending.



                                                     5
effect of the tax preference on the coinsurance rate. 4 They use the simulation results

from Jack and Sheiner (1997) and Martin Feldstein and Bernard Friedman (1977), along

with empirical estimates of the price elasticity of demand, to provide a range of estimates

of the effect of repealing the tax preference.

         A second arm of this research seeks to identify the effects of tax policy

empirically using arguably exogenous variation in the tax rate.5 Jonathan Gruber and

Michael Lettau (2004) estimate the effect of the tax preference using simulated tax rates

as instruments for people's actual tax rates, where the simulated tax rates are functions

only of interactions between state, year, and an individual's decile in the earnings

distribution. They find an elasticity of firm-level insurance spending with respect to the

after-tax price of -0.7. Michael Smart and Mark Stabile (2005) examine the

consequences of the Canadian Medical Expense Tax Credit (CMETC), which allows

taxpayers to claim a credit for 17 percent of medical expenses in excess of $1,637 (2000

tax year) or 3 percent of net income, whichever is smaller. Qualifying expenses include

both insurance premiums and out-of-pocket spending on hospital and physician services,

prescription drugs, and long-term care. Using discontinuities in the CMETC formula,

and variations in the effective formula across provinces and over time, they find moderate

to large tax-price elasticities of demand for health services, between -0.7 and -1.0.

         Each of these studies has important limitations. The consistency of Gruber and

Lettau's (2004) estimates depend on the validity of their assumption that interactions



4
  For simplicity, we use the term "coinsurance rate" to refer to all cost-sharing -- that is, payments made
under an insurance policy's deductible and its copayment schedule.
5
  A related set of studies examine the effect of tax policy on firms' decision to offer insurance, employees
decision to take up insurance, and insurance plan choice (Jonathan Gruber and Ebonya Washington, 2005;
William Jack, Arik Levinson, and Sjamsu Rahardja, 2006). These studies find small elasticities of offer
and takeup, but larger elasticities of plan choice, with respect to the tax preference.



                                                    6
between state tax progressivity and individuals' incomes are uncorrelated with

individuals' taste for health insurance or medical care. Smart and Stabile's approach

requires a similar assumption, and in any event may not be applicable to the effect of the

tax preference on health spending in the United States. On the one hand, the CMETC

only applies to spending on products and services that are not already covered by publicly

financed basic provincial health insurance. Because uncovered services may be more

discretionary in nature, their elasticity of spending may be larger than the elasticity of

spending on all health care. On the other hand, the CMETC applies to both insured and

out-of-pocket spending, while the tax preference in the U.S. applies only to insured

spending. Thus, the U.S. tax preference would tend to induce people to shift to health

insurance plans with less coinsurance, whereas the CMETC would not.6 This effect, in

turn, would increase moral hazard and increase health spending, which implies that the

elasticity of spending with respect to the CMETC would be smaller than the elasticity of

spending with respect to a tax preference for insurance.

        As Gruber and Lettau (2004) point out, their estimated elasticities, as well as

those of Smart and Stabile (2005), imply that repeal of the tax preference would lead to

very large reductions in spending on employer-sponsored insurance. Accurate

assessment of the effect of the tax preference is therefore a critical tax policy issue. In

this paper, we offer an alternative strategy for identifying the effect of interest. We use

the fact the Social Security program limits the annual amount of wage earnings that are

subject to Social Security payroll taxation. Under the Social Security program,

employers and employees each pay a 6.2 percent payroll tax on earnings below the


6
  Smart and Stabile show that, in practice, the CMETC does not affect the demand for insurance on the
intensive margin.



                                                  7
maximum taxable wage (the "wage base"). The wage base is set by law and is

automatically adjusted each year by the average growth in Social-Security covered

wages. (Table 1 reports the wage base for each of our sample years 1996-2005.) For

workers who earn below the wage base, earnings are subject to Social Security payroll

taxes while employer-sponsored health insurance premiums are not; above the wage base,

neither earnings nor premiums are subject to tax..

         This differential tax treatment of earnings creates a differential tax preference for

insurance. Following Gruber and Lettau (2004), we specify the tax price of insurance,

TP, as

                                                  (1     ss   mc ) 7
                                           TP                           ,
                                                    (1   ss   mc )

where τ is the marginal federal income tax rate, τss is the Social Security tax rate, and τmc

is the Medicare tax rate. Thus, for workers who earn below the wage base, the tax price

of insurance is

                                              (1     ss   mc )
                                       TP                           ,
                                                (1   ss   mc )

but for those above the wage base, the tax price is

                                                 (1     mc )
                                          TP                    .
                                                   (1   mc )

In principle, by comparing health care spending of individuals in families with a

employer-sponsored insurance policyholder who earns just below the maximum taxable

wage to spending by individuals with a policyholder who earns just above this threshold,

we can identify the impact of the tax preference on health care spending.

 We compute the marginal federal tax rate by assuming each family takes the standard deduction. We
cannot compute the state tax rates because the MEPS does not have information on the state of residence.



                                                   8
III. DATA

       We use data from the MEPS-HC from 1996-2005. The MEPS-HC collects data

from a sample of families and individuals that is drawn from a nationally representative

subsample of households that participate in the National Health Interview Survey. The

panel design of the MEPS seeks to collect information on each individual in the sample

for two full calendar years. In particular, the MEPS-HC collects the amount of spending

on health care services, wage earnings, and various demographic and economic

information. The MEPS-HC (through the person-round-plan file) also links each

individual with employer-sponsored health insurance to the worker who holds the policy

that is the source of coverage. We limit our main analysis to individuals covered all year

through the same full-year worker who holds a full-year employer-sponsored health

insurance policy. Since in any given year only about 15 percent of all workers have

earnings that exceed Social Security’s maximum taxable wage, our sample pools together

ten years of annual MEPS samples to obtain as many observations on high-wage workers

as possible.



A. Results Using Sample Means

       Because health care is a normal good, we expect, all else held constant, that health

care spending would rise with wages. But if the tax preference provided by the Social

Security payroll tax significantly affects health care spending, its impact should be

manifested in lower health care spending among individuals in families in which the

policyholder earns just above the payroll tax threshold relative to individuals in families

in which the policyholder earns just below the threshold. Thus, if we array individuals




                                            9
according to the earnings of their family's policyholder, we would expect to observe a

monotonic relationship between earnings and health care spending across the earnings

spectrum, except around the Social Security payroll tax threshold.

           Table 2 groups individuals in the 1996-2005 pooled MEPS by the earnings of

their family's policyholder, expressed as a percentage of the Social Security wage base in

their sample year. The table reports the average health care spending level (in constant

2004 dollars, deflated with the CPI) of all individuals within each wage interval. As the

table shows, health care spending generally rises with the earnings level of the family’s

policyholder. Individuals in families with a policyholder earning less than 70 percent of

the Social Security wage base spend on average $1,953 per year in 2004 dollars. As the

wage and salary income of a family's policyholder increases, so does each member's

health spending, up to 90-100 percent of the wage base ($2,406 per year).

           However, individuals in families with a policyholder earning 100-110 percent of

the wage base spend 23.7 percent less on average -- $1,836 per year -- than their

counterparts in families with a policyholder earning 90-100 percent of the wage base.

Given that the tax price of health insurance rises from 0.597 below to 0.692 above the

wage base (see Table 3), this implies a raw elasticity of -1.823,8 which is highly

suggestive of a large impact of the payroll tax preference on health care spending. The

fact that as the wage and salary income of a family's policyholder increases beyond 100-

110 percent of the wage base, health spending begins rising again, to $2,110 for persons

in families in which the policyholder earns more than 130 percent of the taxable

threshold, lends further support to the hypothesis that the drop in health care spending

just above the Social Security tax threshold is the result of the tax preference.

    -1.823 = [(1836 - 2406) / (0.5*(1836 + 2406))] / [(0.692 - 0.597) / (0.5*(0.692 + 0.597))].



                                                       10
       Table 3 shows that differences in the characteristics of individuals and families

are unlikely to account for the differences in spending. The table compares the

characteristics from families in which the policyholder earns 90-100 percent of the Social

Security taxable wage threshold to the characteristics from families in which the

policyholder earns 100-110 percent of the threshold. As the table shows, the

characteristics are quite similar, except for their tax price of insurance. Individuals in the

higher-income group come from families with only slightly more educated policyholders

(15.3 years, as opposed to 15.1 years). The occupation, industry, age, gender, and marital

status distributions show no systematic differences that would explain the observed

differences in health care spending between the two groups.

       The total income of families whose policyholder earns just below the taxable

earnings threshold is 8.0 percent ($8,130) lower than family incomes whose policyholder

earns just above the threshold. This difference is not surprising, but, importantly, rules

out the likelihood that higher family incomes among families in the lower wage group

generated by non-wage sources or other family member earnings explain their higher

health care spending levels.

       Figure 1 presents two breakdowns of the difference in spending between

individuals in families with a policyholder just above and just below the Social Security

tax threshold. The top panel of the figure shows that individuals in families in which a

policyholder earns 90-100 percent of the wage base spend more on both inpatient and

outpatient services (although not on outpatient dental and vision services, which are

traditionally not covered by insurance) than individuals in families with a policyholder

earning 100-110 percent of the wage base. The bottom panel shows average spending by




                                             11
wage income quintile, again for individuals in families with a policyholder earning 90-

100 versus 100-110 percent of the wage base. It shows that spending is higher in every

quintile among those below versus above the wage base, statistically significantly higher

for quintiles 1, 3, 4, and 5 (p < 0.01 for quintiles 1, 3, and 5, p = 0.03 for quintile 4). The

difference in spending is most pronounced among individuals in the top quintile: those

just below the wage base spent $8,973 on average as compared to those just above the

wage base, who spent $6,442.



IV. ESTIMATING THE LINK BETWEEN TAX PREFERENCES AND HEALTH

SPENDING

       Although these results are suggestive, they do not formally control for differences

in individuals and families that may affect both tax rates and health spending. To do so,

we specify a model of the health spending of individuals i = 1,…, N covered by full-year

employer-sponsored health insurance in year t. Each individual is a member of a family j

= 1,…, J that consists of a policyholder who works outside the home for wages or salary,

and that person's spouse and/or children, if s/he has them. An individual has

characteristics Xijt that include age, age squared, gender, and marital status. A family has

characteristics Zjt that include the number of covered family members and the educational

attainment, occupation, and industry of the policyholder. Educational attainment is an

indicator variable denoting whether the policyholder is a college graduate; occupation is

an indicator variable for whether the policyholder is a professional or technical worker

(all other occupations are the omitted group); industry is a series of indicator variables for

whether the policyholder is employed in agriculture or mining, construction,




                                             12
manufacturing, financial and business services, or public administration (all other

industries are the omitted group). Finally, we characterize each family by its total income

Yjt and the wage and salary income of its policyholder Wjt.



A. Models

        Our models specify health spending Hijt as a function of the characteristics of

individuals and families, Xijt and Zjt; a function of family income and the wage and salary

of the family's policyholder, g(Yjt,Wjt); the tax price of insurance TPjt; a family-specific

error term ηj;9 and an individual-specific error term εijt:

(1)     Hijt = θt + λTPjt + Xijtβ + Zjtγ + g(Yjt,Wjt) + ηj + εijt

For the reasons discussed above, simple OLS estimates of (1) are likely to be

inconsistent. For example, because TPjt implicitly depends on Yjt and Wjt, any

misspecification of g(Yjt,Wjt) would mean that TPjt would be correlated with either ηjt and

εijt or both. We therefore estimate (1) by instrumental variables, using ABOVEjt as an

instrument, where ABOVEjt = 1 if the wage and salary income of the policyholder is

greater than 100 percent of the wage base.

        We estimate our model in both levels and logs. When we specify the model in

levels, we assume that g(.) is a cubic function of household income and the wage and

salary income of the policyholder:

g(Yjt,Wjt) = π1Yjt + π2Yjt2 + π3Yjt3 + ρ1ωjt + ρ2ω3jt 2 + ρ3ωjt 3.

where ωjt = is the wage and salary income of the policyholder, expressed as a percentage

of the wage base. This specification is the simplest one for a "fuzzy" regression


9
 This specification of the error structure allows unobserved determinants of health spending to be
arbitrarily correlated both within families and over time.

B. Results

        Table 4 presents OLS and instrumental variables estimates of the effect of the tax

preference for insurance on health spending from (1) and (2). The OLS estimates from

(1) and (2) (in columns (1) and (2)) suggest that the tax price of insurance has a small and

statistically insignificant effect on spending on health services by individuals in families

with full-year employer coverage. The IV estimates (in columns (3) and (4)), in contrast,

show that decreases in the tax price (i.e., increases in the tax preference) increase

spending. At the average level of health spending and the average tax rate, the IV

estimate in column (3) translates into an elasticity of -0.601. This estimate is slightly

smaller (in absolute value) than the elasticity of -0.741 from the log specification in

column (4). The elasticity from the linear model is statistically significantly different

from zero at the 10 percent level; the elasticity from the log model is statistically different

from zero at the 5 percent level. Hausman tests reject the consistency of the OLS

estimates of both (1) and (2) at the 5 percent level (for the linear model, p = 0.01; for the

log model, p = 0.04), suggesting that endogeneity of TP is a practical as well as

theoretical concern.

        Table 5 presents results from six alternative specifications of (2) to investigate the

robustness of our main result. Column (1) of the table repeats the estimates from the log

model in Table 4, column (4) for ease of comparison. Column (2) presents estimates

from the model based only on individuals in households with policyholders earning

between 50 and 150 percent of the wage base. Narrowing in on the discontinuity leads to

an increase in the point estimate of the coefficient of interest (to -1.280, statistically

significant at the 5 percent level), although the standard errors are large enough that the

estimate on the restricted sample is not statistically different from the estimate on the full

sample. Column (3) reports results from a model that omits everyone under age 18; the

estimated effect changes hardly at all, although the standard error rises slightly. Columns

(4) and (5) report the effect of the tax preference on inpatient and outpatient spending

separately; the fact that inpatient spending is less price-responsive than outpatient

spending is consistent with the results from the RAND experiment and other work that

suggests that inpatient spending is less discretionary. Finally, columns (6) and (7)

replicate the analysis on the earlier and the later five-year intervals covered by the

sample, respectively. Although the effect of the tax preference is not statistically

significantly different from zero in the later subsample, it is of roughly the same

magnitude in both as in the full, pooled sample. A t-test of the difference between the

two subsamples fails to reject that they are equal (p = 0.42).

        We estimated five other versions of (2) to investigate further the sensitivity of our

results. First, instead of narrowing the window around the discontinuity (as is

conventional in regression discontinuity study designs), we estimated (2) using only

observations that were distant from the discontinuity. Excluding the 4,948 individuals




                                              15
from families with a policyholder who earned 90-110 percent of the Social Security wage

base leads to an estimated elasticity of -0.347 (standard error 0.477).10 Second, to

confirm that our result was not due to a few outliers, we excluded individuals with health

spending over $100,000. Excluding the 76 observations that met this condition, we

estimate an elasticity of -0.728 (standard error 0.374). Third, to investigate whether our

results might be due to temporary health shocks and reverse causality (running from

health status to income), we excluded individuals from families with a policyholder who

switched from above to below (or below to above) the wage base in their two years in the

MEPS panel. Excluding these 5,494 observations, we estimate an elasticity of -0.750

(with a standard error of 0.443). Fourth, to investigate the possibility of reverse causality

further, we reestimated the model using only family members other than the wage earner

who holds the insurance policy. Including only these 48,507 observations, we estimate

an elasticity of -1.404 (standard error 0.463). Fifth, we reestimated the model using

placebo instruments that were 10 percent below and 10 percent above the true

discontinuity. Using these instruments, we estimate elasticities of -0.321 (standard error

0.786) and -0.253 (standard error 0.576), respectively.

         We also investigated whether the tax price affects coverage, to explore the extent

to which this channel might accentuate the effect of the tax price conditional on having

coverage. We estimated a model similar to (1), but on a sample of all employed people

whether or not they had full-year employer-sponsored insurance (N = 111,139). We used

as the dependent variable the percentage of the year that the individual had coverage. In

10
  The fact that the estimated effect of the tax preferences is statistically insignificant based on observations
that are distant from the Social Security wage base can be explained by two facts: that the difference in
Social Security tax rates above versus below the wage base is partially undone by differences in income tax
rates, and that there is a positive income elasticity of demand for health insurance that is not fully captured
by our regression specification.

elasticity terms, the instrumental variable estimate of the tax-price effect on coverage is -

0.096 (with a standard error of 0.041, significant at the 5 percent level). We discuss the

economic importance of this effect in Section VI below.



V. UNDERSTANDING THE MECHANISM THROUGH WHICH THE TAX

EFFECT OCCURS

         It is possible that our results could be generated by an unobserved process that is

correlated with a threshold effect of policyholders' wage and salary income but not

caused by tax incentives. To investigate this concern, we test whether earning above

versus below the Social Security tax threshold affects individuals' choice of insurance

policy, as economic theory suggests that it should. This choice may occur at the

employer level, by affecting the set of plans that are offered, or at the employee level, by

affecting the plan that is taken up. In either event, if the estimated effect of the tax

preference affects health spending by altering choice of insurance policy, then individuals

with a greater tax subsidy should be covered by insurance that has higher premiums,11

and this effect should only occur for individuals whose premiums are paid with pre-tax

dollars.12

         To investigate whether this is true, we use data from the 1996-1998 Community

Tracking Study (CTS). The CTS consists of three surveys: an Employer Survey, a


11
   The premium for an insurance policy is identically related to the policy's generosity, as measured by its
actuarial value. Given that a policy's actuarial value, AV, is defined as the share of health spending that the
policy would cover for the average person, its premiums is (1 + L) * AV * E(S), where E(S) is the expected
spending of the policyholder(s) and L is the administrative cost, or load, of the insurance.
12
   Purchases of employer-sponsored health insurance can be made with pre-tax dollars under two
conditions: if the premiums are (nominally) paid by the employer, or if the premiums are paid by the
employee through a Section 125, or "cafeteria," plan. However, premiums paid by employees (even
through withheld salary) occur after-tax if the employer does not have a plan that qualifies under Section
125 of the Internal Revenue Code.



                                                     17
Household Survey, and a Followback Survey. The Employer Survey, conducted in 1997,

collects information about the health insurance policies that the respondent employers

provide (if any); the total premium per employee paid for single-person coverage,

including both employee contributions and the amount paid by the employer on the

employee's behalf; the share of the total premium that is paid by the employer on the

employee's behalf; and employer characteristics (industry and firm size). The Household

Survey, administered in 1996-97, is a national sample of households that can be matched

to the Followback Survey. The Followback Survey, administered in 1997-98 to

organizations that offered or administered private health insurance policies covering

Household Survey respondents, collects detailed information on cost sharing,

gatekeeping, and other characteristics of insurance policies (such as whether the policies

are HMOs, PPOs, or point-of-service plans). For each household with a respondent

holding employer-sponsored health insurance, the matched Household/Followback

Survey sample thus contains detailed characteristics of each respondent's health insurance

policy, similar (although not identical) to the information collected by the Employer

Survey; of each respondent household's insurance policyholder, including his or her wage

and salary income, age, gender, and educational attainment; of each respondent

household's insurance policyholder's firm (industry and firm size); and of each

respondent household (household income and household size). The variables from all

three surveys are described in an Appendix (available from the authors).

       Ideally, to test whether the tax preference affects choice of insurance policy, we

would know for each policyholder of employer-sponsored insurance, the wage and salary

income of the policyholder, the generosity of the insurance policy, and the share of the




                                           18
policy that was financed with pre-tax dollars. However, although the matched

Household/Followback Survey contains information on wage and salary income, it does

not contain information on generosity, and none of the three surveys contains information

on the tax status of payments for employer-sponsored health insurance.

       We approximate this ideal in the following way. Using the Employer Survey, we

run regressions of total premium per employee, Pk, and the share of premiums paid by the

employer (for firms providing employer-sponsored health insurance), Sk, on the firm and

insurance policy characteristics, Uk, where k = 1…K firms. These regressions are of the

following form:

                                          Pk = φ1Uk + εk

                                          Sk = φ2Uk + ηk .

       Then, we construct a vector of firm and insurance policy characteristics Uj for

each individual j in the matched Household/Followback Survey who holds an employer-

sponsored insurance policy, where Uj is defined identically to Uk. With this information,

we calculate for each employer-sponsored insurance policyholder his or her predicted

         ˆ                                                               ˆ
premium, P j  ˆ1U j , and predicted share of premium paid by employer, S j  ˆ 2U j ,

using estimates of φ1 and φ2 from the Employer Survey. Finally, using the matched

Household/Followback Survey, we run regressions of predicted premiums on the

characteristics of the insurance policyholder and his or her household listed in the

appendix, Vj; polynominals in the policyholder's household income, Yj, and his or her

wage and salary income ωj (expressed as a percentage of the 1997 Social Security wage

base); and an indicator for whether the policyholder's wage and salary income was

greater than 100 percent of the wage base, ABOVEj:

where h(.), Yj, and ωj are defined as they are in the health spending models. We

estimate this model on the full sample of all respondents with employer-sponsored

insurance and on the half of the sample with above the median value for the predicted

share of premium paid by employer (85 percent).

       Estimates of υ4 from this model, the effect of earning above the Social Security

tax threshold on predicted premiums, are a lower bound on the effect on actual premiums.

First, the estimate only captures the impact of the tax threshold on the portion of

individuals' premiums that are correlated with their firm and insurance policy

characteristics. Second, using predicted premiums instead of actual premiums leads to

conservative estimates because predicted premiums do not depend on any of the

characteristics of individuals in the firm. Therefore, by construction, estimates of the

effect of the tax threshold on premiums obtained in this way cannot be due to any

unobserved characteristics of individuals that may be correlated with wage and salary

levels and health status.

       Selected parameter estimates from this model (and its logarithmic analog) are in

Table 6. The leftmost two columns of the table present results from the full sample.

Holders of employer-sponsored insurance who earn above the Social Security threshold

have lower predicted premiums, holding constant a polynomial in their wage and salary

income, their household income, and their other characteristics, although this effect is not

statistically significant. The rightmost two columns present results from the half of the

sample who, based on the characteristics of their insurance policy and their firm, have at



                                            20
least 85 percent of their premium paid by their employers. For individuals in this

subsample, premiums are almost entirely paid out of pre-tax dollars. The effect on

predicted premiums of earning above the Social Security threshold is more negative and

singificant at the 5 percent level.



VI.     CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH

        As health policy analysts have long observed, the tax preference for health

insurance is likely a key cause of inefficiency in the U.S. health care system. By making

health spending in general, and insured health spending in particular, appear less costly

than they are, the tax preference gives employees the incentive to take compensation as

health insurance rather than cash -- even if the value of the spending to the employee is

significantly less than its cost to society. In this paper, we use a new identification

strategy to estimate the magnitude of the tax preference's effect on health spending.

Using the fact that Social Security taxes are only levied on earnings below a statutory

threshold to identify exogenous variation in tax rates, we find a statistically and

economically significant effect of the tax preference for insurance on spending.

        Our estimates of the tax-price elasticity of demand for health care spending of -

0.601 and -0.741, depending on specification, are squarely within the range reported in

earlier work. Gruber and Lettau (2004), for example, find an elasticity of firm-level

insurance spending with respect to the tax price of -0.7; Smart and Stabile (2005) find

tax-price elasticities of the demand for health services in the range of -0.7 to -1.0. The

fact that our estimates, derived using a very different method than earlier work, are in the




                                             21
same range should give health policy analysts greater confidence that the true effect lies

in this range.

        The elasticities in Table 4 can be used to simulate how much health spending by

privately-insured individuals would fall if the tax preference were repealed. Given that

the average federal marginal tax rate (including Social Security and Medicare taxes) in

our sample is 35.9 percent (authors' unpublished calculation), repealing the tax preference

would increase the after-tax price of insured expenditures from 0.641p to p, where p is

the before-tax price of health care. Evaluated at the average after-tax price, this amounts

to a 43.8 percent price increase (=0.359p / (0.5*(0.641p + p)). At an elasticity of -0.601

(table 4, column (3)), this increase translates into a 26.3 percent decrease in health

spending; at an elasticity of -0.741 (Table 4, column (4)), this increase translates into a

32.5 percent decrease (1.002*0.438) in health spending.

        These effects, while quite large, are consistent with the results from other

simulation models, including our own work. Among individuals with nonzero health

spending in our sample, the average coinsurance rate, as measured by the share of health

spending that is out-of-pocket, is 32.3 percent. According to Jack and Sheiner (Table 2,

1997), at a tax preference for insurance of 32.8 percent, an effective coinsurance rate of

this magnitude implies a coefficient of relative risk aversion of approximately 1.5. At a

coefficient of relative risk aversion of 1.5, repealing the tax preference in their model

leads to an approximate doubling of the coinsurance rate; this result is similar to the

effect of the tax preference simulated by Feldstein and Friedman (1977). A doubling of

the coinsurance rate from 32 to 64 percent, in turn, would lead to a decline in health

spending of between 13.3 percent (at the RAND experiment's estimate of the elasticity of




                                             22
demand for health services of -0.2) and 46.7 percent (at Eichner's (1998) elasticity of

demand for health services of -0.7).13 Gruber (Table 5, 2002) reports that removing all

tax subsidies for health insurance would result in a 35.4 percent decline in health

spending among individuals who are offered insurance by their employer, expressed as a

percentage point change from its initial value. Expressed as a percentage-point change at

the average (in order to make his estimate comparable to the others), this difference

amounts to a 43.0 percent decline in health spending. 14

           Simulations of the effect of repealing the tax preference based on our empirical

elasticity estimates, however, may either overstate or understate the true effect. On the

one hand, if spending becomes less responsive as the tax preference is phased out and the

level of spending is reduced, then the effects of repeal will be smaller than observational

data would predict. On the other hand, a nationwide change in tax policy may lead to a

larger change in coinsurance rates and health spending than observational data based on

small differences in marginal tax rates would predict. Amy Finkelstein (2007), for

example, shows that the change in hospital spending associated with the introduction of

Medicare was far greater than the elasticities from the RAND Experiment would have

predicted. In addition, our estimates are based on the elasticity of behavior of individuals

at the upper end of the income distribution (i.e., around the Social Security threshold); the

elasticity at the mean income may be either larger or smaller.

           Our estimates of the effect of the tax preference on coverage are quite modest,

consistent with the findings of other work (Gruber and Washington, 2005). As discussed

above in Section IV, the elasticity of the number of days of insurance coverage with


13
     That is, 0.133 = 0.2*(0.32 / (0.5*(0.32+0.64))) and 0.467 = 0.7*(0.32 / (0.5*(0.32+0.64))).
14
     That is, 0.43 = (0.354 / (.5*(0.354+(1-0.354)))).



                                                      23
respect to TP is -0.096 in this population, which means that even complete repeal of the

tax preference would lead to only a 4.2 percent decrease in the number of covered days;15

at an average coverage rate of 92 percent, this translates into a decrease of 14 days

(authors' unpublished calculation). This finding has two implications. First, subject to

the caveats above, it implies that repealing the tax preference would likely have little

effect on coverage for the full-year employed population that is the subject of our study.

Second, it implies very small consequences for health spending. Using the estimates of

the effect of coverage on health spending from Jack Hadley et al. (2008), decreasing

coverage by 14 days would decrease expenditures by around $85 per year per person, or

approximately 2 percent.16

         Future work might seek to investigate the effect of the tax preference on health

outcomes. The RAND Experiment found no significant effect of the tax preference on

insurance generosity for the average adult, which, combined with our estimates, would

suggest that the tax preference for insurance leads to massive inefficiency in the

allocation of resources. However, the RAND Experiment did find some effects of health

spending for vulnerable subpopulations, and in any event is now based on medical

technology that is considerably out-of-date. Without better information about how health

spending currently affects health, translating the findings of this paper into implications

for social welfare must necessarily be left to future research.




15
   From above, repeal of the tax preference represents a 43.8 percent increase in TP , which implies a 4.2
percent decrease in the number of covered days because -0.042 = 0.438 * -0.096.
16
   Hadley et al. (2008) calculate that spending per year for a full-year insured person is $3,915, or $10.73
per day; spending per year for a full-year uninsured person is $1,686, or $4.62 per day. Thus, decreasing a
person's coverage by 14 days would lead to a decline in spending of $85 = 14*($10.73 - $4.62), or 2.4
percent on a base of $3,593 (= $3,915*(335/365)).

     Notes: *, **, *** denote significance at the 10, 5, and 1 percent levels, respectively.
     Heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors are in parentheses. One observation is one
     employer-sponsored-insurance policyholder. Based on matched Household and Followback
     Survey data from the 1996-1998 Community Tracking Study. Predicted premiums and the
     percentage of predicted premiums paid by the employer imputed based on the characteristics of
     the policyholder's insurance policy and the policyholder's employer (industry and firm size). In
     regressions but not reported in table are age fixed effects, CTS site fixed effects (approximately
     equal to MSA fixed effects), and coefficients on gender, marital status, family size, and
     education.
