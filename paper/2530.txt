     Using the Goldfeld and Quandt switching regression method, this paper
     investigates variability over 1915-85 in the risk components of bank and

     saving and loan stock. We develop evidence that the market-beta, interest:

     sensitivity,   and     residual   risk of deposit-institution stock vary
     significantly during this period. Reassessing previous event studies in

     light of these findings suggests that event-study methods tend to overreach

     their data.

       CHANGE IN MARXET ASSESSMENTS OF DEPOSIT-INSTITUTION RISKINESS



I. Introduction:

     Testifying before the House of Representatives in December 1984, the

U.S. Comptroller of the Currency posed the following questions:

        Is banking becoming riskier? Are large banks riskier than
        small banks? What effect has interest rate deregulation
        had on the risks faced by the banking system?.. We do not
        have good answers to these questions.

     This paper deploys statistical methods to develop new evidence on these

issues. Using capital market data for 1975-1985, we investigate temporal

variability in market and interest-rate sensitivity and in unsystematic risk

for savings and loan associations (S&Ls) and three size classes of banks.

During this decade, deposit institutions faced substantial regulatory and

statutory change and interest rates became extraordinarily volatile.

     Our methods focus on estimating the parameters of a two-index model,

allowing the model to switch parameter regimes over 1975-85 in            art


unrestricted way. Coldfeld and Quandts [(1972), (1973), (1976)] switching

regression method (CQSRM) is used to determine the temporal variability of

model parameters. CQSRM employs a search procedure which finds maximum-
likelihood estimates of three attributes of regime variation: the shift

dates, the gradualness of each shift, and the parameters of the stochastic

process which obtain in each regime. CQSRM is applied by Quandt (1974) and

Lin and Oh (1984) to solve specific problems of nonstationarity and Unal

(1985) use the approach as a tool of event study.
                                                                              2




     The statistical findings and the analysis presented in this paper serve

to reconcile some of the conflicting results developed in the literature on

the two-index model and provide grounds for reassessing traditional event-

study methods. We find that the riskiness of bank and S&L stock declined in

the late-l970s, but rose again in recent years. We show that event studies

focusing on the impact on deposit-institution stock of recent changes in

monetary-policy regimes or regulatory adjustments need to control for other

significant sources of nonstationarity. Allowing for this nonstationarity

suggests that at least over 1979-1982 it is rash to attribute observed

shifts in return-generating processes to any particular information event.

2. Model and Data Selection

        This paper's focal return-generating process is the two-index model

developed by Stone (1974). This asset pricing model expands the familiar

market model of asset returns by adding an interest-rate index, in this

application as a quasi-industry factor. Including an interest-rate index as

a second factor could just as easily be justified by I4erton's (1973)

intercemporal      capital   asset pricing model specification. This model

expresses return on asset p as:


        RpPo+fimRm+.BiRi+øp .                                         (1)

   and ft1   are measures of the asset's systematic market and interest-rate

risk;        and    represent stock-market return and a return on a debt index.

Lloyd and Shick (1977), Lynge and Zumwalt (1980), Chance and Lane (1980).

                                                                                3




(1985) investigate the extent to which this model can explain returns on

financial-intermediary stock.

     Using the two-index model raises two major problems. First, one must

specify whatever simultaneous relation is presumed to exist between the

variables. Previous authors deal with what is called "multicollinearity"

between        and R0 by imposing an arbitrary causal ordering. Because theory

does not impose a zero covariance, ømi between the market return and an

interest rate index, the following orthogonslization, is proposed [Stone
(lg74), Chance and Lane (1980)j.


          k - [ O/ Om]       k                                            (2)

An alternative approach is to treat       as exogenous and      as endogenous

[Lynge and Zumwalt (1980), Flannery and James (1982)]. This produces the

adjusted market factor,


      m    m   -[0mi /o]k                                                 (3)


Either an adjusted interest-rate index,       or an adjusted market factor;


C,   may be incorporated into Equation (1). In both cases, orthogonal series

are generated, which eliminate simultaneity by     construction. However, as

Ciliberto (1985) elaborates, using Equation (2) biases t-tests against

interest-rate sensitivity, while using Equation    (3) imposes the opposite
bias. Either auxiliary regression grafts a nonsimultaneous          triangular
structure onto the two-index model. We would      need additional theory to
                                                                                4




specify either that R, drives the interest rate, that R1 is logically prior

to m' or that both variables are governed by omitted exogenous forces.

Because    the parameter space spanned is the same whether or not we impose
either auxiliary regression, this paper employs the unorthogonalized two-
index   model.

       A second problem is to select a proxy for unanticipated changes in R.

One approach is to pick an interest-rate index, estimate synthetic forecasts

xis an autoregressive model, and use forecast errors from this model as

proxies     for   unanticipated interest-rate changes (Flannery and James
(l984a)). An alternative approach is to use changes in the yield on a given

maturity of long-term bonds        to   capture unanticipated changes in interest

rates LScott and Peterson (1986); Sweeney and Warga (1986)). Yet another

approach is to proxy unanticipated changes in interest rates by the
difference between the spot 3-month Treasury bill rate at time t         and   the

forward     3-month Treasury bill rate imbedded in the yield curve at time t-l
(Mishkin (1982) and Brewer and Lee (1985)J. Unal and Kane (1987a) also
examine the impact of choosing between unanticipated and anticipated series

for    both long and   short interest-rate indices. Their analysis indicates

that, although bank and S&L stock returns are not responsive to short rates.

long    rates have a significant effect. This pattern holds irrespective of
whether    interest rates are proxied by errors from autoregressive forecasts

or by components orthogonal to Rm• Relying on Occam's Razor, this paper
                                                                                   5




employs unadjusted holding-period returns       on   long-term government bonds to

proxy the unanticipated changes in the interest-rate index.

     Our   samples are constructed from data tapes      prepared by the Center for
Research   in Security Prices (CRSP) at the University of Chicago. All
commercial banks and S&Ls are selected for which CRSP tapes show monthly

returns for the 1975-85 period.2 Appendix I lists these large banks and

S61s and gives their asset size. To test for possible intra-industry
differences, banks are further classified into three classes.         Following a
suggestion    from Joseph Sinkey, a class of "money-center banks"    is   determined
from Citicorp's competitor list (Sinkey, 1986, p.249). Other banks are
classified as 'superregional" and "regional" banks, based on an asset-size
threshold of $10 billion. Partitioning banks in this way allows for
differences in the extent to which the nondeposit debt of different

institutions is effectively guaranteed by the FDIC and develops classes of

banks that may be presumed to operate similarly. At the end of 1984, the

mean asset sizes of the money-center, superregional, and regional banks are

$73.6, $20.6, and $4.5 billion. Sample S&Ls average $13.7 billion. Total

assets of the 31 banks and 8 S&Ls in our sample are $973 billion and $109.6

billion, respectively. Expressed as a percentage of respective industries'

asset totals, sample banks constitute about 43       percent and sample S&Ls   about

12 percent.

     Equal-weighted   portfolio returns are constructed for each class. The
CR5? value-weighted NYSE and AMEX   stock   index adjusted for dividends is used
                                                                                         6




as   the market proxy. Interest rates are proxied by the monthly holding-

period return         on long-term government bonds, obtained from Ibbotson
Associates (1986). As Flannery and James (1984) point out, "since the

holding  period returns on bonds are negatively correlated with changes in
the level of interest rates, a positive value for P1 implies that the firm's
market value declines when interest rates rise."
3. Estiaatin the Model Over Prior Studies Observation Periods
     Unal and Kane (1987a) emphasize that the qualitative force of empirical
evidence on the two-index model varies with the market proxy and the
interest-rate index used, the time period analyzed, the frequency with which

   are observed, and the number of institutions sampled. Because our
data

sample and model specification both differ from previous studies, for
comparative purposes Table 1 reports how our sample and proxy specifications

behave over the specific time periods           analyzed by Flannery     and James (1984),

Scott and Peterson (1986), and Brewer and Lee (1985).

        In    these studies and    in   our   parallel   runs, bank   stock returns show a

market-beta of considerably less than unity. This finding portrays the
market       risk of bank   stocks as below average. Other studies develop similar

results.      For example, Smirlock   and Kaufold (1987), relying on 1982 data,
estimate market-betas for 23 banks, most of which are below one. They go on
to note that, "This ... is consistent with the ft's reported for bank
portfolios by Flannery and James (1984a, 1984b) and Smirlock (1984)."

       Estimates   of interest-rate sensitivity prove         parallel as well. Bank
stock    returns    are     significantly interest-rate sensitive and            inversely
                                                                                 7




related to changes in interest rates (which means positively related to

holding-period       returns). However, on this issue, conflicting evidence may be
found    the literature. Chance and Lane
         in                                        (1980)   find an insignificant
interest-rate coefficient for the two-index        model during   1972-76. Sweeney

and Warga (1986) report similar results for the sane period. In examining

variation over the 1960-1979 period. Sweeney and Warga report a lack of

interest-rate sensitivity during 1970-1974 and 1975-1979.             They    find

significant interest-rate sensitivity for the 1965-1969 subperiod.

      To permit our results     to be weighed against 1975-79 estimates by Chance
and   Lane      (1980) and Sweeney and Warga (1986), the fourth panel of Table 1

applies our two-index model to the 1975-1979 period. During this era, our

sample banks also show no significant sensitivity to changes in interest

rates. Interestingly, the sample shows a market-beta slightly over unity

during        this   subperiod. These comparisons show that when       our model
specification is applied to our sample banks in periods examined by other
studies, similar findings obtain.
     We next compare results for the portfolio of our 8 sample S&Ls with an

S&L sample studied by Brickley and James (1986). To analyze how access to
deposit   insurance affects stock returns of S&L.s, Brickley and James estimate
shifts in the sensitivity of 561 stock to mortgage bond prices and market
returns. They analyze the period 1976-82. To test for a shift in interest-
rate elasticity and market beta in January 1980, they fit the following

model:

        Estimating these models in the same years with the monthly data of our
sample gives:

Although our coefficient estimates are qualitatively similar to those of

Brickley and James, our negative slope shifts are not statistically

significant.     The loss of significance may trace to the reduced number of
firms    in our sample and to the fourfold reduction in observations that
occurs in moving from weekly to monthly data.

4. Testinw the Parameter Stationarity Wmothesis with Switchinf Rearessions
     Tble 1 indicate, that market and interest-rate sensitivities vary with
the subperiod chosen. To run meaningful     regressions,   one must investigate
the   possibility of model nonstationarity.

       Before drawing substantive inferences from a specific model and data

set, researchers should allow for potential inadequacies in measurement,

sampling, and specification. Empirical literature in finance supporting the

arbitrage-pricing model assures us that generalized market models employed

in policy analysis and as benchmarks for event studies are importantly

misspecified.      Parameters of a misspecified model may be interpreted as

coefficients    of an incompletely or partially Nreduced*   form.    Estimates of

the    parameters of a partially reduced form shift with variation in the
contributions    of various relevant forces whose direct influence is excluded

from the model. Researchers using daily or weekly data (for example) must

anticipate that, over any time interval of more than a few months, movements

in omitted variables (or otherwise misspecified relations) may render the

parameters of included variables nonstationary.            This     potential   for

nonstationarity      imparts unreliability to parameter estimates derived from
pooling time-series data that      are   not put through a battery of prior
stationarity tests.
       Policy   analyses and event studies that neglect nonstationarities caused

by variation in omitted variables run a serious risk of sorting out

empirical evidence incorrectly. Formal tests of statistical hypotheses may

develop either falsely positive or falsely negative results. The likelihood
                                                                          10




of   making false inferences about the influence of included variables grows
when omitted    variables are correlated with included ones. Similarly, the

odds of observing a positive event-study result increases whenever, during

or in the vicinity of an event window, reinforcing movements occur in
variables for which the model does not control. Conversely, the likelihood

of observing      negative event-study results increases when offsetting

movements in uncontrolled forces (i.e., omitted variables) occur during a

study's focal time intervals.

       We employ the Goldfeld-Quandt search routine as a way of developing

policy-analysis or event-study benchmark models that can incorporate the

effects of "relevant" movements in unspecified omitted variables.    Although
it would be useful either for us or for other researchers to identify these

omitted variables and to proceed to endogenize the parameter variation we

observe, our goal in this paper is more modest than this. We seek merely to

extend the range of experimental control to capture movements in variables

that standard pricing models omit. In principle, this extension in       R21t

control renders   the   sequence of   parameter movements estimated by the
switching-regression    technique a cleaner benchmark from which to infer the

influence of actual or potential policy actions.

       The Goldfeld and Quandt ((1972, 1973, 1976)1 switching-regression
method (GQSRM) provides a flexible way to identify changes in the systematic

and unsystematic risks of asset portfolios. The strength of the technique is

that the number of effective regimes, the parameter values in each regime,

the switch dates at which one regime supersedes another, and the gradualness
                                                                                         11




of    each regime switch can all be estimated simultaneously. To explain 0Q5R14,
we    specify the multi-regime two-index model               as follows:

In (4), j      is      the regime index and ej is the regression residual distributed

number of cutoff points. To permit the transitions to occur gradually, r-l

sets of variables Dtj may be defined:

       Maximizing (7) with respect to its unknown parameters gives maximum-
likelihood estimates of: the parameters of the regression relation given in
(4);   the   switch points, z';    and   the gradualness parameters   which measure
the    nonabruptness of the associated structural change. Our objective is to

describe the evolution of the systematic market risk mJ' interest-rate

risk (flu), and unsystematic risk (os) of deposit-institution stock over the

1975-85 period.

       Formally, the analysis has two key steps. In the first step, the number

of regimes operative during the analysis period is found. Initially,

maximum-likelihood values for one-regime (L1) and two-regime (L2) models are

obtained using (7). The null hypothesis that no regime switch occurs is

tested against the alternative that two regimes exist (involving one switch

point). Asymptotically, the likelihood-ratio test statistic, -2 ln

has a chi-squared distribution with degrees of freedom (d.f.) equal to the

number of    restrictions under      the null     hypothesis.3 If the alternative
hypothesis is accepted, we        proceed   to test the possibility of three regimes.
                                                                              13




Then, the null and the alternative hypotheses concern the applicability of

two-regime      and     three-regime processes, respectively. More generally,
whenever the null hypothesis is rejected, the number of regimes is
incremented and the likelihood-ratio test re-run until we fail to reject the

                   4
null hypothesis.

       The second step is to investigate the parametric nature of these
shifts. To illustrate, we may assume k regimes to be established in step

one.     Our procedure would be to remaximize the likelihood function for k
regimes, subject to the parameter-equality constraint under examination,
where    the maximum-likelihood value is written as t. The likelihood-ratio

test statistic -2 ln(L.a/Lg) has asymptotically a chi-squared distribution


with one

       Summarizing, we first estimate the number of regimes that the   two-index
model     obeys.      Once   this number is determined, variation in market
sensitivity, interest-rate sensitivity, and residual variance is examined

across regimes.

       Numerical optimization of the likelihood functions developed in this

paper use routines contained in Princeton University's GQOPT package: the

NMSIMP   (Nelder-Mead Simplex Method) and GR.ADX (an algorithm using the
quadratic hill-climbing method). We use NMSIMP      to   obtain starting points,

which are then used as input into the CRADX to produce parameter estimates

and c-values.

5.     Rave U.S Denosit Institutions Become Riskier?
       For S&Ls   and   three classes of banks,   Table 2 summarizes GQSRM tests of

the   number of regimes in effect during    the   1975-85 period. For each class
of     institution and each regime, Table 3 presents estimates of the two-index

model. Table 3 also notes which parameters         prove significant and reports
regime-switch dates and measures of the gradualness of each switch. Each

class undergoes either three or four shifts in parameter regimes.           Most of
these shifts prove to be abrupt ones and the switch dates have overlapping

confidence   intervals. At the same time,    the pattern of results indicates
that 1975-1985 information flows differentially affected different classes

of depository firms.

       S&Ls and regional banks show an abrupt first switch in early 1976. (For

convenience, we term these first switches the 1976 switch).            Money-center
and superregional banks' first switch and S&Ls' second switch occur at the

beginning of 1977 (the 1977 switch).

       All bank groups experience a second switch near or in 1979, (the 1979

switch). In passing, we note that this was a time of marked changes in

operative     regulatory and monetary policy frameworks.            Table   2 shows
switch   points for money-center, superregional and regional banks of 12/79,

5/79. and 9/78, respectively. The table also provides standard errors for

each estimated switch date. Regional banks second switch is determined to

be gradual rather than abrupt. The switch begins 7 months before the mean

date   of 9/78 and completes itself 7    months after this date.
                                                                               15




    The     third switch occurs for all bank groups in the     vicinity   of 1982
(the 1982 switch), a year of considerable financial and regulatory turmoil.
Except for superregional banks, this switch is determined to be abrupt.

Money center, superregional and regional        banks experience their third
switches    in 3/82, 10/81 and 11/82. These point estimates have standard

errors of 6 months, 5 months and 8 months, respectively.           Using these
standard errors produces wide confidence intervals that include late 1981

and all or most of 1982. Even S&Ls' third switch in 9/81 falls within

interval estimates of the banks' 1982 switch.

     SGrL's fourth switch falls in 9/83. Its standard error of 9 months

includes late 1982 and early 1984 in its 95 percent confidence interval.

The confidence interval for superregional banks' fourth switch is tightly

centered on 10/84.

5.1. Channs in Bank Riskiness

     Table 4 tests parameter-equality constraints across regimes to identify

whether    and how each of the three risk parameters varies. We focus first on
bank groups    noting that interest sensitivity      varies   significantly only

for the superregional group. The bulk of the action relates to changes in

market-beta          and unsystematic risk measured as the regression residual


variance (a).

     Variation in market beta. In the 1976 switch, regional banks' market-

beta declines dramatically.       Market-betas for    money-center     and    the

superregional bank groups decrease at the beginning of 1977, but the decline
                                                                                16




is not statistically significant for the money-center group. A further
statistically significant decrease in market-beta occurs only for money-
center and superregional banks in 1979 shift.
     In the 1982 shift1 every bank class experiences a statistically
significant   increase in market-beta.   In their additional regime shift,
superregional banks' slight further increase in market-beta does not prove

statistically significant.

        temporal variability of the market sensitivity of bank stock may be
       The

described as follows. At the start of our sample period, every bank class
had a market-beta in excess of one. In subsequent shifts, market-betas
decline broadly until 1982. During 1977-1982, bank market-betas fal1 below

unity. After 1982, market-betas increase back above unity.

       These observed changes in the market risk of our very large sample

banks help to explain the low levels of market betas reported in Table 1.

The time periods examined in Table 1 included eras of below-average        market
risk    for bank stocks. We noted that    other   studies that bracket   the early
1980s   develop similar estimates (e.g. Smirlock and ICaufold, 1987). However,

Table 3 shows that banks' market beta lies below unity only during the 1977-

1982 period. Both before and after this interval, these coefficients lie

above unity.     Studies which estimate bank systematicrisk as if it were
stationary improperly pool observations from different regimes.       The
misleading inference, that develop exemplify the dangers of choosing
analysis periods arbitrarily or neglecting the possibility of parameter

shifts.
                                                                          17




     It  is natural to hypothesize that the riskiness of bank stocks should
vary with changes in bank failure rates and (because of regulatory lags)
particularly with the number of banks classified •s problem cases by federal
examiners. Table 5 shows that failure rates and numbers of problem banks
were relatively high in the first two years of our sample and fell back to
lower   levels between 1977 and 1981.      Both series jump sharply in 1982.

These data support the CQSRM analysis of temporal variation in market risk.

Variation in other narameters. Unsystematic risk also falls and rises, but

for the regionals and superregionals also falls again in the 1980s. In the

first     switch, all bank groups experience a significant decrease in
unsystematic risk. However, as early as the 1979 switch, unsystematic risk

begins to rise. During the 1979-82 period of generally high unsystematic
risk, market risk and bank failure rates remain relatively low.

     As noted earlier, little significant temporal variation occurs in bank

interest sensitivity. Positive coefficients occur for all bank groups during

all but two of the regimes delineated. This implies a conventional inverse

relationship between bank stock returns and market interest tates. No bank

group shows significant interest-rate sensitivity before the 1979 switch.

Only during 1979-1982 volatile interest rate era do all bank groups show

significant interest-rate sensitivity.     Our observed great variation in

interest-sensitivity can account for the seemingly inconsistent conclusions

of empirical investigations using smaller time periods and different size

compositions of sample banks. Differences in results may          trace   to

differences in the character of and market environments operative in these
                                                                          18




authors' samples. Once again, we see the importance of allowing for possible

nonstationarities before drawing inferences from regression results.

5.2. A Look at Survivorshio Bias in the Money-Center Croun

     Our sample includes no officially failed banks. However, the Bank of

America and Continental Illinois may be described as quasi-failures. As a

sensitivity experiment, we exclude Continental Illinois and Bank of America

from the money-center group to examine whether these banks distort findings

for this group. Table 6 reports regressions for this edited subsample and

for Continental Illinois taken by itself. Comparing Table 3 and 6 shows that

money-center banks' switch points do not differ significantly between the

two subsamples and that risk parameters behave similarly. On the other hand,

taking Continental by itself shows some substantial differences. Continental

skipped the 1977 shift and developed a negative market beta in 1979. Its

1982 increases in beta move against those for other money-center banks. The

April 1984 shift coincides with an announced increase of $400 million in its

problem loans, starting the rim which led to its de facto nationalization.

In its 4/84 shift, all risk components increase, but with only the increase

in   unsystematic risk proving statistically significant. Continental's
federal rescue appears to destroy the two-index model's applicability,

inasmuch as neither beta attains significance in the post-rescue regime.

Interestingly, in its prefailure period Continental shows no significant

interest sensitivity. As our S&t sample, this may indicate that its deposit

insurer   was absorbing the bulk of interest induced gains and losses dring
this troubled time. The plausibility of this interpretation is also
                                                                            19




supported by the failure of the parameter regime for other money-center

banks to shift in the wake of the Continental crisis.

5.3   Chantes   in S&L Riskiness

       For S&Ls, the last column of Table 4 tests for parameter inequality

across regimes. As do regional banks, S&Ls experience significant shifts in

market and unsystematic risk in early 1976, developing a significantly

negative market-beta and greatly enbanced interest sensitivity. However,

S&Ls show an abrupt second shift in 4/77,            one combining increases in
unsystematic risk and market-beta with reduced interest sensitivity.
     In contrast to the 1979 shift for bank groups, the return-generating
process for our small sample of S&.Ls shows no switch during the 1979-1980
era. S&Ls undergo their third shift in late 1981, with market and
unsystematic risk doubling and interest sensitivity declining to
insignificance.
     In the late-1983 shift, market risk declines and interest sensitivity
rises (both significantly), while the fall in unsystematic risk fails to
achieve statistical significance.
       As we did for banks, we may compare temporal variation in market and
unsystematic risk with fluctuations in problem and failed institutions.
Unfortunately, time series of failures and problem S&Ls are not routinely
published by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. For 1975-1985, Table S
reports, as a proxy for problem S&Ls, the number of S6,Ls whose net worth is
less than or equal to zero under    Generally   Accepted Accounting Principles
(GAAP). We call these institutions GAAP-insolvent S&Ls."
                                                                            20




     Table 5 shows that the number of failed S&I.s   surged   sharply in 1982,
with a parallel rise in CAAP-insolvent institutions. Although the number of
failed S&Ls   declines   significantly in 1984, a second sharp surge in the
number of CAAP-insolvent      S&Ls is observed. This suggests that the reduced

failure rate reflects FSLIC's own growing economic insolvency and staffing

weakness   and not an across-the board             improvement    in   industry

credibility. In S&Ls' fourth regime, market and unsystematic risk reach

peaks for the 1975-1985 period. This peak is consistent with S&L failure

rates but not with the trend in GM! insolvency. With only 8 extremely large

S&Ls in our sample (and most of these headquartered in California), it is

doubtful that the regression shifts we observe are representative of the S&L

industry as a whole.

     Interest-rate sensitivity varies over a far wider range of values for

S&Ls than for banks. Moreover, three out of the four shifts in SM. interest-

rate sensitivity prove significant. During their first regime and third

regime when market-betas were at high levels, SM. interes; sensitivity is

not significantly different from zero. In the remaining three regimes, SM.

stock proves significantly market and interest-rat, sensitive. During the

9/81-9/83 regime, although interest rates were highly volatile, S&L stock

shows near-zero interest sensitivity. This may trace not only to a higher

incidence of adjustable-rate mortgages and to mortgage prepayments in the

last part of this era, but also to the extent of hidden economic insolvency

at sample S&Ls. Deep insolvencies could have forced the FSLIC to absorb the
                                                                          21




bulk of interest induced profits and losses on short-funded positions in

long assets during this particularly troubled era.

5.4 Some Observed Implications

     The observed pattern of coefficient change indicates that the riskiness

of sample bank and S&L stocks declined in the late 1970s, but rose again in

recent years. Of course our sample of banks and S&Ls is not necessarily

representative of banks and S&Ls as a whole. The sample includes only very

large institutions. Moreover, using monthly observations reduces the power

of our tests. The wide confidence intervals that attach to the 1979 and 1982

switch dates are particularly unfortunate. Macroeconomic and regulatory

events taking place in these eras call out for tighter estimates. Daily or

weekly data might let us develop closer estimates of the timing of the

structural changes in return-generating processes.

     This paper does not attempt to link its statistical findings with

particular information events. Although the switches could be shown to

coincide with various information flows, without analyzing a full chronology

of potential information events and considering potentially relevant omitted

variables, asserting such links would overreach the regression experiments

we conduct.

     A growing literature has sought to explain cross-sectional differences

in bank stocks' interest-sensitivity (e.g. Flannery and James l984a, Brewer

and Lee 1985. and Tarhan 1987). These studies all assume interest-

sensitivity is stationary over the periods they analyze. However, because
our findings indicate that interest sensitivity shifted importantly over
                                                                                 22




these    authors' analysis periods, such   nonstationarity needs   to be taken into

account. Modelling this nonstationarity endogenously over time         would amount
to   developing a model of the repricing process for deposit-institution

         6
stock.

6. Reassessina Event Studies

        Several authors use 1975-85 data to investigate the impact of selected

information events on bank stocks. We focus on papers concerned with events

occuring in 1979 (1979 event studies) or in 1982 (1982 event studies). Our

estimated     switch dates establish a perspective from which to reinterpret

these studies.

6.1 1979 Event Studies

        Aharony,   Saunders, and Swary (1986) examine the impact on commercial
banks of the well-publicized October 6, 1979 change in Federal Reserve
operating procedures. Using weekly data and a two-index model, they
postulate the possibility of a parameter shift on this date. To test for

risk changes, they estimate market             risk,   interest-rate     risk,   and

unsystematic risk for the two     years   bracketing the October 1979 announcement

date. For every bank group they examine, tests of risk-parameter equality

uncover no significant change in market or interest-rate risk across the two

years.
        Brickley and James (1986) investigate how modification of insolvency

rules by the FSLIC in 1980 might have affected common-stock returns for

financial institutions. Using weekly returns, and taking January 1980 as the

date that insolvency rules were relaxed, these authors test the hypothesis
                                                                            23




that market risk and interest sensitivity prove lower in the 1980-1982

perio4 than in the 1.976-1979 period. For S&Ls but not for banks,they find

significant decreases in these sensitivity measures.

     In the finance literature, it is commonplace to investigate the risk

impact of regulatory changes in this fashion. Among others, Benston (1973),

Miarony, Jones and Swary, Aharony and Swary (1981), Smirlock (1984), and

Laity and Thompson (1986) employ similar methods. But two problems inhere in

this approach (Unal 1987). First, precise dates for regime switches are

imposed a priori and never tested. Second, possibilities for parameter
change are restricted to a narrow subset of regulatory and legislative

"event dates." Event-study researchers neither identify nor control for the

effects of other information events that might develop at nearby dates. For

example, while Mtarony        Al.   (1986) associate their regression findings
with the Federal Reserve's October, 1979 announcement, Brickley and James

link the same class of regression results to a January, .1980 action by

FSLIC. Failure to impose statistical controls for other information events

increases the probability of falsely accepting or rejecting the null

hypothesis.

     Our method does find switches for every bank group in 1979. However,

because the switch-point estimates have large standard errors, we cannot

tightly bracket the switch dates on the Fed's October, 1979 announcement. 95

percent confidence intervals of the switch dates for all bank groups span
much of 1979. We observe that after these shifts bank groups experience
significant   interest-rate sensitivity, lower market risk and higher
                                                                              24




unsystematic risk.    It is striking that the return-generating process for

our small sample of S&Ls shows no switch in the 1978-1980 era.

    A hallmark of the late 1970s is the many ways in which banking and S&L

regulators  sought to help their regulatees to reduce burdens that deposit-
rate ceilings would otherwise have imposed. For example, Money Market
Certificates were authorized in May. 1978. In this same month the Fed

authorized   commercial banks to offer automatic transfer service (ATS)

accounts. A lawsuit challenging the authority of the Fed and other
regulators to authorize this and various other forms of implicit interest

was denied by a District Court in October 1978, but in April 1979 the Court

of Appeals for that District reversed this finding. Congress was saddled

with a yearend deadline either to authorize ATS iccounts and other popular

regulatory innovations or to see them lapse. After voting itself a three-

month extension, on March 31,1980 Congress legalized the             challenged

regulatory innovations and set up a six-year phase-out of deposit-rate
ceilings on time and savings accounts.

     Presuming a sharp causal connection between specifié monetary or

regulatory events and shifts in regression parameters goes beyond the
inferential reach of the data actually examined. Clearly, given the ebb and

flow of regulatory, judicial, and legislative events, it is rash to

associate parameter shifts (nonshifts) for commercial-banks or S&Ls    in   1978-

1979 with specific dates, who   is   to say which regulatory actions, monetary-

policy changes, modificat!on of insolvency rules, court decisions, or steps

in the passage of the 1980 legislation, competitive developments, were more
                                                                           25




important than other events? A cautious observer can only say that the 1978-

79 period includes numerous developments that might jointly or individually

have supported expectations revisions large enough to induce a shift (or

nonshift) in the return-generating processes for deposit-institution stocks.

6.2 1982 Event Studies

     To put the specific events analyzed by 1982 event studies into broad

perspective,    it is instructive to consider a partial chronology of
information events that might have proved relevant in 1982. Early in 1982,

nonperforming loans increased sharply at large banks and the SEC authorized

shelf-registration. Shelf-registration promised to make it easier for large

firms to issue open-market securities as an alternative to bank loans, in

March a Joint Congressional Resolution held it to be the "sense of Congress"

that the full faith and credit of the U.S. Treasury stood behind federal

deposit   insurance. Other worrisome events in early 1982 include:   Drysdale
Government Securities' slide into bankruptcy by mid-May, the developing Penn
Square crisis, and the LDC debt crisis. The office of the Comptroller of
the Currency closed the Penn Square Bank on July 5. In mid-August, Mexico
declared a moratorium on its foreign debt.    However, negative information
about the value of Latin America debt arrived throughout 1982. In late
summer or early fall the Fed is said to have readopted a policy of interest-
rate smoothing. In November, Congress passed the Garn-St Germain Act, aimed
at forestalling the collapse of the S&L industry. The Act also authorized
Money Market Deposit Accounts and Super NOW accounts. These instruments hit
the market in December, when the Fed also reduced its discount rate to the
                                                                             26




lowest level in four years. Completing the picture, we recall from Table S

that 1982 is a year when the number of failed and problem institutions

surges sharply.

     Thus, 1982 shapes up as a crucial year for the deposit-institution

industry.        Despite these many and variegated events, Lamy and Thompson
(1986) treat the Penn-Square crisis as thi dominant event in this time

interval, using the market model to estimate shifts in market risk and

unsystematic risk for the 100 trading days preceding and 25 trading days

following July 6,        1982.   They find no significant shift in market   risk
between these periods, but a significant shift in unsystematic risk.        They
use this as "evidence of a structural change in the pricing mechanism for

bank stocks after the Penn Square failure."

     Mexico's       moratorium   announcement   in August. 1982 is the only
development we know to spawn four independent event studies [Smirlock and

Kaufold 1985, Schoder and Vankudre 1986, cornell and Shapiro 1986, and

Bruner and Simms, 1987J. Broadly, these studies analyze the response of bank

stock prices on or around the announcement-day for the moratorium. In

focusing on announcement-day     "abnormal returns" or parameter shifts,   these

authors     do   not control for the possibility of parameter nonstationarity

elsewhere in 1982, The flow of information events throughout 1982 provides

reason to believe that deposit-institution riskiness may be fluctuating.

Estimating abnormal returns without allowing for alternative shift dates or

nonstationarities may lead a researcher falsely to accept or to reject

event-study hypotheses.

       Also     ocusing on 1982, Fraser, Richards and Fosberg (1985) seek to

determine     i;a   direction of the impact of Super WOWs on bank shareholder

wealth.   They use a two-index model to estimate abnormal returns, but
without con..xolling for changes in slopes or residual variance. They report
that    '..wh.tle    money    center banks were essentially unaffected by the
announcement of Super NOWs,            (excess returns for) regional banks were

strongly (and negatively) affected.'            However, the significant shift our

methods find in the market-beta for regional banks explains the negative

abnormal returns these authors report as the consequence of an abrupt market

repricing necessary to let these stocks offer appropriate                cx   ante

compensation for their now-heightened market risk.

       Our statistical findings reflect the financial and regulatory turmoil

of 1982.        S&Ls and every bank class we examine experience switches in or

near 1982 that show a significant increase in market risk.            Money-center

banks and S&LS also show increased unsystematic risk. The estimated shift

is a gradual one for superregional banks.          For the other bank classes,

because observed switch dates have large standard errors, almost any date in

1982 could pass muster as a potential switching point.             The overriding

problem is that so many potential events can be identified in 1982 that it

is   presumptuous to label any one of them as the precise cause of the
nonstationarity       our   methods uncover.
                                                                            28




7. Summary
     Two types of evidence are developed in this paper: substantive and

methodological.      Substantively, we show that our sample of        deposit-

institution stocks became riskier investments in the wake of the many

regulatory relaxations made in the l980s. 1979 and 1982 are affirmed as

years when information events substantially affected return-generating

processes for deposit-institution stock. Bank market risk lies below unity

only during the 1977-1982 period. Both before and after this interval, bank

market risk lies above unity. Our methods find bank equity returns to be

interest-sensitive primarily during the 1979-82 era, but SM. equity returns

to be interest-sensitive during the bulk of the observation period.

        Methodologically,   we   show   that   using GQSRN     to     identify

nonstationarities in deposit-institution equity returns       supports     the

hypothesis that information flows have differentially affected different

types and sizes of institutions. These same nonstationarities underscore

the unreliability of traditional event-study methods. It is inappropriate

to designate a potential shift date without also allowing for the effects of

other  information events or controlling for observable nonstationarities in
returns that occur in the neighborhood of a researcher's event window.

                                        NOTES

1. Flannery and James (1984a) and Brewer and Iee                (1985)     focus on the
     relation between banks'    interest-rate    sensitivity and    their balance-sheet
     composition. This leads them to test the interest-rate sensitivity of the

     institutions incl'.tded in their sample. In a related study, Martin and

     Iceown (1977) investigate the importance of extra-market sources of

     covariation. They find significant covariance among the unsystematic-risk

     parameters for financial institutions and suggest that this may reflect

     an interest-rate factor.

2. Although     very few institutions of the size sampled on CRSP                  tapes

     disappeared over the sample period (e.g., Penn Square Bank and Franklin
     National Bank), a survivorship bias is built into this approach.
3. Goldfeld and       Quandt   (1973, p 479)   indicate   that this statistic "appears
     in   finite samples to be well approximated"              by    the     Chi-squared
     distribution.

4. The  conditionality of higher-round tests on the outcome of previous
     rounds of testing means that we should tighten the test criterion to
     maintain   a fixed level of significance. Our procedure may be said to fix

     a maximal number of regimes that might be operative during the analysis

     period.

5.   Again,    although this statistic tests the parameter-equality hypothesis,
     some small-sample bias may exist.
6. A related study (Unal and Kane, 1987) constructs and estimates a model of

     this repricing process.

1. Flannery and James, 1984 (FJ), use NYSE Composite Index as the market
     return.   They use three interest-rate indices. The      interest-rate
     coefficient reported here is estimated using the residuals of an AR(3)
     model for the weekly holding-period return for GNM& 8          percent
     certificates.
2. Scott and Peterson, 1986 (SP), use the 562500 return index and monthly
    percentage changes in 30-year Treasury bond yields as proxies for the
     market index and the interest-rate index, respectively.
3. Brewer and Lee, 1986 (EL), use the value-weighted NYSE and AMEX
     composite index obtained from CRSP to proxy market returns. Their proxy
     for the interest-rate index is the difference between the 3-month
    Treasury bill rate at time t and the forward 3-month Treasury bill rate
    imbedded •in the yield curve at time t-1. The reported estimates are
    obtained from cross-section time-series data.
4. The analysis period is chosen to coincide with that of Chance and Lane
    (1980) and Sweeney and Warga (1986).

Sources: Information on banks is compiled from Kane (1985) and the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation's 1985 Annual Renort. S&L information comes
from FHLBB files and Barth, Brumbaugh and Sauerhaft (1986).
Notes:     "Failure" is defined as a regulator-induced cessation of
autonomous operations. It includes supervisory mergers or acquisitions and
loose forms of conservatorship such as the Federal Home Loan Bank Board's
Management Consignment Program. "Problem banks" are those that are
classified as such by FDIC examiners. "CAAP-Insolvent S&Ls"   is defined as
those S&t..s whose net worth is less than or equal to zero under Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).
