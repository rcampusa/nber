During the last two decades, there has been a significant growth in the share of faculty members at
American colleges and universities that are employed in part-time or in full-time non tenure-track
positions. Our study is the first to address whether the increased usage of such faculty adversely
affects undergraduate students' graduation rates. Using institutional level panel data from the
College Board and other sources, our econometric analyses suggest that the increased usage of these
faculty types does adversely affect graduation rates of students at 4-year colleges, with the largest
impact on students being felt at the public masters-level institutions.

    I.   Introduction

         During the last two decades, there has been a significant growth in the share of

faculty members in American colleges and universities that are employed in part-time or

full-time non tenure-track positions (Anderson 2002, Baldwin and Chronister 2001,

Conley, Lesley, and Zimbler 2002, Ehrenberg 2004, Ehrenberg and Zhang 2004). This

substitution of contingent faculty for tenure and tenure-track faculty is at least partially

due to the growing financial pressures faced by public and private higher education

institutions, coupled with the lower cost of non tenure-track faculty members (Ehrenberg

and Zhang 2004).

         Much attention has been directed to the impact of this growing substitution on the

job markets for new PhDs and the attractiveness of PhD study to American college

graduates.1 The growing use of contingent faculty, coupled with the lower salaries and

benefits that they receive, has also led to a growing movement to have contingent faculty

covered by collective bargaining agreements.2 Somewhat surprisingly, however, very few

studies have addressed whether the increased substitution of part-time and full-time non

tenure-track faculty for tenure-track faculty, on balance, has adverse affects on

undergraduate students, such as less learning, longer times-to-degree, lower graduation

rates, or lower propensities of students to go on to post-graduate study.3 Analyses of such

  Bolge (1995) uses data from a single community college and finds no evidence that students learn less in
remedial mathematics classes when they are taught by part-time rather than tenure-track full-time faculty.
Harrington and Schibik (2001) study a single Midwestern comprehensive institution and find that the
greater the proportion of part-time faculty members that students have during their first semester in college,
the lower the probability that they return for their second semester. Bettinger and Long (2004) use a unique
data set of individual student-record data for Ohio public 4-year institutions to analyze the impact of a
student’s having an adjunct or graduate assistant instructor, as compared to a full-time faculty member
(regardless of the faculty member’s tenure-track status) on the probability that the student takes a
subsequent class in the subject. They find, after controlling for the process by which students are assigned



                                                      1
issues are essential if public institutions want to make the case to legislatures and

governors and private institutions want to make the case to their trustees that improved

funding that would permit increased usage of full-time tenure and tenure-track faculty

members would enhance student outcomes. Absent such evidence, growing financial

pressures faced by institutions will likely lead to a continuation of the increasing use of

contingent faculty members.

          Our study is the first study to address whether increased usage of part-time and

full-time non tenure-track faculty adversely influences the graduation rates of students

enrolled in 4-year and 2-year American colleges and universities. We use panel data for a

large sample of institutions over a fifteen-year period to analyze these questions. The data

come from The College Entrance Examination Board’s Annual Survey of College

Standard Research Compilation data file (henceforth College Board data), the IPEDS

Faculty Salary Survey and other Department of Education sources. After the next section

briefly describes the data and the changes in graduation rates and faculty shares that

occurred during the sample period, section III presents our analytical framework and our

empirical results findings for graduation rates from 4-year institutions. Section IV briefly

discusses some extensions of our analyses and our findings for 2-year colleges, and then

concluding comments follow.

    II.      The Data

          Each year the College Board data contain information on the characteristics of

entering students at each institution, the characteristics of the institution, and the


to or select into classes with different types of instructors that, on average, having a part-time faculty
member or a graduate assistant instructor reduces the likelihood that students will take subsequent classes.
However the effects are small and differ by subject matter – while such instructors reduce the likelihood of
taking subsequent classes in the humanities, they increase the likelihood in some of the technical and
professional fields.

graduation rate of a cohort of undergraduate students that entered the institution at an

earlier date. Our econometric analyses use data from the 1986-87 through the 2000-2001

academic years.4

        The College Board data provide us with information on the size of each entering

class, the proportion of underrepresented minority students in the class, the proportion of

out-of-state students in the class, the average age of entering first-year students, the 25th

and 75th percentile SAT math and verbal scores of first-year students, and total

enrollment at the institution. These data also permit us to compute information on the

percentage of faculty at each institution that is part-time. Information on the percentage

of full-time faculty at each institution that are tenured or on tenure-tracks is available

each year from the IPEDS Faculty Salary Survey. Data on the number of undergraduate

students who receive Pell grants and the average Pell grant per recipient at each

institution each year is obtained from the office that administers the Federal Pell Grant

Program within the U.S. Department of Education.

        The College Board data provide information on graduation rates for full-time

first-year students who entered each institution at an earlier date. The 1986-87 and 1987-

1988 College Board data contained information on the 4-year graduation rate for students

who entered college four years earlier. The 1988-89 to 1997-98 data contained

information on the 5-year graduation rates for students who entered college five years

prior to each of these surveys. Finally, from 1998-99 on the College Board data reports

information on the 6-year graduation rates for students who entered college six years

prior to each survey date.


4
 More recent College Board data are available but our analyses end with 2000-2001 because of the lack of
availability of more recent data from other sources that we needed for our analyses.



                                                   3
         Table 1 presents information on how graduation rates, the percentages of faculty

that are full-time, and the percentages of full-time faculty that have tenure or are on

tenure-tracks changed during the sample period.5 While average graduation rates

increase when the period over which the rates are measured increase first from four to

five and then from five to six years, the 5-year graduation rate clearly trended downward

during the 1988 to 1997 period.6 The percentage of faculty that are full-time at these

institutions also declined during the period by about 5 percentage points and the

percentage of full-time faculty that are tenured or on tenure-tracks, declined by about 2.5

percentage points during the 9 years that we have data for this variable.

         In estimating the impacts of the shares of part-time faculty and the share of full-

time faculty that are not on tenure-tracks on graduation rates, it is important to “match

up” the share variables with the correct entering cohort variables. We assume that the

relevant share variables are those during the first four years that an individual is enrolled

in college. So, for example, the 6-year graduation rates reported in the 2000-2001 College

Board data are for students that first-enrolled as freshman in the fall of 1994. Hence we

compute the relevant part-time faculty and non tenure-track faculty shares that this cohort

of students experienced by averaging the values that their institutions reported in the

1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997 College Board data files. Similarly, the relevant entering

characteristics of these students (test scores, out-of-state status, racial/ethnic status and

age at entry) come from the 1994 College Board data file for this group. Because of the



5
  These numbers are averages each year for the institutions reporting a variable in that year. Sample sizes
differ across the variables in each year because the variables come from three different sources. Appendix
Table 1 presents the same information for smaller sets of institutions that reported data for each variable in
all years and the results for these samples are quite similar.

  Remember these are the graduation rates for the classes that entered between the fall 1983 and the fall of
1992.

need to “match up” data from various surveys, institutional graduation rate data used in

our econometric analyses come from the 1991-92 to 2000-2001 College Board data and

earlier years data are used only to provide explanatory variables.

    III.      Econometric Results

    Our analytical approach is to use our panel data to estimate models in which the 5-

year (or 6-year) graduation rate of full-time students that entered institution i in year t

(Git) is specified to be a function of characteristics of the students and of the institution

(Xit), the percentage of faculty that are part-time at the institution averaged over the first

four years that the students were enrolled at the institution (Pit), the percentage of full-

time faculty that are employed in tenure-track positions at the institution averaged over

the first four years that the students were enrolled at the institution (Fit), institutional

fixed effects (ni), year fixed effects (ut) and a random error term (eit),

(1) Git = a0 + a1Xit + a2Pit + a3Fit + ni + ut + eit ,

where the ak are parameters to be estimated.

           The characteristics of the students included in the model are the average

proportion of undergraduate students receiving Pell grants at the institution during the

first four years after the students enrolled and the average Pell grant per recipient (to

control for the fraction of students from lower income families at the institution), the

share of underrepresented minority students in the entering class, the share of in-state

students in the entering class, the average age of entering students, and the averages of

the 25th and 75th percentile mathematics and verbal SAT scores of the entering class.

Institutional level characteristics included in the model are the average number of faculty

at the institution during the four years after the freshman enroll at the institution and the




                                                  5
full-time equivalent number of freshman at the institution. The graduation rate variable

represents a 5-year graduation rate for most of the sample years, but a 6-year graduation

rate for the last few years. This difference is controlled for in the estimation by the

inclusion of the year dichotomous variables, which also capture the effect of other time-

specific omitted variables.7

        Table 2 reports our estimates of this model for our sample as a whole and for sub-

samples of public, private, doctoral, masters and liberal arts institutions. Turning first to

the control variables, entering freshman students with higher mathematics SAT scores

(and in some specification higher verbal SAT scores) have higher graduation rates, other

factors held constant. Increases in the share of undergraduate students receiving Pell

grants are associated, other factors held constant, with lower graduation rates and in some

specifications, the higher the average Pell grant received by recipients (which suggests

either lower family income and in some cases higher tuition levels), the lower the

graduation rate is – both of these findings suggest that graduation rates of lower income

students are lower than those of other students.8 Neither the proportion of

underrepresented minority students, the proportion of in-state students, nor the average

age of entering freshman is related to the institution’s graduation rate. Finally, increases

in the total number of faculty at the institution, holding constant the number of FTE

freshman are associated with higher graduation rates.

        Quite strikingly, our estimates suggest that, other factors held constant, increases

in either the percentage of faculty that are part-time or the percentage of full-time faculty


7
  We are implicitly assuming here that the difference between the 5- and 6-year graduation rates at an
institution does not vary across institutions.
8
  As Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner (2003) have shown, lower graduation rates for students from lower-
income families reflect factors other than the direct financial cost of attending college.



                                                    6
that are not on tenure-tracks, each is associated with a reduction in graduation rates, The

magnitudes of these relationships are larger at public colleges and universities than at

private academic institutions. Other factors held constant, a 10 percentage point increase

in the percentage of faculty that is part-time at a public academic institution is associated

with a 2.65 percentage point reduction in the institution’s graduation rate. Similarly, a 10

percentage point increase in the percentage of full-time faculty that are not on tenure-

track lines at a public college or university is associated with a 2.22 percentage point

reduction in the institution’s graduation rate. Moreover the estimates in the last three

columns of the table suggest that the magnitude of these effects is greatest at master’s

level institutions.

           Table 3 provides estimates of the coefficients of the percentage of part-time

faculty and percentage of full-time faculty employed in non tenure-track positions

obtained from specifications that allow the effects of all variables to vary within both

public and private higher education by institution type. The magnitudes of these effects

are largest at the public masters’ level institutions. Other factors held constant, a 10

percentage point increase in the percentage of part-time faculty is associated with a

reduction in the graduation rate of 3 percentage points, while an increase in the

proportion of full-time faculty not on tenure-track lines is associated with a reduction in

the graduation rate of 4.4 percentage points at these institutions.9 For each institutional

type, increased usage of these types of faculty has a larger effect on students at public

higher education institutions than on students at private higher education institutions.




9
    The larger part-time faculty coefficient for public liberal arts colleges is based on only 27 institutions.



                                                          7
   IV.     Empirical Extensions

   Several extensions of our analyses warrant being briefly reported. First, one might

hypothesize that increased reliance on part-time or full-time non tenure-track faculty

might have a differential impact on students from different places in the SAT distribution

of American college students. In particular, it may be that low-test score students would

be hurt the most by increased reliance on these types of faculty. However, when we

tested whether this was true, by allowing the coefficients of these variables to vary with

the SAT scores of entering students at the institution (dividing the institutions into three

categories); we found no evidence of differential impacts by average SAT scores.

   Second, one might be concerned that the increased usage of part-time and full-time

non tenure-track faculty at an academic institution is symptomatic of an institution that is

undergoing financial stresses and that other things are happening simultaneously at the

institution, such as reductions in course offerings. Hence, it may be these other things that

are causing the reduction in graduation rates that we observe, not the changing nature of

the faculty employed at the institution. However, when we reestimated our models,

including general educational expenditures per full-time equivalent student as an

additional explanatory variable, the estimated effects of changes in the faculty variables

were very similar to those that we reported above in tables 2 and 3.

   Third, the data that institutions report to the College Board are not audited for

accuracy by any outside group and this leads to concerns about data accuracy. In

particular, we found a number of cases in which the exact same values for the number of

part-time faculty and the number of full-time faculty at an institution were submitted by

an institution to the College Board for a number of consecutive years. While this may




                                              8
reflect the relatively slow pace at which things change in academia or a constant faculty

size at some small institutions, it also may reflect measurement or reporting errors.

However, when we reestimated our models, leaving out institution/year observations in

which the value of either of these variables was identical to the value reported by the

institution in the previous year, on balance we obtained very similar point estimates of

these coefficients.

   Fourth, the College Board data also contain information for many institutions on the

fraction of entering freshman that complete their first-year and the fraction of entering

freshman that return for the second year. This permits us to estimate models similar to

those presented in table 2, save that the dependent variable becomes either the first-year

completion rate or the return-for-second-year rate, and the faculty type variables and

other variables now refer only to the students’ freshman year. However, when we

estimated such models we found fewer statistically significant “faculty type” effects and

those that were significant were of much smaller magnitude than the comparable

coefficients in the graduation rate equations. For example, we found evidence that

increasing the percentage of part-time faculty by 10 percentage points would decrease the

first-year completion rate by only 0.5 percentage points at public colleges and

universities and would have no impact on the percentage of freshman students who

returned for their second year, while increasing the percentage of full-time faculty that

were not on tenure tracks by 10 percentage points had no impact on either outcome at

public academic institutions.

   Fifth, the College Board data contain information for some two-year colleges on 3-

year graduation rates and the percentage of entering freshman that return to the




                                             9
institutions for their second year of study. While tenure-track status data are not available

for these institutions, we found no evidence that increasing the percentage of part-time

faculty members at 2-year colleges adversely influences either of these outcomes.

   Finally, one of the reasons often given for academic institutions, especially research

universities, expanding their usage of part-time and full-time non tenure-track faculty is

because their tenured and tenure-track faculty are spending more of their time conducting

research and less of their time teaching. So the costs to undergraduate students of the

increased usage of more contingency faculty may be offset by a greater volume of

research being produced by the regular faculty at the institution.

   To test this proposition, we employed panel data spanning the years 1989 to 1999 for

our sample of doctoral universities and regressed the logarithm of an institution’s

externally funded real (in 1999 dollars) research and development expenditures in a year

on the logarithm of its full-time tenured and tenure-track faculty, the percentage of its

full-time faculty that were not in tenure-track positions in the year, the percentage of its

faculty that were part-time in the year, and institutional and year dichotomous variables.

When we did this, we found that the holding constant the number of full-time tenured and

tenure-track faculty at an institution, an increase in the share of full-time faculty that were

not on tenure-track lines (which is equivalent to an increase in the number of full-time

faculty not on tenure tracks) had no effect on the volume of external research and

development expenditures per full-time tenured and tenure-track faculty member at the

institution. So use of more full-time non tenure-track faculty is not associated with

increased external research volume for the full-time tenure and tenure-track faculty.




                                              10
       V.      Concluding Remarks

       Our study is the first study that has demonstrated that the growing use of part-time

and full-time non tenure-track faculty adversely affects undergraduate students enrolled

at 4-year colleges and universities by reducing their 5- and 6-year graduation rates. For

any given size increase in the shares of either part-time or full-time non tenure-track

faculty, the magnitudes of these negative effects appear to be larger at public institutions

than they are at private institutions and they appear to be largest at the public masters’

level (comprehensive institutions). Other factors held constant, a 10 percentage point

increase in the percentage of part-time faculty at a public masters’ level institution is

associated with about a 3 percentage point reduction in the graduation rate at the

institution and a 10 percentage point increase in the percentage of full-time faculty that

are not on tenure-track lines is associated with about a 4.4 percentage point reduction in

the graduation rate at the institution.

       Of course the costs of reduced graduation rates must be balanced against the cost

savings that accrue to the institutions from substituting less costly for more costly faculty

members. For example, the average salary of full-time lecturers (most of whom are not

on tenure-tracks) at public master’s institutions was $43,129, while the average cost of

assistant professors (most of whom are on tenure tracks) at public master’s institutions

was $49,725 in 2003-2004.10 Thus, for every assistant professor that is replaced by a

lecturer, an institution would save, on average $6,596, or 13.2 percent. This calculation

ignores that many assistant professors “mature” into more expensive associate and full

professors and that lecturers often teach larger classes and more classes per semester than

tenured and tenure-track faculty. Furthermore, to say that an institution’s 5- or 6-year

graduation rate is reduced when it employs more part-time or full-time non tenure-track

faculty does not tell us whether the reduction implies that the students never graduate

from college or implies that their graduation is delayed one or more years. The evidence

we report briefly on first-year drop out rates suggest that the answer is probably a

combination of both outcomes.

   Cost savings from substituting part-time faculty, who often receive much less

generous benefit packages as well as lower salaries is likely to be much larger. However,

Bettinger and Long (2004) have reported that having a part-time faculty member as an

instructor, on average, leads to a decreased likelihood that a student will take subsequent

classes in a subject, which surely is an additional cost to students. The impact of both

types of substitution on a whole range of issues including faculty governance, student

advising, and curriculum development and the evolution of the curriculum must all be

addressed in a more complete cost/benefit analysis of these changes.
