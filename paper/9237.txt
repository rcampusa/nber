                                      ABSTRACT

       Since Max Weber, there has been an active debate on the impact of religion on people’s
economic attitudes. Much of the existing evidence, however, is based on cross-country studies in
which this impact is confounded by differences in other institutional factors. We use the World
Values Surveys to identify the relationship between intensity of religious beliefs and economic
attitudes, controlling for country fixed effects. We study several economic attitudes toward
cooperation, the government, working women, legal rules, thriftiness, and the market economy. We
also distinguish across religious denominations, differentiating on whether a religion is dominant
in a country. We find that on average, religious beliefs are associated with “good” economic
attitudes, where “good” is defined as conducive to higher per capita income and growth. Yet
religious people tend to be more racist and less favorable with respect to working women. These
effects differ across religious denominations. Overall, we find that Christian religions are more
positively associated with attitudes conducive to economic growth.

       Economists, sociologists, and political scientists have long been interested in

explaining the economic success of certain countries and the persistent poverty of others.

In search of the ultimate cause, an obvious role has been suggested for religion. There is

hardly an aspect of a society’s life that is not affected by religion. Why shouldn’t it affect

a country’s ability to produce efficiently and grow?

       Max Weber (1905) was the first to identify the significant role that religion plays

in social change. He went as far as to state that the Protestant Reformation triggered a

mental revolution that made possible the advent of modern capitalism.

       Almost a century after Weber’s seminal work, the importance of religion in

explaining the prosperity of nations seems to be experiencing a rebirth. While scholars

prefer to avoid correlating religion directly with economic prosperity, they try to relate it

to fundamental institutions that have been shown to be conducive to growth. In his study

of development across Italy, for instance, Putnam (1993) attributes the prevailing lack of

trust toward others in the South to the strong Catholic tradition, which emphasizes the

vertical bond with the Church and tends to undermine the horizontal bond with fellow

citizens. In a cross-country study, both La Porta et al. (1997) and Inglehart (1999) find

some evidence for this theory. On a similar note, Landes (1998) attributes the failure of

Spain to develop in the 16th and 17th century to the culture of intolerance diffused by the

Catholic Church, which forced some of the most skillful people out of the country.

Finally, Stulz and Williamson (2001) attribute the low level of creditors’ protection

present in Catholic countries to the anti-usury culture pervasive in the Catholic tradition.

       Unlike Weber, most of these authors provide compelling evidence in favor of

their claim, showing a robust correlation between a country’s main religion and these




                                              2
institutions. Such evidence, however, can be interpreted in two ways. One possible

interpretation is that there is something intrinsic to certain religions, such as Catholicism,

that makes them inimical to the development of talents and institutions that foster

economic growth. An alternative interpretation, which is equally consistent with the

results, is that there was something in the past (correlated with religion, but not

necessarily religion) that trapped a country in a bad equilibrium. According to this

interpretation, there is nothing fundamental, but it is hysteresis that keeps a country

trapped in this equilibrium. A possible variation of this hypothesis, which is

observationally equivalent to the previous one, is that there were some aspects of a

religion, in this case Catholicism, that were inimical to the development of certain

institutions, for example trust, but that these aspects disappeared over time, possibly

because of a reform.

        While the difference between the two hypotheses seems rather uninteresting from

a historical point of view, from a policy perspective it is very important. If the first

alternative is true, then short of changing a country’s religion (a task beyond the power

even of the World Bank), there is very little hope for bringing prosperity to many poor

countries. By contrast, the second alternative provides some hope. It is sufficient to find a

coordinating device to escape the bad equilibrium trap without trying to change people’s

religious beliefs.

        Unfortunately, the existing cross-country analysis cannot distinguish between

these two hypotheses. To identify the effect of religion separately from the effect of other

historical accidents, we have to resort to a within country analysis. Such an analysis

cannot be conducted in one country alone, because the role of a religion might depend




                                              3
highly upon the social and historical context in which it developed. To address this issue

in this study, we use a dataset containing data on individuals for a large set of countries.

The World Values Survey is actually a collection of surveys administered to a

representative sample of people in 66 countries from 1981 to 1997. These questionnaires

contain information not only about religious affiliation, but also about the intensity of

beliefs (frequency of attending religious services) and how the interviewee was raised

(religiously or not). Thus, we are able to study the relation between the degree of

religiosity and the type of religion on a series of fundamental societal attitudes that have

been shown to be conducive to higher productivity and growth.

       We analyze the relation between religion and six groups of variables: people’s

attitudes toward cooperation, women, government, legal rules, the market economy and

its fairness, and thriftiness. As measures of attitudes toward cooperation, we use

individual responses to questions regarding how much one trusts other people in general

and how tolerant individuals are toward neighbors of different races and/or countries. As

measures of attitude toward women, we use responses to a variety of questions ranging

from who should get a job first, a man or a woman, when jobs are scarce; whether men

should have priority in obtaining university education; and whether both men and women

should contribute to household income. As measure of attitudes toward the government,

we use individual responses on how much people trust the government and other

government institutions. As measures of attitude toward legal norms, we use individual

responses regarding trust of the legal system and willingness to break the law, including

cheating on taxes, avoiding a fare on public transportation, or paying bribes. The World

Values Survey asks people to state their position along the efficiency versus equity trade




                                             4
off. The interviewer shows a card to the respondent in which there are two opposite

statements at the extremes of a 1 to 10 interval. The respondent chooses the number that

best describes his or her relative position. Questions range from whether people think pay

inequality is necessary to provide better incentives to whether competition brings out the

worst in people or stimulates hard work and new ideas. Finally, to measure people’s

attitudes toward thriftiness, we use responses to a question concerning whether it is

especially important to instill the “virtue” of thriftiness in children.

          To isolate the effect of religion from other confounding effects, we control for

country fixed effects and several individual characteristics: health status, age, sex,

education, income, and perceived social status.

          We find that on average religion is associated positively with attitudes that are

conducive to free markets and better institutions. Religious people trust others more, trust

the government and the legal system more, are less willing to break the law, and are more

likely to believe that markets’ outcomes are fair. The relation between religiosity and

market mechanisms (incentives, competition, and private property) is more mixed. On the

negative side, religious people are more intolerant and less sympathetic to women’s

rights.

          The aspect of religion that is associated with economic attitudes is different

across the intensity of religious beliefs. Trust toward others is associated mostly with

religious participation, not religious upbringing. By contrast, intolerance is mostly an

outcome of being raised religiously. Active churchgoers are not more intolerant toward

immigrants than the rest of the population (but not less either) and they are less




                                               5
sympathetic to women’s rights. Finally, both a religious upbringing and active religious

participation increase trust toward government institutions.

       We find that different religions have different effects on people’s attitudes.

Participation to religious services increases trust only among Christians. The effect is

zero or even negative for other denominations. Within the Christian family, the effect is

stronger for Protestant than for Catholics, as suggested by Putnam (1993).

       The relation between religion and intolerance is present in all religious

denominations. The only exception is Buddhists who are more tolerant than non-religious

people. Hindus and Muslim are the less tolerant towards immigrants and other races,

followed by Jews, Catholics and Protestants. The point estimates for Protestants and

Catholics are very similar, while based on previous studies one would have expected less

tolerance from Catholics (Landes, 1998). Active participants in any religion trust the

government more than non- religious people, with the only exception of Buddhists. The

effect is stronger for Hindus and Muslim, weaker for Catholics and Protestant. Similarly,

all religious denominations are associated with a more conservative attitude toward

women. However, the effect is much stronger for Muslims.

       Judaism has the strongest negative impact on the willingness to cheat on taxes,

followed by Protestantism (second), Catholicism and Hinduism (third), and Islam

(fourth). The ranking changes somehow when it comes to accept a bribe. The strongest

negative effect is for Buddhist, with Protestants and Muslim next, and Catholics last.

Protestants are the only religious group that favors incentives. This result vindicates

Weber’s claims.




                                             6
       Religious denominations also differ in their attitude toward private ownership.

Observant Catholics support private ownership twice as much as Protestants, while

Muslims and Hindus are strongly against competition. Finally, with the exception of

Buddhists, religious people of all denominations are more inclined to believe that poor

people are lazy and lack will power. The effect is stronger for Protestants than Catholics.

       Overall, we find that Christian religions are more positively associated with

attitudes conducive to economic growth, while religious Muslims are the most

antimarket. Within Christian denominations, the ranking is unclear: Protestants are more

trusting and favor incentives more, Catholics are more thrifty and favor private property

and competition more.

       The rest of the paper proceeds as follow. Section I briefly reviews the theoretical

priors on the economic effects of religion. Section II presents the dataset we use and our

measure of religious affiliation and attitude toward cooperation, government, legal rules,

and the market economy. Section III reports the results of the effects of religion in

general, while Section IV differentiates across religious denominations. Section V

concludes.



I. Theoretical Predictions

       An excellent survey of the theoretical debate on the links between religion and

economic development is provided by Steuart (1998). Without aspiring to be exhaustive,

we now summarize the main points of this debate.

       The earliest crucial point was the direction of causality. On the one hand,

Feuerbach and Marx see religion as a mere reflection of human life. In his Criticism of




                                             7
Hegel's Law, Marx (1844) states: "The grounds of the unreligious critique is man made

religion, religion does not make man... Religious misery is, by one side, an expression of

the real misery. Religion is the exhausted creature's sigh, the state of animus of a

heartless world, the spirit of spiritless situations. Religion is the people's opium.”

       Weber was of the opposite view. In his classic “The Protestant Ethic and the

Spirit of Capitalism,” Weber attributes the emergence of the spirit of capitalism to the

development of a Protestant ethic. Weber’s Protestant ethic results from the interaction of

the doctrine of salvation and the concept of good works. It was Luther who decisively

altered the Christian concept of good works by prescribing the “fulfillment of duties in

worldly affairs as the highest form which the moral activity of the individual could

assume” (Weber, 1905).

       Eisenstadt moves away from an analysis of a direct causal link between

Protestantism and capitalism to focus on the “transformative potential” of religions. The

transformative potential refers to the “capacity to legitimize, in religious or ideological

terms, the development of new motivations, activities, and institutions which were not

encompassed by their original impulses and views” Eisenstadt (1968). Eisenstadt’s main

thesis is that Protestantism redefined political and social institutions, and impacted on the

reformulation of roles within the economic sphere.

       Eisenstadt’s concept of transformative potential is also useful in assessing the

potential impact of other religions, such as Hinduism. Given the multiplicity of gods and

sects, it is very difficult to identify a clear position of Hinduism toward economic

activity. In particular, the stereotype that portrays Hindu as ascetic and uninterested in the

material world can be rejected easily. In the Panchatantra we find statements such as




                                               8
“wealth gives constant vigor, confidence and power” and “poverty is a curse worse than

death” (Uppal, 1986).       Nevertheless, according to Eisenstadt, the highly ritualistic

behavior promoted by Hinduism is less likely to facilitate the development of more

systematic efforts in any field of activity.

        We encounter similar problems when we analyze Islam. While the Sunnah

prohibits the formation and conclusion of aleatory contracts based on chance (Jomo,

1992), many verses of the Quaran encourage effort and improvement. Thus, the

underdevelopment of many Islamic countries cannot be attributed to Islam per se, but is

possibly due to the development, somewhere in between the ninth and the eleventh

century, of inflexible political and legal institutions in the Islamic world designed to

discourage growth values and practices and aimed at preserving the status quo.

        More recently, the debate has focused on the impact of religion on specific

attitudes that might promote or hamper growth, rather than on differences in the

Weltanschauung fostered by different religions. Putnam (1993) for instance, focuses on

trust and claims that the Catholic tradition, which emphasizes the vertical bond with the

Church rather than a horizontal bond with fellow citizens, has a negative impact on

people’s average level of trust in others. Landes (1998) focuses on tolerance and claims

that the culture of intolerance diffused by the Catholic Inquisition negatively affected the

ability of Catholic countries to grow.

        We follow this more recent literature in considering religious beliefs as low

frequency variables, based on religious teachings, which affect people’s attitudes towards

the economic system. These religious teachings do not necessarily reflect the authentic

message contained in the sacred texts. They simply represent the way certain religion




                                               9
beliefs became crystallized over time and the way they are taught and transmitted from

one generation to the next. As a result, even if we were willing to interpret in a causal

way the negative correlation between attitudes towards private property and the Muslim

religion, we do not want to say that this is Mohammed’s or the Quaran’s fault, but simply

the effect of the Muslim cultural tradition and the way it has evolved as a result of

historical circumstances.



Existing empirical studies

       In his survey on the economics of religions, Iannaccone (1998) claims that “the

most noteworthy feature of the Protestant Ethic thesis is its absence of empirical

support.” In fact, work by Samuelsson (1993) and Tawney (1926) shows that most of the

capitalist institutions described by Weber were antecedent to the Protestant Reformation.

        However, this evidence only rejects the specific channel proposed by Weber, not

a more general link between the Protestant ethic and the development of a capitalist

attitude. In fact, in a cross-country study of former British, French, and Spanish colonies,

Grier (1997) shows that Protestantism is correlated positively with growth and

development.

       To verify or disprove Weber’s thesis, however, it is necessary to go past the fact

that the Protestant countries have been more successful economically. This was the fact

that motivated Weber in the first place, so it cannot be used to test his theory.

       Blum and Dudley (2001) make an important step in this direction. First, they

refine Weber’s thesis. They argue that Protestantism, by rejecting the Catholic sacrament

of penance and increasing the individual penalty for defaulting, improved the level of




                                             10
mutual trust and cooperation. Second, they use this theory to explain why wages rose in

Protestant cities between 1500 and 1750, while at the same time the wages in Catholic

cities fell.

         The recent literature can be distinguished between macro and micro studies. The

macro literature focuses on cross-countries studies. La Porta et al. (1997) and Inglehart

(1999) provide evidence in favor of Putnam’s argument that Catholic countries have a

lower level of trust. Barro and McCleary (2002) find that economic growth responds

positively to the extent of religious beliefs, but negatively to church attendance. Finally

Stulz and Williamson (2001) claim that countries permeated by Catholic culture, with its

traditional anti-usury bent, tend to protect creditors’ rights less.

         The problem with these studies is that there are too many institutional differences

across countries and too few degrees of freedom to identify the specific effects of

religions separately. For example, it is impossible to distinguish whether the ultimate

effect is due to the country’s main religion or to some other characteristics correlated

with the beliefs of the dominant religion. Country-fixed effects would solve this

identification problem, but they cannot be used in this framework.

         At the micro level, there are several studies on the effects of religion on economic

outcomes. Religion seems to affect wages (Chiswick, 1983), school attendance (Freeman,

1986), health (Ellison, 1991), and criminal behavior (Evans et al., 1995). Yet, there are

problems with these studies. First, there is an issue of endogeneity: “good kids may avoid

drugs, stay in school, and go to church” (Freeman, 1986). Thus, it is far from clear that

the correlation is causal. Second, these studies are based on a single country (generally

the United States). Thus, they can hardly be generalized to other countries. Finally, they




                                               11
focus on the correlation between religion and outcomes, not attitudes. Outcomes are the

result of attitudes but also of the surrounding environment. For example, ceteris paribus

Catholics in the United States tend to have higher wages (not as high as Jews, but higher

than other religions). But this success is generally attributed to the quality of their

educational system. Thus, it is not necessarily Catholicism per se that makes them more

successful in life, but rather the interaction between the educational system and Catholic

Church organizations in the United States. It would be very dangerous, therefore, to

extrapolate this result to Latin America and to claim for example, that Catholicism would

have a positive influence on the standard of living there.

        In sum, more than one hundred years after its inception, the debate on the

economic effects of religion is far from settled. The complexity and variety of every

religion make it impossible to reach any conclusion on purely theoretical grounds. On the

other hand, empirical work is plagued by identification problems.



Our Empirical Strategy

        We plan to overcome these problems in the following ways. First, we will control

for individual country effects, eliminating the impact of other institutional variables. This

approach runs the risk of underestimating the effect of religion to the extent its impact

has been absorbed fully in the national culture.1 Nevertheless, what we find can be

attributed more credibly to religion.

        Second, we use religious upbringing to identify the effect of religion that is

independent of individual characteristics, particularly those that are unobservable to us.


1
  For example, the Italian philosopher Benedetto Croce stated that the Christian tradition has affected the
Italian culture so much that Italian cannot be considered non-Christian even if they are atheists.


                                                    12
       Third, we reduce the effect of potentially spurious factors by looking at people’s

attitudes rather than at their economic outcome. Asking somebody his view on cheating

on taxes is different from asking him if he has cheated on his taxes. The first question,

however, is more appropriate for our purposes than the second. The decision of whether

to actually cheat is affected greatly by the probability of being caught. This is a function

of a country’s law enforcement, not of an individual’s attitude. Therefore, looking at

attitudes is a better way of identifying the effect of religious beliefs on people’s

preferences.

       In spite of all these improvements, we are well aware of the difficulty in

interpreting the observed correlations as causal effects. The traditional latent variable

critique (that a latent variable causes people both to be more religious and to behave in a

certain way) can be applied even to religious upbringing, as long as we are willing to

assume that this latent variable can be transmitted from parents to children (either

genetically or through education). For this reason, we prefer to interpret our results as

more precisely estimated partial correlations. Even when, to simplify the exposition, we

will talk about the “impact” of religion, the reader should interpret this as mere

correlation.

       We choose as our dependent variables attitudes that might have an important

economic impact. Our variables can be grouped into six categories; attitudes toward: 1)

trust and cooperation; 2) women; 3) the government; 4) the law; 5) the market and its

fairness; 6) thriftiness. We chose the first set of variables because trust and cooperation

have been shown to be relevant for economic growth (Knack and Keefer, 1997, Knack

and Zak, 2001). Also, Landes (1998) claims that intolerance has negative impact on




                                            13
growth. We chose to look at attitudes toward women because of their obvious link with

the labor market participation decision and thus with a country’s endowment of labor. We

looked at attitudes toward the government because political instability has been shown to

be detrimental for growth (e.g. Barro, 1991) and investments (e.g. Alesina and Perotti,

1994). Attitudes toward the law are important because they affect a country’s law-and-

order tradition, which in turn affects financial development (La Porta et al, 1997) and

finally growth. One of the variables analyzed here is the attitude toward corruption,

which has been shown to be detrimental to growth (Mauro, 1995). Pro-market policies

are widely believed to favor growth, and Easton and Walker (1997) provide systematic

evidence for this. Finally, we look at attitudes toward thrift not only for historical reasons

(Weber attributed the success of Capitalism in certain countries to Protestants’ superior

thrift), but also because of its importance in the modern theory of growth.



II. The Data

Description of the World Value Survey

       The World Values Survey (WVS) is a cross-country project coordinated by the

Institute for Social Research of the University of Michigan, under the direction of Ronald

Inglehart. Each wave carries out representative national surveys of the basic values and

beliefs of individuals in a large cross-section of countries. This questionnaire contains

information about demographics (sex, age, education, etc.), self-reported economic

characteristics (income, social class), and answers to specific questions about religion,

political preferences, and attitudes.




                                             14
        We use the last three waves that are available (1981-4, 1990-3 and 1995-7).

Respondents come from 66 independent countries. These countries include almost 80

percent of the world's population. The coverage of countries varies across surveys. The

1981-3 survey covered 22 independent countries and Northern Ireland; the 1990-3 survey

expanded to cover 42 independent countries, Northern Ireland, and greater Moscow; the

1995-7 survey covered 54 independent countries.

        Being a large and very complex dataset, the WVS suffers from some coding

problems. Even after implementing all the changes suggested by the codebook, we found

that a few countries have a distribution of religious denominations that is very different

from the one reported in the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) factbook. To be on

the safe side, we eliminated these country-years.2 We might thus be eliminating valid

observations for countries where the survey weights are very different from the

population weights. Nevertheless, we think this procedure does not introduce any clear

bias, while the opposite type of error would.

        We were also forced to drop a few countries because of missing data on some

other variables that are crucial for our analysis (these countries included Canada, South

Korea, Pakistan, China, the Czech Republic and Slovakia). The summary statistics for the

remaining countries are presented in Table 1.




2
  As a result, we dropped Australia (1,228 obs.) for the 1981 wave; Canada (1,730 obs.) and Nigeria (1,001
obs.) for the 1990 wave; Taiwan (1,452 obs.), Nigeria (2,767 obs.), Ghana (95 obs.) and the Philippines
(1,200 obs.) for the 1995 wave. Our only doubt was Finland, where the percentage of Protestant was fine,
but the percentage of Jews appeared too high. For this reason, we reran all the regressions excluding
Finland, without appreciable differences in the results.


                                                   15
Measures of religious affiliation

         Table 1, Panel A, reports summary statistics of the attitudes toward religion by

country. The first column reports the percentage of respondents that answered yes to the

question “Were you brought up religiously at home?” The second and third column

report the answer to the following question “Apart from weddings, funerals, and

christenings, about how often do you attend religious services these days?” The fourth

column is the percentage of people who answer no to the question “Do you believe in

God?”

         Table 1, Panel B, reports the distribution of population by religious denomination

and country. Religious denomination is coded based on the answers to the following

question: “Do you belong to a religious denomination? IF YES: Which one?”

         We use the first set of answers to identify the exogenous component of religion,

the one that does not depend on individual characteristics. To measure the intensity of

religious beliefs, we use the frequency of attendance at religious services, rather than

self-declared membership in a religious denomination. Many people who have been

raised in a certain religion continue to declare that they belong to that religion even if

they attend religious services less than once a year. We do not regard this as additional

information with respect to religious upbringing.3

         Religious denominations differ in the extent to which they prescribe weekly

attendance at religious services. Our goal, though, is not to measure adherence to a

precept, but rather exposure to religious teachings. Since people who attend religious



3
  In several specifications we have tried and used self-declared membership in a religious denomination
instead of attendance at religious services at least once a year, as a measure of religious belief. The results
were very similar.


                                                     16
services more are exposed to religious principles more, we use church attendance as a

proxy for the dimension of religiosity we care about.

        Table 1, Panel C, reports the distribution of the intensity of religious beliefs by

religious denomination. People who declare themselves Catholic, for instance, attend

religious services much more often than people who declare themselves of any other

religious denomination except Hindu. In evaluating the potential impact of different

religious denominations, we have to take into consideration these systematic differences

in the intensity of beliefs.



Our dependent variables

        Table 1, Panel D, reports the summary statistics for our dependent variables. All

of them represent measures of people’s attitudes. We focus on attitudes that have a direct

impact on economic life. We divide them into four groups.


Measures of attitude toward cooperation

        The first group contains measures of people’s attitude toward cooperation.

Variable 1, which we label trust, is based on the following question: “Generally

speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted or that you can't be too careful

in dealing with people?” The variable is equal to 1 if participants report that most people

can be trusted and zero otherwise. Variables 2 and 3, which we label intolerance toward

other races and intolerance toward immigrants, respectively, are based on the following

question: “On this list are various groups of people. Could you please sort out any that

you would not like to have as neighbors?” (Variable 2: People of a different race;

Variable 3: The immigrants). Variable 4, which we label average intolerance, is the



                                            17
combination of variables 2 and 3 and is equal to 1 if either variable 2 or 3 is equal to one

or if both are.



Measures of attitude toward government

        The second group of variables contains measures of people’s attitude toward

government institutions. Variables 5, 6, and 7 are based on the following: “I am going to

name a number of organizations. For each one, could you tell me how much confidence

you have in it: a great deal of confidence, quite a lot of confidence, not very much

confidence, or none at all?” The answers are coded 1 to 4, by increasing degree of

confidence. The organizations we considered are the government, the police, and the

armed forces.



Measures of attitude toward women

        The third group of variables contains measures of people’s attitude toward

women. Since we are ultimately interested in the effects on labor participation, we

focused on questions that might influence women’s propensity to work. Hence, variable 8

is the answer to this question: “When jobs are scarce, should men have more right to a

job than women?” Answers are coded 1 to 4; we recoded them so that a higher number

represents a higher degree of agreement. Variable 9 comes from the answer to the

question: “Do you think that women should have children in order to be fulfilled, or is

this not necessary?” The answer needs children is coded as one, the answer not

necessary is coded as zero. Variables 10 to 12 come from the answer to the question “For

each of the following statements I read out, can you tell me how much you agree with




                                            18
each. Do you agree strongly, agree, disagree, or disagree strongly?” The statements are:

“Being a housewife is just as fulfilling as working for pay” (variable 10); “Both the

husband and wife should contribute to household income” (variable 11); “A university

education is more important for a boy than for a girl” (variable 12). We recoded them so

that a higher number represents a higher degree of agreement.



Measures of attitude toward legal norms


       The fourth group of variables contains measures of people’s attitude toward legal

norms. Variable 13 is based on a question similar to variables 5 to 7, except that the

organization mentioned is the legal system. Answers are coded 1 to 4; we recoded them

so that a higher number represents a higher degree of confidence. Variables 14 to 18 are

based on the following question: “ Please tell me for each of the following statements

whether you think it can always be justified, never be justified, or something in between,

using this card.” Answers are in the range 1-10, with 1 = never justifiable and 10=

always justifiable.

       The questions we are interested in are: “Claiming government benefits to which

you are not entitled” (var. 14); “Avoiding a fare on public transport” (var.

15);“Cheating on taxes if you have a chance” (var. 16); “Buying something you knew

was stolen” (var. 17); “Accepting a bribe in the course of their duties” (var. 18).


Measures of attitude toward the market

       The fifth group contains measures of people’s attitude toward the market

(variables 19-21). They are based on the following question: “Now I'd like you to tell me




                                            19
your views on various issues. How would you place your views on this scale? 1 means

you agree completely with the statement on the left; 10 means you agree completely with

the statement on the right; and if your views fall somewhere in between, you can choose

any number in between.” The statement on the left is normally the opposite of the

statement on the right. The statements considered are (reporting only the statements on

the right): “We need larger income differences as incentives for individual effort” (var.

19); “Private ownership of business and industry should be increased” (var. 20);

“Competition is good. It stimulates people to work hard and develop new ideas” (var.21).


Measures of attitude toward the thriftiness and fairness of the market

        As measure of attitude toward thriftiness, we use the answer to the question: Here

is a list of qualities that children can be encouraged to learn at home. Which, if any, do

you consider to be especially important? We code a 1 if the respondent lists as important

“Thrift, saving money and things”.4

        Variables from 23 to 25 are questions framed as are variables 19 to 21, except that

the statements are: “People should take more responsibility to provide for themselves”

(var. 23);“In the long run hard work usually brings a better life” (var. 24); “Wealth can

grow so there is enough for everybody” (var.25).

        Finally, variable 26 is based on the question: “Why, in your opinion, are there

people in this country who live in need? Here are two opinions: Which comes closest to

you view? We code as 1 the answer “They are poor because of laziness and lack of will

power” and zero the answer “They are poor because society treats them unfairly.”



4
  The interviewed person is presented with a list of eleven alternatives, ranging from imagination to
obedience, and can mention at most five as important.


                                                 20
Other control variables

        To isolate the effect of religion from other confounding effects, we control for

country fixed effects and several individual characteristics. This strategy might

underestimate the impact of religion, since religion positively affects health (Ellison,

1991, Levin, 1994 and Levin and Vanderpool, 1987), and income (Chiswick, 1983).

Nevertheless, we think it is important to establish whether religion has an additional

direct effect.

        Table 1, Panel E, reports the demographic characteristics of the respondents.

“Health” is coded based on the question: “All in all, how would you describe your state of

health these days?” (1=Very poor; 2=Poor, 3=Fair, 4=Good, 5=Very good). “Male” is an

indicator variable equal to one if the respondent is male, otherwise it is zero. “Age” is

expressed in years. “Education” is the age in years at which the respondent completed his

or her highest education (excluding apprenticeships). “Social class” is coded based on the

response to the question: “People sometimes describe themselves as belonging to the

working class, the middle class, or the upper or lower class. Would you describe yourself

as belonging to the: 1=Lower class, 2=Working class, 3=Lower middle class, 4=Upper

middle class, 5=Upper class.”

        “Income” is coded based on the response to the question: “Here is a scale of

incomes. We would like to know in what group your household is, counting all wages,

salaries, pensions, and other income that comes in. Just give the letter of the group your

household falls into, before taxes and other deductions” (income categories are coded by

decile for each society, 1=lowest decile, 10=highest decile).




                                            21
III. The Impact of Religion

        In Table 2 we present our results on the overall effects of religion. Each attitude

is regressed on our four indicators of religiosity - atheists, people brought up religiously,

currently religious, and actively religious - some control variables, country specific

effects, and calendar year dummies. The size of the reference sample differs across

regressions; valid observations vary according to specific questions on individual

attitudes, and range from 52,252 to 95,739.

       Control variables

       Before we comment on the results on the impact of religion, it is useful to discuss

the effect of our control variables. The results, which are of independent interest, are

very reasonable and provide credibility to the measures of attitude we are going to use.

       First, health has a strong positive impact on all attitudes. Healthier people trust

other people more, are more tolerant, trust the government and the police more, have a

more progressive attitude toward women, are less likely to break legal norms, and believe

more in markets. The only exception is that healthier people view thrift as less of a value

(perhaps because, being healthy, they appreciate the benefits of precautionary saving

less). All of these results are statistically significant. From a quantitative point of view,

the strongest impact is on trust toward others; an improvement in the health status from

“fair” to “very good” increases the average level by 27 percent. In intolerance toward

immigrants, the same increase in health reduces the level of intolerance by 12 percent.

       Gender also plays a role in some, but not all, attitudes. Males tend to be more

intolerant, to trust the government and the armed forces more (but not the police), to be




                                              22
more likely to break legal norms, and to be more in favor of markets. Not surprisingly,

their attitude toward women is less progressive than that of women themselves.

       Older people tend to trust others more, perhaps reflecting a cohort effect, but they

are also more intolerant and less progressive toward women. They trust government

institutions more, and they are less likely to break the law. Their attitude toward markets,

however, is more mixed. Older people lean more toward equality in the equality versus

incentives trade off and are less enthusiastic about an increase in private ownership. On

the other hand, they believe more in individual (instead of government) responsibility,

they believe more that competition is good, and that hard work improves life. They also

have more confidence that wealth can grow so that there is enough for everyone.

       Education increases trust toward others, reduces intolerance, and improves

attitude toward women, but it does decrease the level of trust in government institutions.

Education tends to reduce the willingness to break legal norms, but the effect is not

always there. For example, more educated individuals seem to be more willing to cheat

on taxes (although this effect is not statistically significant) and more willing to avoid

paying the fare on public transport. Education also seems to improve attitude toward the

market, but to decrease thriftiness and the conviction that the market outcome is fair.

More educated people are more willing to believe that success is a matter of luck and

connections rather than hard work and less willing to believe that the poor are such

because they are lazy.

       A higher (self-perceived) social status is associated with more trust toward others,

but also more intolerance. Its impact on trust toward government institutions is mixed and

tends not to be significant. A higher (self-perceived) social status also is associated with




                                            23
a lower willingness to break legal norms and with a higher acceptance of market

principles.

           Finally, higher income has similar effects to higher social status but with a few

interesting exceptions. Higher income people have more progressive attitudes toward

women, although they perceive that the wife has less of a duty to contribute to household

income. Higher income people are more (rather than less) tolerant, but trust government

institutions less. In general they are less willing to break legal norms, but there are two

important exceptions: they are more willing to cheat on taxes and more willing to justify

a bribe.

           In summary, while these controls are difficult to interpret because they may be

reflecting several effects, their sign conforms to some intuitive priors, and this reassures

us that the attitudes we are focusing on are correctly picking up what they are meant to

measure.

           The average impact of religiosity

           Table 2 also contains our estimates for the impact of different levels of religiosity.

The excluded group is made up of non-religious people, who are not openly atheist. The

effects should be read cumulatively. Hence, the trust of somebody who has been raised

religiously and attends service at least once a week (and thus also at least once a month)

can be obtained by adding the coefficients for our three indicators of religiosity. For this

reason, we also report the cumulative effects at the bottom of the table.

           We find that on average religion is good for the development of stronger

institutions. Religious people trust others more, trust the government more, are less




                                                24
willing to break the law, and believe more in the fairness of the market, but they are more

intolerant and they have less progressive attitudes toward women.

        In general, convinced atheists behave in the opposite way from religious people:

they are more tolerant, less trusting of the government and the police, have more

progressive attitudes toward women, trust the legal system less, are more willing to break

the law, and have worse attitudes toward the market and its perceived fairness. The only

exception is that atheists tend to trust other people more. These effects are not simply

attributable to the attitudes of Communists in the former socialist countries. Excluding

former socialist countries from the sample yields similar results (not reported).

         Interestingly, the aspect of religion that seems to matter is different for the

various attitudes. “Trust toward others” is affected mostly by religious participation, not

by being brought up religiously. This could be because this effect is entirely spurious

(good people trust others more and they attend church) or that the dominant aspect is

socialization at the service, rather than religious upbringing. By contrast, intolerance is

mostly (but not uniquely) an outcome of being raised religiously. Active churchgoers are

not more intolerant toward immigrants than the rest of the population (but not less either).

Finally, both a religious upbringing and active religious participation increase trust

toward government institutions.      Similarly, the more conservative attitude of religious

people toward women is not associated with religious upbringing: the more a person

participates in religious services, the more his attitude toward women is conservative.

        Not surprisingly, religious upbringing and affiliation are associated with a

reduced willingness to break any sort of legal rule. It is important to stress that this result

is also present for religious upbringing alone, which is a sign that this is not just the result




                                              25
of a spurious correlation between unobserved individual characteristics, religiosity, and

attitude toward legal norms.

       The correlation between religiosity and attitudes toward the market is more

complex. People raised religiously are less willing to trade off equality for incentives and

are less in favor of private property. The correlation changes sign, however, when it

comes to people attending religious services on a more regular basis: they are more

willing to trade off equality for incentives and in particular, they favor more private

ownership.

       By contrast, religiosity is associated with a higher emphasis on thrift, a greater

sense of individual responsibility, and a stronger belief that the market outcome is fair.

Interestingly, religious people are more likely to believe that people are in need because

they are lazy and lack willpower rather than because society treats them unfairly. Overall,

religious people tend to be more supportive of markets.

       The effect of religious upbringing is particularly interesting in light of the

identification problem that plagues all the studies on the effects of religion. Any “effect”

of religion might be spurious because of some underlying characteristics that shape both

religious behavior and the attitudes we focus on. This is the case for example, when we

analyze the relationship between attendance to service and attitudes toward women.

Being raised religiously, however, is not a choice and cannot be attributed to individual

characteristics. It is still possible, though, that religious upbringing might be correlated

with some latent characteristics of the parents, which affect children’s attitudes directly

and not through religious education.




                                            26
       Therefore, even when we use religious upbringing, we cannot exclude the

possibility that a latent variable might drive both religiosity and people’s attitudes. For

each individual attitude, it is easy to imagine such a variable. For example, individual (or

parents) sociability can easily explain both religious attendance (upbringing) and level of

trust toward other people. Nevertheless, it is difficult to imagine the same latent variable

explaining all the dependent variables. If more social people are more trusting, how do

we explain that they are also more intolerant? One would need several latent variables, all

positively correlated, to explain all of our facts. At this point, Occam’s razor should lead

us to accept a causal interpretation of our results.

       Yet, even if the observed correlations were driven entirely by unobserved

individual characteristics, we still think it is interesting to show that the characteristics

that make somebody attend religious services on a regular basis also make her more

intolerant toward immigrants and people of other races. Even if religious people are more

intolerant because of personal characteristics, it is hard to imagine that a community that

attracts the intolerant would not breed further intolerance.

Does the impact differ if a religion is dominant?

       Before probing into the differences between religions, we want to distinguish the

effect of religiosity from the effect of adhering to a country’s dominant religion. A

dominant religion often becomes enmeshed with the national culture and transmitted

from generation to generation, not necessarily because of some deep convictions but by

force of habit. Thus, being raised religiously and attending the services of the country’s

dominant religion might mean very different things from being raised religiously and

attending the services of a minority religion.




                                              27
           For this reason, we separately control for the effect of being raised in and being

affiliated with the dominant religion (defined as the religion with the highest number of

affilates).5 The results are reported in Table 3.

           Overall, the impact of religiosity seems to be smaller when this is the dominant

religion, but there are important differences. For example, we noted earlier that being

raised religiously had a small effect on trust toward others. It turns out that this weak

result is the combination of two strong but opposite effects. Somebody raised religiously

tends to trust others more, if the religion is not the dominant one. Religious upbringing in

the dominant religion is associated with a reduced trust toward others. By contrast, most

of the correlation between religion and intolerance is attributable to dominant religions.

Similarly, most of the effect of religious upbringing on the attitude toward the police and

the armed forces is attributable to being raised in the dominant religion. The effect is

negative when somebody is raised in another religion.

           The anti-women bias associated with religious education is entirely associated

with the dominant religion. By contrast, regular churchgoers are relatively less

conservative toward women if they belong to the dominant religion. Similarly, regular

attendance at religious services has a less negative impact on the willingness to break

legal norms when a person attends the services of the dominant religion. We interpret

these results as suggesting that regular attendance at religious services is less an indicator

of true religious beliefs when the religion is the dominant one.

           When it comes to attitudes toward the market, the differential impact of religiosity

in the dominant religion is mixed. The dominant religion tends to increase the effect of

being raised religiously on the attitude toward the market and the fairness of its

                                                   28
outcomes, but reduces the impact of service attendance, again consistent with this being

less a sign of strong religious beliefs.



IV. The Impact of Different Religions

         Thus far we have only provided evidence that religiosity matters in general. Most

of the debate in the literature, however, is not about the effects of religion per se, but the

effects of different religions. We deal with this in Table 4.

         For those people who claim to belong to a specific religious denomination, Table

4 differentiates the effect of being raised religiously, attending religious services at least

once a year, and attending services at least once a month, for the six major religious

denominations: Catholics, Protestants, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists.

Unfortunately, the questionnaires do not treat Eastern Orthodox consistently (in two of

the three surveys they are mixed with “others religious denominations”), so we do not

have a separate category for them. For reasons of space we select a subset of variables for

each of the four types of attitudes we study.6

         Religious upbringing has a negative and statistically significant impact on trust

for Catholics, Muslims, and Hindus. In all other religions the effect is null. By contrast, in

all religions a higher attendance at religious services is associated with a higher level of

trust toward others. The only exception is Hinduism. To compare the overall effect of

religion, the last two columns of Table 4 report the total. The next to last column shows

6
  These are: general trust and intolerance toward others (as representative of attitudes toward cooperation);
trust the government (for attitudes toward the government and other institutions); trust the legal system,
cheating on taxes and accepting a bribe (for attitudes toward legal rules); men deserve scarce jobs and
university education, respectively, more than women (as representative of opinions toward women);
income inequality as providing incentives, opinions about increasing private ownership, and judgement
about competition (as representative of attitudes toward the market) and teaching thriftiness to children and



                                                    29
the total impact on trust of a person who attends a religious service at least once a week.

Since the incidence of churchgoers differs across religious denominations, these figures

do not represent a true average impact of a specific religious denomination. Hence, in the

last column of table 4 we weigh the impact of the different level of religiosity by the

denomination-specific level of religiosity. Most of the time the two numbers tell the

same story, but we point out important exceptions.

         Overall, Christian religions foster trust, but more so for Protestants. Because the

sign is opposite when we focus on religious upbringing, we should be suspicious that the

effect is spurious. On the other hand, the fact that it is not present for every religion is

evidence against a purely spurious effect. Why would more trusting people attend

religious services more often if they are Catholics or Protestants, but not if they are Jews

or Muslims? At the very least, we should admit that there is something specific to these

religions (and not to the others) that attracts more trusting people. The “impact” of being

Protestant is almost twice as large as that of being Catholic, and this difference is

statistically significant. In turn, Catholicism breeds trust more than any other non-

Christian religion. The only caveat for Jews is that the sample does not include Israel, so

all the Jews are minorities living in countries dominated by people of different religious

denominations. Thus, this difference might reflect the discrimination to which they are

subject.

         The relation between religion and intolerance seems to be present in all religious

denominations, both for religious upbringing and for attendance at religious services.

Only Buddhists are more tolerant. The point estimates for Protestants and Catholics are


believing the poor are so because are lazy (as representative of opinions about thriftiness and the fairness
of markets).


                                                    30
very similar, while those of Muslims are much higher, and those of Hindus even higher.

Actively religious Hindus are 29 percent more intolerant than non-religious people,

Muslims 19 percent, actively religious Protestant and Catholics 7 percent more.

       Religious upbringing increases trust in the government for Muslims and to a

lesser extent, for Hindus. Religious participation increases trust in the government for all

religious denominations except Buddhists. The effect is stronger for Hindus and

Muslims, weaker for Catholics and Protestants.

       As Panels D and E show, all religious denominations are associated with a more

conservative attitude toward women. However, that effect is twice as strong for Muslims

than for any other religion.

       Similarly, all religions result in increased trust in the legal system and reduced

willingness to break legal rules; however, the effect differs significantly across religious

denominations. Judaism has the strongest negative impact on willingness to cheat on

taxes, Protestantism second, Catholicism and Hinduism third, and Islam fourth. The

rankings are different when it comes to accepting a bribe. The strongest negative impact

comes from Buddhism, with Protestants and Muslims next, and Catholics last.

       Religions differ most in their position on the trade off between equality and

incentives. Protestants and Hindus are more willing to trade off equality for incentives,

while Jews and Muslims are less so. For the other religions, the effect is insignificant.

       Religious denominations also differ in their attitudes toward private ownership.

Protestants, Catholics, and Hindus want more private ownership, while Muslims want

significantly less private ownership. Interestingly, Catholics support private ownership

twice as much as Protestants (and the difference is statistically significant at the 10




                                             31
percent level). Catholics also are more in favor of competition than any other religious

group (including Protestants), while religious Muslims and Hindus are strongly against

competition.

        Only Catholics believe strongly that thrift is a value to be taught to children.

Among Protestants, only those who attend religious services just once a year share this

conviction. Regular churchgoers are less likely to include thrift as a value to be taught to

children. This is somewhat at odds with Weber’s claim that the Protestant religion has

favored the development of capitalism through its emphasis on thrift.

       Finally, religious people of all denominations (except Buddhists) are more

inclined to believe that people in need are lazy and lack will power. The effect is

somewhat stronger for Protestants than for Catholics.


Does the impact differ if a religion is a minority?


       Table 5 reports the results obtained by dividing the sample on the basis of the

dominant religion (as reported in the CIA Factbook). For space considerations, we only

report the results with the three main religions: Catholicism, Protestantism, and Islam.

       In Catholic-dominated countries, religions have a less positive impact on trust

toward others for all religious denominations, including Catholics themselves. Not

surprisingly, religions tend to increase intolerance only when they are dominant. Thus,

Catholics are more intolerant in Catholic countries, but not in Protestant countries;

Protestants are more intolerant in Protestant countries, but not in Catholic ones. An

interesting result comes from panel C: religious Jews trust the government less in a

Catholic-dominated country, while they trust it significantly more in Protestant-




                                             32
dominated countries. This result can be explained easily in light of the strong anti-

Semitism historically present in the Catholic Church’s tradition, as reflected in the way

that Jews were treated in the Papal state.7

           The relationship between religiosity and other attitudes does not seem to be

affected greatly by what the dominant religion is.


Has the Impact of Catholicism Changed?

           The aggregate-level evidence suggests the Catholic religion has a negative effect

on trust (La Porta et al, 1997, Inglehart, 1999) and institutions (La Porta et al., 1999). In

the micro data we find some evidence for the first, but very little evidence for the second.

One possibility is that these characteristics are not specific to Catholicism, but rather

come from other dimensions of the culture in the regions where Catholicism is prevalent

(mainly Southern European countries and their former colonies). Alternatively, these

qualities may have been specific to Catholicism, but they have changed since the reforms

introduced by the Second Vatican Council. In this latter case, they would simply survive

as a cultural aspect of countries imbued with Catholic culture, but not in the Catholic

people.

           To try to separate these two effects we re-run the regressions described in Table 4,

splitting the sample based on the age of the respondent. The Second Vatican Council,

which took place in 1962, substantially changed Catholic doctrine and teaching. Not only

was the use of Latin in the Mass abolished, but also there was an opening up of dialogue

with the other religious denominations. As a result, Catholics after 1960 received a very

different education from their older peers. If these changes indeed affected the influence

7
    For example, the yellow star used by the Nazis to single out the Jews was first introduced and used in the


                                                      33
of Catholicism, we should see a difference in the effect of Catholicism on the older

versus the younger generation. To control for generic cohort differences in Table 6, we

insert a dummy for people born after 1960 into the basic regression and then interact this

dummy with the different levels of religiosity of Catholics.

        We find that Catholics raised after Vatican II are more trusting of other people

and less intolerant. Their religious upbringing and practice also have less of a negative

effect on women’s rights. Interestingly, Vatican II does not seem to have caused a

relaxation in moral values. While the younger cohort on average is more likely to break

legal norms, Catholics raised after Vatican II are less likely to break legal norms than

older Catholics (panel C). By contrast, Catholics raised after Vatican II are less pro-

market (panel C). They believe less in private property and competition. They value

thrift more, but they are more willing to believe that people are poor because of some

injustice in society.     These results overall provide some preliminary evidence in favor

of the hypothesis that the negative impact of Catholicism found in the previous literature

may be explained by some cultural characteristics that survive in countries imbued with

Catholic culture, but do not exist anymore in Catholic people. More research is needed to

investigate this hypothesis further. In the meantime, we can conclude that Catholicism

today is not a significant obstacle to economic development.


V. Conclusions

        In our analysis of the effect of religion on people’s attitudes toward cooperation,

government, women, legal rules, the market economy, and thriftiness we have found a

remarkable number of regularities. We found on average that religion is good for the


Vatican State (Kertzer, 2001).


                                              34
development of attitudes that are conducive to economic growth. But this statement needs

to be qualified.

   First, religious people are more intolerant and have more conservative views of the

role of women in society. Second, these correlations differ depending on whether a

specific religious denomination dominates in a country. Third, these correlations differ

across religious denominations.

   Since Weber the previous literature on the effects of religions on growth has tried to

“rank” religions or at least highlight characteristics in some religious denominations that

would make them more conducive for economic growth than others. If we try to do the

same with our results, the ranking would not be consistent across attitudes. On average,

Christian religions are more positively associated with attitudes that are conducive to

economic growth, while Islam is negatively associated. The ranking between the two

main Christian denominations is less clear. Protestants trust others and the legal system

more than Catholics and they are less willing to cheat on taxes and accept a bribe with

respect to Catholics. By contrast, Catholics support private ownership twice as much as

Protestants and are more in favor of competition than any other religious group

(including Protestants). The only case in which Protestants seem more pro-market than

Catholics is on incentives. When asked whether they are willing to accept more income

inequality to provide incentives Protestants and Hindus are the only religious groups that

favor incentives. This result is consistent with Weber’s view.

    From these results, however, we cannot conclude which religion is better for growth.

In order to answer this question two further steps are necessary. First, we need to

investigate the relative importance of the attitudes studied for economic growth. Second,




                                            35
we need to make a stronger case that the statistical relations observed are causal. Further

research is needed.

                                   Table 1: Sample Statistics

This table reports sample statistics of the responses from WORLD VALUES SURVEY 1981-
1984, 1990-93 and 1995-97 (ICPSR 2790). Respondents were from 66 independent countries in
at least one wave. These countries include almost 80 percent of the world's population. The
coverage of countries varies across surveys. The 1981-83 survey covered 22 independent
countries plus Northern Ireland; the 1990-93 survey covered 42 independent countries plus
Northern Ireland, and Greater Moscow; the 1995-97 survey covered 54 independent countries.

Panel A reports summary statistics of religious beliefs by country. The first column reports the
percentage of respondents that answered yes to the question “Were you brought up religiously at
home?” The second and the third column reports the answer to the following question “Apart
from weddings, funerals and christenings, about how often do you attend religious services these
days?”. The fourth column is the percentage of people who answer no to the question “Do you
believe in God?”

Panel B reports distribution of population by religious denomination and country.
Religious denomination is coded based on the answers to the following question: “Do
you belong to a religious denomination? IF YES: Which one?”

Panel C reports summary statistics of the intensity of religious beliefs by religious
denomination.

Panel D reports summary statistics for the variables used in the regression analysis. Variable 1 is
based on the following question: “Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be
trusted or that you can't be too careful in dealing with people? The variable is equal to 1 if
participants report that most people can be trusted and zero otherwise. Variables 2 and 3 are
based on the following question: “On this list are various groups of people. Could you please sort
out any that you would not like to have as neighbors?” (Variable 2: People of a different race;
Variable 3: The immigrants). Variable 4 is the combination of variables 2 and 3 and is equal to 1
if either variable 2 or 3 or both is equal to one. Variables 5, 6 and 7 are based on the general
question: I am going to name a number of organizations. For each one, could you tell me how
much confidence you have in them: is it a great deal of confidence, quite a lot of confidence, not
very much confidence or none at all? Answers are coded 1-4, we recoded them so that a higher
number represents a higher degree of confidence. Organizations we considered are the
government, the police and the armed forces. Variables 8 comes from the answers to the question
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: When jobs are scarce, men should have
more right to a job than women? Answers are coded 1-4, we recoded them so that a higher
number represents a higher degree of agreement. Variables 9 comes from the answers to the
question: Do you think that women should have children in order to be fulfilled or is this not
necessary? The answer needs children is coded as one, the answer not necessary is coded as a
zero. Variables 10-12 come from the answer to the question For each of the following statements
I read out, can you tell me how much you agree with each. Do you agree strongly, agree,
disagree, or disagree strongly? The statements are: Being a housewife is just as fulfilling as
working for pay (variable 10), Both the husband and wife should contribute to household income
(variable 11), A university education is more important for a boy than for a girl (variable 12). We
recoded them so that a higher number represents a higher degree of agreement. Variable 13 is
based on a question similar to variables 5 to 7, except that the organization mentioned is the legal
system. Answers are coded 1-4, we recoded them so that a higher number represents a higher
degree of confidence. Variables 14 to 18 are based on the following question: “ Please tell me for



                                                40
each of the following statements whether you think it can always be justified, never be justified, or
something in between, using this card.” Answers are in the range 1-10, with 1 = never justifiable
and 10= always be justifiable. “Claiming government benefits to which you are not entitled” (var.
14). “Avoiding a fare on public transport” (var. 15). “Cheating on taxes if you have a chance”
(var. 16). “Buying something you knew was stolen” (var. 17). “Accepting a bribe in the course of
their duties” (var. 18). Variables 19-21 and 23 to 26 are based on the following question: Now I'd
like you to tell me your views on various issues. How would you place your views on this scale? 1
means you agree completely with the statement on the left; 10 means you agree completely with
the statement on the right; and if your views fall somewhere in between, you can choose any
number in between. The statement on the left is normally the opposite of the statement on the
right. Statements considered are (we report only statement on the right): We need larger income
differences as incentives for individual effort” (var. 19); “Private ownership of business and
industry should be increased“ (var. 20); “Competition is good. It stimulates to work hard and
develop new ideas” (var.21); People should take more responsibility to provide for themselves
(var. 23);“In the long run hard work usually brings a better life” (var. 24); “Wealth can grow so
there is enough for everybody” (var.25). Variable 22 is based on the answer to the question Here
is a list of qualities that children can be encouraged to learn at home. Which, if any, do you
consider to be especially important? We code as 1 if the respondent list as important “Thrift,
saving money and things”. Variable 26 is based on the question: Why, in your opinion, are there
people in this country who live in need? Here are two opinions: Which comes closest to you
view? We code as one the answer “They are poor because of laziness and lack of will power” and
zero the answer “They are poor because society treats them unfairly”.

Panel E reports the demographic characteristics of the respondents. “Health” is coded based on
the question: “All in all, how would you describe your state of health these days? (1=Very poor;
2=Poor, 3=Fair, 4=Good, 5=Very good)”. “Male” is an indicator variable equal to one if the
respondent is male, otherwise equal to zero. “Age” is expressed in years. “Education” is the age
in years at which the respondent completed his or her highest education (excluding
apprenticeships). “Social class” is coded based on the response to the question: “People
sometimes describe themselves as belonging to the working class, the middle class, or the upper
or lower class. Would you describe yourself as belonging to the: 1=Lower class, 2=Working
class, 3=Lower middle class, 4=Upper middle class, 5=Upper class”. “Income” is coded based on
the response to the question: “Here is a scale of incomes. We would like to know in what group
your household is, counting all wages, salaries, pensions and other incomes that come in. Just
give the letter of the group your household falls into, before taxes and other deductions” (income
categories are coded by decile for each society, 1=lowest decile, 10=highest decile).

All the variables are defined in the legend of table 1. The row “Raised religiously+ Currently religious”
reports the sum of the coefficients for “Raised religiously”+ “Currently religious”, followed by the p-values
for the test that the sum of the coefficients is significantly different from zero (in brackets). The row
“Raised religiously+ Currently religious+Actively religious” reports the sum of the three coefficients,
followed by the p-values for the test that the sum of the coefficients is significantly different from zero (in
brackets). All the other numbers in brackets are standard errors. All the regressions include a country fixed
effect and survey-year dummies. Panel A: Attitudes toward others and the government

                              Table 3. The role of the dominant religion

All the panels report coefficients from different OLS regressions. The dependent variable of each regression is
indicated at the top of the column and is defined in the legend of Table 1. All regressions include (coefficients not
reported) the same demographic controls as in Table 2 (health, male, age, education, social class, income), an
indicator variable equal to 1 if a person answer no to the question “Do you believe in God?”, a country fixed
effect, and survey-year dummies. “Raised religiously” is an indicator variable equal to one if the respondent
answered positively to the question “Were you brought up religiously at home?”. “Currently religious” is an
indicator variable that is equal to one if the respondent attend religious services (apart from weddings, funerals
and christenings) at least once a year. “Actively religious” is an indicator variable that is equal to one if the
respondent attend religious services (apart from weddings, funerals and christenings) at least once a week.
“Raised religiously in dominant religion” is an indicator variable equal to one if “Raised religiously” is equal to
one and the respondent belongs to the religious denomination most followed in his/her country. “Currently
religious in dominant religion” is an indicator variable equal to one if “Currently religious” is equal to one and the
respondent belongs to the religious denomination most followed in his/her country. “Actively religious in
dominant religion” is an indicator variable equal to one if “Actively religious” is equal to one and the respondent
belongs to the religious denomination most followed in his/her country. Standard errors are reported in brackets.

                            Table 4: The role of religious denominations
Each panel reports the coefficients of an OLS regression, whose dependent variable is indicated at the top of the panel.
Dependent variables are defined in the legend of Table 1. Regressions include the same demographic controls as in Table 2
(health, male, age, education, social class, income; coefficients not reported), an dummy variable equal to 1 if a person does
not believe in God, country fixed effects, and survey-year dummies. Included are also the following indicators of religious
intensity: “Raised religiously”:=1 if the respondent answered “yes” to the question “Were you brought up religiously at
home?”; “Currently religious”: =1 if the respondent attends religious services (apart from weddings, funerals and
christenings) at least once a year; “Actively religious”:=1 if the respondent attend religious services (apart from weddings,
funerals and christenings) at least once a week. Entries in columns 2 to 4 are the coefficients of the variables obtained
interacting the corresponding variable in the first column with that in the first row. Entries in the last two columns are the
sum of the coefficients of the specified variables. They should be interpreted as the cumulative effect of the different degree
of religiosity, relatively to individuals who declare they have no religious affiliation. In the first three columns, standard
errors are reported in brackets; in the last two columns p-values for the F-test that the coefficient is equal to zero are reported
in brackets. *** indicate the coefficient is different from zero at the 1% level, ** at the 5% level , and * at the 10 % level.

                  Table 5. Interacting religious denominations and dominant religion

Each panel reports the coefficients of an OLS regression, whose dependent variable is indicated at the top of the panel.
All the dependent variables are defined in the legend of Table 1. In columns 1-3 the sample is restricted to countries
where the dominant religion is Catholic, in columns 4-6 to countries where the dominant religion is Protestant,
columns 7-9 where the dominant religion is Muslim. All regressions include as control variable (coefficients not
reported) the same demographic controls as in Table 2 (health, male, age, education, social class, income), an indicator
variable equal to 1 if a person answer no to the question “Do you believe in God?”, a country fixed effect, and survey-
year dummies. In addition these regressions include the following three indicators of religious intensity: “Raised
religiously” equal to one if the respondent answered positively to the question “Were you brought up religiously at
home?”; “Currently religious” equal to one if the respondent attend religious services (apart from weddings, funerals
and christenings) at least once a year; “Actively religious” is equal to one if the respondent attend religious services
(apart from weddings, funerals and christenings) at least once a week. We report the coefficient of these variables in a
cumulative way. Thus, the first column reports the coefficient on the dummy “raised religiously”, the second column
the sum of the coefficients of the dummies “raised religiously” and “currently religious”, the third column the sum of
the coefficients of the dummies “raised religiously”, “currently religious”, and “actively religious”. Below the
coefficient in bracket we report the p-values for the F-test that the coefficient is equal to zero (second and third
column). *** indicate the coefficient is different from zero at the 1 percent level, ** at the 5 percent level , and * at the
10 percent level.
