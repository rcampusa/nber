Using Inflation to Erode the U.S. Public Debt

                                             ABSTRACT

As a share of GDP, the U.S. Federal debt held by the public exceeds 50 percent in FY2009, the highest
debt ratio since 1955. Projections indicate the debt ratio may be in the 70-100 percent range within
ten years. In many respects, the temptation to inflate away some of this debt burden is similar to that
at the end of World War II. In 1946, the debt ratio was 108.6 percent. Inflation reduced this ratio about
40 percent within a decade. Yet there are some important differences –shorter debt maturities today
reduce the temptation to inflate, while the larger share held by foreigners increases it. This paper lays
out an analytical framework for determining the impact of a large nominal debt overhang on the temptation
to inflate. It suggests that when economic growth is stalled, the U.S. debt overhang may trigger an
increase in inflation of about 5 percent for several years. This additional inflation would significantly
reduce the debt ratio, even with some shortening of debt maturities.

I. Introduction

           Since the start of 2007, the financial crisis has triggered $1.62 trillion of write-downs and

credit losses at U.S. financial institutions, sending the American economy into its deepest

recession since the Great Depression and the global economy into its first recession since World

War II. The Federal Reserve has responded aggressively. In an effort to hold down borrowing

costs and boost lending, it has kept the target rate for overnight loans between banks at zero to

0.25 percent since December, 2008, and it has pursued unconventional monetary easing.1 Fiscal

policy has become expansionary as well. The $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program and

the $787 billion Economic Recovery and Reinvestment Act have been signed into law. In all,

Federal spending has increased 18 percent in FY2009, to nearly 25 percent of GDP, the highest

level in over fifty years. Revenues have fallen almost 17 percent below receipts in 2008, to

about 15 percent of GDP, the lowest level in over fifty years.2

           The United States is now facing large Federal deficits and growing public debt. The

Federal deficit, estimated at $1.4 trillion in FY2009, or 9.9% of GDP, is the highest deficit-to-

GDP ratio since 1945.3           The Federal debt held by the public is expected to be over $6 trillion,

or 53.8% of GDP, at the end of FY2009, the highest debt-to-GDP ratio since 1955.4                       The total

outstanding Federal debt for FY2009 is predicted to exceed $11.8 trillion, about 90% of GDP.5

  The Budget of the United States Government, FY2009, p. 230, states: The Federal Government issues debt
securities for two principal purposes. First, it borrows from the public to finance the Federal deficit. Second, it
issues debt to Government accounts, primarily trust funds that accumulate surpluses. By law, trust fund surpluses
must generally be invested in Federal securities. The gross Federal debt is defined as the sum of debt held by the

If economic recovery is slow to take hold, large deficits and growing debt are likely to extend

into future years. Not surprisingly, concerns about government deficits and public debt now

dominate the policy debate.

           Many observers worry that the debt/GDP ratios projected over the next ten years are

unsustainable.6        Given that concern, and assuming that deficits can be reined in, how might the

debt/GDP ratio be reduced? There are four basic mechanisms. First, GDP can grow rapidly

enough to reduce the ratio. This scenario requires a robust economic recovery from the financial

crisis. Second, inflation can rise, eroding the real value of the debt held by creditors and the

effective debt ratio. With foreign creditors holding a significant share of the dollar-denominated

U.S. Federal debt, they will share the burden of any higher U.S. inflation along with domestic

creditors.7 Third, the government can use tax revenue to redeem some of the debt. Fourth, the

government can default on some of its debt obligations. Over its history, the United States has

relied on each of these mechanisms to reduce its debt/GDP ratio.8 In this paper, we examine the

role of inflation in reducing the Federal government’s debt burden.

           We start in Section II by laying out some stylized facts. We examine Federal debt held

by the public since World War II and show how publicly-held debt as a percentage of GDP has

evolved. Since the impact of higher inflation on the debt/GDP ratio will depend on the maturity

of the debt, we provide time-series evidence on average maturity length. We also observe that


public and the debt held by Government accounts. Borrowing from the public is normally a good approximation of
the Federal demand on credit markets. Borrowing must be financed out of the saving of households and businesses,
the State and local sector, or the rest of the world. Borrowing from the public thus affects the size and composition
of assets held by the private sector and the amount of saving imported from abroad. It also increases the amount of
future resources required to pay interest to the public on Federal debt. Borrowing from the public and the growth of
the publicly-held Federal debt are therefore important policy concerns.

very little of the debt is indexed to inflation, despite the introduction of Treasury inflation-

protected securities (TIPS) in 1997, and all debt is denominated in dollars.

        The distributional impact of inflation depends on the allocation of debt between

domestic and foreign creditors, so we next show how the share held by foreigners has grown

over time. We end this section by computing the impact of various inflation scenarios on the

debt/GDP ratio, and we calculate how the inflation burden would be shared between domestic

and foreign creditors.

       In Section III, we develop a model that shows the impact of a nominal debt overhang on

the temptation to inflate. The model illustrates that the optimal inflation rate is also positively

related to the share of the debt held by foreign creditors, the cost of tax collection, and the share

of non-indexed debt. Model simulations suggest that when economic growth is stalled, the U.S.

debt overhang may trigger an increase in inflation of about 5 present for several years. This

additional inflation would significantly reduce the debt ratio, even with some shortening of debt

maturities.

       In Section IV, we conclude by comparing the current period with a past period in U.S.

history when the debt overhang was high. We argue that today’s temptation to inflate away some

of the debt burden is similar in some respects to that in 1945, when inflation successfully eroded

a substantial part of the debt burden Yet there are important differences –shorter debt maturities

today reduce the temptation to inflate, while the larger share held by foreign creditors increases

it.

II. The Stylized Facts

           Figure 1 depicts trends in gross Federal debt and Federal debt held by the public from

1939 to the present.9 In 1946, just after the end of World War II, gross Federal debt reached

121.7 percent of GDP and the share held by the public was 108.6 percent. Over the next 30

years, debt as a percentage of GDP decreased almost every year, due primarily to an expanding

economy as well as inflation. The end result was noteworthy. By 1975, gross Federal debt had

declined to 34.7 percent of GDP, and the share of debt held by the public had fallen to 25.3

percent.

           The immediate post-World War II period is especially revealing. Figure 2 shows that

between 1946 and 1955 the debt/GDP ratio was cut almost in half. The average maturity of the

debt in 1946 was 9 years and the average inflation rate over this period, even with a spike to 14.4

percent in 1947, was 4.2 percent. Hence, inflation reduced the 1946 debt/GDP ratio by almost 40

percent within a decade.10

           Returning to Figure 1, we see that debt/GDP ratios stopped declining by the mid-1970s,

when the economy was hit by oil shocks and fiscal deficits increased. In the early 1980s, the

debt/GDP ratio grew sharply as the economy faced recession and a re-emerging fiscal deficit.

Legislated tax cuts and increased government defense expenditures fueled even greater fiscal

deficits and higher debt.

            By the mid-1990s, however, the debt/GDP ratio again began falling. Gross debt fell

steadily from 66.2 percent of GDP in 1993 to 57.4 percent in 2001, while the debt held by the

public fell by about a third, from 49.4 percent of GDP in 1993 to 33.0 percent in 2001. Over the

accounts, primarily trust funds. Debt held by the Federal Reserve is included in debt held by the public.

                                                               4
period 1993-2001, average inflation was about 2.5 percent and the average maturity of the

publicly-held debt was about 5.75 years, so inflation contributed very little to the erosion of the

debt/GDP ratio (less than 15 percent). Most of the decline in the debt/GDP ratio was due to

robust GDP growth.

         The downward trend in the debt/GDP ratio ended in 2001. With a recession, a slow

recovery that reduced tax receipts, legislated tax cuts and increased spending due to the War on

Terror, a government budget surplus turned to deficits and debt began to rise in 2002, both in

nominal terms and as a percentage of GDP. However, a growing economy led to a small decline

in the debt ratio between 2005 and 2007.

         With the onset of the financial crisis, government deficits and the debt/GDP ratio

increased dramatically. In FY 2009, the debt-to-GDP ratio reached a level not seen since 1955.

Figure 3 shows 10-year projections made by the International Monetary Fund, the Congressional

Budget Office, and the Office of Management and Budget. These projections indicate debt held

by the public could be 70-100 percent of GDP in ten years.

         A government that has lots of nominal debt denominated in its own currency has an

incentive to try to inflate it away so as to decrease the debt burden. It will resist the urge to

inflate if the rewards are small and the cost of a lost reputation is high. The average maturity of

the debt and the share that is indexed to inflation affect the ability of the government to inflate

away its value. In the extreme cases of zero maturity or fully-indexed debt, the government is

unable to reduce its debt burden through inflation.

         Figure 4 illustrates the average maturity length for U.S. marketable interest-bearing

public debt held by private investors, along with the debt held by the public as a share of GDP.11


11
  Prior to 1971, maturity length applies to interest-bearing public debt. Since 1971, maturity length applies to
interest-bearing public debt held by private investors. Debt held by private investors was 82% of debt held by the


                                                         5
As noted by a number of authors, the United States exhibits a positive relation between

maturities and debt/GDP ratios in the post-World War II period.12 Most developed countries

show little correlation between maturities and debt/GDP ratios. The United States appears to be

an exception.13 Maturity length on U.S. public debt in the post-World War II era went from a

high of 113 months (9.4 years) in 1947 to a low of 31 months (2.6 years) in 1976. It then

climbed again, with some ups and downs, reaching a peak of 74 months (6.2 years) in 2000

before falling back to 49 months (4.1 years) in 2008. In June, 2009, the average maturity was 47

months (3.9 years).

            In the past two years, the portion of Treasury debt at the shortest maturity has risen

markedly. Figure 5 shows that the share of debt maturing in less than a year has jumped from

about 30 percent to over 40 percent, reaching a proportion last seen in the mid-1980s.

            Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, were first introduced in 1997 for notes

and in 1998 for bonds. In nominal terms, they have increased from $24.4 billion in 1997 to

$531.9 billion in June, 2009. However, as a share of total public debt, they are still quite small.

Figure 6 shows that TIPS have grown in importance over the last 12 years but still account for

less than 10 percent of total debt issues.

            Figure 7 show the share of U.S. public debt held by foreign creditors. The foreign share

was essentially zero up until the early 1960s. Even by the late 1960s, the foreign share accounted

for less than 5 percent of total public debt. It then started rising, reaching 19.9 percent in 1978, in

public in 2008. The public includes the Federal Reserve Banks whereas the private-investors category does not.
Inflation-indexed securities are excluded from the calculation of maturity length.

     See, for example, Calvo and Guidotti (1992).
13
  When we regress log maturity on the log debt/GDP ratio and correct for serial correlation, we find that the
correlation between maturity length and debt/GDP over the period 1946-2008 is 0.7 and highly significant. The
same holds for the early period 1946-1991. Interestingly, the correlation is insignificant over the more recent period
of 1992-2008.

part because of recycled OPEC surpluses. The foreign share has risen dramatically in recent

years, particularly after the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis, and accounted for 48.2 percent of

publicly-held debt in 2008.14         Mainland China and Japan each held about 10 percent of U.S.

public debt at the end of 2008.

         Figure 8 illustrates that Mainland China and Japan are the major foreign holders of U.S.

public debt. Together they held about 44 percent of total foreign holdings of U.S. public debt at

the end of June, 2009. China held $776.4 billion of U.S. public debt, 23 percent of total foreign

holdings, while Japan held $711.8 billion, or 21 percent of total foreign holdings.                   In 2008,

about 70 percent of all foreign holdings were at foreign central banks.

         We next investigate the impact of various inflation scenarios on the real value of the debt

and on the debt/GDP ratio. Suppose creditors purchase X dollars of government debt with a

nominal interest rate of i percent and the debt has m years until maturity. Suppose n is the

number of times the interest rate is compounded per year, and let the compounding period be

infinitesimally small, so that n → ∞ . If the annual inflation rate is π , then the real value of the

debt after m years is V = Xe(i −π ) m . It follows that the percentage change in the real value of the

debt associated with a 1 percent increase in inflation over the life of the debt is ∂ logV ∂π = − m .

The percentage change in the debt/GDP ratio over the period is also − m .15 Hence debt maturity

( m ) is key in evaluating the inflation impact. The calculation assumes that maturity is invariant

to inflation. This assumption need not always hold, but we assume it does when inflation is

  In the discrete version also, the percentage change in the real value of the debt (or the debt/GDP ratio) associated
with a 1 percent increase in inflation over the life of the debt can be approximated by –m, since
V = X [(1 + i ) /(1 + π )]m and ∂ log V ∂π = − m /(1 + π )  − m .

below some threshold. We later test the validity of this assumption for U.S. data in the post-

World War II period.

       Figure 9 illustrates the percentage decline in the debt/GDP ratio (or the real value of the

debt) of a one-, three-, and five-percent increase in inflation, assuming inflation stays at the

higher rate for the life of the debt. Figure 10 pictures the impact of these three inflation

scenarios on the share of publicly-held debt over the period 1946-2008. Table A1 in the

Appendix shows the actual values of these shares under the three inflation scenarios.

       A few observations are worth noting. Inflation yielded the most dramatic reduction in the

debt/GDP ratio—and the real value of the debt—in the immediate post-World War II period. A

five-percent inflation increase starting in 1946, for example, would have reduced the debt/GDP

ratio from 108.6 percent to 59.3 percent, a decline in the debt ratio of 45 percent. The sizeable

inflation impact is not that surprising. Not only was there a large debt overhang when the war

ended (the publicly-held share of Federal debt was 106 percent of GDP in 1945), but inflation

was low (2.3%) and debt maturity was high (over 9 years). Thus there was room to let inflation

rise—and it rose to 8.3 percent in 1946, 14.4 percent in 1947, and 8.1 percent in 1948 before

dropping considerably. Average inflation over the decade was 4.2 percent. Moreover, long

maturities allowed inflation to erode the debt burden. Maturities were over 9 years in years

1945-48 and then fell gradually to 8.75 years in 1949 and 8.17 years in 1950.

       In contrast, inflation would have had little impact on reducing the debt burden in the mid-

1970s after the initial oil price shocks. That period was characterized by a lower debt overhang

(the share of publicly-held share of Federal debt was 23.9 percent of GDP in 1974), inflation was

higher (11 percent in 1974), and debt maturities were shorter (under 3 years by 1974 and a mere




                                                  8
2.67 years in 1975). As a result, in 1975 a 5 percent inflation increase would have reduced the

debt/GDP ratio from 25.3 percent to 21.9 percent, less than 15 percent.

           The estimated impact of inflation on today’s debt/GDP ratio is larger than in the mid-

1970s but not as large as in the mid-1940s. Had inflation been 3 percent higher in FY2009 and

stayed at that higher level over the average life of the debt (3.9 years in 2009), the effective

debt/GDP ratio would be about 12 percent lower. Had inflation been 5 percent higher, the

debt/GDP ratio would be about 20 percent lower, a debt ratio of 43.4 percent instead of 53.8

percent.

       Figure 11 shows how a 3 percent increase in inflation would be shared between domestic

and foreign holders of U.S. federal debt. In the 1960s, foreigners held so little debt that

essentially the entire burden of higher inflation would fall on U.S. creditors. By the end of 2008,

foreigners held almost half of the debt, so higher inflation would be shared about equally

between domestic and foreign creditors.

           Our computations of the impact of inflation on the debt overhang assume that all debt is

denominated in domestic currency, none is indexed, and the maturity is invariant to inflation.

While the first two assumptions are sensible (U.S. public debt is 100 percent dollar-denominated

and over 90 percent non-indexed), the latter assumption about the responsiveness of maturities to

inflation needs further investigation.

       Over the period 1946-2008, the simple correlation between U.S. debt maturities and

consumer price inflation is -0.296, suggesting higher inflation is associated with lower debt

maturities. However, regression results do not support this view.

       Table 1 reports the results of linear regressions that examine the relationship in U.S. data

between debt maturity and inflation, taking into account that debt maturity may also be




                                                   9
influenced by the amount of debt held by the public as a share of GDP, the share of government

spending in GDP, and the GDP growth rate. Over the period 1946-2008, there is a robust

positive and significant relationship between debt maturity and the debt/GDP ratio, but there is

no significant relationship between debt maturity and inflation. Even when we experiment with

various inflation lags, inflation does not influence the maturity of U.S. debt.16 In the table, we

report an example with inflation and one-period lagged inflation as regressors; both inflation

variables are insignificant. Thus, the assumptions invoked to compute the impact of inflation on

the debt overhang seem to be reasonable.17



III. A Model and Simulations

         We describe a stylistic model that illustrates both costs and benefits associated with

inflating away some of the debt burden. The model shows that the foreign share of the nominal

debt is an important determinant of the optimal inflation rate. So is the size of the debt/GDP

ratio, the share of debt indexed to inflation, and the cost of collecting taxes.

         We consider an infinite-horizon economy that starts in period one with a public debt

overhang. Previous inflation was low, say zero, such that a significant share of the public debt is

not indexed to inflation. The average debt maturity is long enough to allow the authorities to

contemplate unanticipated inflation as a way to erode the real debt. An inflation-inducing policy
16
  Missale and Blanchard (1994) found that during the 1960-1989 period, the debt/GDP ratio dominated inflation,
both quantitatively and statistically, in its influence on debt maturity in three countries, Ireland, Italy, and Belgium;
inflation only significantly decreased maturity for two of them, Ireland and Italy.
17
  Figure 4 suggests that the positive and significant correlation between debt maturities and the debt/GDP ratio may
have broken down after the early 1990s, raising the question of whether the relationship between maturities and
inflation may also have changed. Indeed, there is no significant correlation between maturities and either debt ratios
or inflation when the regression is run over the sub-sample 1992-2008. However, the sample size is small. When we
regress over the full period 1946-2008, interacting a dummy variable for the 1992-2008 sub-period with both the
debt ratio and inflation and also including it as a shift parameter, we find that the strong positive and significant
relationship between maturities and the debt ratio is maintained, though reduced by a small 1.5 percent in the more
recent period, and there is no significant difference in the relationship between maturities and inflation across
periods.

is costly, however. It will trigger in the next period the full indexation of the remaining public

debt, and it will be associated with a drop in output during the inflationary-disinflationary cycle.

The period length coincides with the duration of a business cycle and/or an inflationary-

disinflationary cycle (say four years for the U.S.).

        To simplify, we assume away growth. Output in the absence of an inflationary-

disinflationary cycle is Y . The initial outstanding debt in period one (the first period debt

overhang) is bY . A fraction θ of the debt is de-facto indexed to inflation -- either due to formal

indexation (like TIPS) or to having almost instantaneous maturity.

       The real interest rate in the absence of unanticipated inflation is determined by global

conditions and is assumed to be exogenously given at level r. The rate is also the real interest

rate on the indexed bonds. Hence, an unanticipated inflation rate of π > 0 in period one will

                                                                          (1 − θ )Y
reduce the real value of outstanding debt at the end of period one to b             .
                                                                            1+ π

       A fraction ( 1-f ) of the initial debt is held by economic domestic actors, f by foreign

economic actors. To simplify, we assume a symmetric ownership share of the indexed debt

between domestic and foreign economic actors.

       The penalty on attempts to inflate the debt in period one is that the remaining value of

debt becomes real debt in period two and throughout the indefinite future – inflation in period

one will induce private lenders to demand formal indexation or a sharp shortening of the

       Output depends negatively on inflation:

         (1)      Y = Y (1 − hπ φ ); φ ≥ 1 .18



The output is taxed at a rate t. For simplicity, the tax rate is set in period one and stays fixed for

the indefinite future. Taxes are associated with deadweight losses, modeled in reduced form as a

tax collection cost, τ. A tax rate t provides the authorities with net tax revenue of

Y (t − 0.5τ t 2 ) .19 These assumptions imply that if the authorities inflate in period one, they have

the incentive to return to zero inflation for the indefinite future.

         The consumer’s utility is



         (2)      U1 = log C1 + β log C2 + ...β s −1 log Cs + ... .



The domestic consumer’s financial wealth at the beginning of period one is



         (3)      (1 − f ) bY = A1



The second period initial asset position of the domestic consumer is:



                   ⎡                  1−θ                                 ⎤
                   ⎢⎣ (1 − f )bY (θ + 1 + π ) + Y (1 − hπ )(1 − t ) − C1 ⎥⎦ (1 + r ) = A2 .

         (4)

   Recalling that the period length coincides with the duration of an inflationary-disinflationary cycle, the values of
h and φ capture the average output cost and indirectly the welfare cost of such a cycle. While, to our knowledge,
there are no recent estimates of these values, Friedman (1985) estimated that the cost of 5 percentage points of
disinflation over the 1980-1988 period was 20 point-years of unemployment, for a final trade-off of 4-to-1, toward
the pessimistic end of Okun's range. He noted that it was possible to construct a more favorable picture on the basis
of more optimistic assumptions, for a final trade-off of 2-1, about at the optimistic end of Okun's range.

19
  Like Barro (1979), we model these tax collection costs as a non-linear share of output and let them depend
positively on the tax rate.

Assuming that anticipated first-period inflation is zero, a positive inflation in period one implies

that all debt in the future will be indexed. The budget constraint in period s, s > 1, will be:



        (5)     [ As + Ys (1 − t ) − Cs ] (1 + r ) = As +1 .


Forward iterations imply that the intertemporal budget constraints can be reduced to:



                                   1−θ                                  ∞ Y (1 − t )                 Cs
                                          ) + Y (1 − hπ 1 )(1 − t ) + ∑ s =1            = ∑ s =1
                                                         φ                                  ∞
        (6)     (1 − f )bY (θ +                                                                                .
                                   1 + π1                                    (1 + r ) s
                                                                                                 (1 + r ) s −1



The left-hand side of Equation (6) is first-period wealth. The representative consumer

maximizes utility subject to the intertemporal budget constraint, where the net present value of

the consumption stream equals the consumer’s first period wealth:



                                                     1−θ                      1
                           W1 = (1 − f )bY (θ +             ) + Y (1 − hπ 1φ + )(1 − t )
                                                     1 + π1                   r



Assuming an exogenously given interest rate, it follows that the resulting utility is proportional

to initial wealth.

        The policy maker will set the inflation rate and the tax rate in order to maximize the

representative consumer’s first-period wealth, subject to the fiscal intertemporal budget

constraint. We assume an exogenous fiscal expenditure of gY each period. Hence, the fiscal

intertemporal budget constraints are:




                                                               13

The left-hand side of (9) is the flow of taxes per dollar income net of collection costs. It should

cover the “long run” fiscal expense share of the GDP, namely Γ . In the absence of inflation and

debt overhang, the right-hand side of (9) is simply g. If g is zero, then in the absence of inflation

the right-hand side is the annuity value of the public debt overhang as a fraction of permanent

          The fiscal budget constraint provides the tax Laffer curve:



                                                  1 − 1 − 2τ Γ
          (10)      t (π 1 ;θ , g , r , h,τ ) =                  .
                                                       τ




                                                                     14
The policy maker sets the inflation rate so as to maximize the consumer’s wealth, ( W1 ), subject

to the Laffer curve constraint, (10). Specifically, the policy maker’s problem is:



    ⎡                 1−θ                      1               ⎤
MAX ⎢ (1 − f )bY (θ +        ) + Y (1 − hπ sφ + ){1 − t (π 1 )}⎥
    ⎣                 1 + π1                   r               ⎦
π1



It follows that for an internal equilibrium -- one with positive inflation -- we get:



             π * = π (b, f , τ , g , θ ); π b' > 0, π 'f > 0, π τ' > 0, π g' > 0, π θ' < 0
                                                                                             .
             t * = (b, f , τ , g , θ ); tb' > 0, t 'f < 0, tτ' < 0, t g' > 0, tθ' > 0



        Higher debt overhang (a higher debt/GDP ratio, b) increases the incentive to inflate in the

first period in order to reduce the deadweight losses associated with conventional taxes. A

greater foreign share of the debt overhang ( f ) increases the attractiveness of the inflation tax

since it increases the share of the tax paid by foreign lenders. Less efficient tax collection

(bigger τ ) increases the gain associated with the inflation tax. Higher fiscal expenditure (g) is

associated with a higher tax rate t as well as higher inflation. Higher indexation ( θ ) reduces the

efficacy of inflation as an implicit tax, thereby increasing the explicit tax rate, t.

        Figure 12 summarizes a simulation of the model for parameter values comparable to

today’s experience. The initial debt overhang is set at b =0.5, the share held by foreign creditors

is f = 0.5, and fiscal expenditures as a share of GDP is g = 0.25. In addition, average annual

debt maturities are set at m = 4, the share of indexed bonds at θ = 0.10, and the annual real

interest rate at r = 0.01. Finally, we (somewhat arbitrarily) set the tax collection cost at τ =0.25


                                                             15
(implying that 4 cents of each dollar in gross tax payments covers collection costs when the tax

rate is t =0.30).

         A simulation with these parameter values suggests that positive low inflation

significantly reduces the debt overhang. For example, a 6 percent inflation rate reduces the

public debt/GDP ratio from 50 percent to about 40 percent within 4 years.

         Applying parameter values that duplicate the 1946 experience to the base model ( b =

1.1, g = .25, f = 0, θ = 0, r = 0.01, and m =9) results in an inflation rate around 3 percent.

This inflation rate is below the 4.2 percent average inflation observed over the decade 1946-

1955, but not by much.

         One problem is that the simulation is hampered by not having accurate values for

deadweight losses associated with income taxes and inflation, and these costs may differ today

compared to the 1940s.20 To illustrate, suppose the cost of inflation was lower in the aftermath

of World War II. Figure 13 shows the relationship between projected inflation after World War

II and the cost of inflation, φ, where a higher φ is associated with a lower inflation cost. The

earlier simulation assumed φ = 1.15. Increasing φ to 1.4 would increase predicted inflation in the

aftermath of World War II to about 6 percent, above the average inflation for the decade 1946-

1955 but about equal to the rate observed over the shorter 1946-1952 period. Of course, this

example suggests that if the cost of inflation and other structural parameters are not stable over

time, intertemporal comparisons are problematic.




   In the model, the cost of inflation is 1 − hπ . If h=1 and φ=1.15, an inflation of 5 percent is associated with an
20                                            φ

output cost during the inflation-disinflation cycle of about 3 percent of GDP. The inflation rate predicted by the
model depends critically on the assumed inflation cost. Above some threshold inflation, these costs may arguably
accelerate. In another context, Bruno and Easterly (1998) show that the cost of inflation increases above some
threshold.

IV. Conclusion

A lesson to take from the model and the simulations is that eroding the debt through inflation is

not farfetched. The model predicts that a moderate inflation of 6 percent could reduce the

debt/GDP ratio by 20 percent within 4 years. That inflation rate is only slightly higher than the

average observed after World War II. Of course, inflation projections would be much higher

than 6 percent if the share of publicly-held debt in the U.S. were to approach the 100 percent

range observed at the end of World War II. Hence, while moderate inflation may help reduce

today's debt burden, it is a much less powerful tool for addressing long-term fiscal challenges.

         The current period shares two features with the immediate post-war period. It starts with

a large debt overhang and low inflation. Both factors increase the temptation to erode the debt

burden through inflation.

         Even so, there are two important differences between the periods. Today, a much greater

share of the public debt is held by foreign creditors—48 percent instead of zero. This large

foreign share increases the temptation to inflate away some of the debt.21                   Another important

difference is that today’s debt maturity is less than half what it was in 1946—3.9 years instead of

9. Shorter maturities reduce the temptation to inflate. These two competing factors appear to

offset each other, and the net result in a simple optimizing model is a projected inflation rate

slightly higher than that experienced after World War II, but for a shorter duration.

         In the model simulation, we raised a concern about the stability of some parameters

across periods, particularly the parameters that capture the cost of inflation. It may be that the

cost of inflation is higher today because globalization and the greater ease of foreign direct


21
  Figure 12 suggests that if all debt today were held by domestic creditors (f= 0), projected inflation would be zero.
Thus, ‘tax your neighbor’ is a key feature of the inflationary bias suggested by the model. Of course, with a higher
debt/GDP ratio approaching IMF estimates of b = 1, inflation could be positive even with f = 0.



                                                          17
investment provide new options for producers to move activities away from countries with

greater uncertainty. Inflation above some threshold could generate this uncertainty, reducing

further the attractiveness of using inflation to erode the debt.

            Moreover, history suggests that a modest inflation may increase the risk of an

unintended inflation acceleration to double digit levels, as happened in 1947, and in 1979-1981.

Such an outcome often results in an abrupt and costly adjustment down the road.22 Accelerating

inflation had limited global implications at a time when the public debt was held domestically

and the U.S. was the undisputed global economic leader. In contrast, unintended acceleration of

inflation to double digit levels in the future may have unintended adverse effects, including

growing tensions with global creditors and less reliance on the dollar.23




22
  Such a cycle is also politically costly because U.S. savers are exposed to another volatile cycle in their retirement
and savings accounts.

I. The American Revolutionary War Period (1775-1801)

       Figure A.1, taken from Stabile and Cantor (1991, p. 2), shows the growth of

Federal debt as a share of GNP from 1790 to 1990. Although GNP figures are suspect

before 1840, the date of the first census, the graph clearly illustrates the large increase in

the debt/GNP ratio during wartime and the large decline afterwards.

       In this Appendix, we briefly examine the American Revolutionary War (1776-

1781) and the Civil War (1861-1865) periods and ask to what extent inflation helped

erode the debt/GDP ratio in the aftermath of these wars. We find that inflation played

virtually no role. Instead, GNP growth and tariff revenue applied to redeeming debt

principal and interest reduced the debt ratio in the aftermath of these major conflicts.

       Revolutionary War Period. The Congress and the states financed most of The

War of Independence (1776-1781) by issuing paper money, resulting in a rapid inflation

and currency depreciation. Although the war was about 85 percent financed by money

printing, the government also borrowed funds, mostly from its own citizens, though the

French government and Dutch investors also provided some loans.

       The U.S. Congress first started borrowing in October, 1776. The interest rate

offered was 4 percent, payable in specie or its equivalent in foreign bills of exchange, and

the certificates had a 3-year maturity. In February, 1777, to attract investors, the interest

rate was raised to 6 percent and the new securities had no fixed maturity dates. The 3-

year certificates previously issued were not retired on schedule, since redemption funds

were nonexistent; instead, they were converted into open-ended obligations as well. In

March 1778, the offer to pay interest in specie was withdrawn and holders were promised




                                              30
interest payments merely in currency.24 In the 1780s, holders received interest payments

in IOUs. Since no one knew when congressional debts would be repaid, or when and in

what form interest payments would be forthcoming, the securities traded at large

discounts. Even in the mid-1780s, sellers of federal securities received very low prices,

often ten to fifteen cents on the dollar.

            In 1789, after the ratification of a new Constitution and the inauguration of the

first President, Alexander Hamilton was appointed Secretary of the Treasury. He

reported to Congress in January, 1790. He stated that the federal domestic debt was

roughly $40 million, consisting of $27 million in original principal plus $13 million in

accrued interest. Another $12 million was owed to foreign creditors.

         Hamilton made several recommendations to Congress. He proposed federal

assumption of the remaining wartime debts of the states, which would increase the size of

the debt by another $18 to $25 million (ultimately it was $18 million, bringing the total

federal debt to $70 million, about 27 percent of GNP). He proposed converting all

outstanding debt securities into specie-denominated securities at the official par of

exchange. The essence of Hamilton’s proposal was to defer repayment of debt principal

indefinitely but resume interest payments (the $13 million in arrears) in specie.

        Hamilton believed that it would make little difference to investors that the bonds

had no fixed maturity dates as long as the government pledged to maintain regular

interest payments. His calculation that funding interest payments would drive up bond

prices (close to par) and reduce yields proved correct. To generate the revenues to cover

the interest on the national debt, Hamilton proposed a tax program that relied primarily

on an import tariff. After much heated debate, Congress passed the Funding Act of 1790

and Hamilton’s plan was enacted.25



B. The Civil War Period (1861-1900)

        When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Congress authorized the Treasury to issue

Treasury notes (called greenbacks) as legal tender for payment of all public and private

debts and also authorized the sale of bonds. Later, it increased taxes on specific goods,

but as these taxes were inadequate to raise the necessary funds to fight the war, a

continued reliance on money printing and borrowing was unavoidable. Between 1860 and

1865, when the Civil War ended, prices almost doubled. At the end of 1865, interest-

bearing debt stood at $2.7 billion, about 30 percent of GNP, all of it owed to domestic

creditors.26

        With the war over, Congress gave the Secretary of the Treasury authority to

convert short-term notes into long-term bonds and begin retiring greenbacks (Bolles,

1886). In 1869, it authorized the payment of all interest-bearing obligations in “hard

money”—specie. Tax revenue generated primarily through the import tariff was used to

pay interest on the debt and a certain amount of the principal each year. By 1880, the

public debt had been reduced substantially (the debt/GNP ratio was under 20 percent),

through a combination of economic growth and tax revenue targeted at paying interest

and principal on the debt.

  After the Civil War, foreigners began purchasing U.S. government debt. By the end of 1866, they held
13 percent of the public debt. By 1869, they held about 48 percent (Stabile and Cantor, 1991).
