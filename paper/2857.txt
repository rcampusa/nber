              TRENDS IN WORKER DEMAND FOR UNION REPRESENTATION


                                   ABSTRACT


     The dramatic decline in the demand for union representationamong

nonunion workers over the last decade is investigated using data on worker

preferences for union representationfrom four surveys conducted in 1977,

1980, 1982, and 1984.   Relatively little of the decline can be accounted for

by shifts in labor force structure.   However, virtually all of the decline

is correlated with an increase in the satisfaction of nonunion workers with

their jobs and a decline in nonunion workers' beliefs that unions are able

to improve wages and working conditions.

                                 December 1988


      The stagnation of labor unions in the United States moved into a new

phase in the mid-1970's as the fraction of the workforce     unianized began to

fall rapidly.   Tabulations of May Current Population Surveys (CPS) from 1973

through 1985 show that union membership as a fraction of private

nonagricultural employment fell from approximately 25% of employment in the
1973-1975 period to approximately   15% in the 1983-1985   period.   I   have

explored various explanations   for this decline   in some recent work (Farber,

1987, 1989) where I conclude, based on the analysis of data from a variety of

sources,   that 1) only a small fraction of the decline in unionization can be

accounted for by shifts in labor force structure, 2) there has been a
substantial drop in demand for union representationamong nonunion workers

that cannot be accounted for by shifts in labor force structure, and 3) there

has been a substantial increase in employer resistance to unionization that

is likely to have made it more difficult    for unions to organize even those

workers who desire union representation.    Other work by Dickens and Leonard

(1985) and by Freeman and Medoff (1984) support these conclusions.

      In this study I focus on one aspect of the decline in unionization,           and

that is the trend in demand for union representationamong nonunion workers.

My earlier work on this problem relied in part on data from the 1977 Quality
of Employment Survey (QES) and a survey conducted by Lewis Harris and

Associates for the AFL-CIO (AFL) in 1984.     Here the analysis is extended to

include the 1980 wave of the National Longitudinal Survey of Young Men (NLSB)

and the 1982 wave of the National Longitudinal Survey of Young Women (NLSG).

Along with the usual information on personal characteristics,          all four of

these surveys contain responses     to a question, called VFU here and asked of

nonunion workers, asking whether he/she would vote for union representation

on their current job if a secret ballot election were held.           The response to

this question (No—O, Yes—l) is interpreted as an indicator of the worker's

demand for unionization.     All four surveys also contain varying degrees of

information regarding job satisfaction and perceptions         of the instrumentality

of unions in improving wages and working conditions.                              -




I.   The Data and Tabulations

       Both the 1977 QES and the 1984 AFL Survey were designed to yield

representative    samples of the nonunion workforce.       However,   the 1980 NLSB and

the.l%$2'NLSG                          They both include only workers between
                 are not representative.

the ages of twenty-eight and thirty-nine in the relevant year, and nonwhites

are over-representedin both samples.            Samples were generated from each of

the four surveys     in an identical fashion.      These samples consist of all

nonunion non-managerialworkers outside of agriculture and mining who were

not self-employed.     Simple tabulations       of VFU among nonunion workers show

that 38.6% of 663 workers in the the QES, 37.8% of 1242 workers in the NLSE,

43.5% of 1339 workers in the NLSG, and 33.7% of 935 workers in the AFL survey

would vote for union representation.1           There is no apparent trend, but

because preferences for union representationare likely to be correlated with

both age and race, these simple tabulations will be misleading.            Multivariate

techniques   that control for sample compositionwill be required to uncover

any trend in the data.

II.      thx a     Negative In4 ft Nonunion Workers' Demand for
      Representation?:    fl       Worker Characteristics                 -




         In   order to account for the differences    in sample composition, a linear

probability model of the probability that a worker would vote for union

representation that controls for age, race, sex, and year (survey) was
estimated.2      A subset of these estimates are contained in table           1.    All of

the variables      used in this analysis are 0-1 dichotomous variables with the

exception of "year" which can take any of four values (77,80,82,84).                  The

base group consists of white male workers from the QES (1977) who are under

twenty-five years old.

         The results of this analysis are clearcut.          While not presented in the

table, older nonunion workers are significantly         less likely to desire union

representationwhile nonwhites and females are significantly more likely to
desire union representation.        There is a declining      time pattern of demand for

union representation,      though it is not estimated very precisely.              The base

group for the estimates       in column 1 is the QES.    Workers in succeeding

surveys have progressively smaller probabilities         of demanding union

representation.      An F-test of the hypothesis that the three survey dummies

have zero coefficients has a p-value of .095, suggesting that there is a

significant decline in demand for union representation.            The estimates in

column 2 of table I constrain the year dummies to lie along a linear time

trend.     A statistically significantnegative trend is estimated,             and the

hypothesis that the year dummies lie along this trend cannot be rejected at

any reasonable level of significance.        The magnitude      of this trend is such

that the probability chat the average worker demanded union representation

fell 5.8 (se—2.34) percentage points between 1977 and 1984.

         Column 3 of table 1 contains estimates      -of a   linear probability model

that includes additional controls for education         (4 categories),       occupation (5

categories),      and industry (6 categories).3   The results confirm that, while
                                                 4


these additional variables          contribute   significantly to the fit of the model,
                                                               the probability
there is still a significant downward trend (p-value—. 031) in

that a nonunion worker demands union representation.             These estimates suggest

that approximately twenty-five percent of the 5.8 percentage point decline

estimated using the model in column 2 is accounted for by shifts in the
                                    and industrial structure of employment.    There
educational,    occupational,

remains an unexplained negative trend of 4.4 (se—2.4) percentage points.

      An important issue is the extent to which the results are simply due to

a peculiarity in a single survey. The VFU question is asked slightly -

differently in the    four surveys, and the allowed responses are slightly

different.     In addition, the context of the surveys may differ enough to bias

the results.     In order to examine these issues, the model in column 3 of
                                                                               All four
table 1 was reestimated deleting each of the four samples in turn.

estimates     of the time trend derived through this procedure were significantly

less than zero at conventional levels, and,            in no case, was the negative

trend substantially smaller than the overall result.4             This clearly suggests

that the negative trend in the demand for union representation by nonunion

workers found in table 1 is robust to the particular samples used.



III. So Why                           Decline j1 Demand for   j21 ReDresentation?
        Only about one-fourth of the decline in demand for union representation

among   nonunion workers between 1977 and 1984 can be explained by shifts in

labor force structure.            Clearly, other factors must be considered.

        By working with       a   sample strictly of nonunion workers it is appropriate

to investigate the role of subjective variables, specifically measures of job

satisfaction and worker perèeptions of how unions change jobs, that may be

 important    in determining the demand for union representation.5 Both the QES

and the AFL survey have comparable measures of 1) job satisfaction in key

 dimensions    and   -2)   worker perceptions of the ability of unions in the abstract
                                              5


to improve wages and working conditions            (union instrumentality).           In both

surveys,    the questions   referred to are similar, and the allowed responses are

scaled alike.     There is less information on these issues in the 1980 NLSB and

the 1982 NLSG.     These surveys contain only a single overall measure of job

satisfaction that is roughly comparable to those contained in the QES and AFL

survey.    Neither the NLSB nor the NLSG contain any information on worker

perceptions of union instrumentality.
         The analysis proceeds in two stages.         First, the relationship of

overall job satisfactionwith VFU is investigated using information frow all

four surveys.     Next, the relationships         with VFU of both 1) Job satisfaction

in specific dimensions and 2) perceptions of union instrumentality                      are

investigated using data from the QES and the AFL survey.
         The measures of satisfactionwere developed using a four value response

scale.     These were recoded to two values (1 —         satisfied,       0 —   not   satisfied).6

A very large fraction of each nonunion sample report that they are satisfied

                                      86.7%, NLSB - 93.9%, NLSG            93.1%, AFL
                                  -                                   -                   -
with their job overall (QES

89.0%).     A simple cross-tabulation of the response to the VFU question for

the four surveys yields the result that overall job satisfaction is strongly

related to the probability that a nonunion worker would vote for union

representation (p-value<.00l).          Among satisfied workers, 36.4% would vote for

union representation.       Among dissatisfiedworkers, 64.2% would vote for union

representation.     This result is consistent         across all four surveys.

         The linear probability model of VFU among nonunion workers was

reestimated including additionally the measure of overall job satisfaction.7

This multivariate analysis confirms the finding that the probability that a

worker desires union representationis strongly and significantly related to

job satisfaction.     Otherwise       equivalent nonunion workers who are satisfied

with their job are estimated to be 27.2 percentage points (se—2.5) less

likely to desire union representation.             However,   this does not seem to
                                             6



explain the negative trend in demand.            When the measure of overall job

satisfaction is included, the negative time trend is reduced from .63

percentage points per year (se—.34) to .55 percentage points per year

(se—.33).     This is a reduction of only thirteen percent.

      The QES and AFt surveys include additional information on job

satisfaction and union instrumentality           in particular dimensions.    The

dimensions along which comparable measures are available in both surveys are
                                                                              These
1) satisfaction with pay, and 2) satisfaction with job security.

satisfaction measures were recoded to two values (1 —            satisfied,   0 —   not
satisfied).     The only dimension of the job for which a comparable measure of

union instrumentality    was available in both the surveys is wages and working

conditions.      The union instrumentality       measure was also recoded from a four

value response scale to two values (1— unions improve wages and working

conditions,    0 — unions do not).8
          Table 2 contains breakdowns of the satisfaction and instrumentality

variables by union status for each of the two samples.             There was a small and

statistically insignificant increase in the fraction of the nonunion sample
                                                                            —
that reported overall satisfactionbetween 1977 and 1984 (p-value of change

 .160).     Job satisfaction in the two particular dimensions analyzed was lower

than overall satisfaction.      The most striking result for nonunion workers in

table 2 is that reported levels of satisfaction with pay and job security

rose dramatically between 1977 and 1984.              Both of these changes are

statistically significantwith p-values            <   .001.

          The analogous statistics for union members are included in table 2 in

order to shed some light on the question of whether the increase in

satisfaction among nonunion workers is likely to be an artifact of

differences in survey design between the QES and the AFt survey.               In fact,

 the patterns for union workers are quite different than for nonunion workers.

There are no significant differences in any of the three measures of
                                         7


satisfaction between 1977 and 1984.     These findings suggest that the results

for the nonunion workers are unlikely to be an artifact of differences        in

survey design.
        The reasons for the increase in perceived job satisfaction among

nonunion workers are not clear.     Satisfaction with pay may reflect how

workers evaluate their pay relative to either their best alternatives or some

norm that they consider equitable.     Given the well known stagnation in real

earnings since the mid 1970's, the general increase in worker satisfaction
with pay suggests that the standards against which workers judge their wages

fell.    In other words, the period from 1977 through 1984 may be marked by

declining expectations,   and this may be a cause of the decrease in demand for

union representation.

        With regard to union instrumentality, the numbers in the second part of

table 2 suggest that, while most nonunion workers still believe that unions

improve the wages and working conditions of workers,     the fraction of nonunion

workers who believe that unions are effective in this dimension fell

significantly from 1977 to 1984 (p-value<.OOl).      Thus,   nonunion workers are

less likely to believe that unions can help with a central area of concern on

the job.    There is no corresponding decline among union workers so that, as

with job satisfaction,    it is reasonable   to conclude that the change in

attitudes   among nonunion workers is not an artifact of survey design
differences.

        It remains to demonstrate   the links between worker preferences for

union representation and these subjective measures of job satisfaction and

union instrumentality.    While not presented here, simple cross tabulations        of

the data show that nonunion worker preferences      for unionization are very

strongly related to satisfaction and union instrumentalityin the expected
directions and that these relationships      persist between 1977 and 1984.    Each

of the differences by satisfaction/instrumentality      level in the fraction who
                                                   8


would vote for union representation is statistically                significant with

p-values <         .001.

      An important testis to determine how much of the 4.4 percentage point

decline in the demand for union representation among nonunion workers between

1977 and 1984 estimated above can be accounted for by the increase in job

satisfaction and the decline in perceptions of unions' ability to improve

jobs.    A version of the linear probabilitymodel of VFU that includes the

three measures of job satisfaction and the single measure of union

instrumentality            along with the full set of labor force structure control

variables was estimated over the sample of nonunion workers from the QES and

the AFL survey.            The estimated relationship       is


        VEIl   —       - .248*SAT   -   .141*SATPAY .O96*SATSEC ÷.159*UIMPW +.00223*Year
                       (.037)       (.026)         (.030)          (.031)           (.0035)

                                    .190                         n—1489

where   Xfl    represents     the set of labor force control variables,          SAT —l if the

worker is satisfied with job overall, SATFAY —l if the worker is satisfied

with wages, SATSEC —l if the worker is satisfied with job security,                      and UIMPW

—l if the worker feels that unions improve wages and working conditions.                      The

numbers in parentheses are standard errors.

        All four subjective measures are strongly significantly related to

demand for union representationin the expected direction.                    A   worker who is

dissatisfied with his/her job by all three measures and who feels that unions

are instrumental in improving wages and working conditions is estimated to be

64.4 percentage points (se.4.9) more likely to desire union representation

than a worker who is fully satisfied and who feels unions are not

instrumental.

        The estimated time trend is actually insignificantly                 positive after

controlling for satisfaction and union instrumentality.9                    Thus,    all of the

decline in demand for union representation               among nonunion workers between
                                          9


1977 and 1984 can be accounted for by the increase in nonunion workers'

satisfaction and decrease in perceptions of union instrumentality.



IV. Final Remarks

      In light of this evidence, what can the union movement do to recoup its

losses?     The results on the relationship between worker demand for union

representation on the one hand and job satisfaction and union instrumentality
on the other suggest that the task is to convince workers that unions can
                                              The union movement has begun to
play an effective role in the workplace.
define new organizing strategies for this purpose, but their task is

difficult at best until workers feel that unions can help with aspects of

their jobs that they are not satisfied with (AFL-CIO, 1985).

      The role of increased employer resistance to union organizing activity

has not been considered here, but other work (Freeman and Medoff,     1984;

Farber, 1987; Farber, 1989) suggests that this is another important and

related factor in the decline of unionization.      Concern about employer

resistance has prompted the union movement to call for reform of the National

Labor Relations Act to provide an environment where current employer

practices    to discourage union organizingwill be less effective.    However,

until our society as a whole is more favorably disposed toward unions, such

reform will be difficult to achieve.

      One    recurring   theme in the debate over the future of unions in the

private sector is that the competitiveness     of the economy has increased

dramatically and that labor unions may be less viable in such an economic
environment. Unions need to convince workers that they offer real value in

the modern competitive economy.

Note:   There are 626 nonunion workers and 289 union workers in the QES sample
used here. There are 927 nonunion workers and 230 union workers in the AFL
sample used here. The AFL 1984 survey undersampled union workers by
approximately ten percent.

   linear probabilitymodel was estimated here because interpretation of the

results is much more straightforward    than in a statistically more appropriate

probit or logit model.    Ease of interpretationis particularly important

given the severe length constraints on this paper.            Every set of estimates
and every statistical inference in this study has been verified using a

probit model.   The results are identical in all relevant respects.                     -



3The base group for this model consists of white male blue-collar workers in

manufacturing with 12 years of education who are under 25 years old.

4The estimates ranged in magnitude from      -   .00547   (se—. 00347) to   -   .0154

(se—.00673).

5See Seidman, London, and Karsh (1951) and Rees (1962) for early discussions

of the role of these factors.     Farber and Saks (1980) present relevant

evidence from a different source.

7While detailed results are not presented here, all specifications include

controls for sex, rade, five categories of age, four categories of education,

six categsrIes of industry, and five categories           of occupation.        See column 3

of table 1 for details.

9The estimated decline in demand for union representationusing the same

sample of 1489 observations from the QES and AFL survey and the full set of
labor force structure control variables but without using measures of

satisfaction or instrumentality    is 4.2 (se—2.5) percentage points.
