                                             ABSTRACT

Children in many extremely poor, remote regions are growing up illiterate and innumerate despite
high reported school enrollment ratios. Possible explanations for such poor outcomes include demand
­ for example, low perceived returns to education compared to opportunity cost; and supply ­ poor
state provision and inability of parents to coordinate and finance better schooling. We conducted a
cluster-randomized trial in rural Guinea Bissau to understand the effectiveness and cost of concerted
supply-based interventions in such contexts. Our intervention created simple schools offering four
years of education to primary-school aged children in lieu of the government. At endline, children
receiving the intervention scored 58.1 percentage points better than controls on early grade reading
and math tests, demonstrating that the intervention taught children to read and perform basic arithmetic,
from a counterfactual condition of very high illiteracy. Our results provide evidence that particularly
needy areas may require more concerted, dramatic interventions in education than those usually considered,
but that such interventions hold great potential for increasing education levels among the world's poorest
people.

1. Introduction

Children in many extremely poor, remote regions are growing up illiterate and innumerate

despite high reported school enrolment ratios. This "schooling without learning" has many

alleged sources, such as insufficient demand for schooling, inadequate schooling materials, and

lack of qualified, motivated teachers. This leads to three phenomena: one, a substantial part of

the population being illiterate and innumerate; two, for those groups, lower lifetime incomes as a

result, and less opportunity to succeed in the growing worlds around them; and three, greater

socioeconomic inequality.

       In this paper, we report the results of a cluster-randomized controlled trial (RCT)

evaluating a supply-based intervention which aims to dramatically increase learning levels in

particularly poor, rural areas of the developing world. The intervention provides the early years

of primary school in lieu of the government; this entails hiring, training, and monitoring teachers

tasked with delivering schooling, from the pre-primary level on to grade 3, to primary-aged

children. The intervention uses a bespoke curriculum which includes teacher training materials

and teaching and learning materials for both teachers and students. It also employs frequent

monitoring and assessment of teachers and children and regular community outreach /

involvement. We conducted this RCT in rural areas of Guinea Bissau, one of the poorest and

most troubled countries on the planet (da Silva and Oliveira 2017).

       The intervention yielded transformative learning gains among children who would

otherwise be unlikely to ever achieve literacy and numeracy. After four years of receiving the

intervention, children in the intervention group scored 58 percentage points better than children

in the control group on a composite score of tests of mathematics and reading ability. This

difference comprises large gains in both math and reading ability across the difficulty spectrum,




                                                 1
from letter and number recognition to reading comprehension and two-digit subtraction with

borrowing. A very high proportion of control children had zero scores on these tests, suggesting

that the counterfactual is functional illiteracy and innumeracy for many children.

        These gains are dramatic in absolute as well as relative terms, with intervention children

from rural Guinea Bissau exhibiting literacy and numeracy skills similar to children in much

wealthier countries with functioning school systems. A commonly-used metric for measuring

reading skill among early grade children is oral reading fluency (ORF), measured by the correct

number of words read per minute from a set passage. Endline ORF of children randomized to

receive the intervention was 75 correct words per minute. This compares favorably to the ORF

measured in a 2014 national assessment of third grade students in the Philippines and is similar

to that of the (much wealthier) Latin American countries who have used similar tests.1

        Our approach has important common traits with the influential studies of ambitious,

highly-resourced interventions in the US designed to address inequality and raise outcomes for

the less fortunate. The most famous of these are the Perry Pre-school and Abecedarian programs

(Campbell and Ramey 1994; 1995; Heckman, Pinto, and Savelyev 2013). There are three main

similarities: first, these programs targeted needy or at-risk children. Second, they provided a suite

of services, including a comprehensive educational intervention which comprised well-trained

and well-supervised teachers, a structured curriculum, and family outreach. Finally, similar to

our program, those programs were also relatively expensive, but demonstrated a positive return

on investment above that of equity (Heckman et al. 2010). Overall, we argue that our study

provides proof of concept that a resource-intensive intervention can generate large gains in a

challenging setting, but perhaps with a model that might be difficult to scale or replicate. This is

reflected in other work which documents that achieving scalable impacts in education is difficult,

especially among highly effective interventions (Banerjee et al. 2017; Bold et al. 2018).

       Our approach also parallels research on the efficacy of charter schools and "model

schools" in the US (Angrist, Pathak, and Walters 2013; Dobbie and Fryer Jr 2013). These studies

show that new, non-governmental schools which combine a suite of teaching practices and other

components known to be effective can substantially improve learning, relative to traditional

public schools. Furthermore, gains are largest in contexts, similar to ours, where the status quo

option is of particularly low quality (Chabrier, Cohodes, and Oreopoulos 2016).

       Our findings contribute to ongoing efforts to identify effective means to increase learning

levels, and welfare more generally, in the poorest parts of the world (McEwan 2015; Glewwe

and Muralidharan 2016). A growing set of studies shows the potential for targeted interventions

to achieve large gains in settings with low learning levels (c.f., Burde and Linden 2012;

Muralidharan, Singh, and Ganimian 2019). We advance this work by showing the success of a

concerted supply-based intervention ­which delivered all aspects of early primary education

instead of the government ­ in achieving these goals in a particularly challenging setting. Our

approach mirrors the use of "bundled" interventions to tackle otherwise intractable problems,

such as extreme poverty (Banerjee et al. 2015).

       The rest of our paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the context we work in, the

challenges we encountered in initial implementation, and the final intervention design. Section 3

describes our research design. Section 4 presents our main results. Section 5 discusses our results

in the context of other studies of education in disadvantaged areas and Section 6 concludes.

2. Background and intervention details

In this section, we describe the context in which the study took place, the initial challenges faced

in early attempts to implement the intervention, and the final intervention we study.


2.1 Context

Guinea Bissau is a Lusophone country in West Africa with a population of approximately 1.8

million people. Once a Portuguese colony, it attained independence in 1974. Since then, it has

been beset by political and economic troubles. There have been four coups d'etat since its

founding. Until 2018, there had been no elected president who had completed a full five-year

term. It is one of the poorest countries in the world both on per-capita GDP terms and according

to the UN's Human Development Index (da Silva and Oliveira 2017). Aside from some parts of

the capital, there is no national power or water grid. The economy is largely dependent on

agriculture, primarily cashews. Because of its geographic location and low state capacity, Guinea

Bissau has been used as a way station for the transportation of cocaine to Europe, adding to

corruption and governance issues (da Silva and Oliveira 2017). The official language of the

country is Portuguese but the dominant language is Crioulo ­ a hybrid of Portuguese and several

local tongues ­ which is spoken as a first or second language by the majority of the population.

       In Figure A.1 we show a map of the country and our study areas. Our study took place in

villages in the Quinara and Tombali regions in the southwest of the country. These regions were

selected for two reasons: first, the government requested that we work in the two regions as they

were less well-served by existing NGO work; second, Boone et al. (2014) identified them as the

regions with the lowest learning levels in the country.




                                                 4
2.2 Education, literacy, and numeracy in Guinea Bissau

Guinea Bissau's official education system comprises three levels: nine years of compulsory,

basic education (four years of lower primary, called the "first cycle"; two years of upper primary,

or second cycle; and three years of middle school, or third cycle), followed by three years of

elective secondary school and then higher education. The official ages for primary school are

currently 6 to 12; they were 7 to 13 at the start of our trial. As in many developing countries, the

age at which children actually enter school varies widely.

           Boone et al. (2014) report the results of a nationally representative survey of schools,

families, and children across Guinea Bissau in 2010.2 They found very low education levels

among parents, with much lower levels for mothers than for fathers: among fathers,

approximately 40 percent had ever been to school, and 24 percent were able to read a printed

paragraph. Among mothers, only nine percent had ever been to school, and 2.8 percent were able

to read the same paragraph. Among children, however, the survey found substantial enrolment in

school: approximately 85 percent of interviewed children between the ages of 7 and 17 had been

to school, and 70 percent were currently enrolled. Unfortunately, these high enrolments did not

translate to learning. Among all surveyed children in this age range, fewer than one third could

recognize a single digit number or read a single, simple Portuguese word.

           Parents appeared to recognize the low quality of the education their children were getting,

and in the survey they expressed demand for higher quality schools. Of the over 8,500 parents

and caregivers interviewed, more than 98 percent asserted that they would be willing to pay, on

average, approximately 20 percent of household income per school-aged child, for better

schooling for the child. The authors' interpretation of the patterns in their data is that there is

                                                    5
probably substantial demand in rural Guinea Bissau for quality schooling, but some combination

of income, credit market failures, capacity, and collective action constraints impede its provision.

Even so, the extremely poor educational outcomes in these regions ­ regardless of the type of

schools ­ suggests that either demand or supply could be the key reason that children grow up

mostly illiterate and innumerate. These findings motivated the current study.


2.3 Status quo provision of education in study area

Guinea Bissau is often considered a "failed state" because of its frequent coups, highly irregular

payment of its civil servants, and the absence of many basic government services. Education is

one such service, and the reach of government schools in most areas, including our study area, is

uneven and erratic. At baseline, only half of schools in our trial area were run by the government,

with the rest run by either the local community (35%) or an NGO or other private organization

(15%). Ostensibly, children are meant to attend school for four hours per day, five days per

week, nine months out of the year. In practice, government schools were open less frequently in

our study area because of teacher strikes in these schools; according to official data, strikes

disrupted roughly 25% of school days for government schools during our study. Not all official

strikes made their way to our rural areas, however, and roughly half of the schools in the control

area were not run by the government and so were not affected.

       While statistical data from the government and other sources is sparse, Boone et al.

(2014) also provide a thorough description of the "status quo" of education provision in rural

Guinea Bissau. The study visited schools to collect data on teachers (presence and demographic

data), as well as infrastructure data from a representative sample of 351 schools and 781

teachers. The authors found that 86 percent of visited schools were open, with teachers present




                                                  6
and teaching, and 72 percent of enrolled children were present when the schools were visited.3

These schools all had chalkboards and roughly one textbook for every 30 children. The average

pupil:teacher ratio (for combined grades 1-4, as many schools have combined classrooms) was

63.4, with a high standard deviation (24.4). Boone et al. (2014) found very low correlation

between either teacher qualifications or school resources and child learning levels, corroborating

prior studies of this correlation in schools in the country (Lepri 1988; Daun 1997).

         Overall, these areas are characterized by extremely low learning levels despite the fact

that, barring strikes, schools are usually open and teacher and student absenteeism is relatively

low. Although Boone et al. (2014) set out to find examples of success in these areas, it found no

such examples. A main conclusion of their paper, which also motivated this study, is that in

Guinea Bissau "the public sector cannot be relied on to provide regular services due to political

instability, institutional capacity, and a political system that does not serve the very poor."


2.4 Intervention design

Initially, we recruited a group of nearly 50 prospective "untrained" teachers to deliver the

intervention and trained them for one year.4 At the end of this year of training, the trainees

reneged on their commitments to us, demanding a dramatic change in the agreed-upon

employment conditions ­ including a salary increase to a level equivalent to that of the education

ministry's director-general ­ and sued us in the country's courts. While the government sided

with us and these individuals' suit was determined to be without merit, we were forced to

postpone the study until the court case was resolved. The case was ultimately resolved in our

  This level of teacher absenteeism is lower than found in Uganda in Chaudhury et al. (2006) and at the lower end of
the range of what Blimpo, Evans, and Lahire (2011) observe in Gambia.

  Originally this study was part of a larger effort to study the generalizability of a para teacher intervention in India
(Lakshminarayana et al. 2013), run in tandem with a similar effort in The Gambia (Eble et al. 2019)


                                                           7
favor, but resulted in our loss of all 48 selected candidates. In Appendix A, we explain this

experience in greater detail.

       We then had to begin the search for ­ and training of ­ candidates anew, and we decided

to hire certified teachers instead of untrained ones. The logic behind this decision was twofold:

one, these teachers required less training and so the extra training we gave them would be less

likely to cause them to demand dramatically higher compensation; two, it would allow us to start

the intervention more promptly. Using this strategy, we were able to identify fewer willing and

suitable candidates. As we describe in the next section, this led us to change our randomization

strategy from a 1:1 control:intervention cluster ratio to a 2:1 ratio.

       In villages randomly selected to receive the intervention, we provided four years of

school ­ first, a year of pre-primary school focusing on Portuguese language acquisition, then

grades 1-3 of the national primary education curriculum. This schooling was meant to take the

place of official instruction in these years usually delivered by Guinea Bissau's government

educational system. We included the year of pre-primary because the national curriculum is in

Portuguese. To the best of our knowledge, only a trivially small number of children in our study

area had any knowledge of the language at the time of school entry.

       We aimed to have 25 to 30 students per class, resulting in a total of 24 academic classes

across the 16 intervention villages in our study. Classes were held in spaces provided and

furnished by each community. This request for support from the community was intended to

promote community backing of the intervention and to increase parent involvement in the formal

education of their children and the management of the academic classes.

       The curriculum of these classes was designed to maximize child participation throughout

the day. The overall intervention strategy was inspired by the experience, design, tools, and




                                                   8
teaching methods of an early primary school intervention designed by the Naandi Foundation

and evaluated in a prior RCT in India (Lakshminarayana et al. 2013).5 Final instructional tools

were developed in consultation and with review by the ministry of education in Guinea Bissau,

covering the content in the official Guinea Bissau primary curriculum. These tools included daily

lesson plans, a teacher handbook, child workbooks, and other grade-specific didactic materials.

         Teachers were recruited with the requirement that they be able to speak and teach in the

local language spoken in the community in which they were assigned to work. Once hired, they

received two types of training: first, 10 weeks of initial pre-service training in how to implement

our intervention; second, four weeks of in-service training conducted annually before the

beginning of each new academic year to prepare teachers to teach the next year's content. These

emphasized the use of relevant, grade-appropriate teaching strategies as well as use of the

intervention's bespoke teaching and learning materials. In each village, the intervention also

hired a local adult who spoke the most prominent local language. This person assisted the teacher

for the first four months of the intervention to assist with classroom management and children's

transition from their use of their mother tongue to Portuguese.

         Teachers then conducted classes for five hours per day, five days a week, plus additional

hours when required by the curriculum plan or teachers' assessments of child learning needs.

This occurred for the duration of the study, nine months per year over the period February 2014

to December 2017, comprising 730 school days in total. Teachers were paid salaries of 200,000

Central African Francs (or CFA; roughly, US $345) per year, with an additional per-diem to

  This study, along with the study reported in Eble et al. (2019), were a part of larger efforts to attempt to replicate
the success of Lakshminarayana et al. (2013) in newer, more challenging contexts. In Eble et al. (2019), which took
place in The Gambia, the authors used the after-school supplementary lesson design of the intervention studied in
Lakshminarayana et al (2013). In Guinea Bissau, we shifted our strategy to providing regular schooling, instead of
the state, in light of the frequent, prolonged disruptions to state-provided education.


                                                           9
compensate them for the difficulty of living in the villages in which they worked (1,500 CFA, or

US $2.59, per day).6

         Throughout the trial, the intervention team monitored both teachers' work and children's

learning in order to track progress and ensure that learning was progressing as planned. Monitors

­ a separate cadre of staff recruited by the intervention arm ­ visited each academic class for two

days each month. This amounted to roughly 18 days of classroom observation in each class, each

year. The team conducted monthly, two-day review meetings for teachers and monitors. In these

meetings, teachers received feedback and training based on the evidence collected during that

month's classroom observations/monitoring. These meetings were also used to reinforce the

intervention's main methodology and teaching strategies, focusing on concrete examples of what

to do, how to do it, and what not to do. Each month, the intervention team assessed some

children on the curriculum in their current grade, and conducted larger-scale evaluations of child

learning every six months.

         Implementing this intervention was intensely challenging. We chose to work in small,

isolated villages; the rugged terrain, long distances between villages, and poor state of the roads

between them made frequent, spontaneous monitoring difficult, particularly during the rainy

season when some villages become inaccessible. These villages lacked internet connections and

reading materials, and had few or no literate residents who might reinforce child learning. This

also made it difficult to recruit qualified teachers, who were required to reside in the village.7

Further complicating literacy efforts, multiple languages are spoken in these regions, none of

which have their own script. Finally, none of the parents enumerated were native speakers of

 Although recruitment of teachers was difficult, once recruited, all teachers remained in the project until its

children's ability to practice and apply the lessons from class outside of school.


3. Research design

This section describes our research design, including the study population, our sample

size/power calculations, the nature of the data collected, and the pre-specified (relative to

unblinding of the data) analysis plan.


3.1 Study design

In the first screening of villages for eligibility, we began with all four hundred and thirty-nine

villages in the Quinara and Tombali regions with between 50 and 400 households according to

the Guinea Bissau National Institute of the Census.8 We used existing map information and

Quantum GIS (version 1.7.2) to select villages that were at least nine kilometers apart from each

other to avoid risks of spillover from one village to another. With this method we pre-selected 49

villages for enumeration, along with a set of backups should there be need for replacement.9

        We then conducted field visits to record the GPS points of these villages and confirm

whether they met the following three eligibility criteria for inclusion in our study: i) the village

had between 50 and 400 households; ii) the village was reachable by land during the country's

dry season; and iii) the village had no other NGO-administered education program taking place.

Within these villages, our eligibility criteria for enrolling children in the study were that: i) the

child was born between January 2007 and September 2008; ii) the child was resident in an

eligible village; iii) the child did not have any serious physical or mental conditions that may

 In this initial screening we also included villages for which information on the number of households was missing.

 As described in Section 2, because of the small number of trained teachers we could ultimately hire, we decided
upon a sample of 49 villages, with a 2:1 control:intervention ratio, meaning that 16 villages would be randomly
assigned to receive the intervention.


                                                        11
have impaired learning, i.e., severe developmental handicaps; and iv) the child's parents gave

consent to participate in the study.

         We further restricted eligibility to villages which had at least 20 eligible children. After

the initial village visits to confirm eligibility, four of the 49 pre-selected villages had fewer than

20 eligible children and therefore were not included; these villages were replaced with other

villages from the list of backups. We then enrolled these final 49 villages, containing a total of

2,112 eligible children, for participation in our study.10 Given the difficulty of finding qualified

teachers after the loss of our initial pool described in the previous section, we switched from a

1:1 control:intervention cluster ratio to a 2:1 ratio to ensure that we only worked in as many

villages as we could find qualified teachers for. Our final sample comprised 16 intervention

villages and 33 control villages.

         We conducted randomization by computer, stratifying at the village level based on a

composite variable comprising a weighted average of several indicators: the village's distance to

the nearest road, the highest grade taught by the local school (in the one case where the village

did not have a school, we set this to zero), the number of households in the village, the

proportion of mothers speaking Crioulo in the village, and the third quartile of mothers'

educational attainment in the village. We selected these variables on the assumption that they

would be correlated with the primary outcome, as shown in Boone et al. (2014). The results of

our cluster analysis suggested that randomizing within two strata were sufficient.11 This led to

the generation of one stratum with 32 villages, in which villages were randomized 2:1 to control

and intervention status, and another stratum with 17 villages and the same randomization profile.


10
   While the sample size is smaller than we initially planned, it is consistent with or somewhat larger than the sample
size of studies of other hard-to-reach populations, e.g., Burde and Linden's (2012) study of community schools in
Afghanistan.
11
   The cluster analysis was conducted in SAS Software version 9.3, using the command "PROC CLUSTER."


                                                          12
          From December 2012 to April 2013, we conducted our baseline enumeration for the

purposes of enrolling children into the study. The mean number of enumerated children per

village was 43. To conduct our sample size calculation, we took attrition figures from a study of

child health in the country, which suggested roughly 17% loss to follow-up over the course of

the study (Mann et al. 2009). Using this, we expected an average of 35 children per village to be

present for the endline test, and thus contribute to the primary outcome.

          This led to the following power calculation, conducted before commencing

randomization: a study population of 49 villages, with an average of 35 eligible children per

village and a 2:1 control:intervention randomization ratio, provides 92% power to detect a

difference in test scores of at least 0.25 SD in a two-sided test with a five percent significance

level, assuming an intra-cluster coefficient of 0.03. In Appendix Table A.1 we show similar

calculations for different scenarios (greater loss to follow-up and a 1:1 control:intervention

ratio). We registered our statistical pre-analysis plan (also known as an SAP or PAP) at

www.socialscienceregistry.com prior to unblinding of the data.12

          While the study was unblinded to participants ­ it was impossible to prevent parents from

knowing whether or not they were in a village that was receiving materials and teaching support

­ the research team that conducted the surveys and tested the children were not given

information on which villages were in each arm. Furthermore, these staff were closely monitored

to ensure that data collection procedures were consistent across all villages.

          In Tables 1 and 2, we provide summary statistics at the village and child level,

respectively, showing characteristics separately by whether the village/child is in the intervention

or control group. Relative to intervention villages, control villages tended to be slightly more

remote and larger in population. For the most part, children in the intervention and control arms

were quite similar. At the bottom of each table, we conduct a test for the joint significance of

these characteristics in predicting randomization status, as in Bruhn and McKenzie (2009).

3.2 Primary outcome and analysis methods

The pre-specified primary outcome of our study is the child's "composite score." This is the

arithmetic mean of the child's scores on EGRA an EGMA tests, administered sequentially, to

each enrolled child present in the village at time of testing in November and December of

2017.13 EGRA and EGMA tests assess early grade reading and math ability, respectively


13
  Our aggregation of EGRA and EGMA tests into a composite score was chosen for simplicity as a single primary
outcome, and for consistency with related work on delivering educational interventions to other deprived areas
(Lakshminarayana et al. 2013; McEwan 2015; Evans and Popova 2016; Eble et al. 2019). We note that this method
of aggregation is a departure from conventional use of EGRA and EGMA scores.

father's education, 21 observations are missing from the intervention and controls, respectively. *: Due to the
paucity of official birth or health records, we only have precise child age for 200 intervention children and 332
control children. To calculate the F-statistic, we replace these missing values with an arbitrary number not equal to

arbitrary number.

(Platas et al. 2014; Dubeck and Gove 2015). They are administered orally, one-on-one between

instructor and child. We chose them to serve as our primary outcome because they are

particularly sensitive in measuring small differences in ability among children who have very

low levels of learning, such as those in many parts of our trial area. Each test paper has several

different subtasks, evaluating a different skill or competency. In Table A.2, we describe the

nature of each subtask (the full test papers we used are given in Appendix B). In line with other

work using EGRA and EGMA tests, we also present individual test scores, subtask scores, zero

scores, and fluency measures (Platas et al. 2014; Dubeck and Gove 2015).

       For our primary analysis, we use a linear regression to estimate the child-level difference

between intervention and control groups in the primary outcome, controlling for the stratification

factor used in the randomization and nothing else. In all analyses we report robust standard

errors, clustering at the village level. Secondary analyses extend this model to (separately)

investigate interactions by a series of prespecified subgroups. For secondary outcomes that are

continuous, we also use a linear model. For those that are dichotomous (such as whether the

child was enrolled in school), we show both "adjusted" differences from a linear probability

model (i.e., the estimated coefficient for the intervention variable from the regression) and odds

ratios from our (pre-specified) logit model. To account for bias from potential differential

attrition between groups, we calculate lee bounds (Lee 2009) for our primary outcome and the

individual EGRA and EGMA scores.


3.3 Attrition and adherence

We next describe the flow of participants through the trial. Table 3 presents data on whether

enrolled children were present in their village at the trial's midline survey and again at the

endline survey. We observe roughly 13 percent attrition at midline (in the 2014/15 school year),

and roughly 20 percent attrition at endline, with greater attrition from the control arm than from

the intervention arm. We show the broader flow via a CONSORT-style diagram, in Figure 1 (M.

K. Campbell et al. 2012). We also present data on how frequently children assigned to the

4. Main results

In this section, we present our pre-specified empirical analyses describing the main results of our

study. We begin with the primary outcome ­ the composite test score ­ and then present

comparisons by test (reading or math) and subtasks within each test. We then analyze

heterogeneity in these results, the intervention's impact on enrollment in school and attendance,

and spillover effects to the child's siblings.


4.1 Primary outcome

We show our primary outcome, alongside the secondary outcomes for overall math and reading

scores, in Table 4. We observe a very large difference in composite test scores between children

in the control and intervention arms at the end of our study. The control child mean score was

11.2%; for intervention children, this mean is 70.5%, or a 58.1 percentage point adjusted

difference.14 A common learning metric in similar studies is to use the standard deviation of the

control group as a scale factor. In our setting, this is uninformative given the extremely low

learning levels of the control group.15 We show the distribution of test scores of the two groups

in Figure 2. Decomposing the composite score into its reading and math components, we observe

large differences in both tests, although they are larger in reading (6.8% correct vs. 72.5%) than

in math (15.6% correct vs. 68.5%). All differences are statistically significant (p<.001). To

bound the potential impact of differential attrition on our primary outcome estimates, we

calculate Lee bounds and show them in column 5 (Lee 2009). Because our randomization was

conducted with a small number of clusters, we also present finite sample randomization


14
   The adjusted difference is the intervention-control difference for a given variable after controlling for stratification
variables as pre-specified for our main analysis; equivalently, this is the regression coefficient on the intervention
using our main regression specification.
15
   Were we to use the control SD as a scale factor, the 58.1 percent difference in scores would correspond to a 5.31
SD difference in test scores between the two groups.

score differences we estimate are not likely to be the result of differential attrition or chance.


4.2 Reading

In this section, we describe the results of the EGRA test in greater detail. These are shown in

Table 5. In this table, we show three scores for each subtask: i) the average percent correct, ii),

for timed subtasks, the fluency scores, and iii) the percent of children with a zero score.

Table 5 notes: this table shows children's scores on the individual components of the reading test, separately by
treatment group. The number in parentheses next to each subtask corresponds to the subtask number given in Table
A.2. There are 563 observations in the intervention group and 1,081 observations in the control group. *: The lower
proportion of control group zero scores on subtask 5a is a result of the fact that the first question in this subtask
happened to be unusually easy. The question asks the child to read the Portuguese word "O," equivalent to the
English article "the," in the sentence "O macaco convidou a sua amiga..." Because O is also a letter, this question is
substantially less difficult than the questions asking children to read familiar or made-up words in subtasks 3 and 4.

         Intervention children substantially outperformed control children in reading: for all

subtasks, the control-intervention difference is at least 42 percentage points (out of 100).

Children in the intervention group demonstrated reading skill mastery across subtasks of all

                                                         20
difficulty levels. They were able to correctly read more than two thirds of the letters presented to

them (under a one minute time limit). For familiar word reading, the mean intervention child

read 79 percent of the 50 words presented correctly in one minute. For connected text reading,

the intervention children achieve a mean reading fluency of 75 words per minute, which is higher

than the defined reading proficiency benchmark for Grade 3 in most of the EGRA countries (RTI

International 2017). For the untimed tasks, the pattern was roughly the same. In the subtask

measuring children's comprehension of a connected text, the mean score for intervention

children was 72% of questions answered correctly. For the control group, it was one percent.

       Another meaningful comparison in EGRA- and EGMA-style tests is the proportion of

children with zero correct answers (i.e., "zero scores") in each subtask. We show this in the two

right-most columns of Table 5. These data highlight the exceptionally low learning levels among

the control group. In three of the five most difficult reading subtasks, 88 percent or more of the

control group earned zero scores. For example, more than 88 percent of the control children

tested at endline were unable to read even one of the 50 familiar words presented, compared to

only 1.2 percent of children in the intervention group (subtask 4). Similar patterns appear across

all subtasks involving reading or oral comprehension, except for subtask 5a (see footnote 15).

This corroborates the very low levels of literacy found in Boone et al. (2014).


4.3 Math

Next, we discuss children's performance, by intervention arm, on math subtasks. We present

these results in Table 6, mirroring the format of Table 5. Children in intervention villages also

dramatically outperformed children in control villages in terms of math ability, as seen in scores

for all subtasks. Intervention children could solve around 15 simple addition problems and

Table 6 notes: this table shows children's scores on the individual components of the math test, separately by
treatment group. The number in parentheses next to the subtask corresponds to the subtask number given in Table
A.2. There are 563 observations in the intervention group and 1,081 observations in the control group, but there are
46 missing time values for subtask 1 (40 control, 6 intervention); there are 17 missing time values for subtask 4a (8
control, 9 intervention); there are 21 missing time values for subtask 5a (6 control, 15 intervention). Adjusting for
these missing values changes the fluency score estimates by 0.01-0.35. Given the large intervention-control
differences in fluency scores, we do not report these sensitivity analyses here. *: These subtasks were only
administered to children with non-zero scores in addition level 1 and subtraction level 1, respectively.

around 10 simple subtraction problems per minute, compared with around three addition

problems and one subtraction problem for control children, respectively. This suggests

intervention children were at least five times more "fluent" in these core arithmetic skills,

fundamental and important predictors for subsequent mathematical development (Jordan et al.

2009). For two-digit problems, some with borrowing/carrying, intervention children answered

55% of addition problems and 33% of subtraction problems correctly, compared with 3.5% and

1%, respectively, for control children. For the subtask that evaluates children's ability to discern

and complete number patterns ­ EGMA subtask 3, identifying the missing number in a sequence




                                                         22
such as [ 2, 4, 6, __ ] ­ more than half of the intervention group correctly answered 60% or more

of the questions. This would be classified as reaching a desired level of performance in this skill

for third grade students in several other countries which use the EGMA test to assess child

learning (RTI International 2009). Only around 0.2% of the control group score this well on

subtask 3. As with reading, far fewer intervention children had zero scores on math subtasks than

did control children, with larger control/intervention gaps for more difficult subtasks.


4.4 Heterogeneity in effect size for the primary outcome

We next present pre-specified tests for heterogeneity in the effect of the intervention across a

series of demographic characteristics, shown in Table 7. We investigate differential effects of the

treatment by child gender, a proxy for the wealth of the family, and the level of education of the

child's mother and, separately, father. We see large control-intervention test score differences

across all subgroups, but the only statistically significant dimension of heterogeneity is for

father's education, and this result is not robust to standard adjustments for multiple hypothesis

testing, such as a Bonferroni adjustment (List, Shaikh, and Xu 2019).16


4.5 Other effects

In this section we discuss the impact of the intervention on whether or not the child was enrolled

in school at two stages of the trial ­ at the midline of the study in 2014, and again in 2016. In

Table 8, we report the proportion of children in each randomization group enrolled in school at

each stage. In 2014, approximately 94% of intervention children were enrolled in school, while

only 60% of control children were. This gap narrows in 2016, driven largely by an increase


16
  We also pre-specified heterogeneity tests by the village's distance to the main road, whether the child most
commonly speaks Crioulo, as opposed to other languages, and whether there was an economic shock to the main
breadwinner of the child's family during the course of the trial. We found no evidence of heterogeneity and do not
present them here for the sake of brevity.

Table 7 notes: this table follows the custom of columns 1-4 in Table 4, showing control/intervention differences in
children's scores on the composite test by subgroup. The p-values report tests for an equal effect of the intervention
across subgroups, estimated by calculating the p-value on an interaction term between the treatment variable and
the subgroup dummy. *: The wealth index is high if the caregiver reports 1) that they could find money to pay a
sudden medical bill of 42,000 CFA (roughly US $72), and 2) that in the last year their family went no longer than
one month without income; it is low otherwise. We exclude "data missing" as a category for wealth (excluding 133
observations, 117 control and 16 intervention).

in enrollment among the control group: 92% of intervention children were enrolled in school at

the end of the trial, while 79% of control children were. These differences are both statistically

significant.

         We also collected parents' report of whether or not the child missed any school in the

past two weeks. In Figure A.2, we show these results, which suggest that intervention children

are much less likely than control children to miss school in both AY 2014-15 and AY 2016-17.

Table 8 notes: the dependent variable in this table is the child's enrollment in school at midline (first row) and
endline (second row). Columns 1 and 2 of this table show the proportion of students enrolled in school, in each
group, at the midline of the study and endline survey, following the custom of Table 4. Column 3 shows the adjusted
difference, column 4 shows the odds ratio, and column 5 shows the p-value for the null of equal enrollment across
treatment groups.


Because we are missing attendance data for many of these children, particularly for controls, we

have put these particular results in the appendix and urge caution in their interpretation.

        At endline, we collected information from the child's nearest older sibling and nearest

younger sibling about their enrollment in school up to that point. We also administered simple

ASER-style reading and math tests (Pratham 2010). We were only able to locate siblings in

between 25 and 40 percent of cases. Of the siblings we did find, we found little difference in

enrollment in school (see Table A.4). Nonetheless, among these children we found significantly

higher literacy and numeracy among the intervention group for both older and younger siblings.

We show these differences in Figure A.3. This suggests potential spillovers of learning to

siblings, with two important caveats. First, the magnitudes of the differences are very small

compared to the differences we find for study children. Second, because roughly 70 percent of

siblings were not found, we are hesitant to draw strong conclusions from these analyses.

4.6 Cost-benefit analysis

We estimate that this intervention would cost approximately US $1,700 per child to run for four

years; equivalently, the per-child, per-year cost is roughly $425. While this is a very highly-

resourced intervention relative to others in this literature, such as those described in Kremer,

Brannen, and Glennerster (2013), it achieves learning gains of unprecedented magnitude in an

exceedingly challenging environment.17

         We provide a rough estimate of a lower bound for the benefit-cost ratio of this

intervention (Levin et al. 2017). To generate our assumption about the per-person benefit, we

need an approximation of the income premium that achieving literacy and numeracy might yield

later in life. To generate this, we use the following assumptions. One, using the zero scores on

the reading comprehension subtask (EGRA subtask 5a), we assume that the intervention

generates a 71.3 percentage point increase in the likelihood a child will be literate. Two, we

assume that, as a result, the child's future employment is characterized by the following

probability set: they continue subsistence farming (30% chance), they work in their village for a

local NGO (30% chance) they become a community teacher (30% chance), or they progress in

school until the 12th grade, at which point they gain employment in a national NGO (10%

chance).18 We estimate the lifetime gain in income, over a baseline of subsistence farming with

certainty, given current salaries for these positions19, and assuming a 5% annual GDP growth

rate (The World Bank 2019) and a 5% annual discount rate (Duflo 2001). Finally, we assume


17
   To calculate the cost of our project, we use the projected costs for the ongoing (at time of writing) expansion of
the project. We chose this instead of the actual costs incurred during the implementation of this study because of the
costs incurred during the previously described challenges with early implementation. Without dramatic assumptions,
it is not clear how to extract the "true" costs of the final project from those data (e.g., the "right-sizing" of
administration, procurement, and other costs for this smaller scale).
18
   We generated these probabilities based on our understanding of the local labor markets and discussion with
project staff.
19
   NGO salary: 15,000 CFA per month for 12 months per year. Community teacher salary: 25,000 per month for 9
months per year. National NGO salary: 100,000 CFA per month for 12 months per year.


                                                         26
that affected individuals work from age 17 to age 55, during which time they earn the income

benefit assumed above.

       Using these assumptions, our intervention has a benefit:cost ratio of at least 3.32. We

expect this to be a lower bound on the true ratio, given the various, harder-to-estimate returns to

literacy and numeracy that accrue in health, longevity, and welfare more broadly (Dickson and

Harmon 2011). This ratio suggests the intervention is highly cost-efficient, and compares

favorably with many other studies in similar contexts (Evans and Popova 2016).

       An increasingly common approach to this type of analysis is to calculate the "marginal

value of public funds" or MVPF (Hendren and Sprung-Keyser 2020). This calculates the after-

tax benefit to participants, accounting for changes in tax revenue because of the program. These

changes can be negative (e.g., distorting behavior away from productive activity in order to

qualify for the program) or positive (e.g., generating externalities). In Guinea Bissau, the

effective tax rate is zero for most people, as most government revenue comes from two sources:

cashew nut exports and foreign aid. We assume, therefore, that there are no negative externality-

type changes in revenue that would accrue from implementing this policy. The likely positive

externalities of the policy ­ greater economic, health, and political benefits from a higher literacy

rate ­ make our benefit:cost calculation a lower bound on the true benefit:cost ratio.


5. Discussion

In this section, we discuss the potential reasons for the large gains we measure in the previous

section. First, we present an exploratory, quantitative analysis of heterogeneity in effect size to

illuminate how the intervention was beneficial, and to whom. Second, we describe the

uniqueness and scalability of our results.

5.1 Exploratory heterogeneity analysis

In this section, we describe a series of exploratory analyses to investigate for whom our

intervention had the largest effects and, potentially, why. We first estimate heterogeneity in

effect size by the grade the child was enrolled in at the end of the trial. Here we see that grade

progression appears to be an important contributor to the effects we measure. We show

conditional means and the adjusted difference (e.g., the coefficient on the intervention dummy in

a simple linear regression) for a regression restricting the sample to just the grade / enrollment

status in question. This shows that while scores in the intervention group were higher

Table 9 notes: Columns 1 and 2 shows the average scores of intervention and control children, respectively, based
on their school enrollment status at endline. Column 3 shows the adjusted difference, calculated as the coefficient on
the intervention dummy on the intervention variable estimated in an OLS regression of endline test score on
intervention group and randomization stratum, restricting the sample to the group listed in the "group" column. We
do not show a p-value for the heterogeneity of treatment effect across endline grades/enrollment, as in tables 7 and
8, because the cells are too sparsely populated to estimate a model with all [intervention x final grade] variables.



                                                           28
for those in the third grade, this was also true for the control group. The adjusted difference in

the endline test scores of intervention and control group children, conditional on their being in

grade 3 at the end of the study (where they should have been were they to progress normally

through the grades), is 42.75 percentage points. A simple back-of-the-envelope calculation,

dividing that by the 58.1 percentage point overall difference, suggests that slightly more than one

a quarter of the total impact of the intervention came from grade progression, with the remaining

three quarters coming from learning impacts of the intervention independent of endline grade.

       We next report results of exploratory heterogeneity analysis by characteristics of the

school in the village. All but one village had some sort of school in it at baseline. We conduct

our analyses based on the number of teachers in the village, the type of school in the village, the

highest grade taught in the school, and the quality of the school infrastructure, proxied by the

material of its roof. We show these results in Table A.5. We find no evidence of meaningful

heterogeneity in the effect of the intervention along any of these dimensions, consistent with the

consensus from prior work showing that, in rural areas like those we study, existing variation in

school type, school resources, and even teacher credentials generates very little variation in

student learning levels (Daun 1997; Boone et al. 2014; da Silva and Oliveira 2017).


5.2 Features, uniqueness, and scalability of the intervention

In this section, we discuss potential explanations for the large magnitude of the results we find,

describing what features of the intervention are unique and its potential for scalability.

       We think there are two core reasons for the large impacts we observe. First, the

intervention's focus was on child learning, as opposed to test score improvement or child or

teacher attendance. All implementers, from teachers to monitors to senior staff, understood that

learning was the main objective. This focus informed the design of all teaching and learning



                                                 29
materials, from textbooks to teacher handbooks and lesson plans. These materials also

incorporated scripted lessons, which have been shown to work in numerous settings (Piper et al.

2018; Romero, Sandefur, and Sandholtz 2020; Eble et al. 2019) and are alleged to be particularly

helpful for teachers with less training and suboptimal supervision, potentially raising the level of

the "floor" of teaching quality in challenging contexts.

        Second, we conducted regular, in-depth, and responsive monitoring of both student

learning and, separately, teaching. This is in stark contrast to the control condition, where there is

little monitoring of teaching or student learning. For our monitoring of teaching, we focused on

improving teaching skill with an emphasis on learning, not just ensuring teachers were in school.

At the outset, the intervention invested heavily in teachers, conducting three months of pre-

service training in the new pedagogical model we implemented and in how to use the teaching

materials we designed. As the trial progressed, we continued to train the staff in how to teach

new content using new lesson plans. We also employed two tiers of staff whose main role was to

monitor teachers throughout the trial, observing their teaching, providing feedback, and using

these lessons to guide the ongoing teacher training that we administered as the intervention

progressed through the curriculum. This pairing of training and monitoring with the goal of

improving teacher practice has previously yielded large improvements in learning across diverse

settings (Piper et al. 2018; Eble et al. 2019), and we believe this "coaching" played an important

role in generating the large gains in learning outcomes we observe. For student learning, the

intervention team measured child learning regularly through in-class tests and periodic external

testing.20 Supervisors and intervention managers closely monitored these measurements and took

action as needed, e.g., giving teachers of lagging students extra attention or assistance. In


20
 These tests were designed in-house and deliberately diverged from EGRA- and EGMA-style tests to ensure that
we were not "teaching to the test."


                                                     30
addition, the team followed up with parents to ensure children attended classes and provided

additional after-school support to struggling students.

       There are other clear contributors. The most obvious are the increased instructional time

and resources provided, though extra time and money are no guarantee of a large effect

(Woessmann 2016; De Ree et al. 2018). Intervention students had an additional hour per day in

school, and our schools did not suffer from the teacher strikes that occurred in government

schools over the period of our study. These strikes did not happen in non-governmental schools,

however, and the absence of a difference in effect size between villages with and without a

government school suggests that more instructional time does not necessarily translate into

learning in this context. The long literature on credit constraints in education shows both

theoretically and empirically that, in such areas, private provision of education is also

particularly likely to under-supply quality (c.f., Becker 1994; Lochner and Monge-Naranjo 2012;

Heckman and Mosso 2014).

       We believe that efficient implementation of these core components ­ a stronger,

concerted focus on learning throughout materials, training, recruitment, and scripted lessons,

paired with regular monitoring of teachers and student learning levels and action taken in

response to observed need ­ could lead to quality education in many other contexts even in the

absence of a large influx of resources. As described in Bold et al. (2018) and Banerjee et al.

(2017), however, an important challenge is stakeholder buy-in. Implementing such a system

would constitute a large change in focus and responsibilities from teaching and support staff,

which may meet with resistance. Nonetheless, we think that this intervention provides important

guidance on how to proceed in poor, remote areas such as the one we study,




                                                 31
           Our ongoing work shows that this model is scalable. In response to the preliminary

results of this study, we are on track to scale up the intervention in Guinea Bissau to an

additional 2,000 children. In Telangana, India, and The Gambia, we have scaled up a para-

teacher intervention with similar foci to 15,000 and 4,000 children, respectively. Aside from

buy-in, the main barrier to scalability, as we see it, is resources. Implemented outside of the

government, this is a highly expensive intervention. Implemented within the government, we

anticipate both political and logistical challenges to widespread adoption (c.f., Bold et al. 2018).

           We comment on two other potential contributors to these results that warrant discussion:

teaching to the test and floor effects. We chose to use EGRA and EGMA tests precisely because

of their focus on the skills necessary to read, make sense of written content, to do arithmetic, and

to make sense of simple arithmetic expressions. In this sense, these skills are aligned with the

goals for almost all education systems at this level of learning; indeed, in many other education

systems, these tests are used by the government itself to measure learning (Sprenger-Charolles

2008; USAID 2019). The second potential contributor is that the tests were not sensitive enough

to pick up very basic skills, i.e., floor effects. EGRA and EGMA tests are designed to be

particularly sensitive at measuring low levels of learning (Platas et al. 2014; Dubeck and Gove

2015). Comparing only subtasks where the control group has a substantial amount of nonzero

scores21 reduces the overall impact estimate to a difference of 54.08 percentage points, from

58.14 percentage points, providing little evidence of floor effects.

           Our study design did not attempt to identify individual mechanisms behind our

intervention. Instead, we targeted areas with great need and evaluated a comprehensive

intervention to dramatically increase learning levels in them. This "bundled" approach is in the



21
     We calculated the arithmetic mean of average performance on EGMA subtasks 1-4a and on EGRA subtasks 1-2.


                                                       32
spirit of the multifaceted poverty alleviation program studied by Banerjee et al. (2015) and, as in

Muralidharan, Singh, and Ganimian (2019), does not allow us to isolate mechanisms driving the

results we observe, though we speculate that there are complementarities between the individual

components, as in Mbiti et al. (2019).

       At the outset, we were unsure whether such an intervention would work. If demand

factors explained most of the lack of schooling ­ i.e., parents and their children do not believe

education merits the opportunity cost ­ then the poor outcomes of children may not be impacted

by changes to the provision of schooling. Furthermore, as we experienced, implementation

challenges could have derailed our efforts entirely and it is important to document this. We also

argue that it is worthwhile to understand the costs of implementing such a program in an

exceedingly deprived and difficult environment. Due to the fragility of the state in Guinea

Bissau, public institutions such as schools, customs, and the courts often function poorly or not at

all (Sangreman, Delgado, and Martins 2018). Furthermore, we chose to work in hard-to-reach,

extremely poor regions within Guinea Bissau, making provision even more expensive, and

logistics more difficult, than in the country's urban or peri-urban areas.

       The other main contributor to the large difference between children in control and

intervention villages is, sadly, the failure of the state and other actors to deliver education in

these areas. Education levels in Guinea Bissau have remained consistently low over the last fifty

years, and there is little evidence that, in the absence of external intervention such as ours, this is

likely to change (Daun 1997; Boone et al. 2014; da Silva and Oliveira 2017). During the course

of our study, government provision of education in the control villages, as in the rest of the

country, was erratic. The counterfactual case, therefore, is one in which many children reach

adulthood without achieving meaningful levels of literacy and numeracy. We expect that it is




                                                  33
easier to raise learning from such a low baseline than it would be in contexts with higher learning

levels.


6. Conclusion

In the least fortunate parts of the developing world, many children receive schooling which is

unable to teach them even basic literacy and numeracy. We ran an RCT in rural Guinea Bissau to

evaluate an intervention that provided schooling in lieu of the state and other status quo

providers for four years. We find the intervention yielded dramatic increases in learning among

recipient children, leading them to be functionally numerate and literate in a way that the vast

majority of them would not have been in the absence of the intervention.

          Our findings contain a few core messages. First, we show that offering this kind of an

intervention at a near-free price to parents and children in two regions with extremely low

learning and economic outcomes leads to a very high proportion of take-up. This suggests that

supply constraints may be more important than demand constraints in understanding low

educational outcomes in these and similar areas. Second, our results suggest there may be

similarly large learning gains that can be realized by motivated donors or agencies through

implementing a similar type of intervention in contexts where the status quo provider of

education is either irregular or of extremely low quality.

          This intervention achieved learning gains of unprecedented magnitude. While the

intervention is much more highly-resourced than other interventions in this literature, a rough

benefit cost calculation suggests that, even using conservative assumptions, it is highly cost-

efficient. This work, in conjunction with Eble et al. (2019), shows that the upper bound on the

magnitude of intervention-driven learning gains in such deprived areas is much larger than

previously thought. As noted in the introduction, the endline oral reading fluency of children



                                                  34
randomized to receive the intervention was 75 correct words per minute. This compares

favorably to the oral reading fluency measured in a 2014 national assessment of third grade

students in the Philippines, a country with a per-capita GDP nearly an order of magnitude larger

than that of Guinea Bissau.22 It is also much higher than oral reading fluency measures from

other African countries who have used EGRA: average grade 3 oral reading fluency in English-

speaking African countries is 9.2, and in Francophone African countries it is 32.4 (USAID

2019). It is also comparable to EGRA results from wealthier Latin American countries, such as

Guatemala, Jamaica, and Peru. Average oral reading fluency in Latin America is 73 words per

minute in English, and 79 in Spanish.

           Finally, our study provides an opportunity to follow these children later in life, and learn

about the longer-term economic and social returns to education, and literacy and numeracy more

specifically, in a particularly poor region. This, we hope, will advance our understanding of two

important phenomena: one, how best to help similar regions; and two, to quantify where, when,

and how these basic skills can transform lives in the developing world.

composite test scores by the characteristics of the schools in the village. There is only one village in our study which
does not have a school in the village, and we exclude it from this analysis.

prior to being interviewed, separately at the midline and at the endline surveys (in Panels A and B, respectively), and
separately by randomization group. We present results only for those children who were enrolled in school at the
time of survey. A simple chi-square test rejects the null of no relationship between attendance and intervention
status, with p<0.001 in both panels.

siblings and 521 older siblings found in the control villages, and 176 younger siblings and 269 older siblings in the
intervention villages. A simple chi-square test rejects the null of no relationship between literacy and intervention
status, with p<0.001 in both panels. It rejects the null of no relationship between numeracy and intervention status
with p=0.040 for older siblings, and p<0.001 for younger siblings.

Appendix A: Further description of disruption to implementation of the para teacher

model



We began discussions with the government about an education research project in 2011, after the

completion of the data collection for Boone et al. (2014). We originally agreed with the

government on an experiment in which we would open dozens of academic centers where we

would deliver our curriculum. For training, we recruited 100 candidates with at least a high

school education, but no teacher qualifications. Our plan was that, at the end of the training, we

would select as many final candidates from this group as were qualified for implementation of

our intervention and, as described in Section 2, run a para teacher intervention as part of a larger

effort to evaluate that model's scalability and generalizability.

        We hired Portuguese-language and teacher training professionals to travel to Guinea-

Bissau and train our candidates for one year. During the training, candidates were paid a living

stipend and, as part of the training, they received Portuguese language proficiency certification

from an international organization and a pedagogy certification from the Guinea Bissau Ministry

of Education. In return, they provided a written agreement that after the training, should they be

selected, they would commit to residing in the villages we assigned them in Quinara and

Tombali and working as teachers there for at least one year.

        At the end of the year of training, we selected 48 of the 100 candidates to serve as

teachers. Prior to the start of implementation, these individuals reneged on their commitment,

refusing to work under the previously agreed-upon employment conditions. They formally

submitted a new set of demands, including the salary increase described in the introduction and

the removal of the initial probationary period of employment we had agreed upon in order to
remove low-performing teachers. We were not in a position to accept these demands and refused.

Guinea Bissau's government supported us in the dispute, but the teachers attempted to litigate in

the country's courts and the resolution of this took several months. As described in Section 2,

this led us to change the focus of the intervention to one in which we hired trained teachers, as

opposed to para teachers, which also consisted of a change in the research question asked by the

study.

Instruções Gerais
É importante estabelecer uma relação descontraída e de confiança com a criança que vai ser avaliada
através de uma conversa inicial com questões de interesse para a criança (ver exemplo abaixo). A criança
deve ver este exercício mais como um jogo do que uma avaliação. É importante que leia SOMENTE em voz
alta o texto que está a negrito, de forma calma e clara, para que a criança possa compreender os exercícios.
It is important to establish a playful and relaxed relationship with the child that will be assessed through an initial talk
on topics of interest to the child (see example below). The child should perceive the assessment more as a game rather
than an evaluation. It is important that you ONLY read aloud the text in bold, slowly and clearly, so that the child can
understand the exercises.

Instruções Gerais
É importante estabelecer uma relação descontraída e de confiança com a criança que vai ser
avaliada através de uma conversa inicial com questões de interesse para a criança (ver exemplo
abaixo). Aproveite este momento para identificar qual a língua em que a criança se sente mais
confortável. A criança deve ver este exercício mais como um jogo do que uma avaliação. É
importante que leia SOMENTE em voz alta o texto que está a negrito, de forma calma e clara,
para que a criança possa compreender os exercícios. It is important to establish a playful and relaxed
relationship with the child that will be assessed through an initial talk on topics of interest to the child (see example
below). Use this time to identify in what language the child is most comfortable with. The child should perceive the
assessment more as a game rather than an evaluation. It is important that you ONLY read aloud the text in bold,
slowly and clearly, so that the child can understand the exercises.

    Bom dia. O meu nome é_________ e trabalho para a Effective Intervention. E tu, como
 te chamas? Como está a tua família? Quando eu não estou a trabalhar, eu gosto muito de
 ___________. E tu, o que mais gostas de fazer quando não estás na escola?
 Good morning. My name is ________ and I work at Effective Intervention. And you, what's your name? How is
 your family? When I am not at work, I like to ___________. And you? What do you most enjoy doing when you
 are not at school?

Consentimento Verbal

   · Vou-te explicar porque é que eu hoje estou aqui. Eu trabalho para um projecto da
       Effective Intervention. Viemos à tua escola fazer um trabalho para compreendermos
       melhor como é que as crianças aprendem a ler e matemática e tu foste escolhido
       para nos ajudares. Let me tell you why I am here today. I am working with a project of Effective
     Intervention. We came today to your school to do an exercise to help us better understand how children
     learn how to read and do mathematics, and you were chosen to help us.
   · Gostaríamos de pedir a tua ajuda. Mas não tens de participar se não quiseres. We
     would like to ask for your help. But you do not have to take part if you do not want to.
   · Vamos fazer um jogo de leitura e matemática. Eu vou pedir-te para leres em voz alta
       algumas letras, palavras e pequenas histórias. Depois irás ter com o meu colega
       (aponte na direcção do enumerador de EGMA), e ele/ela vai-te pedir para
       identificares números, fazeres contas e resolveres alguns problemas. We are going to
       play reading and mathematics games. I am going to ask you to read letters, words and a short story out
       loud. Then you will go to my friend/colleague sitting at the other side (point to the direction of the EGMA
       enumerator), and he/she will ask you to identify numbers, do some calculations and solve a few
       problems.
   · Por vezes vou utilizar este relógio para saber quanto tempo demoras a completar
     algumas tarefas. Se ouvires um som, não prestes atenção. Sometimes I will use this timer to
     time how long it takes you to complete some of the tasks. If you hear it beeps, please do not pay
     attention to it.
   · Este exercício NÃO é uma ficha de avaliação e não vai influenciar as tuas notas da
     escola. This is NOT a test and it will not affect your grade at school.
   · Relembro que não tens de participar se não quiseres. Depois de começarmos, se
     preferires não responder a uma das perguntas, não há problema. Once again, you do not
