                                             ABSTRACT

Pathways to Education is a comprehensive youth support program developed to improve academic
outcomes among those entering high school from very poor social-economic backgrounds. The program
includes proactive mentoring to each student, daily tutoring, group activities, career counseling, and
college transition assistance, combined with immediate and long-term incentives to reinforce a minimum
degree of mandatory participation. The program began in 2001 for entering Grade 9 students living
in Regent Park, the largest public housing project in Toronto, and expanded in 2007 to include two
additional Toronto projects. In all three locations, participation rates quickly rose, to more than 85
percent, even though parents and students were required to commit in writing to conditions and high
expectations of the program. Comparing students from other housing projects before and after the
introduction of the program, high school graduation and post secondary enrollment rates rose dramatically
for Pathways eligible students, in some cases by more than 50 percent.

I. Introduction


        Children from very poor social-economic backgrounds are subject to many

stresses while growing up and are vastly more at-risk of ending up poor,

incarcerated, unhealthy, and unhappy than children from more affluent

backgrounds. 1 Not only do impoverished children often receive poorer parental

investments - in part because parents are subject to many social-economic stresses

themselves - they also are exposed to far worse school and neighborhood

environments at critical development stages. This compounding adversity can take

a serious psychological toll. 2 Ethnographic studies document harsh realities from

being regularly exposed to violence, subject to low expectations and, overall,

"weighed down by a world of no". 3

        Overarching programs have long been sought to meaningfully overcome

these challenges. Evidence on their effectiveness is usually disappointing, but there

are exceptions. 4         In the well-known Perry Preschool Project, extremely

disadvantaged preschoolers from rural Michigan were randomly provided two

years of intensive preschool and home visits by experienced teachers. More than

thirty years later, those selected into the program were substantially less likely to

have spent time in jail (28 versus 52 percent) and substantially less likely to have

received government assistance (59 versus 80 percent). 5 More recent research also

points to promising interventions directed at disadvantaged adolescents. Some

chartered schools accepting poor students into their programs by lottery have been

shown to generate impressive long-term benefits. 6 Dobbie and Fryer (2011b)

identify common features among them, including more time in school, tutoring,

after-school assistance, and a culture of high expectations. Fryer (2012) finds

applying these features to public schools can lead to similar estimated impacts.

Similarly impressive gains to high school attainment and academic performance

were found from another recent randomized trial that provided daily two-on-one

tutoring combined with social-cognitive behavioral therapy to disadvantaged

students from Chicago (Cook et al., 2014).

           This paper evaluates another recent effort to comprehensively help at-risk

youth escape from chronic poverty.                         The Pathways to Education Program

(Pathways) began as a grass-roots effort by staff from the community health center

of Regent Park, Canada's oldest and largest public housing project, in Toronto.

Regent Park represents one of Canada’s poorest neighborhoods. It comprises of

2,087 high- and low-rise apartment units within a self-contained downtown

community, and is home to 7,500 residents, all paying rent-geared-to-income. The

community faces relatively high levels of crime and gang activity. From the 2001

census, 87 percent of family households living in Regent Park are classified as falling

below Statistics Canada’s Low-Income Cut-Off (LICO), 56 percent of residents are

single parent, and 59 percent of residents have no earnings. 7 In the 1990s, more

than half of Regent Park youth failed to complete high school.

         From this backdrop, the Board of Directors for the Regent Park Community

Health Centre began to discuss a plan for the development of a program that could

promote and support academic achievement for Regent Park youth, with the

ultimate goal of fostering a more positive community environment. The program

adopts a multi-faceted approach, offering extensive tutoring, mentoring, and

financial support (such as bus tickets tied to attendance at school and bursaries for

postsecondary schooling), as well as easy access to student-parent workers who

provide information and advice as needed on a wide range of issues. After several

years of consultation and obtaining seed funding, the program began in the 2001-

2002 school year for entering Grade 9 students from Regent Park, and was phased

in for successive Grade 9 cohorts each year thereafter. Eligibility is based solely on

residing in Regent Park, though participation requires parents and students to

commit to the program's high expectations in writing each year.

         The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) conducted a pro bono evaluation of

Pathways in 2007 and concluded that the program led to a fall in the high school

dropout rate from 56 percent to 10 percent. A concern with this evaluation is that it

involved comparing dropout rates among Pathways participants to a group

previously living in the same area. In other words, the comparison group included

everyone that would have been eligible for the program, but the treated group

7
 A household falls below the LICO if they spend more than 20 percentage points above the average
comparative household on food, clothing, and shelter. For example, if the average Canadian family spends
35 percent of before-tax income on food, clothing, and shelter, a family that spends more than 55 percent of
before-tax income on these items falls below the LICO.

                                                     3
included only participants, possibly those who would have done better anyway. The

BCG evaluation also did not account for the general tendency for dropout rates to

decline over time when looking at successfully younger cohorts. Data and full

details of the study were never made available, making follow-up analyses and

further exploration challenging.

       Few other youth intervention evaluations find such large effects as the BCG

study does for Pathways. If the size of these program impacts could be replicated in

other settings, scaling up the Pathways program could lead to a highly effective

strategy for helping disadvantaged youth.         This paper represents a more

transparent attempt to evaluate impacts from the introduction of Pathways. We

compare students from Regent Park and other Toronto housing projects entering

high school between 2000 and 2007 to produce a more convincing and clear

evaluation of the Program’s initial impact on high school completion, postsecondary

enrollment, as well as on intermediate school attainment measures within high

school. We also explore differences in Pathways participation and impacts by

gender, language spoken at home, and initial academic ability.

       Matching Pathways participants to Toronto District School Board high school

students from Regent Park, we find Pathways participation rates quickly rose to

more than 85 percent. While our estimated effects are not on the same order of

magnitude as those concluded in the BCG study, they are nevertheless impressive.

We estimate that Pathways eligibility increased high school completion by 40

percent (from 38 to 53 percent) and post secondary enrollments by more than 50

percent (from 34 to 53 percent). We find intermediate effects on math and reading


                                         4
scores, as well as on the likelihood of taking more university prerequisite courses.

Pathways appears to impact females more than males, but immigrant and non-

immigrant families equally.

        The expansion of Pathways in 2007 at two additional Toronto housing

projects (Rexdale and Lawrence Heights) provides an opportunity to check the

internal and external validity of the Regent Park estimates. Even when looking only

at the first year impact of the program, results are consistent for the expansion sites

compared to Regent Park - almost full participation among eligible students (85

percent), and a very large relative increase in high school completion. College

enrollment impacts are also significant for males.

        The next section better details the structure of the Pathways program.

Section III describes the data. Section IV presents the main results and several

robustness checks.         Section V concludes with a discussion on costs, possible

mechanisms underlying the results and an outline for further research.




II. The Structure of the Pathways to Education Program 8


A. Origins

        The Pathways to Education program began as an effort to address poor academic

performance by youth from Toronto’s Regent Park, Canada’s largest public housing project.

Regent Park is comprised mostly of immigrants (69 percent in 2001), hailing from a wide

range of countries, including Somalia, Bangladesh, the Congo, Vietnam, China, and Latin


8

and Gosine, 2006, and Rowen, 2012.

                                                   5
America. It is difficult to obtain data to determine the extent of criminal activity by

neighborhood in Canada. However, what little data does exist suggests that Regent Park’s

residents experience significant crime and drug activity (Oreopoulos, 2008). In 1992, there

were 55 reported assaults causing bodily harm on Regent Park property, a rate of about 15

per 1,000 residents (26 per 1,000 households). That number is much higher than the 1995

rate of 1.7 assaults per 1,000 residents in the Toronto Census Metropolitan Area). 9 Nine

murders occurred in the year Pathways was introduced (Rowen, 2012). In 2010, a string of

shootings left three dead over three weeks. In 2013, a 15 year-old Pathways student was

shot and killed.

        Historically, Regent Park experienced much higher dropout rates than the

rest of Toronto. A cohort of students who entered Grade 9 in 1993 in the former

Toronto Board of Education was tracked for a number of years to assess dropout

rates. This analysis revealed that, among Regent Park students, the fraction still in

school or out of school without a diploma by the end of the sixth year of high school

was 56 percent compared with 29 percent for students in the rest of the city.

        In the mid-1990s, the Board of Directors for the Regent Park Community

Health Centre began to formulate an action plan for encouraging "Community

Succession", a vision of greater economic mobility involving children growing up to

take on successful careers and, in turn, giving back to the community that helped

them attain these goals.          Members of the board were heavily influenced by a

presentation from Jack Geiger at a 1995 International Conference of Community

Health Centres, held in Montreal. Geiger presented a case study of how the Tufts-

Delta Health Center in the late 1960s expanded its operations to take on a larger

role of community development and foster social change. 10 The expansion included

public transportation, a pre-Head Start early childhood enrichment program, a

nutritional and recreational program for elderly residents, a supplemental food

program, and a crop sharing cooperative. Geiger said the most important impact of

the expansion was a multi-faceted educational program, providing evening high

school equivalency and college preparatory courses, as well as assistance with

college and professional school applications and providing scholarship information

and university contacts. He argued that the education program increased social and

human capital and led to a positive cycle of improved community development.

           Over the next five years, board and staff members from Regent Park's Health

Centre constructed the Pathways to Education program based on this idea of

community succession and a review of research of other programs that might work

in the Regent Park setting, along with discussions with community members and

other stakeholders. Members initially considered including a summer job program

for youth finishing high school to give students job experience and a larger

employment and training initiative for older youth, but decided to focus on

education to keep operations at a manageable scale. With funding from the Ontario

Trillium Foundation, the program began initially in the 2001-2002 academic school

year for approximately 115 students living in Regent Park and transitioning into

Grade 9. Each year another cohort was added. By the 2004 to 2005 academic year,

enrolment reached 615.

                                                      7
           Eligibility for Pathways is inclusive, based only on residence. In contrast to

other programs that specifically target students based on criteria such as financial

need or initial academic ability, Pathways is available to every Regent Park youth

attending high school (beginning with students entering Grade 9 in 2001).

Participation is voluntary, and requires both students and parents to agree each

year in writing to the program's conditions and high expectations. 11 To recruit

students, Pathways developed strong ties with the five elementary schools that

include Regent Park in their catchment areas.               Schools help identify eligible

students, provide contact information, and facilitate meetings with parents.




B. Pathway's Four Pillars

           There are four pillars of support to the Pathways program: Counseling,

Academic, Social, and Financial.             Each student is assigned to a Student-Parent

Support Worker (SPSW), who is employed full-time by Pathways. SPSW's serve as

the main connection between students and the program. They are responsible for

working with each student and parent to help ensure academic success.                 The

relationship begins prior to the start of high school at a mandatory orientation

session. Students are required to meet with their SPSWs at least twice a month,

more if needed. Through relationships with high schools, SPSW's monitor students'

absenteeism, grades, and other participation in Pathways activities. They provide

information to students about events and community resources and distribute free

bus tickets. SPSWs often serve as the go-to people for dealing with any issues that

     Copies of both agreements are shown in Appendix A.

                                                    8
may arise at home, school, or around the community. They are each responsible for

approximately 50 students over a school year, and end up focusing more of their

time on those who appear to need it most. If crises or issues arise, they may work

together with other facilitators to determine how best to manage these situations.

Many SPSWs maintain contact with their students after graduation on an informal

basis. 12

        Pathways participants also receive extensive academic support in the form of

free local evening tutoring, provided up to four nights a week.                          Tutoring is

conducted both in small groups and on a one-on-one basis. It is available in core

academic subjects, as well as for development of literacy and general study skills.

Tutoring is mandatory twice a week, with exemptions for students with previous

term grade averages above a threshold (60 percent in Grade 9, 70 percent in Grade

10 and beyond). Tutors are volunteers that receive some training and help about 5

hours per week, on average. They include accountants, retired teachers, bank

managers, parents of students, graduate students from teacher colleges, and even

current and former Pathways students. The student-tutor ratio is generally less

than 5 to 1.

        In Grades 9 and 10, Pathways students receive social support in the form of

group mentoring. Students are required to participate every two weeks, choosing

from a range of activities focused on fostering social and group work skills and a

commitment to the community. Previous examples included attending sporting

  A 2009 documentary film, "Invisible City", follows two struggling Regent Park and Pathways students

events, theatre, participating in creative arts, cooking, bowling, community recycling

projects, and martial arts. Group mentoring now includes workshops from the

"YouCan" program to teach conflict resolution. 13      Each group is comprised of

approximately 15 youth and 3 volunteer mentors, who are often university

students. By Grades 11 and 12, students may still choose from specific activities

offered, but also may play more of an active role in choosing more independent

activities based on their own talents and interests. SPSWs and students agree on

biweekly activities that may occur within or outside of the community (including

tutoring younger grades).      Social support also comes in the form of career

mentoring. Pathways offers many events for students preparing to exit high school,

including resume preparation classes, job interview practice, college and university

campus visits, and visits to potential employers. Students also receive personal

assistance from SPSWs on post secondary applications, including fee waivers.

          The final pillar of Pathways support is financial. Support comes in two

forms: immediate assistance, for helping with the costs of going to school, and

longer term assistance, for helping with the costs of going to college. Free public

transportation tickets and school supplies are provided to Pathways participants,

but they must meet with their SPSWs to get them. Tickets are allocated bi-weekly

based on previous period school attendance.        The largest three attended high

schools by Pathways students are 2, 3, and 5 kilometers away. Evidence from focus

groups and staff experience suggests that the tickets provide strong motivation for

                                         10
program participation and going to school. 14                        One of the most expensive

components of the Pathways program is a trust fund for each participant. For each

year of participation the program sets aside $1,000, up to a maximum of $4,000 that

can be used toward tuition and other post secondary expenses after high school

graduation.

         If students in Pathways miss school, or miss mandatory SPSW meetings,

tutorial sessions, or group mentoring workshops, their SPSWs will have a

conversation with them. SPSWs will first focus on encouraging attendance before

mentioning the possibility of program withdrawal.                        If lack of participation is

discussed and no meaningful response occurs, a warning letter is sent home to a

parent. If there is still no progress, they may be dropped from the program. Very

few students are ultimately dropped. As the Pathways Coordinator of Tutoring and

Mentoring previously remarked, "We do not give up easily...Our philosophy is that

you set high expectations and the kids will rise to them. If they haven't met them,

they are on their way. If they have made a mistake, we try to help them see it as a

small setback." (Bales, 2004).



C. Expansion




14
   In one focus group, a student remarked, "If I don't go to school one day and like next time, I get my
tickets, my SPSW would be like, you didn't go to school these days, and so you'd get two less tickets 'cause
this day you didn't go to school so you shouldn't have those tickets and so you know, you can't skip because
you're like damn I need these tickets.". Another Grade 11 student remarked, "I have to go [to tutoring]
because of Pathways. If I don't go I'm not gonna get my tickets to go to school, if I don't get my tickets, I
can't go to school there's no other way...except...walking."

                                                    11
       A pro bono evaluation by the Boston Consulting Group reported in 2007 that

Pathways led to a rapid fall in the high school dropout rate, from 56 to 10 percent.

As mentioned above, full details of the report were not made public and the pre-

pathways sample included all eligible for the program (living in Regent Park), while

the post-Pathways sample included only those in Pathways.         Nevertheless, the

report generated wide public attention and attracted various organizations,

including government, in wanting to provide further support. Other community

organizations also became interested in adopting the Pathways program for

themselves. A new charitable foundation, called Pathways Canada, was established

to raise money and oversee expansion across the country.

       Pathways Canada secured funding to expand in 2007 to two more sites in

Toronto. Targeted sites were among the city's 13 "priority neighborhoods", inner

city areas with a combination of high crime activity and high social service need.

Almost all of these neighborhoods include large public housing projects.       Like

Regent Park, interest in adopting Pathways drew support from the neighborhoods'

community health centres.     Pathways Canada selected the Rexdale Community

Health Centre in Rexdale (Jamestown) and Unison Health and Community Services

in Lawrence Heights to operate the program beginning for residents from these

areas entering Grade 9 in 2007 and phased in each year with an additional Grade 9

cohort. The Rexdale catchment area and housing project, located in the northwest

end of Toronto, is about one-fourth the size of Regent Park, while the Lawrence

Heights catchment area and housing project, located north of the city centre, are




                                        12
about one-half the size of Regent Park. 15 Both neighborhoods are comprised largely

of immigrants and low income families from ethnically diverse backgrounds. Crime

and gang activity are relatively high compared to the rest of the city.

         Pathways expanded to three other sites in 2007 outside Toronto: Ottawa,

Kitchener, and Montreal. In 2009, Scarborough Village in Toronto was added, along

with another low-income community in Hamilton. In 2010, three new sites were

added in Winnipeg, Kingston, and Halifax. Shawinigan (Quebec) was added in 2012.




III. Data and Methodology



A. Toronto District School Board Data



         Data compiled for this study comes from three main sources: the Toronto

District School Board (TDSB), Toronto Community Housing (TCH), and Pathways

administrators. TDSB administrative data are available for high school students that

entered Grade 9 beginning in 2000, the year prior to when Pathways was

introduced. 16 Our baseline data begins with all recorded students entering Grade 9

at a TDSB school between 2000 and 2007. 17 Background information includes



15
   The Rexdale project include 554 housing units. Lawrence Heights housing project contains 1,452
housing units, while Regent Park contains 2,429 housing units. Both sites include in their catchment areas
a small fraction of nearby residential homes outside the housing projects, though we do not include students
from these outside homes in our sample.
16
   Brown (2006) describes this data in more detail.
17
   Students attending Catholic or private schools are therefore not included in the sample analysis. This
omission does not likely affect estimated program impacts given the small fraction attending non-TDSB

                                                    13
gender, immigrant status, an immigrant's year of arrival, language spoken at home,

age, high school attended, and residential address in Grade 9.

           We estimate Pathway's impact on a variety of outcomes, beginning in Grade

9.       The TDSB data contain information on grade performance in Grade 9

mathematics and English courses.                    Each subject variable indicates a students'

performance level in the course: 0 for students who had not achieved a credit by the

end of their first year (i.e. failed the course); 1 for students who completed with an

average mark of 50 to 59 percent; 2 for students with an average of 60 to 69

percent; 3 for students who completed with an average mark of 70 to 79 percent;

and 4 for students with an average mark of 80 percent or more. 18 We also create a

summary dummy variable for Grade 9 performance equal to 1 if the sum of the

English and Mathematics variables is one or less (which we call 'low Grade 9

grades'), zero otherwise.

           Our data also indicates whether students passed both the Reading and

Writing components of the Ontario Secondary School Literacy Test (OSSLT) when

the test was initially taken in Grade 10. The OSSLT is a standardized test designed

to be written by all Grade 10 high school students in Ontario.                                Passing both

components of this test is a requirement for high school completion. Students that

did not write for at least one of the two days of the test are treated as having not

passed.




schools (about 10 percent) and the fact that Pathways eligibility is based on location of residence, not
location of school.
18
     We recode a small fraction of students with missing values as having attained 0 level.

                                                       14
       We also record whether a student takes courses in grade 9 and 10 that place

him or her on a university track. Under the Ontario secondary school curriculum,

students choose a program of study that includes grade 9 and 10 courses that are

classified as academic (university-directed), applied (college-directed), or locally

developed essentials (workplace-directed). Our indicator variable takes on a value

of one if a majority of courses taken in grades 9 and 10 are academic, zero

otherwise. About three-quarters (75.8 percent) of students from the 2000 cohort

for all of Toronto are classified as on academic track, compared to about half (48.7)

for our sample of public housing tenants.

       Our outcome variable for high school graduation within five years is equal to

one for students recorded as completing their Ontario Secondary School Diploma

(OSSD) by the end of their fifth year from entering high school (in Grade 9), or as

having completed at least 30 credits (a student with 30 or more credits but without

being recorded as graduated is likely due to measurement error). It is equal to zero

otherwise for students that either (i) remained in the TDSB system the following

Fall (in year 6), (ii) transferred outside TDSB to another school system, or (iii) left

school without graduating. The alternative variable of graduating or returning in

year 6 generates almost identical results.

       Ontario's two central application service organizations for postsecondary

education (one for colleges, another for universities) provide TDSB with application

data and confirmations of acceptance.        We have information on whether our

entering Grade 9 students eventually applied to and accepted a college or university

program within five years. Students are only permitted to accept one offer. For


                                            15
exposition we refer to this outcome as enrolled, since virtually everyone that

accepts an offer enrolls.



B. Public Housing Address Data



        The TDSB data is matched to Toronto public housing projects using uniquely

identifiable postal codes. We focus on the 113 projects built before 1976 by the

Metro Toronto Housing Corporation Authority, now called Metro Toronto Housing

(MTC). 19 To create a publicly available dataset, some nearby and small projects are

grouped together, ending up with 57 housing project groups. Addresses for these

locations were obtained from MTC directly and cross-checked using Canada Post's

online postal code finder. Every household residing in these projects pays rent

geared to income. 20 That is, approximately 25 to 30 percent of a household's gross

total income is charged as rent.

        For any given period, all MTC housing applicants use the same form. Prior to

1995, applicants were placed on a waiting list based on a point system. Households

were given points primarily based on financial need, but also on current living

conditions, welfare participation, overcrowding, and whether they were living in

emergency housing. High demand for subsidized housing meant only those families

who attained the near-maximum number of points were given offers of



19
   Projects that accommodate only seniors and a small number of projects that house only aboriginals or
special needs families were omitted.
20
   Smaller MTC projects built after 1976 allowed for mixed housing, with some households paying rent-
geared to income, others paying market rent. We omit these residences to focus on a comparison group of
Grade 9 students whose parents only pay rent-geared to income.

                                                  16
accommodation, and even then these families waited an average of one and a half

years. Those with the most points were housed first, giving preferences to families

most in distress. Beginning in 1995, MTC adopted a more chronological order

approach to the waiting list, with special consideration given to new arrivals to

Canada, the homeless, and for those in domestically violent situations. Even for

those that qualify for special consideration, wait times for offers of accommodation

were often substantial. Average wait times in 1998 were 5 to 7 years (Toronto

Social Housing Connections, 1998).

       With these long wait times, families had an incentive to remain eligible for

accommodation in as many housing projects as possible.         The ability to state

housing preferences varied over time. In the early 1980s, families could not specify

which project or area they wished to be housed. The application form in the 1990s

made it easier to indicate area preferences (across 15 to 17 possible city zones).

Families could indicate they only wanted to be listed for specific communities or

projects, however doing so would likely lead to longer wait time before an offer of

accommodation. Currently, a family that does not specify any preference on the

MTC application is automatically placed on the waiting list for housing

developments in the zone of current residence.

       Pathways was not announced to residents prior to its initial recruitment,

both in Regent Park and in the expanded 2007 sites, Rexdale and Lawrence Heights..

Given the chronological approach to assigning applicants to public housing units

and the long wait times, it is unlikely that households with a preference to go to

these projects because of Pathways would be in our data (in general, applicants


                                        17
have a preference for smaller projects to avoid living in neighbourhoods with a high

density of poor households). Movement across projects is rare and not allowed

without exceptional reasons (e.g. change in work location).

       We match public housing postal code addresses, recorded when entering

Grade 9, to the TDSB data. Each code generally refers to one side of a city street,

often over only one block or a single apartment building. Approximately three-

fourths of families living in these postal codes were located in public housing

addresses with unique postal codes. To help ensure similarity across our sample,

with all families paying rent-geared to income and facing a similar application

process, we only use postal codes that uniquely match to these projects. The

baseline sample from this match is 6,901 students that began Grade 9 at a TDSB

high school between 2000 and 2007 while residing in a Toronto public housing

project in which all parents were subject to rent-geared to income.



C. Pathways Participation Data



       Pathways registration and participation data were also matched to the

baseline TDSB data. Pathways administrators provided a list of all students ever

registered for the program since its inception in 2001. Information on student

name, gender, day of birth, and especially Ontario Education Number (OEN) made it

possible to link the two datasets.

       We also have registration status for 2007. This allows us to examine changes

in registration status between Grades 9 and Grade 12 for the 2003 cohort, changes


                                         18
in status between Grade 9 and Grade 11 for the 2004 cohort, and changes in status

between Grade 9 and Grade 10 for the 2005 cohort. Finally, we also have

information on recorded monthly mentoring and tutoring sessions attended in

2003, 2004, and 2007.



D. Difference-in-Difference Analysis



         Intent-To-Treat (ITT) effects are estimated from a difference-in-differences

methodology, looking at the relative differences in outcomes between students from

Regent Park, Rexdale, and Lawrence Heights and students from other housing

projects before and after Pathways was introduced. Our baseline results are from

the following regression model:



(1) y         = βT    +δ ' X     +e +e +e
        ipc       ipc        ipc   p  c ipc



where y             is an outcome variable for individual i , from housing project p , who
              ipc

entered Grade 9 in year c . T is a dummy variable indicating whether an individual

is eligible for Pathways.            X   is a vector of the individual's demographic

characteristics, including gender, age in grade 9, immigrant status, and a dummy

variable for whether           English is the primary language spoken at home.        The

coefficient of interest is β , the average effect of being eligible to participate in

Pathways. To explore whether Pathways generated similar effects when initially


                                               19
introduced in Regent Park and when expanded, we estimate ITT effects separately

for the 2000 to 2006 period, when only Regent Park introduced Pathways, and for

the 2001 to 2007 period, when the two expansion sites introduced the program. 21

Given the smaller sizes of Rexdale and Lawrence Heights, we combine the two sites

and refer to them collectively as Rexdale/LH. 22

         Standard errors are clustered by housing project to allow for correlation in

the outcomes of students residing in the same housing project across school years 23.

We also present results using alternative inference methods based on the wild

cluster bootstrap, a synthetic control group, grouped means and with confidence

intervals computed using the method described in Conley and Taber (2011) in

Appendix B. 24

         It is fortuitous from a research perspective that the program was rolled out

for successive cohorts. Grade 10 Regent Park students in 2001 and Grade 10


21
   Combined average program effect estimates, over the 2000 to 2007 period are shown in the appendix.
An alternative approach of estimating separate Pathways effects for Regent Park and Rexdale/LH over the
2000 and 2007 period requires dropping observations from the other treated site and thus reducing sample
size. Results are similar, and reported in the next section.
22
   We also report estimated program effects at each new site, which are generally similar but some
confidence intervals are too wide to draw precise conclusions.
23
   With 57 housing projects (clusters) in the final dataset, all inference is based on 57 – 1 = 56 degrees of
freedom. As is well known (see Cameron and Miller (2013)), the CRVE are asymptotically valid as long
as the number of clusters gets large. Our final dataset with 57 clusters is consistent with Angrist and
Pischke’s (2009) “42” rule of thumb. Finally, all clusters have more than 30 observations.
24
   Recent Monte Carlo evidence suggests that the cluster robust variance estimator (CVRE) may lead to
standard error estimates that are biased downwards when cluster (group) sizes are different and when the
proportion of treated clusters is very small (MacKinnon and Webb (2013)). On the other hand, existing
methods to correct for cases like ours, with different cluster sizes and small proportion of treated clusters,
may be biased towards rejecting true effects. As discussed in Appendix B, recent literature suggests
conducting inference using standard errors from a cluster wild bootstrap procedure. However, Mackinnon
and Webb (2013) show that cluster wild bootstrap standard errors severely under-reject true null hypothesis
when the proportion of treated clusters is very small, the opposite problem of the CVRE standard errors.
As a result, it is likely that the “true” standard errors are somewhere between the two. Moreover, the main
qualitative finding that eligibility for Pathways led to large and statistically significant effects on academic
outcomes is robust to these two procedures and others, as shown in the Appendix. while the data in this
application feature both different cluster sizes and small proportion of treated clusters, given the lack of
consensus in the literature we use the CVRE for our baseline estimates.

                                                      20
Rexdale/LH students in 2007 were never eligible for Pathways. The possibility

exists of spillover effects, if these earlier cohorts benefited from Pathways

improving outcomes of later cohorts. This would tend to bias estimated program

effects downwards. Given that Pathways students account for about a quarter or

less of all students in a given cohort at a given high school, aggregated spillover

effects may be small.

       The difference-in-differences approach requires two main assumptions for

causal inference: 1) underlying pre-Pathways differences between projects that

eventually adopt Pathways and comparison projects remain fixed, even after the

program is introduced, and 2) the counterfactual outcome path for Pathways

projects follows same pattern as that for the comparison projects. We conduct a

number of robustness checks to assess the reliability of these assumptions. First, we

use alternative comparison groups (only very large projects, only downtown

projects, only future projects (for Regent Park), or only projects within the 13 city

designated 'at-risk' neighborhoods).    Second, we use the 1996 and 2001 micro

census files, with postal codes, to test whether a more detailed set of background

characteristics remain relatively similar for cohorts over a longer time series than

we have available from the TDSB data. Comparing program effects using more than

one program introduction over different time periods, of course, also provides a

robustness check to the overall results, and a check on external validity for whether

the impacts from the program's initial introduction can be replicated in other

locations. It also should be reassuring that we find similar significant effects for

different sub-groups, suggesting our findings are not spurious.


                                         21
E. Descriptive Statistics



        Table 1 presents sample size counts of our baseline data. From the total of

6,901 students entering a TDSB school in Grade 9 between 2000 and 2007 from a

Metro Toronto Community housing project, 1,274 are from Regent Park, 737 are

from Rexdale/LH, and 4890 are from other projects. We track roughly 150 students

entering Grade 9 from Regent Park each year, 90 students from Rexdale/LH each

year, and and about 600 students from other projects. 25 The 863 students in the

2000 Grade 9 cohort compares to the 18,798 students in the Toronto District School

Board (Brown, 2006).

        The table also describes average demographic characteristics for the

combined sample of 2000 to 2007 cohorts in our baseline data. The table shows a

difference in language spoken at home between students from Regent Park and

other projects. The fraction of students whose language at home is not English is

the highest for those from Regent Park (74.5 percent) compared to any other

development.       The next highest are 68.0 (Quebec High Park), 66.7 (Stableford

Farm), 59.3 (Edgeley Village), 56.8 (Blake Street), 56.8 (Flemington Park), 56.4

(Alexandra Park), 56.2 (Kennedy Road), and 56.0 (Beecker Street) percent. A likely

explanation for these differences is that Regent Park contains larger unit sizes, on



25
  Regent Park's cohort sample more than doubles between 2006 and 2007. While we have no background
information to explain the sharp rise, we do not have reason to believe the data are incorrect. Pathways
participation data show a proportionate rise between those years, and descriptive background variables
remain, on average, the same. In any case, our main program estimates for Regent Park exclude the 2007
cohort, and when we do include it, estimates are generally the same.

                                                   22
average, to accommodate larger families than other housing projects. Ethnic and

immigrant composition have generally not changed over cohorts. In our impact

analysis, controlling for differences in language spoken at home does not

substantially alter the results, and we find similar effects for immigrants and non-

immigrants.



F. Pathways Registration and Participation



       All children living in Regent Park and entering Grade 9 beginning in the

2001-2002 school year are eligible to participate in Pathways, as are entering Grade

9 students in 2007-2008 living in Rexdale/LH. Participation requires students and

their parents to first register each year by completing an agreement form. To help

enlist households, administrators obtain Grade 8 classroom lists from local

elementary schools and go door-to-door to encourage those eligible to register.

Those introducing the program are usually community members themselves.

Registration efforts also involve advertising throughout the housing project and

word of mouth.      The Community Health Centres that deliver Pathways are

conveniently walking distance from housing project residents.

       Figure 1 shows Pathways registration rates among TDSB students entering

Grade 9 between 2000 and 2007. In the first year of the program in Regent Park,

58.8 percent of eligible students registered.    In the second year the fraction

registered climbs to 80.7 percent and by the third year, 89.3 percent of all Regent

Park Pathways eligible students located in the TDSB data are matched to the


                                        23
program registrant list. The fraction registered remains high for the remaining four

years of recorded data and even climbs to 96 percent for the 2007 cohort. This

represents a remarkably high coverage rate of eligible students. The Pathways

participation rate in the initial year at Rexdale and Lawerence Heights is also

impressive, at 83.3 and 87.7 percent respectively.

       Not shown in the tables, but worth mentioning is that Grade 9 registration

rates are similar for males and females, English speaking and non-English speaking

students, and for low and high performing students. For example, Grade 9 male and

female Pathways registration rates among the 2004 Grade 9 cohort from Regent

Park are 86.4 percent and 91.3 percent respectively. Four years later, registration

rates for those still in school were 80.0 percent and 86.4 percent respectively.

Initial Pathways registration rates are also similar between eligible students

speaking English and not speaking English at home (85.2 percent and 90.1 percent

respectively). Finally, while Grade 9 math and English grade performance variables

(0 if a grade less than 50 percent, 1 if grade is 50 to 59 percent, etc…) may well be

endogenous to Pathways participation, it nevertheless is interesting to note similar

rates of participation between those whose sum of these two variables was one or

less and those whose sum was greater than one (85.7 percent versus 90.0 percent

respectively).

       Participation in various Pathways activities was not well recorded. At least

up to 2007, no data was collected on public transportation ticket provision or SPSW

visits. Group mentoring and individual tutoring sessions were recorded, but even

for these cases, data quality is unclear. Tables 2A and 2B show monthly mentoring


                                         24
and tutoring sessions attended for the 2003 Grade 9 cohort enrolled in Pathways.

Generally, participants were required in Grades 9 and 10 to attend two tutoring

sessions each week unless exempted based on grade performance, and were

required to attend two group mentoring sessions each month. Yet, the Table 2A

suggests that registrants were attending only about half of these required sessions,

on average. In the first recorded month of October in Grade 9, for example, 2003

registrants attended 3.9 tutoring sessions and 1.0 mentoring activities, on average.

Tutoring activity falls off to between 2 and 3 sessions attended each month, on

average, after December, likely due to some students becoming exempt. We find

slightly higher tutorial attendance in Rexdale/LH during its initial Pathways year in

2007, and lower group activity, relative to Regent Park.

       Among those attending any tutorial sessions in a given month, Table 2B

shows the number of sessions attended remains above 4, on average.            Group

mentoring activity, among those that do go, is similar across program sites, around

1.5 times a month. Taken at face value, the data imply that registrants are not

attending all the mandatory tutoring and mentoring sessions. On the other hand,

the data do indicate significant and regular attendance throughout the school year.



IV. Impact of Pathways on High School Achievement and Postsecondary
Enrollment


A. Graphical Summary


       Figures 2A and 2B summarize our high school completion results graphically.

Figure 2A shows high school completion rates by the end of 5th year for youth that
                                         25
entered high school in Grade 9 between 2000 and 2007 from different Toronto

Public Housing Projects. 38.2 percent of students from Regent Park that entered

Grade 9 in 2000 (and not eligible for Pathways) graduated by their fifth year. 26 The

graduation rate for students entering Grade 9 a year later -- the first year of

Pathways -- rises to 52.0 percent, a 13.8 percentage point increase. The rate

increases further, to 60.0 percent for the 2002 Grade 9 cohort, and then remains

relatively stable to 2007, with the exception of a jump up in 2004 (to 68.1 percent)

and a jump down in 2005 (to 53.0 percent). Thus, the graduation rate rises steadily

for students from Regent Park corresponding exactly to the rise in Pathways

participation (58.8 percent in 2001 and 80.3 percent in 2002). In contrast, the

figure indicates, only modest and slow improvement for cohorts from other projects

(excluding Rexdale/LH).          Initially, a higher fraction of students from these other

projects go on to finish compared to Regent Park, but after Pathways is introduced,

the pattern is reversed.

        By assuming graduation rates in Regent Park would have followed the same

pattern as that in other projects if Pathways had not been introduced, we can

estimate the program’s overall impact on becoming eligible. Figure 2B shows this

graphically by normalizing graduation rates by initial site differences observed in

2000. Between cohorts 2000 and 2001, the figure shows a relative rise in the

Regent Park graduation rate by 15.4 percentage points, the period Pathways is

introduced. Similarly, using all 2000 to 2007 cohorts, the relative graduation rate in



26
  Another 13.5 percent remained in TDSB the following year, 7.4 percent transferred outside TDSB, and
40.5 percent dropped out.

                                                  26
Regent Park after the introduction to Pathways increases, on average, 13.5

percentage points, a significant improvement. 27

         The break in trend for Rexdale/LH graduation rates in 2007 also

corresponds to the introduction of Pathways. High school graduation rates at

Rexdale/LH follow closely the rates observed for the comparison projects from

2000 to 2006, then jump from 49.0 percent to 64.4 percent in 2007, when the

program was introduced. That is a 10.6 percentage point increase in the graduation

rate relative to the rate change between 2006 and 2007 at the comparison project

sites.



B. Regression Analysis


         Table 3 shows our main estimated effects of Pathways eligibility on high

school graduation for Regent Park and Rexdale/LH, both for the full sample and for

various subgroups. As outlined in equation (1) and discussed in the previous

section, outcomes are regressed on a Pathways' eligibility indicator (student is from

Regent Park and entered Grade 9 in 2001 or later or student is from Rexdale/LH

and entered Grade 9 in 2007), as well as a set of dummy variables for housing

project and cohort, along with controls for age when entered grade 9, gender,

immigrant and home language status. We drop the 2007 Grade 9 cohort when

estimating Regent Park program effects and drop the 2000 cohort when looking at


27
  Also noteworthy is that the estimated treatment on the treated (TOT) effects are almost exactly the same
when using the first year of Pathways (a 23.1percentage point increase in the probability of high school
graduation [0.136/0.588] ) versus using the second year (a 20.9 percentage point increase in the probability
of graduation [0. 168/0.803]).

                                                    27
Rexdale/LH, which allows us to keep the full sample for these remaining years

(combined results are shown in the Appendix). Graduation is defined as being

recorded as obtaining a diploma while dropping out is defined as not graduating and

showing up at a TDSB or other high school the following year. Standard errors are

clustered by housing project 28.              We present similar results using alternative

standard error and confidence interval estimates in Appendix B, Table A1.

           As shown, Pathways eligibility effects (Intent-to-Treat) are large both for

Regent Park and Rexdale/LH. We estimate, with statistical significance at the 1

percent level, that the 2001 introduction of Pathways in Regent Park increased the 5

year graduation rate by 15.2 percentage points (from 38.2 percent to 53.4 percent)

and the 2007 introduction in Rexdale/LH increased the rate by 9.7 percentage

points (from 47.9 percent to 57.6 percent). 29

           Table 3 also shows how these effects differ by student background.

Pathways impacts females significantly more than males for both Regent Park and

Rexdale/LH, though both gender groups appear to benefit at least to some degree.

Our estimated Pathways impacts are generally similar by whether English is spoken

at home. We also compare results for low achieving Grade 9 students (measured by

whether they failed or almost failed Grade 9 Mathematics or English) to those who

did not achieve low Grade 9 grades. While this variable is likely endogenous to

28
     See footnote 19.
29
  Similar estimates arise when using graduation after 6 years as the outcome variable (but with data from
the 2000 and 2004 cohorts only). For Regent Park, Pathways eligibility increased 6-year high school
graduation rates by 21.7 percentage points (from 38.2 to 59.9 percent, standard error 0.025). We also find
separate eligibility effects for Rexdale (a 15.1 percentage point increase in high school graduation from a
pre-Pathways mean of 45.4 percent) and Lawrence Heights (an 8.5 percentage point increase from a mean
of 49.3 percent).


                                                    28
Pathways eligibility (as we provide evidence for in Table 5), the bias is downwards

for both subgroups if students at the margin of getting better grades are the ones

affected by the program. It seems worth noting that, nevertheless, we find positive

and significant Pathways eligibility effects at both the Regent Park and Rexdale/LH

sites. Absolute gains are larger for higher achieving students, perhaps because

students with serious initial difficulty are harder to help. This is in line with the

notion of dynamic complementarities in human capital skill formation (Cuhna and

Heckman, 2007).

       If we define Pathways participation as ever signing up for the program,

participation effects (Treatment-on-the-Treated) are about 20 percent larger than

eligibility effects, since most students from both Regent Park and Rexdale/LH take-

up the program. Appendix Table A2 shows these Treatment on Treated estimates

using Pathways eligibility as an instrument for Pathways participation and the same

difference-in-differences methodology as above. They require the assumptions that

non-participants are unaffected by Pathways and that no one is made worse of by

Pathways. Under these assumptions, introducing the program led participants to

increase 5-year graduation rates by 19.1 percentage points for Regent Park, and

12.0 percentage points for Rexdale/LH. Appendix Table 2 also shows participation

effect estimates after defining participation as signing up for Pathways and

attending at least one mentoring or tutoring session in Grade 9. Here the Treatment

on the Treated effects are larger, but more so for Regent Park than Rexdale/LH.

       Pathways not only focuses on helping at risk high school students graduate

but also promotes postsecondary education.       This is done explicitly through a


                                         29
college scholarship to each participant of up to $4,000, college application assistance

and fee waivers, and organized campus visits. The program also promotes college

implicitly from helping improve grades (and eligibility), and through regular

advising. Tables 4A and 4B look at post secondary outcomes for Regent Park and

Rexdale/LH respectively.     For Regent Park, we estimate very large impacts of

Pathways on post secondary attainment, even larger than the high school

completion impacts presented above. Application rates increase by 16.8 percentage

points, up from a mean of 43.3 percent in Regent Park in 2000. This leads to a 9.8

percentage point increase in a 2-year college acceptance among Pathways' eligible

cohorts by the end of their fifth year, and a 9.4 percentage point increase in

university program acceptance. Similar to our high school attainment findings,

impacts on postsecondary acceptances appear to be significantly larger among

females than males, though significant for both. For females, Pathways in Regent

Park more than doubles college acceptances. And also similar to patterns observed

with our high school findings, Regent Park Pathways' effects on postsecondary

acceptances are large for both English and non-English home speaking students and

higher for students not initially failing their Grade 9 English or Math courses.

       Table 4B shows the postsecondary results for the new Pathways sites

introduced in 2007. While college and university application rates increased by

about 10 percentage points (up from 51.1 percent), the overall effect on

postsecondary enrolment was an increase by 4.4 percentage points and not

statistically significant. Perhaps in the initial program year, Rexdale/LH students

were encouraged to apply but to programs they could not get in to, or programs


                                          30
that, ultimately, students were not interested. Specifically for males, however, we

estimate that the program doubled college enrolment (from 12.1 to 24.1 percent). 30

        Finally, we estimate Pathways eligibility effects on some intermediate

outcomes, within high school, to explore possible mechanisms by which Pathways

may improve high school completion outcomes. Table 5 shows Intent to Treat

effects from Pathways on Grade 9 Math and English grades, Grade 9 and 10

academic track status, and OSSLT Literacy Test pass rates. While these variables are

the only intermediate outcomes we observe, all three are found to be significantly

affected by Pathways' introduction, either for Regent Park or Rexdale/LH, or both.



C. Robustness Checks


        We consider two robustness checks to examine how well our results hold.

First, we consider alternative comparison groups to our baseline of youth from all

Toronto Community Housing projects (other than Regent Park and Rexdale/LH)

with only tenants paying Rent Geared to Income (RGI). Some of these projects are

considerably smaller than Pathways projects, and scattered throughout the city.

Although the application procedure is centralized and generic for all projects,

applicants can specify region preferences or specific project preferences (the default

is to be considered for housing within an applicants' current census subdivision).




30
  When estimating the eligibility effects for each new site separately, we find a 8.7 percentage point
increase in post secondary enrollment for Lawrence Heights, while a 1.7 percentage point decrease for
Rexdale. The Lawrence Heights effect is statistically significant using Huber-White standard errors, but
not when using other methods discussed in the Appendix.

                                                    31
Table 6 shows results from using the same regression equations for Table 3, but

with different comparison groups.

        The first row of Table 6 shows the baseline results for Pathways eligibility

effects on fifth year graduation rates. The second row uses for the comparison

group only the twelve largest housing projects, aside from Regent and Rexdale/LH,

which are similar in size and notoriety. 31 The total sample drops by almost one half.

The effects remain large - about a 10 percentage point increase in graduation

attributed to Pathways eligibility.              The third row uses only the two largest

downtown projects in the same subdivision as Regent Park. Here the point estimate

for the Pathways effect on high school graduation is an increase of 7.5 percentage

points, with a large standard error of 7.7 percentage points. The last row uses a

sample with only housing projects within Toronto's “priority neighborhoods”, which

are areas with concentrated levels of crime and poverty. . Results are similar to the

baseline results in row 1 and significant. 32 The main message from the table is that

the choice in comparison group does not seem to affect the results. High school

completion rates rise modestly and slowly for all the comparison groups examined.

The rapid improvement in Regent Park and Rexdale/LH's academic outcomes

following the introduction of Pathways is what appears to drive the results.

        Our school district data do not permit us to go back before 2000 and test

whether the performance gap between youth from Regent Park and other housing

31
   The large projects are Alexandra Park, Bleecker Street, East Mall, Edgeley Village, Jane Finch, Firgrove
Crescent, Flemingdon Park, Lawrence Heights, Malvern, Moss Park, Pelham Park, Regent Park, Rexdale
(Thistletown) and Warden Woods.
32
   We also test the robustness of the effect of Pathways eligibility for Regent Park residents using two
housing projects that later adopt the Pathways program (beginning in 2007 for Rexdale/LH). Eligibility for
Pathways is estimated to increase graduation rates by 14.0 percentage points (standard error of 2.7
percentage points), relative to this comparison group.

                                                    32
projects was relatively constant in years prior to Pathways. If performance for the

165 students from Regent Park who entered Grade 9 in 2000 was unusually poor

compared to prior years, the observed subsequent improvement to later cohorts

would incorrectly be attributed to Pathways. In an attempt to test whether the

2000 Regent Park cohort was anomalous, we obtained access to Statistics Canada's

1996 and 2001 census files with postal code identifiers to identify youth between

age 9 and 17 living in the same public housing addresses as those in our sample.

Although the timing of the censuses and their cross-section nature do not lend

themselves well to testing Pathways' effects on final education attainment, we can

instead use them to test whether background characteristics across projects

remained stable for a richer set of variables than those available from the Toronto

School Board data.

       Table 7 shows mean characteristics from the census data for Regent Park and

other housing project students. We assign students to Grade 9 cohorts based when

the year they were age 14, since 92.3 percent of our TDSB sample was age 14 when

they entered Grade 9. The pattern of more Non-English speaking students from

Regent Park remains similar to that observed from the TDSB data. The census data

also indicate families from Regent Park are generally poorer than those from other

housing projects, receive more government income assistance, and are less likely

with married parents.     Due to the negative correlation between poverty and

performance, we might expect to observe worse performance for students from

Regent Park. This is not the case for the years after Pathways was introduced.




                                        33
       The last row presents coefficient estimates and standard errors for the

interaction term of being from Regent Park and entering Grade 9 in 2000 after

regressing each background characteristic on this interaction, along with fixed

effects for housing project and cohort, and clustered standard errors at the project

level. This coefficient tests whether overall differences in characteristics between

Regent Park and other projects systematically differ for the 2000 Grade 9 cohort,

our only pre-Pathways cohort in our TDSB data. All of the estimates are small and

insignificant, except for the 'parent with university' variable, which indicates

parents of the Grade 9 cohort from Regent Park are 3.8 percentage points less likely

with any university education compared to other years. This difference would not,

at least on its own, be enough to explain the much larger Pathways' effect estimates

found in our TDSB data. Together with the insignificant differences found for the

rest of the background variables, we interpret Table 7 as providing evidence against

the hypothesis that the Grade 9 Regent Park cohort in 2000 was unusual in a way to

lead to expect dramatically improved education outcomes for later cohorts.




V. Discussion and Conclusion


       Pathways to Education is a comprehensive youth support program

developed to improve academic outcomes among those entering high school from

very poor social-economic backgrounds.       The program includes proactive case

workers assigned to each student at the start of Grade 9, free weekly tutoring and

group activities throughout high school, career counseling, and college transition
                                        34
assistance, combined with immediate and long-term incentives to reinforce a

minimum degree or mandatory participation. The program is community-based, to

address poor academic performance for youth from three of Toronto's largest public

housing complexes. Since its start in 2001, Pathways has attracted national public

and media interest. An internal 2007 consulting report concluded that "Pathways is

one of the most successful programs we have found anywhere in North America".

The program has recently been expanded to 11 other communities across Canada

and efforts for further expansion continue. About half its financial support (47

percent) comes from national, provincial, and local levels of governments. The

other half comes from considerable foundation (20 percent), corporate (19

percent), individual (8 percent), and other (6 percent) support.

       This paper is an attempt to more transparently present an evaluation of the

introduction of Pathways, with more convincing identification strategies and

robustness checks than earlier assessments, and with a look at whether impacts

were replicated at expanded sites. Our results remain impressive:



   •   Pathways reaches a remarkably high fraction of its target group: 80 to 95

       percent of eligible students entering high school and their parents register in

       writing for the program

   •   At the program's initial site (in Regent Park), fifth year high school

       graduation rates increased from about 38 percent to 58 percent, while fifth

       year post secondary enrollment rates more than 50 percent, from about 43

       percent to 59 percent

                                         35
   •   The program's expansion, at two other sites in 2007, also led to impressive

       gains - an immediate 10 percentage point increase in high school graduation

       and about a 10 percentage point increase in post secondary enrollment for

       males

   •   High school impacts are larger for women and for students not failing initial

       math and English classes. Impacts are similar for students with English and

       non-English languages spoken at home

   •   Program effects are also positive for most of the limited intermediate

       outcomes we are able to look at: Grade 9 math and English grades, and taking

       a set of academic track courses.



       Pathways costs approximately $3,500 per year per student in 2010 Canadian

dollars, along with $1,200 in head office administrative costs (Boston Consulting

Group, 2011). Direct operating costs comprise of 20 percent public transportation

tickets, 15 percent scholarship expenditures, and the remaining towards SPPGs,

tutoring and group activity operations.        Over an average participants' entire

duration in high school, Pathways is estimated to cost $14,000 in present value

direct operating costs, plus indirect administrative costs, plus costs from extended

enrollment in school.    While substantial, if students affected by the program

experience earnings gains in the range of previous returns to schooling estimates

for marginal students, total benefits likely exceed costs, even when only looking at




                                          36
benefits from additional tax revenue. 33 Including the many possible non-pecuniary

benefits from additional schooling (Oreopoulos and Salvanes, 2011), as well as

social benefits from reductions in crime and improvements to health (Lochner

2011) would reinforce this conclusion.

         A better understanding of Pathways' mechanisms would help contain costs

and lead to more detailed theories of change. The approach used in this paper for

estimating average program effects cannot be used for trying to disentangle which

program components worked and which did not. The components themselves were

designed to work together: Student-Parent Support Workers are able to monitor

and encourage tutoring use, inform students of group activities and events. Group

activities promote social capital among Pathways participants.                               Free public

transportation tickets and college scholarships are conditional on meeting with

support workers and attending tutoring and group activities.

         Looking at previous research, one can find evidence of large impacts for

some of Pathways' components on their own. As discussed earlier, tutoring, after-

school assistance, and a culture of high expectations are key parts to highly effective

chartered schools (Dobbie and Fryer, 2011b). Personalized and regular coaching, at

least at the college level, has also been shown to be effective at increasing education


33
  For example, suppose high school dropouts earn $25,000, on average, at age 20 and worked until age 65
with 1.5 percent real increases in wages. Suppose returns to additional high school for marginal students
are in the range of 10 percent per year (Angrist and Krueger, 1991, Oreopoulos, 2007), and that Pathways
compliers who complete high school because of the program increase their high school attainment by two
years (for a total increase in annual earnings of about 20 percent). Similarly, suppose high school graduates
earn $30,000 with the same wage profile implied above. Assume higher post secondary enrollment from
Pathways implies a 20 percent return each year (e.g. Oreopoulos and Petronijevic, 2013, and Zimmerman,
forthcoming). With Pathways increasing high school graduation by about 18 percentage points and college
enrollment by about 21 percentage points participants, this implies a net present value increase in expected
earnings of $72,789 using a 3 percent discount rate. With an average tax rate of 30 percent, this implies
additional expected tax revenue of $21,837 per Pathways eligible.

                                                    37
persistence (Bettinger and Baker, 2011). Assistance with college transition and

applications, including paying application fees, has also been shown to markedly

increase college enrollment (Bettinger et al., 2012, Carrell and Sacerdote, 2013),

although, of course, not high school completion. College trust incentives, very

similar to those offered by Pathways, have also been found effective. A study in New

Brunswick that randomly offered entering Grade 9 students college trust funds that

accumulated by $2,000 each year in high school, up to a maximum of $8,000 -

exactly double Pathways' incentive, reduced dropout rates by about 8 percentage

points and increased postsecondary enrollment rates by about 10 percentage points

(Frenette and Ford, 2012). A randomized trial in Chicago provided social-cognitive

skills training, along with mandatory daily two-on-one tutoring, to help

disadvantaged youth better self-regulate and interact (Cook et al. 2014). Impacts on

school engagement, math and, in some cases, reading scores, were some of the

largest ever estimated in the literature.     The Accelerated Study in Associate

Program, a comprehensive intervention designed to increase completion rates for

low-income community college students, features many of the same components as

Pathways including free public transportation tickets, mandatory tutoring, regular

counseling over multiple years, and career advising services. Initial results from

this program point to very positive effects on credit accumulation, as well as

postsecondary retention and graduation rates (Scrivener and Weiss, 2013).

       It is not possible to tell from the results in this paper whether only a few

components of the program drive the results or whether its integration is crucial. In

the absence of being able to experiment with variations of the program, qualitative


                                         38
research through survey and ethnographic research may help. The expansion of

additional Pathways sites outside of Toronto also provides an opportunity to test

whether these initial impacts can be replicated. Implementation quality, community

support, recruitment, communication efforts, and target population may be key

underlying ingredients for program effectiveness that could explain why some site

impacts are larger than others. Still, the program's initial introduction looks as

though it was highly effective in improving education attainment for a sample of

very poor youth. These results are promising, similar to recent intensive efforts to

target disadvantaged youth, and point to the need for further research and policy

discussion.

Appendix B: Robustness Checks with Alternative Inference Methods



        Inference in difference in differences models with grouped (clustered) data

has been an active area of research in the past few years. 34 The primary concern in

this literature is that OLS standard error estimates are biased downward due to

possible heteroskedasticity and serial correlation (at the group level) in the error

term. This can lead to incorrect inference, over-rejection of the null hypothesis in

significance tests of individual parameter estimates and confidence intervals that

are too narrow. The standard error estimates reported in the main results above

correct for possible heteroskedasticity and serial correlation in outcomes of

students living in the same housing project. We cluster standard errors (CRVE) at

the housing project level and with 57 clusters in the final dataset, each of which

contains more than 30 observations, inference is based on the critical values of a t-

distribution with 57 degrees of freedom. Nevertheless, there may be remaining

concerns with this approach because (i) the proportion of treated projects is low

relative to the number of untreated housing projects, (ii) the variation in cluster

sizes and (iii) if the projects in our sample experience cohort specific shocks that

determine outcomes (i.e. there are project x cohort fixed effects in equation (1)). In

this Appendix we explore the robustness of the inference in the main results above

to alternative specifications.

        The CRVE consistently estimates variance of the ITT effect of interest in

equation (1) if three key assumptions hold. The first assumption, that the number

34
  Cameron and Miller (2013) is an example of a review and discussion about the current state of this area
of research.

                                                   46
of groups goes to infinity is well known. The “rule of 42” is a rule of thumb that

applied researchers have used to justify the reliability of CVRE estimates. However,

the consistency of the CRVE also depends on two other assumptions, specifically: (i)

a degree of within-group correlation is constant across groups and (ii) each group

contains an equal number of observations. The implications of violating these two

assumptions for the reliability of standard errors computed using the CRVE has only

recently received attention in the literature.    In a series of Monte Carlo studies,

MacKinnon and Webb (2013) show that the CRVE is unreliable when group sizes are

very different. Using simulated data with relative groups sizes that mimic the

population differences between U.S. states, they find that the CRVE severely over-

rejects a true-null hypothesis even when the number of groups is very large. They

find that performance is particularly poor when the proportion of treated groups is

very small or very large relative to the number of untreated groups.

       In light of this evidence, the characteristics of the data in this application are

challenging for two reasons. First, there is significant variation in the sizes of the

different housing projects in our sample. Large housing projects like Regent Park

have approximately 150 observations per cohort while smaller housing projects like

Sheppard Birchmount have approximately 10 observations per cohort. Also, only

three projects (Regent Park, Rexdale and Lawrence Heights) receive treatment, in

the form of the introduction of the Pathways program.



       MacKinnon and Webb find that the wild cluster bootstrap discussed in

Cameron, Miller and Gelbach (2008) performs much better than the CRVE. We test


                                          47
the robustness of the results in the main analysis using the wild cluster bootstrap

with 999 replications by constructing bootstrap confidence intervals for the 5-year

graduation rate ITT estimates. The results for this procedure are reported in row 2

of Appendix Table 1 (ITT estimates, standard errors and 95% confidence intervals

from the main analysis are reported in row 1 as a comparison). For the 5-year

graduation rate, the distribution of ITT effects has a mean of 15.2 percentage points

which is very similar to the estimated ITT in the main analysis. The ITT estimates

at the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles of this distribution imply 95% confidence intervals

that range between 6 percentage points and 24 percentage points, nearly twice the

size of the confidence intervals estimated using the CRVE. 35 While the confidence

intervals implied by the cluster wild bootstrap are much larger than those implied

by the CRVE, the empirical distribution of ITT effects implies that point estimates

are still significant at the 1 percent level36.                  Similarly, the implied confidence

intervals for the ITT estimates suggest that the effect of being eligible for Pathways

at the Rexdale/LH (column 2) and three combined sites (column 3) is significant at

conventional levels.

         MacKinnon and Webb find that the wild cluster bootstrap under-rejects true

null hypothesis in cases when the proportion of treated groups is below 10 percent

and above 90 percent, the opposite problem of the CRVE. In this application, the


35
   The reported standard errors are the standard deviations of the estimated bootstrap distribution of ITT
estimates.
36
   We also test the null hypothesis of a zero estimate for the ITT directly by imposing the null hypothesis in
the data generating process (DGP) as in MacKinnon and Webb (2013). Equation (1) is then estimated for
each bootstrap replication using the dependent variable formed by the DGP. A Wald test statistic is formed
for each replication and the symmetric bootstrap p –value is computed. The null hypothesis of a zero ITT
estimate is rejected at the α level if the symmetric bootstrap p-value is less than α. The null hypothesis is
rejected at the 1 percent level.

                                                     48
proportion of treated projects is about 2 percent. The fact that we are able to reject

the null hypothesis of a zero or a negligible ITT effect using this procedure is strong

evidence of a relatively large and statistically significant impact of being eligible for

Pathways on high school attainment rates.

         As a second robustness check, we estimate the impact of eligibility for

Pathways using the synthetic control method described in Abadie et al. (2010).

This method directly addresses the case when there is only one treated group and

several potential control groups. The essence of this approach is that the ideal

control group in any comparative case study will have pre-treatment characteristics

(variables) that are as similar as possible (in levels) to those of the treatment group

of interest.       With very similar pre-treatment characteristics, the post-treatment

outcomes from this ideal control group are a reasonable estimate of the unobserved

counterfactual outcomes for the treated group. The Abadie et al. method uses pre-

treatment variables (both outcomes and covariates) from a pool of potential control

group candidates to construct a synthetic control group that is most similar to the

treated group of interest. Then, any differences in the post-treatment outcomes

between the treated group and the synthetic control group can be attributed to the

reform or event-study being analyzed.

         In this application, data from the pool of control projects from the pre-

Pathways cohorts (the 2000 cohort) are used to construct the synthetic control

group 37. Each of these projects is assigned a weight so that the weighted average of


37
  The synthetic control method relies on the assumption that the number of pre-treatment periods is large
relative to the scale of the transitory shocks in the residual. With only one year of pre-treatment data, it is
unclear whether this assumption is violated in this application.

                                                      49
each of the pre-Pathways characteristics from the synthetic control group most-

closely resembles the 2000 Grade 9 cohort from Regent Park. Most projects are

weighted relatively equally using this approach, with nearly all individual project

weights varying between 1.5 to 3 percent of the synthetic control group 38. This is

contrasted with the OLS estimation in the main analysis which implicitly weights the

projects with the most observations (the largest housing projects in the sample) the

highest. The average pre-treatment 5-year graduation rate for the synthetic control

group is 38.15 percent compared to 38.18 percent for Regent Park.

        Row 3 in Appendix Table 1 reports the estimated impact of being eligible for

Pathways using the synthetic control group method. Following the introduction of

Pathways for the 2001-2002 academic year, the 5-year average graduation rate in

Regent Park is 9.6 percentage points higher than that of the synthetic control group.

This estimate is very similar to the difference-in-difference estimate reported in row

1.

        Following Abadie et al (2010), we also evaluate whether the estimated

impact of being eligible for Pathways is rare compared to a series of placebo studies.

Specifically, we iteratively assigned each project to the treated group and

constructed a synthetic control group for each case.                      The estimated placebo

treatment effects are then compared to the estimated effect for Regent Park. Of the

57 estimated treatment effects (56 placebo estimates plus the Regent Park

estimate), the 9.6 percentage point gap between Regent Park and the synthetic

Regent Park is the 9th largest.             Therefore, the probability of estimating a gap

38
  The control group project with the largest weight is Yorkwoods Village (11.9%), followed by East Mall
(2.8%), Willowridge Richview (2.8%), Roywood Drive (2.6%) and Kennedy Glamorgan (2.4%).

                                                  50
between the treatment and synthetic control group greater than the magnitude of

that for Regent Park is 17 percent 39. This suggests that the estimated gap for Regent

Park is relatively rare.

         The model estimated in equation (1) assumes the absence of a project x

cohort effect (equivalently, the underlying pre-treatment differences between

Regent park and each of the comparison projects remains fixed both before and

after treatment).         Conley and Taber (2011) point out that when the number of

treatment groups is finite, relaxing this assumption implies that the difference in

differences estimator is not consistent even with a large number of clusters in

total 40. However, they show that if eligibility for treatment is randomly assigned

(independent of the project x cohort effects), the limiting distribution of the

differences in differences parameter can be estimated (up to the value of the

parameter). The essence of their approach is that when the eligibility for treatment

is randomly assigned, information from the residuals of the control projects can be

used to estimate the limiting distribution of the differences in differences

parameter.        This can then be used to perform hypothesis tests and construct

confidence intervals. Using several empirical examples, they show that confidence

intervals may be much wider than those implied by traditional inference methods.

         In row 4 of Appendix Table 1 we investigate whether the large and

statistically significant ITT estimates presented in section IV are robust to relaxing

this assumption. Assuming that the estimates in the main analysis represent the

40
  If the expectation of the project x cohort effect, conditional on treatment status, is equal to zero then the
difference in differences estimator is still not consistent but is unbiased.

true values of the ITT parameter, both the 95% and 90% confidence intervals are

computed using the method described in Conley and Taber (2011). The implied

confidence intervals are very large relative to those computed using standard

inference methods.          The estimated confidence intervals suggest that the 5 year

graduation rate is not statistically significant at the 5 percent level..

         That being said, there are at least two reasons to believe that the assumption

of non-zero project x cohort effects is unwarranted in this application.                        First, the

cohorts we study enter high school (Grade 9) in consecutive years meaning that at

any given time, each cohort will be in school at the same time as at least three other

cohorts. Therefore, any project x cohort effects would represent shocks that impact

one project-cohort but not any neighboring cohorts, even if students in the shocked

cohort have peers or classmates that are in neighboring cohorts. If peer effects are

important in determining high school outcomes, it is difficult to imagine how

project-cohort specific shocks could enter equation (1) 41. We also inspect the

family/background characteristics of students in successive cohorts from the mid-

1990s through the mid-2000s in Table 7 to check for evidence whether students

from Regent Park and other public housing projects experience cohort specific

shocks. The series appear to move together, leading us to conclude that there is no

such evidence. For example, the trends in many of the demographic variables such

as the percentage of immigrants, parent’s university attainment, family earnings,


41
  Moreover, since eligibility for Pathways is determined by the housing project one lives in and not school
and because many of the housing projects in our data are very close geographically, students living in one
project have high school classmates that live in other projects. Assuming non-zero project x cohort effects
would also suggest that there are important shocks that impact the high school outcomes of students but
don’t impact peers that live in housing projects nearby that are in the same cohort even if they attend the
same school.

                                                    52
receipt of government assistance and poverty rate are similar for both Regent Park

and the comparison housing projects from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s.

        Next, we explore the sensitivity of the results to ignoring the heterogeneity in

the comparison housing projects. We first collapse the high school attainment

outcome variables into their annual means and by whether they are Regent Park,

the Rexdale/LH sites or other public housing.. Row 5 in Appendix Table 1 reports

the ITT parameter estimates of regressions of these annual means on a dummy

variable equal to one if the annual mean is from a year when students from Regent

Park or Rexdale/LH were eligible for Pathways 42.                       Heteroskedasticity robust

standard errors are reported in square brackets. Essentially, these regressions

formally estimate the result in Figure 2.                By grouping all comparison housing

projects into one control group, we are ignoring any heterogeneity in the pre-

treatment differences between the comparison projects. Similar to the main results

above, estimated ITT effects are both large and significant for each of the high school

attainment outcome variables. Eligibility for Pathways is estimated to increase the

5-year graduation rate by 14.7 percentage points in Regent Park and 9.6 percentage

points at the Rexdale/LH sites. These estimates are very similar to the baseline

results in row 1. 43



        We interpret these results, taken together with the robustness checks in

section IV, as pointing to the introduction of Pathways having led to consistent and

 Regent Park, Rexdale/LH and post-Pathways period dummies are also included in these regressions.

 Differences in estimates between rows 1 and 5 are due to the fact that the group mean regressions do not
weight project means by their sampling weight.

 Notes: Sample is the same as in Table 1. Each column in the table reports the "Intent to Treat" (ITT) effects of Pathways
 to Education on 5-year high school graduation rates. Columns 1 and 3 report the Pre-Pathways means. Columns 2 and 4
 report the corresponding estimated ITT effect for elligible students living in Regent Park post-Pathways (students who
 enrolled in Grade 9 in the 2001-2002 to 2005-2006 academic years) and the Lawrence Heights (LH) and Rexdale sites for
 the 2007-2008 academic year). All regressions include cohort (year) fixed effects and housing project fixed effects.
 Regressions in the top row include the following control variables: age (in Grade 9), female, immigrant, and english as a
 second language. The regressions in rows 2 to 7 include the same control variables with the exception of the variable used
 to define the sub-sample of interest. Standard errors are clustered at the housing project/development level. Student
 immigrant status and first language is based on TDSB registration records. * p < 0.1, ** p < 0.05 and *** p < 0.01.

 Notes: Sample is the same as in Columns 1 and 2 of Table 3. Each column in the table reports the "Intent to Treat" (ITT) effects of Pathways to
 Education on four post-secondary education (PSE) outcome variables. Applied to PSE is a dummy variable equal to 1 if a student applied to at least
 one PSE institution in the province of Ontario in their final year of high school and equal to 0 otherwise. Enrolled in PSE is a dummy variable equal
 to 1 if a student accepted an offer of adminssion to a PSE institution in Ontario upon completing high school and 0 otherwise. Enrolled in PSE is a
 dummy variable equal to 1 if a student accepted an offer of adminssion to a PSE institution in Ontario upon completing high school and 0 otherwise.
 Each column reports the Pre-Pathways (students who enrolled in Grade 9 in the 2000-2001 academic year) means for the Regent Park housing
 project and the corresponding estimated ITT effect for elligible students living in Regent Park Post-Pathways (students who enrolled in Grade 9 in
 the 2001-2002 to 2006-2007 academic years). All regressions include cohort (year) fixed effects and housing project fixed effects. Regressions in
 the top row include the following control variables: age (in Grade 9), female, immigrant, and english as a second language. The regressions in rows
 2 to 7 include the same control variables with the exception of the variable used to define the sub-sample of interest. Standard errors are clustered
 at the housing project/development level. Student immigrant status and first language is based on TDSB registration records. * p < 0.1, ** p < 0.05

Notes: Sample is the same as in Table 3. Each column in the table reports the "Intent to Treat" (ITT) effects of Pathways to Education on four
intermediate high school outcomes. Columns 1 and 2 report year end achievement levels (grades) for Grade 9 English and Math. An
achievement level of 4 corresponds to an "A" grade while an achievement level of 0 corresponds to a failing grade. On Academic Track in Grade
9 is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the stduent is enrolled in "academic stream " courses and 0 otherwise. "Academic Stream" courses prepare
high school students for university, "Applied Stream" courses preapre students for community college and "Essentials Stream" courses prepare
students to enter the labour force after high school . Gr10 Literacy Pass is an indicator variable equal to 1 if a student has paased the Ontario
Secondary School Literacy Test (OSSLT), a requirement for graduation in the Province of Ontario, on their first attempt (in Grade 10). All

Notes: Panels A and B report the annual means for background variables (descriptive statistics) for children between the ages of 9 and 17 living in Toronto public housing between 1993 and 2006.
Data are obtained from the 1996 and 2001 Census of Canada. Panel C reports the regression coefficient and corresponding standard error (in square brackets) of a regression of each demographic
variable on a dummy variable equal to 1 if the child lived in Regent Park in 2000 and 0 otherwise. All regressions include cohort (year) and housing project fixed effects . Standard errors are
clustered at the housing project/development level. * p < 0.1, ** p < 0.05 and *** p < 0.01.

Notes: Each column in the table reports the "Intent to Treat" (ITT) effects of Pathways to Education on the 5-year high school graduation rate. Each column reports Pre-Pathways means
and the corresponding estimated ITT effect. For column 1 the ITT is for elligible students living in Regent Park post-Pathways (students who enrolled in Grade 9 during the 2001-2002 to
2006-2007 academic years). Column 2 reports the ITT for elligible students living in the Lawrence Heights and Rexdale sites post-Pathways (students who enrolled in Grade 9 during the
2007-2008 academic year). Column 3 reports the ITT for all Pathways sites for the 2000-2001 to 2007-2008 academic years. Row 1 reports the baseline estimates (Table 3, column 1) as
a comparison. All regressions in row 1 include cohort (year) fixed effects, housing project fixed effects and the following control variables: age (in Grade 9), female, immigrant english
as a second language. Standard errors are clustered at the housing project/development level. Row 2 reports mean ITT effects from 999 cluster-wild bootstrap replications along with
corresponding standard deviations and 95% confidence intervals computed from the 0.025 and 0.975 percentiles of the estimated iTT distribution. Row 3 reports average differences in
post-Pathways outcomes between treated cohorts and a synthetic cohort. Row 4 reports 95 percent and 90 percent confidence intervals, using the Conley/Taber (2011) method (see
Appendix B). In row 5 the dependent variable is the housing project/group mean for each outcome. Regressions control for cohort (year) fixed effects and weight observations by the
number of students in each housing project mean cell. For row 3, heteroskedasticity robust standard errors are reported in square brackets. * p < 0.1, ** p < 0.05 and *** p < 0.01.

Notes: Sample is the same as in Table 3. Each column in the table reports the "Treatment on the Treated" (TOT) effects of Pathways to Education on 5-year high school graduation rates. Columns 1,
3, 5 and 7 report the Pre-Pathways means. Columns 2, 4, 6 and 8 report the corresponding estimated TOT effect for elligible students living in Regent Park post-Pathways (students who enrolled in
Grade 9 in the 2001-2002 to 2005-2006 academic years) and the New Sites (Lawrence Heights and Rexdale for the 2007-2008 academic year). In columns 2 and 4 the Pathways participation dummy
variable is instrumented with a dummy variable indicating whether the student was living in a housing project that offered Pathways when the student entered Grade 9. In columns 6 and 8 the
explanatory variable of interest is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the student attended at least one tutoring or mentoring session in Grade 9. This is instrumented with a dummy variable indicating
whether the student was elligible for Pathways (living in a housing project that offered Pathways when the student entered Grade 9). All regressions include cohort (year) fixed effects and housing
project fixed effects. Regressions in the top row include the following control variables: age (in Grade 9), female, immigrant english as a second language. The regressions in rows 2 to 7 include the
same control variables with the exception of the variable used to define the sub-sample of interest. Standard errors are clustered at the housing project/development level. Student immigrant
status and first language is based on TDSB registration records. * p < 0.1, ** p < 0.05 and *** p < 0.01.
