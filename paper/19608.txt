                                             ABSTRACT

Every country faces what economists call an intertemporal (across time) budget constraint, which
requires that its government’s future expenditures, including the servicing of its outstanding official
debt, be covered by its government’s future receipts when measured in present value. The difference
between the present value of a country’s future expenditures and its future receipts is called its fiscal
gap.

This study estimates Russia’s 2013 fiscal gap at 890 trillion rubles or $28 trillion. This longterm
budget shortfall is 8.4 percent of the present value of projected GDP. Consequently, eliminating
Russia’s fiscal gap on a smooth basis requires fiscal tightening by 8.4 percent of each future year’s
projected GDP.

One means of doing this is to immediately and permanently raise all Russian taxes by 29 percent.
Another is to immediately and permanently cut all spending, apart from servicing outstanding debt,
by 22.4 percent.

How can a country with vast energy resources and foreign reserves and other financial assets that
exceed its official debt still have very major fiscal problems? The answer is that the Russia’s energy
resources are finite, whereas its expenditure needs are not. Moreover, Russia is aging and facing
massive obligations from its pension system and other age related expenditures.

Introduction -- Fiscal Sustainability Matters

A country’s fiscal sustainability matters. It matters to its growth path, to its future tax rates,
to its saving behavior, to its net domestic investment, to its labor supply, to its inflation rate,
to its employment, to its wages, to its returns on capital, to the integrity of its financial
markets, to the viability of its political institutions – indeed, it matters to virtually any
question one might pose about a country’s future.

Fiscal sustainability also raises ethical questions. If a country is spending more than it can
cover with its current and future taxes, will the unpaid bills be left for today’s and
tomorrow’s children? More precisely, will current adults, particularly retirees, escape the
requisite fiscal adjustment because the adjustment starts when they are at the ends of their
lives or, indeed, after they die?

But understanding what’s a generationally fair means to achieve fiscal sustainability first
requires knowing what overall adjustment is needed and how delaying the adjustment will
increase its requisite size. A country’s fiscal gap – the difference between the present value
of its future expenditures and its future receipts – answers this question. It measures the
degree to which a country’s projected fiscal policy fails to satisfy what economists call its
intertemporal budget constraint.

No household can continually spend more than it makes. At some point, those who are
financing the excess of the household’s expenditures over its receipts will declare “game
over.” The same is true of governments. Eventually they need to change their spending or
their revenues or both to satisfy their intertemporal budgets. The longer the delay in
adjusting policy, the bigger and more painful the adjustment will be and the greater will be
the burden on young and future generations who are left behind to pay the bills.

The requirement that, along its economic transition path, a country’s taxes cover its
expenditures when measured in present value (discounted as of today) is a feature of all
neoclassical economic growth models. Indeed, every dynamic growth model constructed by
economists incorporates this long-term budget constraint, either explicitly or implicitly.

But while the fiscal authorities fictively dwelling within mathematical economic models
realize they have to behave, real word policymakers often fail to get this message before it’s
too late. Countries whose prevailing policies produce fiscal gaps are running policies that are
unsustainable. And the size of the country’s fiscal gap indicates the degree to which taxes
need to be raised, spending needs to be cut, or a combination of tax hikes and spending cuts
need to be imposed, either immediately or starting at a future date, to achieve a sustainable
course of policy; i.e., to eliminate the fiscal gap as currently measured.

Fiscal gap accounting may sound like the analysis of a zero-sum game in which one
generation can gain only if another loses. That’s not necessarily the case. There are
investments, be they in education, research, infrastructure, technology, and
communications, whose costs are more than offset by future welfare improvements or
future revenues thanks to their positive impact on the economy. But fiscal gap accounting
provides a framework for governments to soberly evaluate whether an investment will
actually pay for itself through time or, instead, represent an added burden that current and
future generations must bear. But even if that extra burden is positive, the benefits from
the investment, e.g., in the arts and sports, may justify the costs.
                                                   3
An example of an investment that could pay for itself is the development of clean energy
sources financed by borrowing from current older generations. If future generations are
asked to repay this borrowing, but the investment provides sufficient welfare improvements
to those future generations, in terms of abating climate change as well as better health
outcomes, future generations may, on balance, end up better off.

Although this study constitutes the first fiscal gap analysis for Russia, prior studies discussing
problems with conventional fiscal accounting and measuring the sizes of fiscal gaps in
developed countries date back more than two decades. They include Auerbach, Gokhale,
and Kotlikoff (1991), Gokhale and Raffelhüschen (1999), Gokhale and Smetters (2003),
Auerbach, Gale, and Orszag (2003), Auerbach, Gale, and Orszag (2004), Kotlikoff and Green
(2009), Evans, Kotlikoff, and Phillips (2012), and Kotlikoff and Burns (2012).

The emergence of this literature reflects the economics profession’s growing understanding
that conventional fiscal sustainability measures, specifically official debt and deficits, are not
well grounded in economic theory. Instead, what is measured with these statistics is what
the government in questions chooses to label an official as opposed to an unofficial or
implicit debt, i.e., what shows up on the government’s books as an official liability is whole a
function of what the government does and doesn’t decide to put on its books. This fiscal
labeling game – making arbitrary choices to call particular receipts that are surrendered to
the government in exchange for future repayments “official borrowing” and other such
receipts “taxes and promises of future transfer payments” has been played to get effect.
The developed world now has a mountain of implicit debt towering over a small hill of
official debt. This is no less true for Russia than any other developed country.

Indeed, our findings for Russia may surprise many readers. Despite having positive net
financial wealth (i.e., it foreign reserves and other financial assets exceeds its official
government debt), Russia has a very major fiscal gap. The 2013 value is 889.674 trillion
rubles or $27.6 trillion. This present value long-term budget shortfall is 8.4 percent of the
present value of Russia’s projected GDP. Consequently, eliminating Russia’s fiscal gap on a
smooth basis requires fiscal tightening in all future years by 8.4 percent of each future year’s
projected GDP.

How can a country with positive net wealth have small or, in the case of Russia, even
negative net official debt and still have very major fiscal problems? The answer is that official
debt measures are, economically speaking, entirely arbitrary. What obligations governments
do and do not put on the books and, correspondingly, what governments report as their
official debts is a matter of preference, not economic theory. Indeed, as formally shown by
Green and Kotlikoff (2009), governments have complete leeway in deciding which receipts to
call “borrowing” and which receipts to call “taxes” and what promises of payments in the
future to call “principal plus interest” rather than “transfer payments.”

The fiscal gap has an enormous advantage over conventional debt accounting insofar as its
measurement is guided by economic theory and its calculation is invariant to fiscal labeling
conventions. I.e., no matter what a government chooses to call its receipts and payments,
the fiscal gap will stay the same since it only cares about the present value of payments net
of receipts – not what they are called.

Many Russians, attuned to thinking their country’s fiscal condition is quite solid based on its
current positive net financial assets, will, no doubt, find it hard to believe that Russia faces a

                                                   4
very serious long-term fiscal problem. But this is, indeed, the reality and the longer this
problem is ignored, the harder will be its resolution.

What would it take, starting today, to eliminate Russia’s fiscal gap? One answer is to
immediately and permanently raise all Russian federal taxes by 29 percent. Another way is
to immediately and permanently cut all spending, apart from servicing outstanding debt, by
22.4 percent. A third way to eliminate the gap and achieve fiscal sustainability entails using
both tax increases and spending cuts, each of which would eliminate half the fiscal gap. In
this case, the requisite immediate and permanent tax hike is 14.5 percent and the requisite
immediate and permanent spending cut is 11.2 percent.

These results do not reflect extreme projections. On the contrary. This study relies,
wherever possible, on demographic and fiscal projections of Russia’s Ministry of Economic
Development (MED) and Russia’s Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat). All data and
methods used in the analysis are posted on the Gaidar Institute website at (www.iep.ru).

Russia’s fiscal gap, scaled by its economy, is close to the largest of any developed country.
But the dubious distinction of having the largest fiscal gap relative to its GDP may well lie
with the United States. The U.S. fiscal gap now stands at 10 percent of the present value of
its future GDP. For the U.S., a 57 percent immediate and permanent tax hike or a 37 percent
immediate and permanent spending cut is needed to close the fiscal gap.

The source of the U.S. fiscal gap is population aging coupled with excessive growth in
transfer payments per capita to the elderly, particularly government-financed healthcare
benefits under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Since 1970, these benefit levels have
grown at twice the growth rate of per capita GDP. And they are projected to continue to
grow faster than per capital GDP for decades to come. Today, U.S. government healthcare
and pension spending per retiree exceeds $30,000 – twice Russia’s per capital income. Were
there very few older people in the U.S. to collect these benefits, their growth would be of
little consequences. But 42 million American retirees are already collecting old-age benefits
and 78 million baby boomers are poised to retire over the next 20 years and collect benefits
that will average closer to $40,000 per head.

Russia’s fiscal gap has different causes. First, Russia is becoming, and will remain, somewhat
older than the U.S. By 2050, approximately 23.0 percent of Russia’s population will be 65 or
older, compared with 20.9 percent in the U.S. The current elderly population shares of the
two countries -- 13.0 percent in Russia and 13.5 percent in the U.S. -- are much smaller and
also quite close to one another. The fact that Russia, despite its much lower fertility rate
than the U.S., won’t have a much older population than the U.S. reflects its projected lower
life expectancy and its relatively high projected rate of net immigration.

Second, Russia’s pay-as-you-go pension system, not its healthcare system, is the most
important transfer program interacting with its demographic transition. Indeed, absent its
pension system (both pension benefits and the payroll taxes financing pensions), Russia’s
fiscal gap would be 480.0 trillion rubles or 54 percent smaller.

Third, Russia’s energy resources, from which the government derives roughly a third of
current revenues, are finite. Based on Russia’s current proven oil reserves and its current
rate of extraction, the country will run out of oil in 55 years. If we augment proven reserves


                                                 5
by 25 percent to account for the potential of bringing unproven reserves on line as well as
the potential for new oil discoveries, the exhaustion date for oil will occur in 65 years.

Russia’s reserves of natural gas will be depleted in 92 years assuming the current rate of
extraction is maintained. Depletion will occur in 115 years were natural gas reserves to
increase by a quarter due to new discoveries. Even though depletion isn’t going to occur in
the near term, revenues from natural resources will not grow as fast as the economy and,
therefore, will not grow as fast as other revenues or total expenditures. Hence, Russia faces
a similar challenge to Norway, Chile, Saudi Arabia, and other natural resources-dependent
economies, namely making sure the income from these resources isn’t spent too quickly to
the detriment of future generations.

Long-term projections are, of course, fraught with uncertainty and these uncertainties
concern more than Russia’s energy endowments and the ability to extract and develop these
resources. What will happen to the prices of oil and natural gas? Will Russia’s fertility rate
turn around, and soon? Will its immigration rate remain steady as Rosstat forecasts or will it
fall as the United Nations predicts? Will mortality rates fall, such that Russian life expectancy
reaches Western levels? Will GDP keep growing and if it does, will it grow faster than
government expenditures?

No one knows the answers to these questions. The best one can do is to explore the
sensitivity of Russia’s apparent very major fiscal problem to different assumptions. This
study provides three estimates of Russia’s fiscal gap. We reference them as intermediate,
pessimistic, and optimistic.      The intermediate estimate incorporates intermediate
assumptions about demographics, GDP growth, discovery and development of additional
energy resources, the course of energy prices, labor market structure and the pension
system. The pessimistic and optimistic estimates incorporate pessimistic and optimistic
scenarios for each of these factors.

In the case of demographics, the pessimistic scenario coincides with Rosstat’s assumptions
of low fertility, low life expectancy, and low immigration. This produces a low projection of
total future Russian population. The optimistic scenario, correspondingly, assumes high
values for each of these variables and generates a high projection of total future Russian
population.

Based on pessimistic assumptions, Russia’s fiscal gap is 278.0 trillion rubles or 5.2 percent of
the present value of future GDP. In this case, either a 17.7 percent immediate and
permanent tax hike or a 14.9 percent immediate and permanent cut in all non-interest
spending would suffice to eliminate the fiscal gap.

Under optimistic assumptions, Russia’s fiscal gap is 1,669.5 trillion rubles or 10.5 percent of
the present value of GDP. And eliminating the fiscal gap could be accomplished via either an
immediate and permanent 36.5 percent tax hike or an immediate and permanent 26.6
percent cut in all non-interest spending.

Recall that Russia’s fiscal gap is 8.4 percent of the present value of GDP. Hence, the
pessimistic assumptions produce a smaller fiscal gap as a share of the present value of GDP
and the optimistic assumptions produce a larger fiscal gap as a share of the present value of
GDP. The question, then, is why bad economic times makes for better fiscal times and vice
versa?

                                                  6
The explanation is that the pessimistic assumptions imbed two factors that significantly limit
Russia’s future fiscal challenge. The first is shorter longevity, which reduces the fiscal burden
of the pension and healthcare systems. The second is that slower GDP growth reduces future
defense and other discretionary government spending, which is assumed to remain fixed
relative to the size of the economy. But slower GDP growth does not reduce projected
energy-sector revenues. Consequently, energy-sector revenues are able to pay for a larger
share of discretionary as well as pension and healthcare spending. The opposite
explanations apply to the optimistic scenario, which entail larger fiscal challenges for Russia.

As with any unpaid bill, waiting to pay it makes it bigger, if, as is here the case, unpaid
balances accumulate at interest. Under intermediate assumptions, eliminating Russia’s fiscal
gap would, as indicated, require either a tax hike or 29.0 percent or a benefit of 22.4 percent
if one of these adjustments is undertaken immediately. Waiting for 20 years, until 2033, to
adjust policy raises these two figures to 34.5 and 25.9, respectively.



Fiscal Gap Accounting -- Methodology
Russia’s fiscal gap for 2013 is defined as:
                   
                             X t  Yt
Fiscal gap                                      W2013

                                      t  2013
                t  2013



where X t and Yt stand for total real government expenditures (apart from interest and
principal payments on outstanding government debt) and revenues in year t, respectively, r
is the real discount rate, and W2013 stands for 2013 government financial wealth (e.g.,
foreign reserves) less official debt. All variables referred to the consolidated budget of the
Russian Federation. The consolidated budget of the Russian Federation is a budget that
consolidates local and federal government budgets with the budgets of extra-budgetary
social security funds, specifically, pension funds (local and federal) and healthcare funds.

Government non-interest expenditures include government purchases of goods and services
and pension, welfare, healthcare, and other transfer payments to households. Government
revenues include all tax and non-tax receipts, including revenues accruing to the government
from the energy sector.

We explicitly project both government spending and revenues through 2100. After 2100, we
assume that GDP, as well as total spending and total revenues, grow at a constant rate g .
Thus, we can write:

                   2100 X  Y                          X                                          
                                                                    2100  Y2100

                                                                                                      

As described below, several of the components of spending and revenues, including
healthcare spending, pension payments, educational expenditures, payroll taxes, and
income taxes are projected based on relative-age profiles and age- and year-specific future
population counts. Hence, the forecast of future Russian demographics, specifically the

                                                                 7
projected number of future Russians by age and sex, to which we turn next, is central to our
analysis.


Demographic Forecast
Russia has experienced some remarkable demographic changes since the breakup of the
Soviet Union in 1991. At that point Russia’s population stood at 148.3 million. Today’s
population is smaller – 143.3 million. The population decline reflected a rise in death and
emigration rates and a decline in birth rates. But in the late 2000s, things started turning
around. Since 2009, Russia has experienced positive population growth. Last year, 2012,
Russia’s population rose by almost 300,000 people. And this year’s Russian total fertility
rate of 1.691 children per woman topped those of all other countries in Eastern Europe.

There are two major sets of demographic projections available for Russia. One is produced
by Rosstat. The other is produced by the United Nations’ Department of Economic and
Social Affairs (Population Division). The UN population projections report the results in a less
detailed manner than Rosstat. It provides population counts in 5-year age groups, rather
than the single-year age groups needed for our analysis. But the major difference between
the two forecasts involves future net migration into Russia. Although the UN’s 2012
population prospects entail more net migration than previously assumed, it still differs
significantly from Rosstat’s with respect to net migration over the next three decades and
particularly in the decade preceding 2031 – the last year of the Rosstat forecast.

On balance, we concluded that the Rosstat projection was more suitable for our analysis. It
is more detailed and assumes a higher migration rate, which seems historically reasonable.
Also, Rosstat appears to have a better track record forecasting Russia’s population than does
the UN. Finally, Rosstat’s forecast is consistent with other Russian forecasts, including the
economic forecast of MED. However, Rosstat’s official projection extends only through 2031,
and the agency was unable to provide us projections beyond 2031. Hence, it was necessary
to rely on our own assumptions in extending Rosstat’s forecast.

This task would have been relatively easy were we in possession of Rosstat’s age-specific
demographic assumptions. However, only the total fertility rate (TFR), life expectancy, and
net migration assumptions were publicly released. Consequently, we were forced to make
our own assumptions about age-specific mortality, fertility, and migration rates. We did so
using Rosstat’s 2010 data on these age-specific variables, which is the latest release date for
these variables. Note that our age-specific demographic assumptions, which we use to
extend Rosstat’s demographic projections beyond 2031, may not be consistent with
Rosstat’s own underlying, but undisclosed age-specific projections for the years 2010
through 2031. But any error will likely be minor.

Projections of Russia’s Total Fertility Rate

Past actual and projected future values of TFR under optimistic, intermediate, and
pessimistic assumptions are presented in figure 1. The values plotted for 2013 through 2031
are Rosstat’s. The values after 2031 are based on our extension of Rosstat’s three
projections.


                                                  8
As is clear, Rosstat’s pessimistic TFR scenario entails a rapid return to Russia’s recent low
fertility behavior, with the TFR falling below 1.4 over the next decade. However, after 2025,
Rosstat assumes the pessimistic path of TFR slowly starts to recover to preclude what would
otherwise be an ongoing decline in Russian population levels. We extend this recovery
through 2100 at which point TFR is 1.8. After 2100, our pessimistic TFR path keeps TFR at its
2100 value.

Rosstat’s optimistic TFR scenario extends the recent observed rise in the total fertility rate,
projecting a value above 2.00 by 2031. We extend this optimistic projection by continuing
TFR growth until it reaches the level – roughly 2.05 – that would, absent immigration,
ultimately produce zero population growth (ZPG).

Rosstat’s intermediate TFR forecast foresees a small drop in TFR – to 1.6 from the current
1.7 rate – between now and 2031. After 2031, we assume TFR makes a gradual comeback,
reaching the 2.05 ZPG level, not in 2040, as in the optimistic scenario, but in 2080. After
2080, we assume that TFR remains at 2.05.



Projections of Russians’ Life Expectancy

Russian life expectancy is very low, especially for males. The current levels of expected life
at birth are 64.6 for males and 75.9 for females. In the U.S., these figures are 76 and 81,
respectively. That’s the bad news. The good news is that Russian life expectancy has risen
sharply since 2005 for both males and females.

Projections for male and female life expectancy are shown in Figure 2. As indicated,
Rosstat’s pessimistic scenario sees life expectancies falling somewhat and returning to
roughly their current values over the next two decades. We then assume a slow growth in
these values through the course of the century reaching, for males, 75 and, for females, 85
in 2100.

Rosstat’s intermediate and optimistic life expectancy projections entail significant further
increases through 2031. Our extensions of these projections culminate with male life
expectancy at 86 in 2100. For females, our optimistic projection foresees women born in
2100 living, on average, to 95. And our intermediate projection has females born in the
long run living, on average, to 86.



Net Migration

Figure 3 plots our three scenarios for net migration. The first thing to notice is the
substantial variability in recent years in net migration, making long-term projections even
more tenuous than would otherwise be true.

Net migration declines over time under each scenario. While the pessimistic and
intermediate scenarios level off at a positive value, long-run migration is zero under the
optimistic scenario. Were we to assume positive long-term net migration, Russia’s
population after 2100 would grow indefinitely large.



                                                 9
Population Projections

Figure 4 provides projected total population counts under three scenarios. As the graph
shows, the projections differ sharply. The pessimistic scenario projects Russia’s population in
2100 to total just under 85 million. The optimistic scenario projects it to equal 165 million.
And the intermediate scenario foresees a total population in 2100 of 135 million.

Long-Term GDP Forecast
Several of our forecasts for expenditures are predicated on the future path of Russia’s GDP.
Our projection of real GDP through 2100 is based on two components – a projection of labor
productivity, specifically output per working age Russian, and a projection of the number of
Russians of working age.


Projecting the Working-Age Population Through 2100
The evolution of the working age population through 2100 relies on Rosstat’s demographic
forecast through 2031 and our extension of that forecast through 2100. We take the
working age population as all Russians age 20 through 64, inclusive. This definition differs
from the official one in Russia which states that working age population includes women age
16-54 and men age 16-59. The reason for our decision to redefine working age is that the
official definition doesn`t describe the current economic reality accurately. In modern Russia
most young people start working after at least a couple of years of higher education and
don`t retire until their mid 60s.

Figure 5 shows how the work force is projected to decline through time. This is true even for
the optimistic scenario, notwithstanding a projected rise in the Russian population under
that scenario of over 20 million between now and 2100. How can the total population rise in
this scenario while the working-age population declines? The answer lies primarily in the
assumed increases in fertility and longevity. I.e., over the remainder of this Century, the


                                                                                                    13
projected expansion of the population will arise among the young and the old, not among
people of working age.

Projections of Labor Productivity
Our projection of labor productivity is based on three labor productivity scenarios, through
2030, provided by the Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation (MED).
Figure 6 presents labor productivity from 2000 through 2013 as well as MED’s official
projections of this variable through 20301.

The global financial crisis of the late 2000s produced a major drop in Russian output without
a concomitant drop in employment of equal magnitude. Consequently, measured Russian
productivity (output per unit of labor input) fell plunged this period.

Currently, Russia’s labor productivity is growing at slightly higher than 2 percent per year,
and all three of MED’s projections foresee either higher or very much higher labor-
productivity growth rates in over the next two decades.

Why do the three MED productivity forecasts through 2030 differ so much?


1
  Note that MED doesn’t publish labor productivity forecast in 2021-2024 as well as in 2026-2029. So, we
estimate productivity growth during these periods on the basis of extrapolation of average growth rates
between 2020-2025 and 2025-2030.


                                                      14
MED’s pessimistic scenario assumes moderate long-term economic growth arising from
modernization of the fuel, energy, and materials sectors of the Russian economy. It also
assumes relatively slow growth in civilian high- and medium-tech sectors.

MED’s intermediate growth scenario foresees significant economic growth based on the
creation of a modern transport infrastructure, the modernization of Russia’s energy and
resources sector, Russia’s becoming more competitive with respect to high-tech/knowledge-
based industries, and substantial inflows of foreign investment capital.

MED’s optimistic scenario is developed on the basis of the innovation scenario, while it is
characterized by an accelerated pace of growth, increased rate of accumulation of private
businesses, the creation of a large-scale, non-oil export sector, and a significant inflow of
foreign capital2

Our projection of labor productivity growth from 2030 (when MED’s projection stops)
through 2100 assumes that Russia’s productivity growth rate will decline at a constant rate,
with the growth rate ending up at an assumption 1.7 percent level. This is the rate that the
Congressional Budget Office projects will prevail in the U.S. from 2022 onward. 3

Specifically, let LP2030 stand for the MED’s assumed 2030 labor productivity growth rate
(which will differ depending on whether the pessimistic, intermediate, or optimistic scenario
is considered). We solve for the constant rate d at which Russia’s productivity growth rate
declines as follows:

                                              (      )
                                                         70
                                       LP2030 1+ d            = 0.017 ,


Russia’s absolute labor productivity in years between 2030 and 2100 is, then, our
productivity level for 2030 multiplied by 1+d raised to the number of years between 2030
and the year in question.

Figure 7 presents projected labor productivity levels through 2100 for 3 MED scenarios
described above. And figure 8 shows projected absolute productivity levels from 2013
through 2100, that is output per worker in constant (2013) prices.

Projections of GDP
Prior to 2030, we use MED’S GDP forecasts adjusted for differences in our projections of
total population of the Russian Federation and MED’s projections. Our projections of total
population through 2030 are those produced by Rosstat in 2012, whereas MED’s projections
use slightly different population projections. We also measure labor productivity differently
from Rosstat. Specifically, we define labor productivity as output per person of working age,
where working age is defined as ages 20 to 64.

To be precise, we take the MED GDP forecast till 2030 and multiply it by the ratio of our
estimate of total population to the MED estimate of total population (for each year). After
that we divide adjusted 2013 GDP forecast by the Rosstat 2012 forecast for 2013 of the
working age population and arrive at our measure of labor productivity for 2013. We then
grow this initial level of productivity through 2030 based on MED’s assumed annual labor
productivity growth rates, notwithstanding that MED’s definition of labor productivity is
somewhat different from ours (due to their defining the work force differently). We do this
for each of the three scenarios separately. This produces three paths of projected labor
productivity through 2030. Multiplying these year-specific values of output per working age
population by the Rosstat 2012 projection of the working age population in each year
produces our forecast of GDP in that year.

Between 2030 and 2100 we multiply, for the pessimistic, intermediate, and optimistic
scenarios, our projected levels of labor productivity, the derivation of which was described
above, by our projected estimates of the number of Russians of working age for the year in

question. The pessimistic GDP projection combines the pessimistic labor productivity and
the pessimistic work force projections. The intermediate GDP projection combines the
intermediate labor productivity and work force projections. And the optimistic GDP

For each scenario we assume that the output growth rate after 2100 is equal to the average
growth rate in the last projected decade (2090-2100). Figure 10 presents GDP growth rates
corresponding to the three GDP projections shown in figure 9.

According to figure 9, Russian GDP growth rates while gradually declining through 2100
remain positive. This doesn’t reflect growth in the working age population because, as
we’ve seen, all three scenarios foresee a decline in the number of Russians of working age.
The explanation is the growth in labor productivity, which, though declining after 2030,
remains high enough to permit GDP to increase.

Figure 11 presents our projection versus MED projections of real GDP levels according to
three scenarios. Under each set of assumptions, our projections of GDP are lower than
those of MED. But, to reemphasize, the differences here are due only to two things – our
use of Rosstat’s most recent (2013) demographic projections and to our definition of the
work force.

Projecting Government Expenditures
This section discusses our projection of future government spending. Our starting point is
the consolidated budget of the Russian Federation. The general categories of the federal
budget, as well as details of what they include, are specified in table 1. Discretionary
expenditures, such as national defense, which are of a public goods nature, are projected to
grow with GDP; i.e. they are assumed to be the same share of GDP in the future as they are
now. These expenditures as well as their current GDP shares are specified in table 2. Figure
12 shows our projection of these expenditures in real terms (2013 rubles) under our
pessimistic, intermediate, and optimistic assumptions.

One important discretionary expenditure not included in table 2 and figure 12 is spending on
education. This expenditure category as well as expenditures on pensions, healthcare, and
other transfer payments depend on the age structure of the population. Consequently, as
detailed below, our projection of these expenses take into account their age patterns as well
as the projected changes in age-specific population counts.




                                                          20
Forecasting Public Spending on Healthcare

Healthcare spending is highly age dependent, with per capita expenditures on the elderly
generally much higher than healthcare expenditures on the young and middle aged. Given
Russia’s projected aging, total healthcare spending will likely rise significantly in the long run.
Moreover, in many developed economies per capita healthcare spending has been growing
much more rapidly than per capita GDP.

Our projection of future Russian healthcare expenditures is based upon the following
formula: Et = Σi ε50-64,2012 (1+d)t-2012 αi Pi,t , where t ≥ 2013, Et stands for aggregate healthcare
expenditures in year t, ε50-64,2012 is the average 2012 per capital level of healthcare spending
on those ages 50-64, d is the growth rate in per capital spending on those 50-64, αi is per
capital expenditure on age group i relative to per capital expenditures on those age 50-64,
and Pi,t is the projected number of population age i in year t.

In words, our projection of total healthcare expenditures in year t depend on four things:
demographic projections (described above and captured in the equation by Pi,t), an age-
profile (αi ) of relative government healthcare spending by age, an initial level of healthcare
expenditure per person in our reference age group, ε50-64,2012 , and an assumed growth rate
in real healthcare spending per capita (d).

Unfortunately, there are no official or even unofficial age-healthcare expenditure profiles for
Russia. Consequently, we chose to use the profile for Sweden reported in Hagist and
Kotlikoff (2009) as our source for αi. Our sense/hope is that the Russian and Swedish profiles
are similar in shape. This values of the αi provide the ratios of per capita expenditure for the
age ranges 0-14, 15-19, 20-49, 65-69, 70-74, 75-79 and 80 and above to per capita
expenditure in the age range 50-64.

The Swedish profile is shown in table 3. Per capita spending on children through age 19 is 43
percent of that on 50-64 year olds. For those 20-49, relative spending is 63 percent. Above
65, but below age 75, it’s 150 percent, and above age 75 its 196 to 199 percent.

To calculate ε50-64,2012 , we set t to 2012 in the formula for Et and solve for ε50-64,2012 = E2012 /Σi
αi Pi,2012 . Finally, to inform our assumption concerning the future growth rate, d, in real per
capital healthcare spending for those age 50-64, we calculate the values of ε50-64,t for the
years 2003 through 2015 based on the demographics and total actual real healthcare
expenditures from 2003 through 2012 and total real expenditures for 2013 through 2015
projected by the Ministry of Finance. “Total healthcare expenditures” refers to the
combination of federal and regional budgets as well as federal extra-budgetary funds
(Pension Fund of Russian Federation, Federal Compulsory Medical Insurance Fund Social
Insurance Fund Russian Direct Investment Fund Technology Development Fund and Fund of
Assistance to Development of Small Forms of the Enterprises in Scientific and Technical
Sphere).

Our resulting projections for total real government healthcare expenditures are shown in
figure 13.

Forecasting Public Spending on Education

The education expenditures projections follow the same principle as the healthcare
expenditures projections. The only difference is that we can infer the age-profile of
education spending, at least crudely, from government budget data. Specifically, the budget
details separate expenditures on primary, secondary, and tertiary education. Dividing these

                                                        24
respective expenditures by the numbers of primary, secondary, and tertiary students,
provides our profile of educational spending by broad age group. As with our other age-
specific expenditure and tax profiles, we assume the educational profile remains stable
through time. Future research will, hopefully, provide a basis for understanding how these
age-profiles can be expected to change in the future.

To generate our age-education profile, we use data from the unified education budget of
2005-2012. This data have a breakdown into subcategories that can be assigned to different
age groups of people. The earlier data with such breakdown is not available because of
changes in accounting principles. The spending for 2013-2015 is available as the Ministry of
Finance’s forecast of total spending on education. To estimate the breakdown for these
years we need an age-spending profile for education. We get it by taking the average of age-
spending profiles calculated for available and projected data, that is 2005-2012. The
calculated average profile is given in Table 4. The division of items is as follows: pre-school
education, compulsory education (in-school), higher and postgraduate education, primary
vocational education, secondary vocational education, retraining, youth policy and children’s
healthcare, applied research in education and others.

We consider three age groups. Group of 0-6 years old is provided with pre-school education;
group 7-17 with compulsory education as well as youth policy and children’s healthcare
which constitutes a relatively small sum; group 18-39 receives higher and postgraduate
education, primary vocational education, secondary vocational education and retraining;
applied research in education and other spending are divided equally between all people 0-
39 years old.

We use the same data on demographic structure of the population by age as we did for
healthcare spending analysis. Hence, we group the younger part of the population
accordingly in three groups: 0-6, 7-17, 18-39. Summing up the corresponding items of the
budget we derive total public expenditures on each age group i,  , which we divide by the
number of group i’s population to form per capita spending per member of each group
              . Then expenditures of each year are deflated to 2013 rubles. Using these
calculations, we can estimate the age profile of education expenditures. The profile is
reported in table 4.



                       Table 4 Age-Education Relative Expenditure Profile

                                    Age Group       Profile
                                            0-6         0.33
                                           7-17               1

After 2015, we assume that spending on education at a given age a in year t equals spending
per person at age a in 2015 multiplied by a) the cumulative projected growth in output pre
working age person between 2015 and year t and b) the projected number of Russians age a
in year t. Figure 14 displays projected education expenditures in 2013 rubles through 2100.

Forecasting Public Spending on Housing

When we forecast expenditures on housing we also take into account population dynamics.
We assume the real per capita housing expenditures grow with the rate of GDP
per working age person growth. Unlike healthcare and education expenditures forecasts, we
assume that housing expenditures per person are independent of age, i.e., we assume a flat
age housing-expenditure profile.

Forecasting Pension Expenditures and Revenues from Taxes for Social Needs

Russia’s pension system features labor pensions, public provision of pensions, and employer-
provided private pensions. Labor pensions are provided to all retired individuals by the
government. Public provision of pensions concerns only certain professions employed in the
public sector and some other privileged categories. Employer-provided pensions are paid by
private pension funds. Thus, we are interested mainly in labor pensions.

Labor pensions consist of old-age pensions, disability pensions and survivor's pensions. The
old-age pension is provided to those people who paid insurance premium payments for at
least five years prior to reaching the pension collection eligibility age, which is age 60 for
men and age 55 for women. Some professions may have earlier pension eligibility ages, and
these ages can differ for the pay-as-you-go and funded parts.

The latest reform of the Russian labor pension system occurred in 2002. Before that it the
system operated solely on a pay-as-you go (PAYG) basis. The reform added a funded pillar
to the system and also modified the PAYG benefit formula such that a portion of the PAYG
benefits would be paid out on the basis of a notional defined contribution (NDC) formula.
NDC pension plans credit workers for their past contributions and adjust for the timing of
the contributions by accumulating past contributions at a designated rate of return. Benefits
are then determined as a function of this notional (pretend) defined contribution account
balance.

                                                 27
The PAYG benefits consists of base amount, which does not depend on one’s history of
contributions to the pension fund. This base first pillar amount currently equals 3610.31
rubles (or $112.82) for all pensioners except those who are over 80, people with group-1
disability, and dependent family members incapable of work. These people have higher base
pensions, the role of which is to provide a minimally acceptable standard of living to all
pensioners. The NDC part of one’s PAYG benefit is calculated by dividing accumulated past
contributions by the expected number of months of future payments. The NDC benefit is
meant to emulate the type of lifetime wealth accumulation and decumulation that would
arise were the worker saving on her own in attempting to smooth her living standard. This
desire to have a smooth living standard over time is called consumption soothing.

Both the base- and contribution-related pension payments are indexed for inflation and
financed through the Pension Fund of Russia (PFR). The contribution rate is now set ati22
percent for people born before 1967 and 16 percent those born after.

The funded pillar of the pension system consists of obligatory and voluntary payments.
Obligatory payments to the funded pillar are made by people born after 1967 and equal 6
percent of their earnings. Adding 6 percent to 16 percent bring us back to the 22 percent
total contribution rate required of older participants. All contributions to the funded
account are invested among different assets at the workers’ discretion.

Our long-term pensions forecast involves several steps, the first of which is forecasting the
number of pensioners. Our data sources here are the Russian Pension Fund’s data on the
total number of pensioners in 2011 and the number of people who became pensioners in
2011, Rosstat’s population structure data for 2011-2012, our three population projections,
and age-specific estimates of the above-average mortality rates of disabled pensioners (see
figure 16).

The first step in projecting total benefit outlays by the pension system is forecasting the total
number of new pensioners in each year. We assumed that the shares of each sex-age group
that became pensioners remain constant throughout the forecast period and equal to the
corresponding shares of each sex-age group that became pensioners in 2011.

In the second stage, the number of pensioners who are alive in this year and were awarded a
pension in prior years, so called “old” pensioners, is determined for each year throughout
the forecast period. It is assumed that mortality rates of old-age pensioners equal the
mortality rates of the population. For disabled pensioners, age-specific estimates of the
above-average mortality rates are used. Moreover, all disability pension recipients move to
the old-age pension category after the retirement age in accordance with the current
legislation.

The total number of pensioners in year N is calculated as a sum of “old“ pensioners, that are
alive in year N and receiving pension for more than a year, and new pensioners who were
awarded a pension in year N.

After the calculations some adjustments are made to ensure that the total number of
pension recipients never exceeds the actual number of people alive in a given age group.




                                                        29
Forecasting the Number of Insured Workers

In order to forecast insured workers we use the following data sources: the distribution of
employed by sex and age-groups in 2009 (Rosstat survey data), the average yearly number
of employed, the MED’s forecast of economic development (GDP and labour productivity)
through 2030, and the World Labor Organization’s (WLO) forecast of labor force
participation rates in Russia till 2020.

On the first step the distribution of employed by sex and age-groups from Rosstat survey
data was corrected in order to correspond to the average yearly number of employed. After
that a forecast of this distribution was constructed using the WLO data.

Labor force information was calculated using WLO LFPRs and Rosstat Population figures (as
opposed to the UN data used by WLO):



After that yearly increases in labor force of each group were calculated. The number of
employed through 2020 were calculated based on the assumption that they grow
proportionally to the size of the labor force. These figures were then corrected in order to
correspond to the Ministry of Economic Development Data. The forecast from 2020 to 2030
is constructed using the same sex-age profile taking into account the overall growth imposed
by MED. After 2030 the share of employed in each age-sex group was considered constant.


Forecasting Earnings of Insured Workers

Our next step in projecting aggregate pension benefit payments as well as social needs
revenues is to project the earnings of insured workers. Our data here are the accrued
average monthly wages of employees of organizations by sex and age (Rosstat data, 2002-
2010), the total size of insurance contributions on funded and pay-as-you-go parts of
retirement pension in 2002-2010 (Russian Treasury data), data from the Russia Longitudinal
Monitoring Survey (RLMS) (2002-2010), and the distribution of insured workers by sex and
age-groups, 2002-2010 (based on Rosstat’s distribution of employed by sex and age-groups
during 2002-2009 and the average yearly number of employed).

The average monthly wages of employees of organizations by sex and age were estimated
based on individual data of The Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey for 2002-2010.

Estimated average monthly wages were corrected in order to correspond to Rosstat data in
years 2002-2010. Then the average monthly wages of employees of organizations by sex,
age and contribution rate schedules were estimated based on the corrected individual data
of RLMS (2002-2010).

For each year in period 2002-2010 the total size of insurance contributions on funded and
pay-as-you-go parts of retirement pension was estimated based on the estimated average
monthly wages of employees of organizations by sex, age and contribution rate schedules
and the distribution of insured by sex and age-groups.

The estimated average monthly wages of employees of organizations by sex, age and
contribution rate schedules in 2010 were used to calculate the average monthly wages of
employees of organizations by sex, age and contribution rate schedules in 2011-2100. It was
assumed that the wage growth rate corresponds to the labor productivity growth rate.



Forecasting Pension Expenditures

For each year in the forecast period the size of old-age and disability retirement pensions of
new pensioners is calculated by the following formulas:

          PK          AP
SPeld        Beld     ,
           Т          Т

           PK
SPdsb          Bdsb
          Т K        , where

SPeld - size of old-age retirement pension;

SPdsb - size of disability retirement pension;
                                                         31
PK   - size of pension capital of the insured person taking into account indexation;

   - size of pension accruals of the insured person taking into account indexation;

 - estimated period of future pension payment legislatively defined;

 - coefficient for disability pension on the basis of qualifying period of employment;

Beld - base size of pay-as-you-go size of old-age retirement pension;

Bdsb - base size of pay-as-you-go size of disability retirement pension.



The size of pension capital of the insured person is calculated based on forecasted earning of
insured workers using the estimation of pension capital in year 2002, the accrued sum of
insurance contributions on the pay-as-you-go part of retirement pensions taking into
account indexation from 2002 to year N and the value of pension capital in year 2010. The
accrued sum of insurance contributions on the funded part of retirement pension is also
calculated based on forecasted earnings of insured workers.

For each year in the forecast period the size of old-age and disability retirement pensions of
old pensioners is calculated on the basis of the size of old-age and disability retirement
pensions in previous years taking into account indexation and the size of insurance
contributions paid for insured person this year. The size of old-age and disability retirement
pensions in base 2009 year is calculated on the bases of the data of The Russia Longitudinal
Monitoring Survey (RLMS).

The size of expenditures on retirement pensions is calculated as:

                                                                                                   , where
              - size of old-age retirement pension of new pensioners in year N;
              - number of new pensioners that receive old-age retirement pension in year N;
             - size of old-age retirement pension of ‘old’ pensioners in year N;
             - number of ‘old’ pensioners that receive old-age retirement pension in year N;
              - size of disability retirement pension of new pensioners in year N;
               - number of new pensioners that receive disability retirement pension in year N;
              - size of disability retirement pension of ‘old’ pensioners in year N;
              - number of ‘old’ pensioners that receive disability retirement pension in year N;
      1,53 – coefficient that takes in account the size of expenditures on survivors pensions.




Forecasting ”Social Policy” Expenditures
In order to estimate the expected value of total expenditures on Social Policy, which consists
of the following items: pension benefits, social services, social security, family and child
welfare, applied social policy research, and other social policy issues, we have assumed that
the changes in “pension benefit” expenditures are in line with estimated expenditures on
old-age, disability and survivor retirement pensions. So we estimate the ratio between

                                                           32
“pension benefit” expenditures and estimated value of expenditures on old-age, disability
and survivor retirement pensions in 2012 and use this ratio to approximate the value of
expenditures on “pension benefit” in 2013-2100.

A second assumption is made that the remaining part of expenditures on Social Policy
remain fixed through time as a share of GDP. The sum of these two estimated parts of Social
Policy expenditures gives us our projection of total Social Policy expenditures from 2013
through 2100.



Projecting Government Budget Revenues
This section considers the projections of government revenues. As chart 1 below shows, a
large fraction of revenues are derived from the extraction and export of natural resources,
which are subject to depletion. Indeed, international trade revenues, which primarily consist
of flows from natural resources, including export duties and taxes and charges for the use of
natural resources, constitute 32 percent of total consolidated budgetary receipts. We also
separately project revenues from taxes and contributions for social needs. These revenues
represent 17 percent of total budget revenues, and they are linked to budget expenditures
for social policy and pension capital dynamics. Therefore, we derive social tax income from
the core model that forecasts the evolution of pension system. The remaining revenues,
apart from those associated with energy sector and pensions and social needs, are assumed,
in our analysis, to remain constant through time at their current share – 20.4 percent -- of
GDP.

Total revenues from oil (including revenues from oil products export duties) are projected to
be a fixed share of the total value of oil produced and this share varies across the three
scenarios. For the optimistic scenario this share is set at 45 percent. For the intermediate
and low scenarios it is set at 40 percent and 35 percent, respectively. The same approach is
used to project gas revenues, however it is assumed that in all scenarios the government
received a 7 percent share of all receipts from the extraction of gas. These shares are in
accordance with the past relationship between energy-sector receipts and energy-sector
revenues.

The value of oil production is defined as the product of the dollar Urals oil price, the rubles-
dollar exchange rate, and total oil extraction. Similarly the value of gas extracted is defined
as the product of total gas extraction, the nominal exchange rate and the Russian natural gas
border price in Germany denominated in dollars.

In our calculations, we simply consider alternative paths of the real ruble prices of natural
resources, rather than focus on the particular sources, e.g., change in the exchange rate.
Specifically, we consider three different oil and gas price paths. In the optimistic scenario,
we assume that real ruble oil and gas price increases annually by 1 percent through 2030
and remain fixed thereafter. Our pessimistic scenario assumes real energy prices fall by 1
percent each year through 2030, remaining constant thereafter. Finally, under our
intermediate scenario the real oil and gas price remains fixed through time at its 2012 level.

The annual levels of oil and gas extraction are assumed to be identical under all three
scenarios and equal to the extraction amounts projected by MED in its forecast for the
period from 2013 to 2030. After 2030, we assume that extraction equals MED’s projected
2030 level and continues at this level through time until all reserves are depleted For each
scenario we employ different assumptions with respect to extractable reserves.

Our source for the current levels of oil and gas reserves is the Ministry of Natural Resources
and Environment of Russian Federation. Under the pessimistic scenario we assume that only
75 percent of these reserves are available for extraction. For the optimistic projection, we
assume that new discoveries will raise the total volume of both oil and gas reserves by 25
percent. Also, as a robustness check, we evaluate the fiscal gap for Russia using alternative
estimates for total reserves of natural resources.

There are alternative data for extractable oil and gas reserves. We could, for example, take
estimates of proven reserves from the BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2012 and add it
to estimates of undiscovered reserves provided by USGS. According to these estimates,
presented in table 6, total oil reserves are only 74 percent of those officially reported. But
using these alternative data sources for natural gas reserves raises our estimate of natural
gas reserves by 18 percent. On balanced utilizing these alternative reserve measures
together with our intermediate assumptions produces no significant differences in Russia’s
fiscal gap or the size of the fiscal adjustments needed to eliminate it.

Table 7 presents Russia’s fiscal gap for our three different scenarios. It also indicates the
various components underlying the fiscal gap. The results, as indicated above, indicate a
                                                 38
2013 fiscal gap ranging from 5 to 10 percent of the present value of Russia’s projected future
GDP. In absolute terms, the gap ranges from 278 trillion ($8.6 trillion) to 1,669 trillion rubles
($52.0 trillion). The 890 trillion rubles ($27.8 trillion) intermediate fiscal gap is 8.35 percent
of the present value of future GDP. Sensitivity analysis implies that fiscal gap depends on
different assumptions about the total oil and gas reserves only marginally, i.e. the fiscal
stance of Russia is not significantly sensitive to the volume of oil and natural gas available for
extraction.

Table 8 presents these fiscal gaps as shares of the present value of future revenues and
future non-interest expenditures. Consider the top panel in the table. In the case of tax
hikes, the pessimistic, intermediate, and optimistic tax increases needed (starting
immediately and retained indefinitely) to eliminate the fiscal gap are 17.7 percent, 29.0
percent and 36.5 percent, respectively. In the case of spending cuts, the requisite
pessimistic, intermediate, and optimistic reductions (also starting today and remaining in
place forever) are 14.9 percent, 22.4 percent, and 26.6 percent, respectively.

The other panels in table 8 show the impact of waiting to address the fiscal gap. Specifically,
they consider what would happen were policy to remain as now projected, but the fiscal gap
were addressed via tax hikes or spending cuts starting in 2023, 2033, and 2043, i.e., 10, 20,
or 30 years from now. As expected, the requisite adjustments get bigger. Take, for example,
the fiscal gap that would prevail in 2043 absent policy changes between now and then. The
required pessimistic, intermediate, and optimistic tax hikes are not 17.7 percent, 29.0
percent, and 36.5 percent, as they are now. Instead, they are 29.2 percent, 38.1 percent, and
45.4 percent. In the case of spending cuts, the pessimistic, intermediate, and optimistic
reductions increase from 14.9 percent, 22.4 percent, and 26.6 percent, respectively, to 23.6
percent, 28.2 percent, and 31.8 percent, respectively.

These fiscal gaps are calculated using a three percent real discount rate. We also calculated
fiscal gap values using real discount rates of 2 percent and 4 percent. Our findings,
presented at table 9 imply that higher discount rate leads to lower but still positive fiscal
gap. For the intermediate scenario raising the discount rate from 3 percent to 4 percent
reduces the fiscal gap from 8.4 percent to 6.7 percent of the total present value of GDP. In
contrast, using a 2 percent discount rate increases the fiscal gap to 10.5 of the present value
of future GDP.

Altering the choice of the real discount rate significantly affects all three components of
fiscal gap. A higher rate drives up both revenues and net debt and lowers expenditures all
measured as a share of total discounted GDP flows. The observed pattern holds not only for
intermediate scenario but also for the two others. Table 10 reports the values of each fiscal
gap component for all scenarios and discount rates.

This result is generally driven by three effects. The first and strongest effect is associated
with the relatively short-run nature of energy tax revenues. Higher discount rates make this
source of revenue relatively more important in present value terms. The second effect is
associated with population aging. Higher discount rates place relatively less weight on the
long-run costs of paying pension and healthcare benefits to the elderly whose ranks are
swelling substantially, but gradually. The third effect relates to the government’s positive
net financial wealth. The larger the discount rate, the more important is this government
resources relative to the present value of the bills it has to help pay.

Conclusion
Notwithstanding having financial assets that exceed official debt and looking, on a net debt
basis, like one of the fiscally most solvent and prudent governments in the developed world,
Russia, like the U.S. and other seeming fiscally secure countries, faces a substantial fiscal
gap. In Russia, as elsewhere, most of the country’s debts are being kept off the books thanks
to bookkeeping practices, which, while followed throughout the world, are designed to leave
most of a country’s liabilities off the books. They are also designed to omit most of a
country’s assets.

Russia’s pension and other expenditure obligations are real debts the country must pay, yet
they have been kept off the books. And its future taxes and energy income are real sources
of income that are also being ignored in what is standard international practice – focus on a
country’s short-term fiscal situation, especially its immediate cash flows.

Economic theory doesn’t sanction such accounting. Indeed, it tells us that what’s entered on
the books as an official obligation and what’s kept off is a linguistic choice, not a scientific
decision. But what is put on the books, in terms of recorded debts and assets, and what is
kept off the books makes an enormous difference in the assessment of a country’s fiscal
condition.

Russia’s short-term and economically arbitrary accounting practices are averting attention
from three major problems. First, the country is dramatically aging even based on Rosstat’s
potentially optimistic assumptions about ongoing fertility improvements. Second, the
country’s aging is going to interact with its large and growing pension and healthcare benefit
obligations to the elderly. Third, the country is highly dependent on income from energy to
sustain its public finances. But these resources are finite and will, based on current
extraction rates, be exhausted by the end of the Century even under optimistic assumptions
about new energy discoveries.

Unfortunately, time is not on Russia’s side when it comes to addressing its massive fiscal
gap. The longer adjustments on the tax, spending, or tax and spending sides take, the more
painful will be the medicine that the Russian public is forced to swallow.
