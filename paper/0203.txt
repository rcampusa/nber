1.    Introduction

      The concept of taxable income which is widely accepted by economists is that
of total accretion (see e.g. Simons (1938, p.149) and Musgrave (1965, p.165)).

According to this concept, all accretions to wealth are included, in whatever form

or from whatever source they are received. As a matter of principle it is obvious

that accretion as an index of equality should be measured in real terms. The value

of   net worth at the end of the period must be deflated in order to determine the
change in net worth. The application of this principle calls for the exclusion
from taxable income of capital gains that reflect an increase in the price level,

and for allowance for losses suffered from the holding of claims (such as money).

       In favor of disregarding capital gains that do not reflect real income increases,

it has sometimes been argued that wage increases in inflationary times also reflect

gains that are not real and that, accordingly, comprehensive money income is an

appropriate tax base (Groves (1959)). In reply, it has been convincingly demonstrated

by Diamond (19714) that a comprehensive tax base would   discriminate   against taxpayers

whose income has a sizeable profit component. The reason is that inflation affects

capital and labor incomes differently, resulting in a greater percentage increase

in income from capital than from income from labor. He has further shown that a

deduction of the inflation rate times the value of assets will preserve the relative

contributions to the tax base of the two sources of income. Thus, equity consideration

calls for such an inflation—exclusion, to be available to all type of investment.

But there are obvious difficulties in providing exclusion to all assets, an example

being money holdings (cash). Since cash earns zero money income, the application

of an inflation deduction with full loss—offset would call for tax credits fr

holders of cash. The accounting and book keeping that would be involved 3eem
                                      —2—

prohibitive. Diamond has therefore suggested to provide an exclusion only, al]owing

no tax credits. However, the provision of an inflation—exclusion to some assets

only, introduces efficiency considerations into this issue. Thus, partial allowance

for inflation may lead to a waste of resources used to convert assets from those

without to those with such an exclusion provision. Given that application of the

principle with full loss offset to all assets is impracticable, we may therefore

wish to consider provision of only a partial inflation—exclusion to assets for which

it is feasible. The problem is examined in this paper by means of a simple model of

anticipated inflation, in which individuals may invest either in assets for which

full or partial inflation—exclusion is provided, or in cash, for which no loss

offset is allowed.

     Among other Issues, we shall examine the short and long run effects of taxation

and of the provision of an inflation deduction on the rate of inflation and on the

level of savings.

     We do not discuss the long—run optimum tax and deduction rates, because it turns

out that for a given tax revenue, these instruments are perfect substitutes, i.e.

their relative size does not affect the equilibrium configuration.


     Our analysis leads us, however, to discuss the optimality of monetary policy

in the long—run. There seems to be a remarkable agreement among most writers (for

example, Phelps (1965), Samuelson (1968) and (1969), Friedman (1969)) that the

laissez faire system does not lead automatically to optimality of the quantity of

real balances. The argument is that the cost of holding money for the individual

is necessarily different from the cost to society. While the cost to the

individual is measured by the (money) rate of interest, the cost to society is

ordinarily assumed to be (practically) zero. The suggested recipe for optimality

is therefore to satiate the economy with money, i.e., to increase the quantity of

real balances to a point where their marginal utility (or product) is zero. In

an optimum the cost of holding money should be driven down to zero. Following
                                       —3—

Phelps   we call this situation "full liquidity".
     It seems, however, that the foregoing reasoning has overlooked an important
point.    Specifically, although there is no direct cost of providing nominal money

bills there may be an economic cost of providing the economy with real money balances.

This cost results from the fact that an increased quantity of real money can be

absorbed in the economy only through   the   market   mechanism, and   this may lead to

changes in the real part of the system. Thus, for example, if the quantity of

real balances increases, consumers may feel better off and increase their consumption

expenditures which will reduce the accumulation of physical capital. It is then

possible that the cost involved in the expansion of real money may outweigh the

gains before full liquidity is reached.


     The model considered here is one of imperfect control, where the government

operates a relatively small number of basic instruments which are not capable of

eliminating the social cost of money. In analyzing this problem we shall assume that

the utility functions of the private and government sectors are identical and that

the difference between the two sectors (in off—steady state situations) arises from

better foresight on the part of the government. In particular, the private sector

will be assumed to behave according to (changing) "static—expectations", even under

dynamic conditions, while the government will be assumed to have a full evaluation

of the future.


     In the foregoing model money cannot be made neutral in the short run because

of inadequacy of the instruments. We cannot, therefore, expect to have full

liquidity in the short run if the economy is off—steady—state. However, even under

steady—state conditions, money is not neutral except in the absence of imperfections

created by, say, taxes. In principle, there may be a stationary optimum (or optima)

where the optimum quantity of money is short of full liquidity because of the real

social cost of increasing real balances. We shall illustrate this by an example
                                         —'4—



which is in itself not very realistic but is indicative of similar situations which

may arise under realistic conditions. In the foregoing example we shall assume

that the rate of monetary expansion is the only instrument available to the goverrunerlt,

and   that the   utility function is of the additive logarithmic form.

      The upshot of the foregoing statements is that a policy offull liquidity is

not necessarily optimal in the short run or in the long run if there is imperfect

foresight and imperfect control in off—study state situations.

2.    The Model


2.1 The Individual's Optimum Conditions

        We assume that the individuals in the economy can be represented by one

family. This family liveS forever and the number of its members (L) increases

by n per—cent per unit of time so that Lt =                            The utility function of
                                                             L0eflt.
the representative unit is given by


                               -5t
(1)                  U =       e
                                     u(ct,mt)dt


where c is physical consumption per—capita planned for time t and                            is

the amount of real balances per—capita at time t. The latter are related to

nominal balances (M) by


                               M
(2)                  m =

where        is the expected price level of the physical good in terms of nominal

money. The instantaneous utility function, u( ),                  is   assumed to have the

usual concavity properties of neo—classical production functions. In addition

we have a positive subjective discount rate .

      Let w. and r be the expected real wage rate and real rate of interest
at time t. The money rate of interest (i) is related to the real rate of
                                                    P
interest by i. =      rt   +         where   Pt =       is   the expected rate of change of
                                                    t
the price level.


      The stock of capital per—capita (k) owned by the individuals is rented

to firms   and   yields the money rate of interest i.
                                   —6—

      The material wealth of the individuals is given by a =   k   + m.   To this we

must add their human welath (h) which consists of the present value of the

wage stream. The latter is given by


                                   S              8

where u denotes the individual's planning time and where p =        r—n.        If

converges and p    converges to a positive constant (as along steady states)

then h is well—defined.
      U

      Finally, we add the present value of real government transfers (g) which

is given by the same expression as (3) with transfers at time s,

substituted for w5. Again if v converges to a constant, then g is

well—defined.


      Denote the total wealth of the individual by y ,    so that y = a         + h + g
                                                      U              U      U        U   U
Then feasibility of his consumption plan can be taken to mean that              0 for

where we use the fact that money does not earn any interest and it is subject

includes both ordinary consumption and consumption of services of liquid

meaning that the present value of consumption for any u cannot exceed

initial wealth.

      Denote the present value of consumption in (6) by z. We may assume

that I       0. Since both c and m are non—negative we have c                 0. It

follows that z 0. Noting that z is bounded from above and non—decreasing

we know that there exists                   = z   (say). From (6), z y0. However, if

z <         then it is obviously possible to construct an alternative feasible
      y0,
consumption path which has more consumption than the original one over some

finite interval, and no less consumption elsewhere. Since U =                  >   0, the

original path cannot be a candidate for an optimal one. We may thus define an

efficient program as one which satisfies z = y0,               i.e. a program which

satisfies the budget constraint with equality. By (5), then, an efficient

program satisfies

          The consumer's optimum problem is to maximize (1) subject to () and the

non—negativity conditions on y, c and m. Assuming an interior solution, the

Euler—Conditions for the optimal paths C, m                  and y are given     by

         We may solve the differential equation (9) to obtain

which holds for any efficient path of y. It can be shown by standard methods

that a feasible path which satisfies (14),           (8),   (9) and (ii) is optimal, i.e.

it maximizes (i).



2.2. Static Expectations: Explicit Solutions

         An explicit solution of the optimal path can         be   found with the additional

assumption that the consumer expects all the exogeneous variables to remain

constant, i.e. static expectations,


(12)         p=p, p=p, v=w, v=v (p=r—n>0, ir+p>0).
                                                    -9-

       The budget relation (6), which we have shown to hold with equality, is

now given by



(13)                 a0 +
                                p
                                    =   r (cu   +   i U)


where    a0 = k0 + m0     is the initial real value of assets per—capita.


       Assume further that the utility function u( )           is   of the additive—log

form


(19)                 u(c,m) =       log c + log m.

       Under these assumptions (8) and (9) become

        (9')   can be solved to yield c = c0e              .   Substituting   this solution

in (13), using (8'), we may solve for the demand           for c0 and

                                            w+r

        Note that the money rate of interest, i, must be positive if in0 is to
be positive and finite. As expected, the demand functions (15) and (16) are

seen to have negative price and positive wealth derivatives.

2.3     Macro Relations

        The foregoing maximization takes                       place   at an actual time t = 0         (to

distinguish from the individual's planning time denoted by u). By relating

the consumer's expectations to prevailing values of the exogeneous variables,

and the latter to the macro variables by means of an aggregate production

function and market equilibrium conditions, the dynamic path of the economy

can be traced.

        The production function in the economy is of the neo—classical type and is

given by

adjustment of expectations or "warranted price expectations"1. Competitive

equilibrium in labor and capital markets implies

       Using the relations a =         k   + m,     v = Om,       (15) and (19), we may express the

demand for consumption at time t as

       We may solve (21) for                and by substitution of' this solution and (20)

into equations (17) and (18) obtain the dynamic path of the economy for given

initial conditions (k0,m0) at t =                 0,     and for any given function e, t E [O,oo].

                                                                      2          e. It turns out
       The simplest case is to take                    as constant ,      say,
that for         such policy, there exists a unique steady—state of the system, with

k = m =    0.   Obviously, by (18), in steady—state p = 0 — n.                    It is interesting

to note that the system can be shown to be unstable for deviations from steady

state. A similar result has been obtained by Uzawa (1966) under somewhat

different assumptions,but also with instantaneous adjustment of expectations,

which seems to be the crucial assumption for this result.3

       We shall now introduce Into the system an income tax and examine its

implications on individual behavior and on the equilibrium configuration.

3. Income Taxation


3.1. EQuity and Efficiency Considerations

     Since we assume that labor is supplied inelastically, we can concentrate

on the effects of taxation on the income from capital.

     In the presence of a positive inflation rate, the shortcoming of a

comprehensive tax base applied to money income is that it results in a greater

percentage increase in taxable income from capital then from labor income.

This inequity provides an argiment for an adjustment for :kiflation of the return

to capital. Specifically, we shall consider an inflation exclusion, allowing a

deduction from   taxable   income that depends on the inflation rate times the value

of capital assets.

     Equity and efficiency considerations both call for the inflation exclusion

to be available for any type of investment. This is necessary in order to have

the net relative rates of return from various investments independent of the

inflation rate. There are, however, some obvious difficulties in applying the

inflation exclusion to all assets. The asset that raises the most obvious

difficulties is cash. Since cash yields zero monetary gains (although it

provides monetary benefits in the form of liquidity services), the application

of an inflation deduction on cash holdings would call for tax credits for

individuals holding cash. The non—taxation of liquidity benefits could be

removed, in principle, by including these Imputed benefits, equal (in equilibrium)

to the rate of return oi othe:aets times the amount of cash, in taxable

income. But the accounting and record keeping that would be involved seem

prohibitive.
                                        — 13 —



       It   is thus reasonable to consider an adjustment for inflation by means of

an exclusion only, allowing    no tax   credit   for the failure of cash to yield at

least   the inflation rate. Allowing an inflation—adjustment only for some
assets and none for others clearly involves an ficiency loss, generated by
resources    used to convert assets from those without to those with the inflation

exclusion. It may therefore be appropriate to provide only for partial adjustment

of those assets for which exclusion is available. We attempt here to evaluate

these considerations relating to the provision of an inflation adjustment, from

the point of view of the individual and from the point of view of society.



3.2 Equilibrium Conditions

       Suppose that taxable income is defined as the money return on the value of

capital minus a fraction cU              0) of the rate of inflation times the value

of capital. Taxable income per—unit of capital is thus           I. —   cp =   r   +    (l—c)p.
A full inflation exclusion (c =     1)    means that only real income is taxable,

while no exclusion Cc = 0)      means that all nominal returns are taxable. Let

the tax rate be t        0. For the individual, real after—tax return of a unit of

capital per capita is now given by


(22)                p=—y where y=t(i—ep).

       Accordingly, the opportunity cost of cash holdings is now i =               i    —

The individual's optimum conditions are given by (8') and. (9')           with         '    and   I



replacing      p and 1, respectively. Assuming that        tax   receipts are

returned to the individual by lump—sum transfers, the budget constraint, (it),

remains unchanged. Under the assumption of static expectations, the solutions

3.3.    Short—Run Effects of Monetary Expansion

       In the short—run k and in are constant, and equilibrium is attained by

adjustment of the rate of inflation and consumption. Thus, given k and in,

the effect On it of an increase in 3 can be directly calculated from (23):


                        —
                        —               8(y +

                            (i+     — (1—c)(1+Bx)t)(f'—A) >0


where a subscript denotes partial derivative with respect to this variable.

       The short—run change in consumption due to an increase in 0 is found

from (20'):


                            in
                                                =       m(1— (i—c))( +5

                                 (lT(1))it0         (1+8 —   (l—c)(1+8xr) f'A)
                                                                                 > 0.



       These results are stated in the following:


Proposition 1.     In the short—runs an increase in the rate of change of money

supply increases the rate of inflation and the level of consumption.



3.. Short—Run Effects of Taxation

       Given k and in,           the effects on it of an increase in T or c can

'tLLso be calculated from (23):



26                      =   (l+$x)(f'—i+p(1—c)) > 0
                    T       1+8 — (1—c)(l+Bx)

and


(27)
                    C
                        =
                            1+8 —

       An increase in the tax rate creates a substitution effect in favor of'

the demand for real balances, (16'). In order to bring demand into equi'ibrium
                                              — i6   —




with   the given supply of money, this increase generates an increase in the

(actual and expected) rate of inflation. An increase in the inflation—exclusion

rate has exactly the opposite effect:


Prqposition 2.          In the short—run1 an increase in the income tax rate increases

and an increase in the inflation—exclusion rate decreasesthe rate of inflation.

       Short—run changes in consumption due to an increase In T       or c are
found by differentiating (20'), using (21'),



(28)                       =      [Ci — r(l_c))TIT — r—p(i-.d] =

       using   (27)


                        = (f'—p+p 1—cfl(x_]. m > 0
                               — l—)(1+x


since x > 1.          Similarly,



(29)                    c = [p + (lT(l_c))7r] =


       using   (27)


                       -

                                   - 1-)(l+Bx)


       We thus have:


Prqposltion 3.         In the short—run, an increase in the income tax rate increases,

and an increase in the inflation—exclusion rate decreases, the level of

consumption.

       Notice that the government's tax revenue is equal to yk = T(k—cp)k,       so

that a constant k and a given revenue imply a constant y. Since only y
                                    — .17 —




appears In the eciuillbritun equations (20') and (21'), we have:

Prposition 4.   Changes in the tax rate and in the inflation—excusion rate

that keep the government's tax revenue constant, do not affect the short—run

equilibrium values.

14 Long—Run Effects


I.1. Steady—State

equations for the economy

       Equations (28) and (29) determine the dynamic path of the economy for

given initial conditions (k0,m0) at t = 0,                             and with any arbitrary policies

(0,t,c), for t E [O,oQ].

       Let     us examine the steady—state properties of the model for constant

values of 0, y, and c, and for k =                       rn   =   0,    i.e.


                                          z(k,m,0,T,c) = 0

                                          s(k,m,0,T,c) = 0


       It can easily be shown that at T =                     E = 0,    we have for       0:


f' —   A   —     = 0,    that is the 'Modified Golden Rule' path.6 Denote this path

     Now, by (32) and (28) Z                 =   —c       <   0.      Since z < 0         an increase in T

(around    T   = 0)   requires in order to keep z = 0                           a decrease in m. By (32)
and (26), s=               <   0.      Accordingly, since Sm >                  0,   an increase in t

requires   an increase in m.


     In Figure 1, the equilibrium steady—state with T                                >0    is denoted by   k**

Proposition 5.        In   steady—state, an income tax reduces the capital labor

ratio but may increase or decrease the amount of real balances.


     It is easy to see that an increase in the inflation—exclusion rate has

the opposite effect of an increase in the tax rate.

5. The Optimal Monetary Policy

        The   government has several instruments — monetary       (0) and fiscal    ('r and E)   —



vhie :i.t;.rinYie  achieve certain goals. Let us assume first that there exists a
                        to

fixed positive tax c > 0 with a full inflation—exclusion c = 1 (for a given
tax revenue, yk, we have seen that a substitution of T for €, does not
affect the equilibrium values), and that the government wants to choose 0 so

as to maximize the welfare of the individuals.

        We may derive from (8'), (20') and (30) the modified steady—state

relation (33) in the presence of a tax


                                 3(f— k)
                        in—- (l-T)T'-)+0-n
(33 )



which    reduces to (33) when i = 0       and k =    k*. The graph of (33') for a
given     k (<k* as was shom above) is given in Figure 2. The reason for the

negative      relation is that in steady states an increase in 0 increases ,
which reduces the rate of return and consequently         the   demand for money. It

can also      be seen that the economy may "produce" any    amowit of   in provided 0
is sufficiently close to —        (l—T)(f'—J) + n.   The question is   whether in these

circumstances      it   is at all possible to have an optimal stationary state with

a finite in.


        Given the dynamic equations (30) and (31), the government wants to determine
the time path of 0 so as to maximize the value of the utility integral (1)

given    the Initial values of k0 and
        The   economic meaning   of the optimality conditions for the government's

program can be best explained by using the Maximum—Principle formulation. The

relevant   imputed value of the ttnatlonal_incomett at each t is given by


(37)         H =   u((k,m,0,t,),m)   +   qz(k,m,0,i,c)      +   qs(k,m,0,t,)
where q       and q are the undiscounted shadow prices of k and m, which

should be considered as continuous f'unctions of time. The first order conditions

for a maximum yield

where   subscripts denote partial derivatives. The first two equations are

concerned with the effects of k and m on H along the optimal path.

Along this path the gains and losses associated with a change in k or m

must exactly offset each other as stated in these equations. As for (LO), it

is the condition that it should be maximized with respect to the control

variable 9 at each moment of time. Indeed in our model we have

               <   0 for all t. Suppose that s0 and c9 are positive
H00 =   cu
(actually, c0 is positive,and s0 is positive around k*, when t = 0).

Then a positive shadow price for money impJ4i.es                > U. This means   that the

same physical un:Lt of our good has a higher value in investment than in

consumption. This paradox is resolved if we remember that the shift from c

to k cannot be accomplished directly but only through the instrument 0.

Now, if we reduce c through 0 it must involve additional loss via the

reduction of in.

         Equations (38)_(140), together with the accumulation equations (30) and
(31), the "end—conditions" (l&i) and the initial values                   and in0 determine

the optimal time path for the economy. Because of the complexity of the system

we cannot analyze its time path by conventional graphical (or other) methods.

The most one can hope to do is to analyze the steady—state solution of the system.

          We are now interested in examining whether there exists a steady—state,

with k =      in =        =q   =   0,   which satisfies the first order conditions for an

optimal path. From (30) we have the relationships z0 = _ce, Zm =

Conditions (38)—RO) thus become

(l1)          (u_) + q5m — qir0m              = 0



          Assuming   that    c = 1      we have         =   — (l—r)f"m,   inn =        — (1—T)(f'—U)—

and ir0m      =           Equations (142)_(l1) can then be further simplified
                  Bc0.


(142')        (u_q_Bq5)c + q1(f'—A—S) + q(l_t)f"m = 0


(143')        (u0__Bq5)C +           u + q5((l—T)f'—ll) + 0—n) = 0


(1114')       (u__B5)c + q5m = 0


          We have seen, (25), that c0 > 0. Hence by (414') U —                    — 8q5 < 0.

Substituting in 3 j the expressions for c, U = c = f—Ak and u =

it can be shown that for small t                   and a given k, (143') is a strictly

monotone, increasing relation between 0 and

Thus, for given          and k, equations (33') and (13') determine a

unique pair (m**,O**). It remains to show that the system as a whole is

consistent, I.e. that all variables can be determined siriultaneously. This

can be demonstrated by numerical calculations which we have performed with

particular examples.8

     The important thing to note about the solution displayed in Figure 2, is

that it is obtained for a finite m, which Implies positive Urn       and q, in
spite of the fact that it is feasible to create any value of rn.     Thus, the

optimum stationary state is short of full liquidity.

     It should be noted that when t       0,   the present model does give

full liquidity (m ,     with    8 = —6)   as the unique optimum stationary

solution. It seems therefore, that for the given expectations' structure,

the imperfect control model in the absence of taxes, still tends to the 'bliss'
                                           — 25 —




solution.   It is only with the additional "imperfection" created by the presence

of taxes, that   a   'non—bliss' solution becomes optimal. It would   be   interesting

to examine whether other expectation atructwes could      provide   for such an optimum

even in the absence of taxes. In any case. we have demonstrated that in an

economy with "imperfections" of various kinds — due to individuals' erroneous

expectations, taxes etc. —    the   optimum policy may drive the economy to a

stationary state short of full      liquidity.

    However, in steady states           =   p)       the consumer will have perfect foresight.


2. The more ambitious target of choosing the function                         so as to maximize

    the utility integral, has been examined by Liviatan and Sheshinski (1971).


3. Under the more general assumption of adaptive expectations, it can be

    shown that for a sufficiently slow speed of adjustment, the system is

    stable (instantaneous adjustment means, of course, an infinite speed of

   adjustment).


   These calculations can be deduced directly from the budget equation,

   which (in real terms) is now given by

   to (21') is that               < 1. This condition guarantees that the

   denominator in (23) is positive.


6. Note that the steady—state level of capital per—capita, k*, is

   independent of'    0.   Thus, monetary policy does not affect, in the long
