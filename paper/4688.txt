       This paper tests some empirical implications of the general human capital model's

explanation of rising wage profiles. At the individual level, the model implies that there will be

a negative relationship between the initial wage level and wage growth of young, inexperienced

workers. At the market level, the model implies that the present value of the wage profile of an

investor equals that of an otherwise identical non-investor, or that the ratio of the present values

equals one. We test both of these hypotheses.

       Evidence on the wage level-wage growth tradeoff points to a negative relationship

between initial wage levels and wage growth, even after correcting for negative biases that may

have influenced existing estimates of this relationship. Evidence on present values of wage

profiles suggests that the ratio of the present value of rising wage profiles to flat wage profiles

is quite close to one. Alternative estimates of this ratio are tightly clustered around one, and

more often than not are insignificantly different from one. Overall, then, the evidence is largely

consistent with the general human capital model.

       One of the most robust findings in labor economics is a positive return to time in the

labormarket in standard log wage equations, throughout much of the working life, But

economists disagree on the source of this relationship. The dominant explanation is probably

the general human capital model, in which the stock of human capital rises with experience

as people invest in general human capital (not limited to a specific finn). resulting initially in

lower real wages and subsequently in higher real wages (Ben-Porath, 1967; Mincer, 1974;
Becker, 1975). A second explanation that has attracted considerable interest is that long-term

incentive-compatible contracts must pay workers less than their marginal product when

young, and more when old; thus, even if productivity is constant over a worker's life, wages

will rise (Lazear, 1979 and 1981)•t

       Much existing research testing the competing models considers whether wage increases

are closely positively correlated with productivity increases (e.g., Medoff and Abraham, 1981;

Brown. 1989; Kotlikof I and Gokhale, 1992; Hellerstein and Neumark, forthcoming)? In this

paper, in contrast to attempting to measure workers' productivity (or increments thereto), we
test theoretical implications of the general human capital for wage profiles, tests that do not

require estimates or inferences regarding productivity.

       We test two implications of the human capital model of general investment. At the

individual level, this model implies that there will be a negative relationship between the

initial wage level and wage growth of inexperienced workers. This implication has been


    1A third, more recent explanation, is that workers prefer rising wage profiles, as a form of forced saving
(Frank and Hntr&nc. forthcoming; Loeweastein and Sicherman, 1991).

   2lmplicatious of specific human capital investment are ambiguous. Becker (1975) argues that such investment
implies that wages grow dower than marginal product, but Carmichael (1983) and Blinder (1981) develop specific
human capital models in which wages grow faster than marginal product. Some implications of the forced-saving
model are Snilar to those of larears model, since workers arc — less than their marginal products when
young, and more when old.

considered in the literature (Hause, 1977 and 1980; Chamberlain, 1978; Lillard and Weiss,

1979; Kearl, 1988). The existing estimates, however, may be affected by a spurious

correlation stemming from regression to the mean, which leads to a bias towards a negative

relationship between wage levels and wage growth. In contrast, we attempt to test this

implication correcting for this negative bias. At the market level, the model implies that the

ratio of the present value of the wage profile of an investor to that of an otherwise identical

non-investor equals one? We also test this implication, which does not appear to have been

considered in the literature.4

        To summarize the results, the evidence from the wage level-wage growth test points to

a negative relationship between initial wage levels and wage growth, even after correcting for

negative biases that may have influenced existing estimates of this relationship. The evidence

from the present value test suggests that the ratio of the present value of rising wage profiles

to flat wage profiles is quite close to one. Alternative estimates of this ratio arc tightly

clustered around one, and more often than not are insignificantly different from one.

Overall, then, the evidence is largely consistent with the general human capital modeL

        As Weiss (1986) emphasizes, the human capital model of general on-the-job

investment generates hypotheses at the individual and the market leveL At the individual

level, the model implies that there will be a negative correlation between the initial wage

level and wage growth of young workers, controlling for other factors that affect wages. This

arises because individuals face a tradeoff between lower current wages (entailing investment)

and higher future wages At the market level, the model has implications for the equilibrium

wage structure. In particular, 'at the start of working life the present value of the constant

earnings stream...must equal the present value of the observed earnings profile..." (Mincer,

1974, p. 18). In this paper, we test both of these implications of the hwnan capital model.

The first test has received the most attention in the literature. In our view, though, the

equilibrium implication regarding present values of wage profiles is at least as important, if

not more so, because it appears to specify a much sharper restriction on the data)

Testing for a Negative Relationship between Wage Lewis and Wage Changes

        The first test is based on estimates of the relationship between levels and changes of

log wages (or residuals from the corresponding regressions). 'lids component of our research

parallels some earlier research, although much of this earlier research utilizes unusual data

sources. Hause (1977) provides estimates of partial correlations amoni earnings at different

ages using data from Sweden and the U.S. However, his data sources suffer from small

sample sizes and unsatisfactory earnings measures: the U.S. data are based on recalled full-

time earnings covering a fifteen-year period, while the Swedish data are based on total

taxable income. Reflecting these problems, perhaps, Hause's estimated signs of the partial

correlations vaiy widely, ranging from .75 to -.6, depending on the precise sample used and

the years or ages for which the correlations are computed. Using the Swedish data, Hause

(1980) embeds a similar test in estimation of the covariance structure of earnings, and finds a

wage levels and wage growth within a tingle job. And job sbop$og (see TopS and Ward 1992) may gestate a

wage profiles entail higher wages, cit because costly bonding requires firms to pay a worker in excess of their
marginal product (Akertol and Katz, 1989) or beause the incentive caiftad boosts productivity (Lear and
Moore, 1984). The furred-saving model would have the opposite implication, since it asserts that workers

significant negative correlation (-.49) between earnings and earnings growth. Kearl (1988)

studies individual-level data on all income (rather than earnings) from 19th century Utah;

estimating a similar covariance structure, he finds strong negative correlations (ranging from

-2 to -.6). Lillard and Weiss (19'79) study scientists in the U.S., and fail to find a negative
relationship between earnings levels and growth rates, which they suggest may be because

there are strong ability effects on both the level and growth of earnings for scientists.6

Chamberlain (1978), using the early years of the National Longitudinal Survey of Young
Men, finds strong evidence of a negative correlation (-.76) between the intercepts of wage

level and wage growth equations.

        What we do differently is to consider the problem of negative bias induced by a

regression to the mean type of problem in these micro-level estimates.7 To illustrate this

problem, suppose we have one observation on a level (defined for period t) and a change

(defined from period t to t+1) of the log wage for each individual. If there is any
measurement error in wages, or more generally if there are any influences on wages

unrelated to human capital investment on the job which are not perfectly correlated over

time, then a spurious negative correlation is induced between the wage level and the wage

change. Denote by w, either the log wage level, or the residual from the regression of log

    'Lu addition, we use more complete data to estimate the wage equations. We use cijexo-level panel data, as
did Chamberlain, but construct measures of actual experience while he used only potential experience. AJso of
the papers cited, only Chamberlain used a proxy for unobserved ability, specifically an 10 score collected from
high schools. Unobserved ability is potentially important since hiajser-ability individuals may invest more (and
indeed appear to do so in Chamberlain's data), which imparts an upward bias to the correlation between wage
levels and wage growth (see also Hause, 1972). We use the National Longitudinal Survey Youth cohort (NLSY)
which has arguably superior proxies for ability.

The human capital model implies that w, is lower the larger the amount of current period

investment, denoted Ic, but w1 is higher the greater the amount of accumulated human

capital, denoted H,, at the beginning of the period. Assume that measured w1 is determined

by these two effects, plus an error term ç,

where B is the return on past investment, e is assumed for the moment to be serially

uncorrelated, with mean zero in every period, and c, is uncorrelated with w1', which denotes

the unobserved component of the wage that is the return on human capital minus net

investment. (We also assume no depreciation.) We can use (1) to obtain an equation for the

change in log wages

                       = Sw1' +          -

        We also assume that human capital investment declines over time. In particular, we

assume that for all t,         = 0k,, with 0 c 0 c 1. We can then rewrite equation (2) as

(3)

where (1-0 + a) > 0. Equations (1) and (3) reveal the essence of the human capital

model's prediction; investment in period t (Ic,) lowers period t wages but increases wage

growth from period t to t+1.

         We are interested in the sign of the coefficient from a regression of Sw1 on w1. In

 data on inexperienced workers, we can assume that the correlation between the terms

 involving Ic in equations (1) and (3) swamps the correlation between k, in equation (3) and

 131-I, in equation (1). because for such workers the return on cumulative past investments is

 small. (More precisely, if workers are observed before the overtaking age, k, exceeds B1-I.)

 Thus, as long as workers are observed before the overtaking age, the human capital model

 predicts that in the regression (omitting the constant)

 (4)

 we    should find y c   0.

         The problem, however, is that as equations (1) and (2) make dear, both the

dependent and independent variables are measured with error. As in the usual case,

measurement error in w, biases the estimate of y toward zero. But unlike the usual case,

measurement error in the dependent variable also biases the estimate of y because this

measurement error is correlated with w1. To see this, note that the observed model

corresponding to equation (4)is

         In addition to the usual measurement error bias associated with the term ?I e enters

the equation a second time, because it affects the measurement of Awe. Thus, the plim of the
OLS estimate of y is

(6)             y - (y + 1)-Var(e)/Var(w)

so that the estimate is biased downward (rather than toward zero), as long as the absolute
value of y is less than one.9

       However1 we can obtain a consistent estimate of y by Instrumenting for w1 in equation

(5). In particular, we instrument with the lagged value w1.1. Given the assumption that is

serially uncorreiated, w1., is uncorrelated with           both and            and it is correlated with w,.

The variation in w1 that should be explained by the Instrument is that related to the extent of

hwnan capital investment. The notion behind using WI_I is that a young person investing

relatively heavily in human capital will have low w1 as well as low wb,. However, if e is

serially correlated, then w1.1 is correlated with e,, and w1.1 is not a valid instrument.

Consequently, we also report results using w,. as an instrument instead of w1•1. For these

estimates, any bias from non-independent errors should be much smaller.2°

Comparing Present Values of Rising and Flat Wage Pm files
        Present value calculations rely on assumptions regarding the structure of the wage

profile for two reasons. First. it is not enough to estimate a wage regression including the
standard controls as well as experience effects, and then to compute the present values of

earnings profiles first including the experience effects and then zeroing them out. Rather, we

need to be able to estimate the reduction in initial wages for investors implied by the human

measures the persistence in the unexplained component of the wage, should be less than
{Cov(w,w3)/Cov(w,w.j}, which measures the persistence in the overall wage. Ifs is MA(1), then w,,is
uncorrelated with s, and is a valid instrument. Therefore, if the two IV estimates using w and w,,1 arc very
close, there cannot be much bias from e following either an MA(l) or AR(l) process.
         Because s is interpreted as influences on the wage other than investment. it might be presumed to be
positively serially correlated. Note, however, that variables associated with permanent differences in wage levels
(which may cover most of the variables included hi dtnlhrd wage regressions) drop out of ç, c. and hence
may generate little bias. Rather, it is the transitoty, non-human capital influences on wages that are ci central
interest, and these may be largely uncotrelated over time. To garner some evidence on the non-independence of
c, we estimated p from the residuals of wage regressions nrlndhtg individual fixed effects, and expenenoc terms.
Whereas the estimate of p from the 1ni4n.k of the regression excluding fixed effects was .48, the estimate using
the fixed-effects regression was -.06. While suggesting that s is serially independent, this is not definitive because
c is meant to be the residual net of all human capital investment, some of which may be unobserved and
unrelated to the observables.

information on the appropriate discount rate to use in the present value calculations. Thus,

in contrast with the wage level-wage growth test, the escnt value test must be more closely

integrated with structural models of human capital investment.
       The most familiar form of the human capital model's implication that in equilibrium

the present values of alternative wage profiles for an individual are equal is embodied in

Mincer's (1974) model in which individuals invest in schooling only. This model is useful for

clarifying some issues that arise in interpreting standard wage equations in the context of the

human capital model. Given the assumption that individuals work for the same number of

years after completing schooling, and imposing the equality of present values of the earnings

streams resulting from alternative schooling choices, the wage equation

(7)            w1=w0+r1S+ç
results, where w0 is the log wage of the individual with no schooling, S is years of schooling,

and r, is the rate of return to schooling, interpreted roughly as an average rate of return

across individuals, if this framework describes the determination of wages, then (perhaps

controlling for ability differences that influence w0), the equilibrium implication can be tested

by comparing the present value of the wage profile at one level of schooling with that of the

wage profile at another level of schooling, using an appropriate discount rate

       Rosen (1977) has pointed out some difficulties related to using equation (7) to test the

human capital model, If individuals have varying rates of return to schooling, then the

Mincer model implies corner solutions, depending on whether an individual's rate of return

to schooling is greater than or less than r. Rosen showed that corner solutions can be



   "OF course, the wage profile would have to be 4atcd to begin at the ompleticu ct schooling, and to

eliminated by introducing individual variation in ability and in costs of financing education,

which leads to a determinate equilibrium of schooling-wage combinations. However, the

slope of the log wage-schooling relationship does not identify the return to schooling, since it

confounds the role of education in producing human capital with covariation between wages

and schooling stemming from variation in ability and access to finance.

       However, Willis (1986) develops an alternative interpretation of Mincer's model in

which, as a special case, equation (7) describes a determinate equilibrium, and the coefficient

on S is the rate of return to schooling. Willis considers a model with heterogeneous, rather

than homogeneous human capitaL'2 He shows that in such a model, as long as there is

equality of opportunity (i.e., all individuals face the same interest rate r), and equality of

'relative ability' (i.e.. ability has a single factor that shifts productivity equally in all pursuits),.
then equation (7) can be derived as a market equilibrium, with r as thi return to schooling.

and the present value of lifetime earnings, discounted at the rate r, equated across the

alternative human capital investment decisions facing an individual? Thus, under Willis's

reinterpretation of equation (7), comparison of the present values of alternative wage profiles

is a more compelling test of the human capital model.

       While these issues have been addressed with respect to schooling decisions, they also

pertain to on-the-job investments, which must be brought into the model for the purposesof

this paper. The optimal path of post-schooling human capital accumulation depends on the

technology for producing human capitaL Mincer's approach was to assume that the solution

 to the optimal investment problem is given by

 (8)             lç=k0-(k0/T)P,
where k is the ratio of time spent investing in period t, T is the period over which

investments are made, the 0 subscript denotes the initial period, and P, is potential

experience in period t. In this case, denoting by rp the rate of return to post-schooling

investments, Mincer derived the log wage equation for period t as

(9)              w, = r,S + ln{1 - Ic0 +     (kJT)P}       + r,c,P1 + (-rk0/2T)P,2

The terms involving kG r,, and T reflect the accumulated returns to past investments, and the

negative impact on earnings of investment in period t (When w1 is observed).

        There is, in fact, little a priori reason to believe that equation (8) is the optimal

investment profile. We thus also consider an alternative specification of the investment

profile that was proposed by Mincer. In addition, we consider some specifications of the

wage equation augmented to account f or differences in labor force attachment. These

specifications are listed in Table 1, and are discussed in Appendix B.

        According to Willis (1986), in a model with heterogeneous human capital, under the

same assumptions described above regarding equality of opportunity and ability, along with

the assumption that opportunities for post-schooling investment are independent of schooling,

the wage profiles that Mincer derived—incorporating returns to on-the-job investment—can be

derived as equilibrium wage profiles with the coefficient of schooling still measuring the

discount rate.'1 Arguably, r should also equal this discount rate because, in equilibrium,

individuals invest up to the point where the marginal gain from investment equals the

        Thus, in our empirical work we estimate wage equations such as equation (9),

substituting r for r1 and rp, and using the estimate of r as the discount rate in the present

value calculations.0 Of course, Willis' reinterpretation of Mincer's model makes it clear

schooling investments tests only a restricted version of the human capital model.

Nonetheless, it is an important version because, based on Willis' work, it must be the one that

researchers have in mind when they interpret the standard log wage equation as a human

capital earnings function.
                                                  ffl The Data
        We rely primarily on data through 1987 from the National Longitudinal Survey Youth

cohort (NLSY), whose respondents were aged 14-21 at its inception in 1979. This sample

offers some advantages for this research. For the test based on the wage level-wage growth

correlation, we want a sample with a large number of observations before the overtaldng age.

Also, as discussed earlier, unobserved ability may be positively associated with both the

intercept and the slope of the wage equation, hence bbiing the results against finding a

                    levels and wage growth of young workers. The NLSY has test scores

from the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery Test which can be incorporated into

the model to control for this possible source of bias. Research with these data suggests that
                                                                                                  their effects on

wages (Blackburn and Neumark, 1993)."

        We restrict the analysis to men to reduce problems from selection into employment,

and because we focus on the implications of the human capital model for continuous

workers.17 We impose some standard sample restrictions for estimating wage equations, and

focus solely on white men. In addition, we impose some non-standard restrictions to obtain a

sample of individuals who are "typical" in terms of the human capital model-going to school

continuously and then working more or less continuously. These restrictions lead to a final

sample of 7,480 observations on 1,437 individuals. Details regarding the sample restrictions

and their effects on the potential sample size are given in Appendix A. Finally, in many of

the analyses we restrict the sample further, because we require data to define changes in

variables, or lagged values of variables. The effects of these restrictions on the sample are

also explained in Appendix A.

        To explore the robustness of some of our results, we also use the Januazy 1987 CI'S

Occupational Mobility and Job Tenure supplement, imposing sample restrictions similar to

those used for the NLSY data. With this data set we can obtain a random sample of the

same age group included in the NLSY as of 1987 (ages 22-29), as well as a random sample of

workers of all ages. This data set includes information on the amount of time that

respondents have been engaged in their current kind of work, a variable that provides some

basis for comparison with results from the NLSY using actual experience. With both data



     "A disadvantage of the NL.SY is that the sample period covered is one of 'harp changes in the wage structure,

       Table 2 reports descriptive statistics and 01_S estimates of regressions for the level

and change in log wages, for the NLSY sample. Most of the estimates of the level equations

correspond to estimates from other samples. One exception is that the peak experience

Evidence on she Wage Level-Wage Growth Tradeoff

        Table 3 presents estimates of the regressions of log wage changes on log wage levels,

for both raw data and residuals. Looking first at the raw data, column (1) of Panel A

suggests a strong negative relationship between wage levels and changes, with an estimated

coefficient of -.259! However, as explained above, this negative relationship may be partly
spurious. This is confirmed by the estimates in column (2), in which the lagged wage is used

as an instrument for the contemporaneous wage. The estimated coefficient (-.058) is still

significant and negative, but is considerably closer to zero. The same result holds in column




     'Appendix Table A2 provides estimates of comparable specifications for the 1987 observations from the
NLSY. and the January 1987 CPS supplement. For the latter data set, time doing the current kind of work is
used as a proxy for actual experience. For the 1987 NLSY data, the — of the profile is at 12.9 years of
experience, close to that in Table 1. For the CPS data for the same age group, the — is 83 years, even lower.
In contrast, for all ages from the CPS data, the — is 25.7 years. Thus, the roag quadratic in the returns to
experience. and the low implied experience level at which wages peak, appears to be largely attributable to the
use of data on yowig workers. The table also reports comparisons for specifirtn using potential expenence.
In this case, there is evidence that the experience level at which wages — is lower in the NISY (11.0 vs. 26.1
years in the CI'S for 22-29 ycar-elds). But the quadratic coefficient is imprecisely estimated for young workers in
both samplet

     "The regression estimate of y was not corrected for observations that are not contiguous, which may bias this
estimate towards zero. But when we reestiniated y using only the contiguous observations, the results were
virtuaUy unchanged.

(3), where we instrument instead with the wage lagged twice?1 The similarity of the

estimated coefficients in columns (2) and (3) suggests that serial correlation in the error term

does not bias the instrumental variable results.

         The lower panel of the table reports the same set of results using residuals from

regressions of log wage levels and changes on the levels and changes, respectively, of the

control variables (other than experience) used in Table 2. The results are qualitatively and

quantitatively very similar.
         The estimates in Table S make two points. Looking simply at wage levels in one

period, and wage changes from that period to the next period, results in negative bias in the

estimated relationship between wage levels and wage growth, suggesting that previous
estimates have overstated the wage level-wage growth tradeoff. On the other hand, estimates

that should reduce or eliminate this negative bias do not overturn the result that the

relationship is negative, as predicted by the general human capital model.
         We can delve further into the implications of the general human capital model for

wage level-wage growth relationships like those reported in Table 3. According to the model,

this relationship should be most strongly negative for the least experiinced workers, rise to

zero at the overtaking age, and subsequently be positive. In Table 4, we explore these

implications by looking at the earliest and latest available observations on each individual,

imposing a maximum of three years of potential experience on the early observations, and a

minimum of six years of potential experience on the late observations. Given the similarity


   nAn alternative to instrumenting wills w,1, for example, is simply to sit,szitutc w.1 for Wr AS equaL on (5)
     this removes most of the bias from regression to the mesa, because only the component of the error
shows,
a correlated with the regressor (in contrast toy+ 1)e when w, is used as a regressor). Thus, if yls relatively
small, there should be little bias front using w,,. In fact, the eaimah- of y obtained front this method should be
biased towards zero, relative to the estimate using w,1 as an IV for w,. For .11 of the specifications reported in
the per, this was the case. For example, for the estimates corresponding to Table 3, but using w,, or w,2 as
regremas, instead of instruments, the estimates of y ranged frau -.029 to -.041, with standard errors of .013 to


                                                         14
of the results in Table 3 using w and w,4 as instruments, in this table we use only the

former (to obtain larger samples).

        When the wage change is regressed on the contemporaneous wage, as reported in

Panel A, the estimated coefficient is strongly negative for both the early (-279) and late

(-r4) observations.       The latter negative estimate, and the near equality of these estimated

coefficients, both contradict the general human capital model. However, upon instrumenting

for w, with w,.1, only the estimated coefficient for the early observations is negative(-.099)

and significant, while that for the late observations is positive and insignificant. The results

in Panel B, using the residuals, are qualitatively similar. Thus, the regression to the mean

problem inherent in the estimates in columns (1) and (3) apparently obscures evidence in

favor of the general human capital model?

Evidence on Present Value Comparisons of Wage Profiles

        Next, we use estimates of alternative wage profiles to compute the ratio of the present

value of the wage profile of an investor to that of a non-investor. The wage equation

estimates for the alternative specifications of the wage equation are reported in Table 5.

The first four columns report estimates of quadratic earnings functions, based on a linearly
declining investment profile. Columns (1) and (2) report estimates of the original Mincer

formulation, first excluding and then including the test scores. In both cases, the estimates of

the investment period ('F) appear rather low, at 4.4-43 years. The estimates of k0 indicate

that initial wages are reduced by about 30-40 percent by human capital investment?

Columns (5) and (6) Stead report estimates of Mincer's Gompertz earnings functions, based


     ra the fact that the estimated coelfldent in column (2)11 me stroeØy negative than that in column (2)
 of Table 31s             with the fact that In Table 4, the estimate is based wily wi the least experienced workers,
 while In Table 4 It is based os .11 workers.

    No4e that tile positive .dii"tn of k imply that there is a tradeoff bctween Initial wage levels and wage
 growth, cnint with the results in Tables 3 and 4 that .nmkie this tradeoff ins less restrictive manner.
                                                         15
on an exponentially declining investment profile. These estimates suggest a longer

investment period. For example, B = .17 implies that it takes 17.6 years for lc to decline to

five percent of its initial value.

        Our principal concern is with the present value calculations, reported in the last three

rows of the table. We report estimates for three alternative levels of final potential

experience (30, 40, and 50 years). In columns (1) and (2), the ratios of the present value of

the wage profile of an investor to that of a non-investor are significantly greater than one,

although the estimated ratios are all quite close to one, ranging from 1.02 to 1.09. In

addition, while the standard errors (constructed from first-order approximations to the

nonlinear function of the parameters being tested) are quite small for these specifications,

there arc other sources of uncertainty that are not captured in the statistical formulas, such as

mortality, productivity growth in different jobs, etc., so that the precision of these estimates

should probably be regarded as overstated? Similar calculations are reported in columns

(5) and (6) for the Gompertz earnings functions. For this specification, the estimated ratio of

the present value of the wage profile of an investor to that of a non-investor is very close to

one under any of the assumptions regarding years of work. The estimates range from 1.00 to

1.02, and are never significantly different from one.

        For both earnings functions the estimate of k0 rises slightly upon including the test

scores, suggesting that omitted ability obscures part of the reduction in initial wages of

investors, because they have on average higher ability. Given this result, we attempt to go



    2'Tbe precision of these estimates may seem surprising. However, only the parameters of the experience
profile (it, r, k and 1') arc required to esñmate the ratio at the present values of the earnings profiles. Let
ln(w,) - XB be the profile of non4nvestots, and ln(w,) - XB + Z,y be the profile of investors. Then ltttingr
denote the interest rate, and taking sums from t- 1 toT, this ratio is:

   (I exp(XB+Z,y)/(1 +r)'}/{I cxp(XB)/(1 +r) — {exp(XB) 1 exp(Z17)/(1 +r)t}/(exp(XB) .1 1/(t +r)')
   (I exp(Z,y)/(1+r)'}/(Z 1/(1+r)')

                                                        16
 one step further than including the test scores, including instead individual fixed effects For

 these estimates, second-order Taylor-series approximations to the nonlinear wage equations

 are used, in order to obtain models that are linear in the variables. However, because

schooling is fixed for each individual, the coefficient of schooling cannot be identified. Thus,

we assume that the specifications including the test scores adequately remove any omitted

ability bias in the schooling coefficient, and, in columns (3) and (7), impose the estimate of
the return to schooling from the previous column. As expected given more complete

controlling for unobservable ability, for both the quadratic and Gompertz earnings functions,

the estimates indicate higher initial investment (a larger estimate of k0), and a longer

investment period (a larger estimate of T in column (3), and a smaller estimate of B in

column (7)), although, admittedly, an estimate of k0 of S5 for the Gompertz earnings
function is implausible. For the quadratic earnings function, in column (3), the effect of

removing the fixed effects on the estimated present value ratio is rather small, although the

relative present value of the wage profile of investors rises slightly. For the Gompertz

earnings function, the effect is somewhat more severe. In particular, for an assumed work
life of 30 years, the ratio of present values is significantly below one.tm

         As a final exercise with the NLSY data, we turn to estimates of the specifications

incorporating data on actual experienee using the specifications described in Table 1 and

Appendix B? For the quadratic earnings function, the estimates indicate an investment


    tmlte differences relative to columns (2) and (6) stem principallyfrom the fixed-eli eels estimation, not the use
of second-order linear approximations. When we reestimated the specification in column (2) using the second-
order approximation, the estimates of r, k and I were similar to those in °'n (2), and the estimated ratios at
present values were identicaL When we reestimatcd the specification in column (6) using the second-other
approximation, the .crirn.t- of k rose to 36 while the estimate of 8 fell to .07. The estimated ratios at present
values were .96, 1.00, and 1.02, for an assumed work life of 30, 40, and 50 years, respectively.

    2tFor these specifications we revert to including the lest scores, and excluding the flied effects. The estimates
with fixed effects were quite imprecise, and the estimates of k,, exceeded one for both earnings functions. The
problem is likely that A, the ratio at actual to potential experience, varies little for individuals (it varies somewhat

period of 13.02 years. which may be more plausible than the estimate of 4.43 years from the

parallel specification using only potential experience. The estimates for the Gompertz
specification are little changed relative to the estimates in column (6). For both earnings

functions, the estimated ratios of present values of the wage profiles are close to one, and

not significantly different from one, whatever the assumed years of work.

        Finally, we explored the robustness of the results for the original quadratic and

Gompertz earnings functions, using our 1987 CPS data set. These estimates are reported in

Table 6, for 22-29 year-olds (the age range of the NLSY sample in 1987), and for workers of

all ages. The estimates are quite similar in either case, although for the 22-29 year-olds, the

estimate of T is quite imprecise. Most importantly, for both age ranges and both earnings

functions, we again obtain estimated ratios of present values of wage profiles that are close

to one, ranging from .99 to 1.04, most of which are not significantly different from one.

        We interpret the evidence from the present value comparisons as providing striking

consistency with the prediction of the general human capital model that, in equilibrium, the

present value of the wage profile an individual faces if he invests in human capital equals the

present value of the wage profile if he does not invest. For a number of specifications,

samples, and estimators our estimates of these ratios are tightly clustered around one,

although sometimes the estimates are significantly different from one. However, an estimate

of 1.02, even with a standard error less than .01, does not strike us as providing any

substantive rejection of the general human capital model.

                                        V. Conclusions

        The human capital model of general investment implies that, at the individual level,

inexperienced workers give up present wages in return for wage growth. At the level of the

 market, equilibrium implies that the ratio of the present value of the wage profile of an

investor to that of an otherwise identical non-investor equals one. In this paper we test both

of these implications. In general, we view the evidence as consistent with the general human

capital model.

       The evidence on the wage level-wage growth tradeoff points to a negative relationship

between initial wage levels and wage growth. However, failure to account for the problem

of regression to the
                   mean leads to severe negative bias in estimates of this relationship, and,

more importantly, results in a negative estimate even for workers who are likely at or beyond

the overtaking age. In contrast, after correcting for regression to the mean, the estimated

relationship is positive for more experienced workers, and negative only for inexperienced

workers, as predicted by the general human capital model.

       The evidence from the present value estimates is that the ratio of the present value of

the wage profile of an investor to that of an otherwise identical non-investor is generally near

one, depending on the exact earnings function specification, sample, and estimator. While the

estimates are sometimes significantly different from one, they are tightly clustered around

one, and rarely differ by more than .05. Thus, in our view, the present value tests also
corroborate the predictions of the human capital model.

       We hasten to emphasize that, to the best of our knowledge, our tests of the human

capital model are new. While other researchers have estimated wage level-wage growth

correlations, none have addressed the regression to the mean problem. And we have come

across no papers that implement the present value tests. Thus, we expect further refinements
and replications of these and related tests to yield more definitive answers.

                              Appendix A: Sample Construction

      A munber of restrictions are imposed on the NLSY sample in order to focus on men

who follow the "typical" pattern of school, work, and investment in the original human capital

models. First, we ensure that they are enrolled in school relatively continuously from age six.

In particular, the sample is restricted to individuals whose age at departure from school (i.e.,

the last time they are observed in school in the sample) was within two years of what this age

would have been had the individual begun grade 1 at age 6, remained continuously enrolled

in school, and completed one grade each year; only post-schooling observations are used.

Second, we focus on individuals who work relatively continuously. Specifically, measuring

potential experience from the actual date of departure from schooling, we restrict the sample

to individuals whose actual experience (based on cumulative weeks worked since leaving

school) is more than one-half of their potential experience. We also impose some relatively

standard restrictions on the sample, including omitting individuals who spent any time in the

military, and observations for which respondents report a wage less than one-half of the

minimum wage, report their industry as agriculture, forestry, or fisheries, or in which they

report they are self-employed. We also require a minimum of two observations per person,

for some of the analysis. Finally, some of the analyses require multiple observations per

person, or entail other restrictions, hence leading to smaller sample sizes. The effects of the

sample selection rules and the data requirements on the sample size and number of

individuals available are documented in Appendix Table Al.
                   Appendix B: Alternative Investment Ptofiles and Wage Equations

          An alternative investment profile that was originally considered by Mincer, but has

  been little used in the subsequent literature, is one in which the investment ratio k, declines

 This leads to the wage equation

 (32)             w, = rlcaJ8 - (r,,kjB)exp(-BP,) + ln(l - k0exp(-BP1))

         We also consider specifications that bring data on actual experience into the

 estimation. We follow Mincer (1978) in assuming that full-time earnings capacity inperiod

 (F,) is given by

 (B3)             E,=E,.1(l+rAl)
 where k, is given by equation (7). As Mincer (1978) points out, this specification captures the

 notion that "opportunities and incentives for market-oriented (job) investments should

increase with the amount of time devoted to the
                                                labor market" (Mincer 1978, p. 3), by
entailing a positive relationship between dollar investment costs and hours of work.                       A

represents the fraction of potential experience an individual actually works, assumed constant
and estimated by the ratio of actual experience to potential experience at a
                                                                                                  point in time.
This investment profile yields the wage equation

(84)             w, = (r1,k0).AP-(r1,lcJ2T).(AP?) +             In{1-k + (k0/T)'P,}          •'

        Letting Ic, = k0exp(-BAP,), the exponentially-dedlisting investment ratio can also be

equations (9) and (B2) used in the literature, ç and r, are not separately identified along with either k, and T, or
k, and B, whereas bringing actual experience into the wage equation (as in equations (B4) and (BS) permits all of
the parameters to be separately identified. For reasons n$AIII.4 in the text, we do not exploit these augmented
specifications (a this purpose, but rather only as a coherent means & incorporating dais on actual experience.
         We did, however, explore the consequences ci letting ç and r be unequal. As a general matter, this led
to rather nonsensical estimates, with r in the range of .4-3. Such results have to be viewed as casting doubt
either on these specifications, on the human capital model generally, or on the specific implication that r, should
equal rr because in equilibrium both cl these are driven to equal the discount rate.
